https://openalex.org/W2114892242,"A recently completed research program (TREES) employing the global imaging capabilities of Earth-observing satellites provides updated information on the status of the world's humid tropical forest cover. Between 1990 and 1997, 5.8 ± 1.4 million hectares of humid tropical forest were lost each year, with a further 2.3 ± 0.7 million hectares of forest visibly degraded. These figures indicate that the global net rate of change in forest cover for the humid tropics is 23% lower than the generally accepted rate. This result affects the calculation of carbon fluxes in the global budget and means that the terrestrial sink is smaller than previously inferred."

The inability to distinguish between allelic and duplication sequence overlap has hampered their characterization as well as assembly and annotation of our genome. We developed a method whereby each public sequence is analyzed at the clone level for overrepresentation within a whole-genome shotgun sequence. This test has the ability to detect duplications larger than 15 kilobases irrespective of copy number, location, or high sequence similarity. We mapped 169 large regions flanked by highly similar duplications. Twenty-four of these hot spots of genomic instability have been associated with genetic disease. Our analysis indicates a highly nonrandom chromosomal and genic distribution of recent segmental duplications, with a likely role in expanding protein diversity."

Strong 13C depletions indicate an incorporation of methane carbon into carbonates, bulk biomass, and specific lipids. The mats mainly consist of densely aggregated archaea (phylogenetic ANME-1 cluster) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus group). If incubated in vitro, these mats perform anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction. Obviously, anaerobic microbial consortia can generate both carbonate precipitation and substantial biomass accumulation, which has implications for our understanding of carbon cycling during earlier periods of Earth's history."
https://openalex.org/W2101744311,"Intracellular signaling networks receive and process information to control cellular machines. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1,2/protein kinase C (PKC) system is one such network that regulates many cellular machines, including the cell cycle machinery and autocrine/paracrine factor synthesizing machinery. We used a combination of computational analysis and experiments in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts to understand the design principles of this controller network. We find that the growth factor-stimulated signaling network containing MAPK 1, 2/PKC can operate with one (monostable) or two (bistable) stable states. At low concentrations of MAPK phosphatase, the system exhibits bistable behavior, such that brief stimulus results in sustained MAPK activation. The MAPK-induced increase in the amounts of MAPK phosphatase eliminates the prolonged response capability and moves the network to a monostable state, in which it behaves as a proportional response system responding acutely to stimulus. Thus, the MAPK 1, 2/PKC controller network is flexibly designed, and MAPK phosphatase may be critical for this flexible response."

Changing the length, chemical composition, architecture, and topology of the chains allows response mechanisms and rates to be easily manipulated; and devices based on the entropy of the chains, surface energies, and specific segmental interactions can readily be made. Although numerous applications exist, intriguing possibilities are emerging that have tremendous potential to further developments in surface-responsive materials."
https://openalex.org/W2067233675,"To understand the molecular events coupling between cell proliferation and differentiation by elucidating genes essential for the process, we conducted a large scale gene expression analysis of an in vitro osteoclastogenesis system consisting of recombinant RANKL and mouse RAW264 cells. The entire process leading to the formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells takes 3 days and plates become fully covered with multinucleated cells at 4 days. Microarray probing at eight time points revealed 635 genes that showed greater than 2-fold differential expression for at least one time point and they could be classified into six groups by the “k-means” clustering analysis. Among a group of 106 early inducible genes (within 2–5 h after RANKL stimulation), four genes includingNFAT2 were identified as genes whose enhanced expressions were fairly correlated with an efficient induction of matured osteoclasts. Moreover, cyclosporin A significantly suppressed the multinucleated cell formation accompanying the reduction of the nuclear localization of NFAT2. When the expression of NFAT2 was suppressed by introducing antisense NFAT2, multinucleated cell formation was severely hampered. Functional analysis thus combined with gene analysis by microarray technology elucidated a key role of NFAT2 in osteoclastogenesis in vitro.

Specific factors/regulatory genes playing essential roles for cellular differentiation have been identified in various systems, and they have been shown to exert their effects eventually through the induction or repression of certain groups of genes (1MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Google Scholar, 2Studzinski G.P. Harrison L.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 189: 1-58Google Scholar, 3Perry R.L. Rudnick M.A. Front.

Therefore, gene expression profiling based on fine statistical analysis in addition to an elucidation of key factors/genes might be essential to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation process of a certain cell type. Fortunately, recent advances in the technology for assaying RNA in a highly parallel fashion (5Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Google Scholar, 6Velculescu V.E.

Genet. 2001; 2: 418-427Google Scholar), coupled with the completion/progress of several mammalian genome projects, make the approach feasible if a refined system is available. Here, we describe the broad outlines of gene expression during osteoclastogenesis in vitro, in particular during the initial stage, and explain the identification and characterization of genes essential for osteoclastogenesis on the basis of profiling characteristics. A similar approach using a different cell system was reported recently (8Cappellen D. Luong-Nguyen N-H. Bongiovanni S. Grenet O. Wanke C. Susa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21971-21982Google Scholar).

Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 308-332Google Scholar). They were reported to be formed by fusion of mononuclear precursor cells derived from colony-forming unit granulocyte macrophages (CFU-GM) and branch from the monocyte-macrophage lineage during the early stage of the differentiation process (9Roodman G.D. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 308-332Google Scholar, 10Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Google Scholar). Recently, a key factor responsible for initiating this differentiation process was identified and named receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) (or osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF)/TNF-related activation-induced cytokine TRANCE) (11Wong B.R. Rho J. Arron J. Robinson E. Orlinick J. Chao M. Kalachikov S. Cayani E. Bartlett III, F.S. Frankel W.L. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25190-25194Google Scholar, 12Yasuda H. Shima N.

Cell. 1998; 93: 165-176Google Scholar); namely, RANKL is a type II transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family and is expressed in several cell types including activated T cells and osteoblasts. RANKL binds the receptor called receptor activator of NFκB (RANK) that is expressed in osteoclast precursors and induces osteoclast formation (14Anderson D.M. Marakovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, a system of in vitroosteoclastogenesis using the recombinant RANKL and mouse monocyte/macrophage-derived RAW264 cells was established (15Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Google Scholar, 16Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Google Scholar, 17Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Google Scholar). This system consists of a single cell type with a defined differentiation inducible factor, RANKL, and moreover, the entire process requires only 4 days to form mature osteoclasts under microscopic observation (17Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Google Scholar), making this an appropriate system to analyze a mammalian cell differentiation process. To obtain gene expression profiles globally, RAW264 cells were cultured either in the presence or absence of RANKL, and RNA was prepared for profiling at eight time points ranging from 0 to 96 h. At each time point, RNA from RANKL-treated and -untreated cells were labeled differentially and applied to DNA microarrays to assay the relative expression levels of about 9,000 mouse genes in response to RANKL stimulation. A total of 635 genes turned out to be significantly affected by RANKL stimulation and clustering analysis of these genes made it possible to classify them into six groups. Among them, since it was reasonable to suggest that the initial stage played a crucial role in switching cells from proliferation to differentiation, we focused in the present study on the group of genes induced within 2–5 h after RANKL stimulation. Cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β and TNF-α, and a transcription factor NFAT2 were found to be included in this group. We confirmed the expression of these genes by RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses. Comparison of microarray findings during the initial stage between two different conditions in which high and low efficient induction of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive MN cells were conducted, respectively, revealed the involvement of NFAT2 for MN cell formation. We further examined the behavior of NFAT2 and confirmed its crucial role in osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Soluble recombinant RANKL was constructed and expressed as a GST fusion protein as described previously (17Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Google Scholar) and finally purified free from LPS using the Detoxi-GelTM Endotoxin Removing Gel (Pierce). GST was prepared using the same procedures. RAW264 mouse monocyte/macrophage line cells (18Ralph P. Nakoinz I. J. Immunol. 1997; 119: 950-954Google Scholar) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Japan) and were maintained in Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) as described previously (17Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Google Scholar). For osteoclastogenesis in vitro, cells were plated at a density of 1.3 × 104/cm2 unless otherwise noted with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone) and incubated for 24 h, and then purified RANKL was added to the final concentration of 500 ng/ml (at 0 h) when needed. Medium was changed every 3 days with Eagle medium containing RANKL and fetal calf serum as above. After culturing for the indicated periods, cells were fixed and stained for TRAP as described previously (17Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Google Scholar). When cyclosporin A (CsA; Sigma) was administered, the indicated concentration of CsA was added and incubated for the indicated periods. Isolation of the nuclei and the cytosol from RAW264 cells were performed as described previously (19Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual, Section 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and treated with a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 units/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice. After 15 min, IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.625%, and mixed vigorously for 10 s. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 min, and the resulting supernatant fraction was recovered as the cytosol. Nuclei were then treated with hypertonic buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 units/ml aprotinin) for 15 min; the supernatant fraction was recovered as the nuclear fraction after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. The pTRAP-GFP plasmid was constructed by fusing a 1.8-kb fragment containing the 5′-flanking sequence of the mouse TRAP gene (20Reddy S.V. Hundley J.E. Windle J.J. Alcantara O. Linn R. Leach R.J. Boldt D.H. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Mineral Res. 1995; 10: 601-606Google Scholar) and pdEGFP (Clonetech). pTRAP-GFP was transfected into RAW264 cells with a plasmid carrying neo-resistant gene, and a clone, RAW264/TG, was isolated. Pooled total RNA was isolated from RAW264 cells at the time points 0, 2, 5, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after RANKL or GST stimulation. Untreated RAW264 cells were used as 0 h control. Total RNA was purified using a Strataprep Micro and Miniprep Total RNA isolation kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α was examined by RT-PCR with total RNA thus prepared under the conditions described previously (21Itahana K. Morikazu Y. Takeya T. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5036-5044Google Scholar) in which a linear amplification was achieved. A pair of primers specific to each gene was prepared: GCTATGGCTCACTTCATGAG and CAGTGATGTGGTTGTCACAG for IL-1α; GCAGTATCACTCATTGTGGC and GGAGTGTCCTAGAGATTGAGC for IL-1β; CCTCTCATCAGTTCTATGGC and CTTCTCCAGCTGGAAGACTC for TNF-α. For microarray probing, reverse transcription, second-strand synthesis, and probe generation were all accomplished by the standard Affymetrix protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) (22Lockhart D.J. Dong H Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. Biotinated cRNA was prepared using the cDNA as a template. Then the cRNA was fragmented and subjected to hybridization to oligonucleotide chips, Murine Genome U74A (Affymetrix), as described in the Gene Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix). After hybridization, bound cRNA was fluorescently labeled using R-Phycoerythrin Streptoavidin (Molecular Probes), and the fluorescence was intensified by the antibody-amplification method. The microarrays were scanned with a laser scanner (Hewlett Packard). The derived average difference value (AD) was globally normalized and targeted to all probe sets equal to 100 before comparative analysis. To examine the expression differences of each gene, we performed comparison analysis using the Affymetrix data suite system, and the genes (probe sets) showing greater than 2-fold change in value with a difference call of I or D were chosen as changed genes in each comparison. Probe sets whose AD was less than 100 in all samples were excluded from further analyses due to the low confidence in the value (data not shown). The genes thus selected as changed genes, at least at one time point, were collected and each AD was transformed to a Z-score, which was calculated from the distribution of ADs of each probe set for normalization. The Z-score thus obtained was subjected to clustering analysis using the k-means method (23Hartigan J.A. Clustering Algorithms. Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar, 24Kohonen, T. (1997) Self-Organizing Maps, 2nd ed.,Springer Series in Information Sciences, Vol. 426, Berlin, Germany.Google Scholar) with Spotfire Decision Site (Spotfire Inc.). The minimum number to cover all typical patterns of expression regulation, six, was chosen by trial and error. Western blotting was carried out essentially as described previously (17Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Google Scholar). Antibodies for IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α were purchased from Genzyme-Techno. Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (AC-74, Sigma) was used. Anti-rat IgG and anti–mouse IgG were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-NFATc1 (NFAT2) monoclonal antibody (7A6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The Tet-OnTM gene expression system (25Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Mueller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Google Scholar) was purchased from Clonetech Inc. cDNA covering the entire coding region of the NFAT2 gene was obtained by RT-PCR using mRNA prepared from RANKL-induced RAW264 cells. The first 231 nucleotides of cDNA were inserted into the pTet-Splice in the reverse orientation, pNFAT2-AS, so that transcribed RNA could function as an antisense mRNA for NFAT2. Stable transfection of RAW264 cells with pTet-On was carried out as described previously (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual, Chap. 17. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), giving rise to a clone RT3. Further transfection of pASNFAT2 into RT3 gave a mixed population of stably expressed cells. Osteoclasts are giant cells, containing up to 100 nuclei, formed by fusion of mononuclear precursor cells (9Roodman G.D. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 308-332Google Scholar). We found that the numbers of cell to be inoculated was critical for the efficiency of MN cell formation (Fig. 1 A). Namely, when 1.5 × 104 and 2.5 × 104 cells were inoculated per well of 24-well plates, ∼2,500 MN-TRAP-positive cells were formed. However, inoculation of 5 × 104 cells resulted in 90% reduction and 10 × 104 cells gave less than 1% of the maximal number. Cell morphologies obtained after 4 days under the two conditions are shown at the bottom (Fig. 1, B and C) and importantly, cells seen in densely plated dishes were TRAP-negative. Therefore, it appeared that an inhibitory signal for the differentiation process was induced before the stage of TRAP induction, when cells were plated at the high density condition (described below). When RAW264/TG cells in which the expression of GFP could be monitored under the control of the TRAP gene promoter were inoculated at the density of 2.5 × 104 cells per well, the expression of GFP was clearly detected at 24 h after RANKL stimulation. Cells with dendrite-like structures became apparent and significant numbers of fused cells appeared in RANKL-treated plates at 72 h. Finally, MN-TRAP-positive cells covered the plates in the RANKL-treated plates at 96 h. On the other hand, cells continued to proliferate and accumulated in GST-treated cells, and the expression of GFP was hardly detected. MN cells thus formed were shown to resorb dentine slices (data not shown; Ref. 15Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott G. Kelley M.J. Sarosi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Google Scholar) and to possess hydrolyzing activity of the hydroxyapatite layer (data not shown). To understand the temporally regulated process described above at the gene level, DNA chip technology was introduced. Total RNA was prepared from time points that were chosen on the basis of previous (17Meiyanto E. Hoshijima M. Ogawa T. Ishida N. Takeya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 278-283Google Scholar) and the above observations; they were 2, 5, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after RANKL- or GST-stimulation. Total RNA thus prepared from RANKL- or GST-stimulated and the parental RAW264 cells were further purified, and labeled cRNA was prepared for DNA microarray analyses using Affymetrix oligonucleotide chips (Murine Genome U74A). A substantial number of hybridization signals were determined in duplicate in independent hybridization experiments, which all showed a high degree of reproducibility. The number of probe sets (genes) that appeared to be differentially expressed by a factor greater than 2-fold between RANKL-treated and -untreated RAW264 cells at each time point are shown in the first row of Table I. In a similar fashion, genes differentially expressed (>2.0-fold) between RANKL- and GST-treated cells at each time point were deduced and are shown in the second row. On the basis of such comparisons, genes differentially expressed in RANKL-treated cells against both GST-treated and RANKL-untreated cells could be deduced at each time point and are summarized in the third row of Table I; they consisted of 635 genes in total. We applied a non-hierarchical clustering method, k-means, to the filtered data of the 635 genes thus selected to visualize the patterns of gene expression globally, producing six major groups (Fig. 2). The groups were named 1 through 6 based on the timing and mode of induction or suppression: Group 1 (up early); Group 2 (up middle); Group 3 (up late); Group 4 (down early); Group 5 (down late); Group 6 (others). For example, genes known as marker genes for osteoclast differentiation, such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 and vacuolar ATP synthase, were found in Group 3. In particular, genes that belonged to Group 1, which were found to be induced at 2–5 h after RANKL stimulation, were presumed to contain genes that play essential roles in determining the cell fate from proliferation to differentiation and are listed in TableII. We, therefore, focused and extended our analyses on Group 1 in the following experiments.Table INumber of genes differentially expressed among untreated parental, GST- and RANKL-treated cells at the indicated time points after the respective treatmentsTime points (hrs)251224487296Total(A) RANKL vsuntreated314476119413401297118512142303(B) RANKL vsGST2785733273773275315131481(C) common in (A) & (B)142174194236217294272635Gene expression profiles were monitored as described in the text.

On the basis of such comparisons, the number of genes commonly extracted in (A) and (B) are shown in the bottom row (C). Osteoclast differentiation has been shown to be regulated by various cytokines and factors including RANKL secreted from osteoblasts/stromal cells, macrophage, and activated T cells (10Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Google Scholar). Among them, IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α have been extensively characterized as paracrine factors (27Assuma R. Oates T. Cochran D. Amar S. Graves D.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 403-409Google Scholar). The present finding, therefore, that Group 1 included IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α could be an important clue to understanding the physiological roles of RANKL. We further confirmed the expression levels of these genes by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, IL-1α and IL-1β were actually found to be induced by RANKL stimulation exclusively at 2 h after stimulation, followed by rapid down-regulation, confirming the results by microarray analyses. Identical profiles were also seen at the protein level (Fig.3 B). Although the elevated expression was detected after RANKL stimulation, IL-1α was constantly detected even in control cells. On the other hand, mature forms of IL-1β and TNF-α were induced in only RANKL-stimulated cells in addition to a membrane-bound form of TNF-α (upper band in the bottom panel). As described above, the proceedings and efficiency of MN cell formation was greatly affected by the density of the inoculated cell numbers, and the critical time point for the cell fate appeared to be within 24 h, judging from the TRAP induction profile. It was assumed that this cell density-dependent switch might be coupled with changes in gene expression profiles and hence, we compared the gene expression levels between two conditions at 2, 5, 12, and 24 h. As a result, we could deduce four genes whose expression levels showed greater than a 2-fold difference between the two conditions even at the earliest time points (2–5 h). The four genes thus identified were Down syndrome candidate region 1 (DSCR1), nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFAT2), neoplastic progression 3, and Syndecan 1. Their profiles under the two conditions are shown in Fig.4. Among these genes, NFAT2 was different from other genes in that its expression level remained high through 24 h whereas the other three genes declined at 12 h. Moreover, only NFAT2 was a transcription factor, and its functional relation with DSCR1 was implicated (28Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1595-15604Google Scholar), suggesting the possible involvement of the DSCR1/NFAT2 pathway for the MN cell formation. We then focused on NFAT2 and further characterized it in the following experiments. NFAT was originally identified as a transcription factor responsible for the induction of IL-2 after T-cell activation and constitutes a family of four related genes: NFAT1 through NFAT4(4Serfling E.

Lopez-Rodriguez C. Rao A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2476-2489Google Scholar). We examined the expression profiles of NFAT1, -3, and -4 in RAW264 cells before and after RANKL stimulation. Little expression of NFAT1 and -3 were detected, whereas NFAT4 was found to be expressed constitutively throughout the conditions even in unstimulated RAW264 cells (data not shown). We, therefore, focused on NFAT2 and examined its expression profile more precisely at the protein level. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the expression of NFAT2 was almost undetectable before RANKL stimulation, but the abrupt induction was detected at an approximate mass of 82 kDa on day 1. The expression level was then found to be gradually decreased during the late stage of 4-day incubation. Multiple bands were always detected and presumed to reflect the phosphorylation state (32Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Google Scholar); this was confirmed by the mobility shift of slowly migrating bands after ph"

To study htt aggregation, we examined purified htt fragments in vitro, finding globular and protofibrillar intermediates participating in the genesis of mature fibrils. These intermediates were high in β-structure. Furthermore, Congo Red, a dye that stains amyloid fibrils, prevented the assembly of mutant htt into mature fibrils, but not the formation of protofibrils. Other proteins capable of forming ordered aggregates, such as amyloid β and α-synuclein, form similar intermediates, suggesting that the mechanisms of mutant htt aggregation and possibly htt toxicity may overlap with other neurodegenerative disorders.

In vitro, expanded htt forms fibrillar aggregates with morphological and biophysical properties similar to those formed by amyloid β (Aβ) peptide (15Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Google Scholar). The aggregation threshold in vitro mimics the glutamine length threshold for the disease phenotype (16Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Google Scholar), suggesting that an abnormal conformation of expanded htt plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Recently, Thompson and colleagues (17Kazantsev A. Walker H.A. Slepko N. Bear J.E. Preisinger E. Steffan J.S. Zhu Y.Z. Gertlet F.B. Housman D.E. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 367-376Google Scholar) have designed polypeptides that bind mutant htt, suppress aggregation in vivo, and reduce pathology in both cell and animal models of poly(Q) disease. It is possible that the pathway from soluble htt to fibrillar aggregate is a multistep process, with the toxic species formed before the mature fiber. To better understand this pathway, we have characterized the morphological and structural features of poly(Q)-mediated htt fibrilization using biochemical and biophysical techniques, including SDS-PAGE, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Plasmids encoding huntingtin exon 1 (htt exon1) proteins with either 16 or 44 consecutive glutamine residues were prepared using a multistep PCR-based and synthetic DNA approach (18Peters M.F. Ross C.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 275: 129-132Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ regions of htt exon1 DNA were individually cloned into the Bluescript vector (Stratagene; 5′, SalI andXbaI sites; XbaI and NotI sites). The 3′ htt exon1 cDNA fragment was then inserted into the 5′ vector (XbaI and NotI sites) to yield a modified httt exon1 cDNA with a 42-base pair linker between the 5′ and 3′ regions. To generate the 16Q htt exon1 construct, an oligonucleotide comprised of a mixed CAG/CAA sequence and encoding for 14 glutamine residues was inserted into the modified htt exon1 cDNA using theBseRI and BsgI restriction sites flanking the synthetic linker. To prepare the 44Q htt exon1 construct, two additional rounds of PCR were carried out to add a total of 30 CAG/CAA codons to the repeat region. The CAG/CAA oligonucleotide was then inserted into this modified vector to yield the final 44Q htt exon1 construct. Finally, both 16Q and 44Q inserts were sublconed into a modified pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) using SalI andNotI restriction sites to allow for expression as MBP fusion proteins. MBP-htt exon1 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, grown to an OD600 of 0.6–0.8, induced with 0.3 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Calbiochem) for 2 h at 28 °C, and harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5,000 rpm. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mm methionine, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (ICN Biochemicals), and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), lysed by French pressure, and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. MBP fusion proteins were purified by incubation of the lysate supernatant with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C. Following several washes, MBP fusion proteins were eluted with PBS supplemented with 10 mm maltose and further purified by nickel chelate chromatography. Purified fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. A goat polyclonal antibody was prepared against the N-terminal htt exon-1 fragment as described previously (19Peters M.F. Ross C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3188-3194Google Scholar). Anti-MBP was purchased from New England Biolabs and expanded polyglutamine selective monoclonal antibody 1C2 was obtained from Chemicon International. Purified fusion proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol. Final protein concentrations were estimated using Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To remove the MBP affinity tag and induce aggregation of htt exon1–44Q, dialyzed fusion protein (0.25 mg/ml) was digested with factor Xa protease (Novagen; 1 μg of enzyme:25 μg of protein) at room temperature. At various time points, aliquots were removed and mixed with SDS sample buffer to terminate the cleavage reaction. Digest reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–15%) and Western blotting using anti-htt exon1, anti-MBP, or 1C2 antibodies. MBP-htt digest reactions were carried out as described above. For each time point analyzed, a 5-μl aliquot was removed and flash frozen in liquid N2. Prior to TEM analysis, freshly thawed samples were applied to a carbon-coated copper grid and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. TEM imaging was carried out using a Zeiss-EM10 equipped with a Gantan CCD camera. A Nicolet model 8210 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a zinc selenide attenuated total reflectance accessory and deuterated triglycerine sulfate (DTGS) detector was used for spectral recordings at room temperature. The spectrometer was purged with liquid nitrogen for 4 h before recording spectra. For each spectrum, a 256-scan interferogram was collected at a resolution of 4 cm−1. For each reading, the single beam spectrum of the buffer and protein solutions were divided by the background single beam spectrum, before conversion to absorbance spectra. The final protein spectra were obtained by subtraction of the buffer spectra and smoothed using a 7-point Savitsky-Golay algorithm. For all protein spectra, the area of amide I region (1,600–1,700 cm−1) was normalized to one. To compare secondary structural changes in different samples, a second derivative calculation was performed using Grams/386 software (Galactic Industries Corp.) as described previously (20Fu F.-N. Lomneth R.B. Cai S. Singh B.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5267-5278Google Scholar). Prior to analysis, a 5-μl aliquot of digested 44Q protein was deposited onto freshly cleaved ruby mica (Mica, New York) and allowed to adsorb for 30 s. The sample was washed with double distilled water, dried with nitrogen gas, and imaged in air with a Nanoscope III microscope (Digital Instruments, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) operating in tapping mode as described previously (21Rivetti C. Guthold M. Bustamante C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4464-4475Google Scholar). Images were flattened with a first-order or second-order fit using Digital Instruments software. For these studies, we prepared MBP-tagged htt exon1 fusion proteins with a normal length (16Q) and a pathological length (44Q) poly(Q) region (Fig.1 A). A His6tag was engineered at the C terminus of the fragment to allow isolation of full-length exon 1 protein. SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining confirmed that the recombinant htt exon1 fusion proteins were >99% pure following the second chromatography step (Fig. 1 B,left panel, lane 2). Western blot analysis demonstrated that both normal length and pathological length htt exon1 proteins were recognized by an anti-huntingtin antibody (Fig.1 B, middle panel). However, only the htt exon1–44Q protein was immunoreactive with 1C2 (Fig. 1 B,right panel), an antibody previously shown to selectively recognize expanded poly(Q) tracts. Previous studies have shown that following removal of the N-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag, a htt exon1 fragment with an expanded poly(Q) region aggregates in a time- and poly(Q) length-dependent manner (16Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Google Scholar). MBP-htt exon1 fusion proteins were treated with factor Xa to remove the affinity tag and induce expanded htt aggregation. The cleavage reaction was monitored by Western blotting as shown in Fig. 1 C. Analysis of the digests with an anti-htt exon1 antibody showed that the htt 44Q protein formed high molecular weight SDS-insoluble aggregates at later time points in the cleavage reaction while the 16Q protein did not. These observations are consistent with previous studies and confirm that expanded but not normal length poly(Q), in the context of htt exon1, aggregates following removal of an affinity tag. Interestingly, reactivity to 1C2 was eliminated after MBP cleavage, even though the cleaved htt protein is still recognized by an anti-htt antibody. This change in immunoreactivity is unaffected by boiling in SDS and suggests that a structural change in the 44Q monomer takes place following MBP removal. To assess morphological and structural changes in the expanded poly(Q) region of htt exon1, we monitored the MBP cleavage reaction of 44Q by TEM and FTIR spectroscopy (Fig.2). As early as 30 min following addition of protease, small globular assemblies with a diameter of 4–5 nm were visible by TEM (not shown). These globular features increase in number at longer incubation times of 2 and 3 h (Fig. 2, B andC, respectively). At later time points between 4 and 6 h (Fig. 2, D–F), amyloid-like fibers were visible and co-exist with the spherical assemblies. Interestingly, the number of globular features decreased with a coincident increase in fibers. By 7 h post-MBP cleavage (Fig. 2 G), only fibers were visible. Neither globular assemblies nor fibers were observed in a control sample not treated with factor Xa (Fig. 2 A). FTIR analysis of the cleavage reaction products revealed no evidence of the β-structure within 44Q in the 1,620–1,640-cm−1 region (22Fink A.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 3: 9-23Google Scholar, 23Haris P. Infrared Analysis of Peptides and Proteins: Principles and Applications. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.2000Google Scholar) at time 0 (Fig. 2 I). However, a large increase in the 1,620-cm−1 band, likely representing intermolecular β-structure (23Haris P. Infrared Analysis of Peptides and Proteins: Principles and Applications. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.2000Google Scholar), was observed 7 h following addition of enzyme. This β-structure coincides with the assembly of htt fibers. At earlier time points when there were exclusively or predominantly oligomers (2 and 3.5 h, respectively; Fig. 2 J), two distinct IR bands were observed in the β-region (1,620–1,640 cm−1). These peaks may arise from an increase in β-sheet and or β-turn structure (23Haris P. Infrared Analysis of Peptides and Proteins: Principles and Applications. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.2000Google Scholar), suggesting that at a time coinciding with the appearance of globular oligomers, 44Q adopts a β-structure, which may differ from that of the fibers. Previous work has demonstrated that Congo Red (CR), a dye used to assay for amyloid fibers, is also an inhibitor of poly(Q)-mediated htt fibrilization (24Heiser V. Scherzinger E. Boeddrich A. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6739-6744Google Scholar). To determine the effect of CR on the fibrilization of htt exon1–44Q, we treated the purified protein with increasing concentrations of CR 30 min after addition of factor Xa protease. Aliquots were removed at 4, 8, and 24 h, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 3 A). Monomeric htt exon1 44Q was visible in all samples 4 and 8 h after the addition of enzyme. After overnight incubation with 2.5 and 10 μm CR, monomeric 44Q protein was visible even after an overnight incubation with factor Xa, demonstrating that SDS-insoluble htt fibers were not formed under these conditions. These observations support previous data that CR blocks poly(Q)-mediated fibrilization (24Heiser V. Scherzinger E. Boeddrich A. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6739-6744Google Scholar). In contrast, no monomeric htt was detected in the control or 0.25 μm CR conditions. By this time, all monomeric 44Q protein had presumably been incorporated into SDS-insoluble fibers and remained at the origin of electrophoresis (data not shown). To visualize these effects at a morphological level, we imaged CR-treated 44Q samples by TEM (Fig. 3, B and C). Large fiber bundles were visible in the control sample (Fig.3 B). In contrast, numerous small individual htt fibrils were visible in the CR-treated sample (Fig. 3 C). Based on SDS-PAGE analysis, these fibrils were not resistant to SDS denaturation. Moreover, the individual fibrils were thinner than those making up the fiber bundle, with a diameter of 4–5 nm, compared with 10–11 nm for the control. Upon closer inspection of the control sample, we observed that at the ends of some fiber bundles were small fibrils 4–5 nm in diameter. These 4–5-nm fibrils may represent incomplete growth at the end of the fiber bundle. A possible explanation for these observations is that fiber assembly is preceded by the formation of smaller fibrils or SDS-sensitive protofibrils. To further investigate the poly(Q)-mediated htt fiber assembly pathway, we carried out AFM analysis of MBP-htt exon1–44Q before and after removal of the affinity tag. Before MBP cleavage, the fusion protein appeared by AFM as a globular feature with a height of 1.2 nm, corresponding to the MBP affinity tag, and a “tail” feature likely to represent the htt exon1 fragment (Fig. 4 A,arrows). After an overnight incubation with factor Xa, large fiber bundles were visible by AFM (Fig. 4 B). These were not observed for the htt exon1–16Q fragment, consistent with previous findings that a poly(Q) tract of 16Q does not form amyloid fibers in the context of the htt exon1 fragment. Individual fibers with a height of 10–11 nm were visible at the ends of the fiber bundle, some of which displayed a segmented “beads on a string” morphology (Fig.4 B, inset, arrowheads). Upon careful inspection of the close-up images, we observed thinner fibrils at some of the bundle ends with a height of 4–5 nm (Fig. 4 B,inset, arrows). These height data are consistent with the data observed for protofibrils and fibers visible by TEM and strongly suggest that the htt exon1–44Q fibers observed by both TEM and AFM are the same. Thus, the 4–5-nm globular features visible early in the TEM cleavage reaction are likely protofibrillar subunits and may represent oligomeric intermediates in the fibrilization pathway. A possible model, based on the current data, is shown in Fig.5. Before removal of the affinity tag, htt exon1 is soluble with an unstructured poly(Q) region. These observations are consistent with previous structural studies suggesting that poly(Q) is unstructured in solution (25Altschuler E.L. Hud N.V. Mazrimas J.A. Rupp B. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 50: 73-75Google Scholar, 26Chen S. Berthelier V. Yang W. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 173-182Google Scholar, 27Masino L. Kelly G. Leonard K. Trottier Y. Pastore A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 267-272Google Scholar). After removal of the affinity tag, the expanded htt construct begins to adopt β-structure via conformational changes in the expanded poly(Q) and forms globular assemblies likely to be intermediates in the fibrilization pathway. Over time, the globular oligomers can associate linearly to form single protofibrils. These protofibrils are not visible as isolated entities, unless Congo Red is present to prevent their association. Importantly, the protofibrils are SDS-soluble, unlike mature htt fibers. Mature fiber formation may result from the association or concurrent growth of two protofibrils or by addition of oligomers to a single protofibril; our data cannot distinguish between these possibilities. In the present studies, we show by electron microscopy and AFM that expanded poly(Q) in the context of htt forms globular and protofibrillar species. Such observations are reminiscent of previous studies on other amyloidogenic proteins such as Aβ, α-synuclein, and yeast (prion) Sup35 NM peptide (28Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar, 29Rochet J.C. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10619-10626Google Scholar, 30Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Google Scholar). Morphological characteristics of these species are remarkably similar despite the variation in amino acid composition and molecular size among the different proteins. Recently, Wetzel and colleagues (31O'Nuallain B. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1485-1490Google Scholar) have generated two monoclonal antibodies that recognize fibrillar Aβ as well as poly(Q) and other amyloid-like fibers. Taken together, these data suggest that similar structures are formed upon conversion from the normal to the mutant state and are likely to form by similar mechanisms. Globular oligomers may represent early prefibrillar intermediates of fibrilization. By FTIR spectroscopy, we detected the appearance of β-structure that coincides with the appearance of globular oligomers, demonstrating that htt adopts secondary structure early in the fibrilization pathway. Congo Red, a dye commonly used to assay for amyloid fiber formation, prevented the assembly of mature htt fibers, possibly by binding to the β-structure of the protofibril. Studies of both Aβ and α-synuclein toxicity have suggested that globules and/or protofibrils may be more toxic than mature fibers (32Klein W.L. Krafft G.A. Finch C.E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 219-224Google Scholar) and that stabilization of protofibrillar intermediates may promote disease pathogenesis (33Conway K.A. Rochet J.-C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr, P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Google Scholar). Recent experiments show that oligomers or other prefibrillar aggregation intermediates are toxic in several models (34Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar, 35Walsh D.M. Klyubn I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Google Scholar). Regardless of the toxic species, there is evidence that structural changes take place before the appearance of mature fibers and that a strong correlation exists between these alterations and neurotoxicity. Based on the similarities between htt fibrilization and that of other amyloid-forming proteins, we propose that HD toxicity is also governed by such structural alterations. Characterization of these changes may allow for the rational design of therapeutics at multiple steps in htt fibrilization and, by analogy, for other neurodegenerative diseases. We thank W. Xiao for assistance with initial TEM experiments, L. Gonzalez and D. Borchelt for critical reading of the manuscript, M.

https://openalex.org/W2052786131,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomerase components Est2p, TLC1 RNA, Est1p, and Est3p are thought to form a complex that acts late during chromosome replication (S phase) upon recruitment by Cdc13p, a telomeric DNA binding protein. Consistent with this model, we show that Est1p, Est2p, and Cdc13p are telomere-associated at this time. However, Est2p, but not Est1p, also binds telomeres before late S phase. The cdc13-2 allele has been proposed to be defective in recruitment, yet Est1p and Est2p telomere association persists in cdc13-2 cells. These findings suggest a model in which Est1p binds telomeres late in S phase and interacts with Cdc13p to convert inactive, telomere-bound Est2p to an active form."

Here, we examined the contribution of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR4, the adapter protein MyD88, and CD14 to signaling in response to the three forms of A. fumigatus encountered during human disease: resting conidia (RC), swollen conidia (SC), and hyphae (H). Compared with elicited peritoneal macrophages obtained from wild-type and heterozygous mice, TLR2−/− and MyD88−/− macrophages produced significantly less tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) followingA. fumigatus stimulation. In contrast, following stimulation with RC, SC, and H, TLR4−/− and CD14−/− macrophages exhibited no defects in tumor necrosis factor-α release. TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, MyD88−/−, and CD14−/− macrophages bound similar numbers of RC and SC compared with wild-type macrophages. RC, SC, and H stimulated greater activation of a nuclear factor κ B (NFκB)-dependent reporter gene and greater release of tumor necrosis factor-α from the human monocytic THP-1 cell line stably transfected with CD14 compared with control cells stably transfected with empty vector. A. fumigatus stimulated NFκB-dependent reporter gene activity in the human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, only if the cells were transfected with TLR2. Moreover, activity increased when TLR2 and CD14 were co-transfected. Taken together, these data suggest that optimal signaling responses to A. fumigatus require TLR2 in both mouse and human cells.

Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 382-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Human exposure most commonly occurs following inhalation of airborne resting conidia (RC),1 which are an ideal size for alveolar deposition. Bronchoalveolar macrophages can phagocytose and kill RC and thus are thought to constitute the first line of defense against the fungus. Should this initial defense fail, the RC become metabolically active and grow into swollen conidia (SC) and eventually hyphae (H), the invasive form of the fungus. Thus, the host can successfully defend against aspergillosis by killing any of the three growth phases of the fungus, RC, SC, and H. The spectrum of aspergillosis (2Stevens D.A. Kan V.L. Judson M.A. Morrison V.A. Dummer S. Denning D.W. Bennett J.E. Walsh T.J. Patterson T.F. Pankey G.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 30: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) ranges from allergic manifestations, mostly seen in atopic individuals, to invasive disease, which occurs almost exclusively in those with severe immunocompromise. Most patients with invasive aspergillosis have a qualitative or quantitative disorder of phagocyte function such as neutropenia due to chemotherapy or macrophage dysfunction due to high doses of corticosteroids (3Levitz S.M. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1989; 3: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar). Even with antifungal therapy, invasive aspergillosis is associated with high mortality rates. In Drosophila, the genes encoding antibacterial and antifungal peptides are differentially expressed after injection of distinct microorganisms. Drosophila that are naturally infected by A. fumigatus exhibit an adapted response by producing peptides, including drosomycin, with antifungal activity. This response is mediated through the selective activation of the Toll pathway. Drosophila with toll mutants are overwhelmed following challenge with A. fumigatus (4Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3020) Google Scholar, 5Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain toll-like receptors (TLR) with homology toDrosophila toll (6Muzio M. Mantovani A. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At least ten members of the TLR family have been identified in humans and mice (7Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). The TLR is characterized by extracellular leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R (TIR) homology domain that is shared with IL-1R family proteins, including the IL-1R, IL-18R, and T1/ST2 (8O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The TIR homology domain is also found in the cytoplasmic adapter protein, MyD88, which interacts with the IL-1R/TLR family members. Stimulation via the IL-1R/TLR family leads to initiation of signaling cascades that culminate in activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases. This process facilitates the transcription of genes that regulate the adaptive immune response, including those for many cytokines and chemokines. Recent studies have established that individual microbial ligands activate specific TLRs. Moreover, in many instances, activation requires the presence of a co-receptor, which may function as an initial binding receptor. This is best worked out for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria. LPS binds to the glycosylphosphoinositol-anchored cell protein, CD14, in the presence of a serum factor, LPS binding protein. However, signal transduction requires the presence of TLR4 (9Bernheiden M. Heinrich J.M. Minigo G. Schutt C. Stelter F. Freeman M. Golenbock D. Jack R.S. J.

Other recently described TLR microbial ligands include TLR3, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR9, which signal in response to double-stranded RNA, bacterial flagelin, small antiviral compounds, and unmethylated CpG DNA, respectively (23Takeshita F.

The inflammatory response is critical to the survival of all complex organisms, serving to eliminate or isolate the injurious agent(s) and facilitate the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue (26Driscoll K.E. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 112–113: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The proinflammatory cytokine TNFα plays a critical role in the regulation of the inflammatory response following challenge by A. fumigatus. Thus, in murine models of aspergillosis, neutralization of TNFα is deleterious, whereas pre-treatment with a TNFα agonist peptide enhances resistance (27Mehrad B. Strieter R.M. Standiford T.J. J.

(30Wang J.E. Warris A. Ellingsen E.A. Jorgensen P.F. Flo T.H. Espevik T. Solberg R. Verweij P.E. Aasen A.O. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2402-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) demonstrated that human monocytes treated with blocking antibodies directed against either TLR4 or CD14 had a modest reduction in TNFα production following stimulation withA. fumigatus hyphae. In the present study, the contribution of CD14 and TLR signaling pathways to the production of TNFα following stimulation by A. fumigatus was examined using knockout mice and transfected cell lines. The three fungal forms, RC, SC, and H, which the host is exposed to during the course of an infection, were used as stimuli. We found that TLR2 is the predominant cell surface receptor required for signaling in murine macrophages and HEK293 cells, whereas activation of NFκB was enhanced in THP-1 cells and HEK293 cells in the presence of CD14. Moreover, signaling occurs mainly via the adapter protein MyD88. All reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and RPMI 1640 were purchased from BioWhitaker (Walkersville, MD). Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine (Invitrogen), HEPES, macrophage serum-free medium, and geneticin (G418) were purchased from Invitrogen, and ciprofloxacin was purchased from Bayer (West Haven, CT). Reagents to perform the mouse and human TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were purchased as a kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and used as directed.

Complete media is defined as RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,l-glutamine, and ciprofloxacin. Unless stated otherwise, all incubations were at 37 °C in humidified air supplemented with 5% CO2. As in our previous studies, experiments were performed under conditions designed to minimize potential endotoxin contamination (12Shoham S. Huang C. Chen J.M. Golenbock D.T. Levitz S.M. J.

Briefly, RC were suspended in PBS and passed through 4 layers of sterilized gauze (Johnson & Johnson, Arlington, Texas) to remove hyphal material and debris. RC were differentiated into SC and H by incubation at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 1% HEPES for 5 and 7 h, respectively. The average hyphal length was 12 μm as measured using 6-μm calibrated beads (BD PharMingen). The RC were used live. However, because fungal overgrowth precluded the use of live SC and H, these growth phases were killed by incubation in a water bath at 100 °C for 10 min. To eliminate potential LPS contamination, RC, SC, and H were washed once in PBS containing 50 μg/ml PMB and an additional 4 times in PBS alone. The fungal cells were counted using a hemocytometer, suspended at the desired concentration, and stored at 4 °C until use. Fresh fungal preparations were made every 4 weeks. The stimulation ratios of fungi to cells were 1:1, 10:1, and 1:1 for RC, SC, and H, respectively. In preliminary experiments, these ratios resulted in near maximal stimulation of cellular responses (data not shown). LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (smooth) was subjected to a modified phenol re-extraction protocol (35Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J.

Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from 6–10-week old mice (36Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J.

Briefly, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3 ml of thioglycollate, and after 4 days peritoneal exudate cells were harvested by lavage with 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. The cells were washed once in the medium and plated at a density of 1 × 105 per well in a 96-well tissue culture plate. After 2 days, non-adherent cells were washed free, fresh medium was added, and the adherent cells were challenged with the indicated stimuli for 18 h. Supernatants were then harvested and tested for TNFα release by ELISA as described above. The cells from the CD14−/− mice and their WT counterparts were harvested and cultured in serum-free medium (Invitrogen) so as to avoid the confounding effects of soluble CD14 present in serum (41Yang Z. Breider M.A. Carroll R.C. Miller M.S. Bochsler P.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These cells did not encounter serum at any time during the course of the experiment. The human myeloid cell line, THP-1, stably transfected with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD14 (THP1-CD14 expressing 2 × 106 molecules per cell) and control THP-1 cells stably transfected with the empty RSV vector (THP1-RSV) were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Ulevitch (Scripps, La Jolla, CA) (42Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). THP1-RSV cells express minimal (<1000 molecules/cell) amounts of cell surface CD14 (42Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TLR2 and TLR4 are constitutively expressed on THP1 cells, and the expression does not change when the cells are maturated (43Sugawara S.

The cell lines were maintained in complete medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 0.5 mg/ml geneticin. A luciferase reporter gene (44Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J.

THP1-CD14 and THP1-RSV cells were transiently transfected with the ELAM-luciferase reporter plasmids using DEAE-Dextran and 1 μg of plasmid DNA per 1 × 106cells, as in our previous studies (45Harrison T.S. Nong S. Levitz S.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 176: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours following transfection, the cells were challenged for 18 h with the indicated stimuli. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using a kit from Promega and read on a luminometer. HEK293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained by serial passage in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, and ciprofloxacin. By RT-PCR, HEK293 cells express mRNA for TLR1 and TLR6, but not for TLR2 and TLR4 (46Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B. Giese T. Endres S. Hartmann G. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4531-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). 2D. T. Golenbock, unpublished data. Cells were transiently transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In addition to pELAM.luc, plasmids used for transfection included ones containing genes encoding for TLR2, TLR4 (15Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CD14 (47Golenbock D.T. Liu Y. Millham F.H. Freeman M.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22055-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MD2 (48Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To ascertain that transfection efficiencies were comparable among groups, in selected experiments cells were co-transfected with the pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega). This plasmid constitutively drives transcription of β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase activity was measured using a β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Binding of A. fumigatus RC and SC was determined as in previous studies (49Levitz S.M. Tabuni A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, conidia were incubated with mammalian cells at a ratio of 10:1 for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 1% buffered formaldehyde, and counted under a microscope. Binding was expressed as the binding index, defined as the average number of conidia associated per cell. Both cell surface-associated and fully phagocytosed (internalized) conidia were counted. Means and Standard Errors (S.E.) were derived using a statistical software program (SigmaStat; Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). The two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare experimental groups. The Bonferroni correction was used when multiple comparisons were made. MyD88 is a cytoplasmic adapter protein that appears essential for optimal signaling via TLR2 and TLR4 (37Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). To determine the role of MyD88 in aspergillosis, TNFα release from peritoneal macrophages obtained from MyD88−/− mice was determined. The three growth phases of A. fumigatus, as well as LPS and PG, stimulated significantly higher TNFα release from the WT macrophages compared with the MyD88−/− macrophages (Fig.1) (p = <0.001). These data demonstrate that the vast majority ofAspergillus-stimulated TNFα release is dependent upon signaling pathways utilizing MyD88. Elicited peritoneal macrophages from TLR2−/− mice and their TLR2+/− littermates were examined for their ability to secrete TNFα in response to stimulation by RC, SC, and H of A. fumigatus. As positive controls for each of these experiments, wells containing known TLR2 (PG) and TLR4 (phenol re-extracted LPS) agonists were included. Unstimulated macrophages served as negative controls. In selected experiments, to rule out endotoxin contamination, 20 μg of polymixin B per ml were added to the wells prior to stimulation. This had no significant effect on cytokine release in response to the fungal stimuli (data not shown). RC and H stimulated significantly more TNFα production from the TLR2+/− macrophages compared with the TLR2−/− macrophages (Fig.2). In contrast, SC stimulated similar amounts of TNFα from TLR2+/− and KO macrophages. As expected, the TLR2 agonist, PG, stimulated TNFα release only from the wild-type macrophages, whereas the TLR4 agonist, LPS, stimulated similar amounts of cytokine release from heterozygote and TLR2−/− macrophages. C3H/HeJ mice have a point mutation in the TIR domain of TLR4 rendering them hyporesponsive to LPS (50Sultzer B.M. Nature. 1968; 219: 1253-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 51Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V., Du, X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). Secretion of TNFα in response to Aspergillus stimulation was compared in elicited peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice and congenic TLR4+/+ C3H/OuJ mice (Fig.3). There were no significant differences in TNFα release between the macrophages from the two strains following stimulation with RC, SC, and H. However, there was a trend, albeit not significant (p = 0.072), toward greater TNFα release from the C3H/OuJ macrophages following stimulation with SC. The TLR2 agonist, PG, stimulated similar amounts of TNFα from both cell types, whereas the TLR4 ligand, LPS, only stimulated the wild-type macrophages. These data suggest that TLR4 does not play a role in signaling murine macrophage TNFα release following stimulation by RC and H, although a small contribution of TLR4 in signaling responses to SC cannot be excluded. To study the role of CD14 in signaling cytokine responses to A. fumigatus, peritoneal macrophages obtained from CD14−/− mice were stimulated with the three growth phases of Aspergillus and TNFα release determined (Fig.4). These experiments were performed using serum-free medium because serum contains soluble CD14 (52Wright S.D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Ramos R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 53Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Patel M. Miller D.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). There were no significant differences seen in TNFα release upon stimulation by RC, SC, and H when comparing CD14−/−macrophages to the WT. As expected, the positive controls LPS and Bb showed a significant increase in TNFα release in the WT compared with the CD14−/− (p = <0.001). These data suggest that signaling in Aspergillus is not dependent upon CD14 in mice. The above experiments suggested that CD14 was not required for mouse macrophage responses to A. fumigatus. These data contrast with those of Wang et al. (30Wang J.E. Warris A. Ellingsen E.A. Jorgensen P.F. Flo T.H. Espevik T. Solberg R. Verweij P.E. Aasen A.O. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2402-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), showing a role for CD14 in human monocytic responses to hyphal stimulation. To investigate whether species-related differences could account for this disparity, the role of CD14 was examined further by studying TNFα release and NFκB nuclear translocation in the human myelomonocytic cell line, THP1, stably transfected with CD14 (THP1-CD14). THP1 cells containing an empty RSV vector (THP1-RSV) served as control cells. The cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid, pELAM.luc, containing an NFκB-dependent promoter driving expression of luciferase and then stimulated with A. fumigatus (Fig.5 A). The three growth phases of the A. fumigatus, RC, SC, and H, stimulated significantly higher NFκB production, as measured by luciferase production, in the THP1-CD14 cells than in the THP1-RSV cells (p = <0.001). Similarly, LPS, which binds to CD14 (10Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar), also stimulated significantly more luciferase in the THP1-CD14 cells. The differences in luciferase production were not secondary to differences in transfection efficiency or the intrinsic capacity of the different cell lines to translocate NFκB. This was evidenced by the finding that stimulation with TNFα, which signals independently of CD14 and TLRs, resulted in similar amounts of luciferase in the two cell lines. Further evidence for similar transfection efficiencies came from experiments in which the cell lines were co-transfected with the pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid, which contains the human CMV"

In analogy with the proteomics technology, where all proteins expressed in a cell or tissue are analyzed, the peptidomics approach aims at the simultaneous identification of the whole peptidome of a cell or tissue,i.e. all expressed peptides with their posttranslational modifications. Using nanoscale liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry and data base mining, we analyzed the peptidome of the larval Drosophila central nervous system at the amino acid sequence level. We were able to provide biochemical evidence for the presence of 28 neuropeptides using an extract of only 50 larval Drosophila central nervous systems. Eighteen of these peptides are encoded in previously cloned or annotated precursor genes, although not all of them were predicted correctly. Eleven of these peptides were never purified before. Eight other peptides are entirely novel and are encoded in five different, not yet annotated genes.

This neuropeptide expression profiling study also opens perspectives for other eukaryotic model systems, for which genome projects are completed or in progress. The most common approach in proteomic studies is to separate and visualize as many proteins as possible of an organism, tissue, or cell, by two-dimensional electrophoresis and to subsequently identify differentially expressed proteins by mass spectrometric techniques. One of the major constraints of this technology is that proteins of a molecular mass lower than 10 kDa are generally not retained and overlooked in most of the proteomic studies. Nevertheless this mass region contains a group of very important proteins, the peptide hormones and neurotransmitters. To date, many neuropeptides have been purified from vertebrate and invertebrate sources. Peptide physiology in the pregenomic era (before the realization of the genome projects) was time-consuming as a peptide present in tissue extracts had to be purified to homogeneity prior to sequencing, synthesis, and functional analysis. Drosophila is an outstanding model system for the molecular genetics and developmental biology in higher eukaryotes. Yet, its molecular endocrinology is poorly documented because only seven neuropeptides have been identified by traditional purification. Recently, a milestone was reached with the completion of theDrosophila genome project (1Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A.

Through the BLAST program, one can screen the genome of an organism for candidate-neuropeptides based on sequence homology with known neuropeptides from other organisms. In this way, 31 (neuro)peptide genes were found inDrosophila melanogaster (2Hewes R.S. Taghert P.H. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1126-1142Google Scholar, 3Vanden Broeck J.

These findings, however, give no information on the temporal and spatial expression nor on the physiological relevance of these (neuro)peptide genes. Often, the precursors of biologically active peptides encode several peptides. In general, these peptides can be predicted from the precursor gene as it is assumed that proteolytic processing generally occurs at mono- and dibasic cleavage sites. However, not all of these possible cleavage sites are always used. Prediction of precursor-derived peptides is even more difficult when the existence of unconventional cleavage sites is taken into account (6Baggerman G. Huybrechts J. Clynen E. Hens K. Harthoorn L. Van der H.D. Poulos C. De Loof A. Schoofs L. Peptides. 2002; : 635-644Google Scholar). As a result, it is impossible to predict with certainty what the final processing products will be, based on the sequence of the precursor solely. This means that the structural characterization of the naturally occurring peptides remains necessary, not only to confirm the cleavage of the peptides from their precursor but also to identify posttranslational modifications, which cannot be predicted with certainty from the DNA sequence alone. Along with the emergence of very sensitive mass spectrometry and the miniaturization of separation techniques, a new approach, designated as peptidomics in analogy with proteomics, enables us to analyze the entire peptidome of a tissue at the amino acid sequence level, starting from very little material. Peptidomics overcomes the drawback of the small body size of Drosophila that hampered traditional purification efforts. In this study, we investigate the neuropeptide profile of the larvalDrosophila central nervous system, using nanoflow capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and theDrosophila genome data base as tools to find and identify neuropeptides D. melanogaster are kept in 250-ml bottles and fed on a diet per bottle consisting of 70 ml of water, 17 g of sucrose, 0.45 g of yeast, 0.9 g of agar, 0.5 ml of 8% Nipagin, and 0.36 ml of propionic acid. Batches of 50 CNS 1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; FARP, FMRF-amide-related peptide; NPF, neuropeptide F; AKH, adipokinetic hormones; DIM, Drosophila immune-induced. of “wandering” larvae are dissected and extracted in 20 μl of methanol/water/formic acid (90/9,9/0,1, v/v/v). The supernatants are filtered through Millipore spin down filters, dried, and stored at –20 °C. Capillary LC-tandem MS experiments were conducted using an Ultimate high pressure LC pump, a column-switching device (Switchos) and a Famos autosampler (all LC Packings) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass). Chromatography was performed using a guard column (μ-guard column MGU-30 C18, LC-Packings) acting as a reverse phase support to trap the peptides. Ten μl of the sample (corresponding to 50 Drosophila CNS equivalents) was loaded on the pre-column with an isocratic flow of 2% acetonitrile in MilliQ water with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After 2 min, the column-switching valve was switched, placing the pre-column online with the analytical capillary column, a Pepmap C18, 3 μm of 75 μm × 150 mm nano column (LC Packings). Separation was conducted using a linear gradient from 95% solvent A and 5% solvent B to 20% A and 80% B in 90 min, followed by a linear gradient from 20% A and 80% B to 50% A and 50% B in 60 min (solvent A: water, formic acid; 99.9/0.1 (v/v); solvent B: acetonitrile, formic acid; 99.9, 0.1 (v,v)). The flow rate was set at 150 nl/min. The LC system is connected in series to the electrospray interface of the quadrupole time-of-flight device. The column eluent was directed through a metal-coated fused silica tip (Picotip type FS360-75-10 D, New Objective). Needle voltage was set at 1300 volts, cone voltage at 35 volts. Nitrogen was used as nebulizing gas. All double and triple-charged ions (typical for peptides, background ions have generally only one charge) of sufficient parent ion intensity (threshold was set at 15 counts/second) were automatically recognized by the charge state recognition software (Masslynx 3.5, Micromass) and selected for fragmentation as they eluted from the column. Argon was used as a collision gas; collision energy was set at 25–40 eV depending on the mass and charge state of the selected ion. Three different successive approaches were used for peptide identification. 1) The fragmentation spectrum of an ion with an experimental mass corresponding to the calculated mass of a known or predicted Drosophila peptide was compared and matched with the theoretical fragmentation spectrum of that peptide obtained from the Biolynx software (Micromass). 2) Unknown peptides were identified by subjecting their fragmentation spectra to a Mascott search (www.matrixscience.com). This bioinformatic tool allows the identification of a peptide in a (genomic) data base by analyzing the fragmentation spectrum of the peptide and by using the results of this analysis to search the data base for a possible match. 3) Alternatively, the fragmentation spectrum was first analyzed manually, and the deduced amino acid sequence as well as the total peptide mass were used as queries in a Mascot search. Often only a partial amino acid sequence is obtained. Nevertheless, the Mascot program can be used to identify the gene from the genomic data base using the partial sequence and the parent mass as queries. All obtained fragmentation spectra were analyzed in this way. The programs TargetP (version 1.01) (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) (7Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol.

The sequences are presented in TableI, and the nomenclature is derived from the flybase. The used programs predict an extracellular localization for all 15 peptide precursor proteins and yield a potential signal peptide, except for the leucokinin precursor. In D. melanogaster, as in other insects, a high number of neuropeptides display a C-terminal amino acid sequence, similar to FMRF-amide. In the fruit fly, these FARPs are encoded by four different genes. In our experiments, we found peptides originating from all four precursor proteins. The Fmrf gene contains five copies of DPKQDFMRF-amide, as well as 10 additional possible amidated peptides (9Schneider L.E. Taghert P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1993-1997Google Scholar). Three of the encoded peptides (DPKQDFMRF-amide, TPAEDFMRF-amide (2 copies/gene), and SDNFMRF-amide) have already been purified and sequenced from extracts of adult Drosophila (10Nichols R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 213-218Google Scholar). We were able to detect these Drm-FMRF-amide peptides in the larval CNS extracts along with another peptide (PDNFMRF-amide) predicted from the same Fmrfgene. The dromyosuppressin or Dms gene only encodes the myoinhibitory peptide dromyosuppressin or TDVDHVLRF-amide (10Nichols R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1992; 3: 213-218Google Scholar). In the LC-MS experiment we were able to detect and fully sequence dromyosuppressin (Fig. 2 a) as one of the most prominent MS peaks. The drosulfakinin or Dsk gene has been cloned (11Nichols R. Schneuwly S.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12167-12170Google Scholar) and predicts three putative peptides, Drm-SK-0, Drm-SK-1, and Drm-SK-2, annotated as drosulfakinins because of their sequence homology with other insect sulfakinin peptides and with the vertebrate hormones of the gastrin/cholecystokinin family. Similar to cholecystokinin in vertebrates, sulfakinins reduce food intake and stimulate muscle contractions in insects (12Wei Z. Baggerman G. Nachman J. Goldsworthy G. Verhaert P., De Loof A. Schoofs L. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 1259-1265Google Scholar). An ion with a fragmentation spectrum corresponding Drm-SK-2 (GGDDQFDDY(SO3H)GHMRF-amide) with a sulfated tyrosine residue was detected. The sNPF gene has not yet been cloned but was found by BLAST analysis (3Vanden Broeck J. Peptides. 2001; 22: 241-254Google Scholar). It encodes four putative peptides. Two of them display sequence similarities with two short NPFs from the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and are annotated as Drm-sNPF1 (AQRSPSLRLRF-amide) and Drm-sNPF2 (WFGDVNKPIRSPSLRLRF-amide). None of these predicted peptides were detected in our mass spectral read-outs. Instead, other peptides derived from the same precursor were detected and sequenced. We annotated the first one, SDPDMLNSIVE, as Drm-sNPF-AP or Drosophila-short NPF-associated peptide, referring to its presence in the same precursor as Drm-sNPF. In its precursor Drm-sNPF-AP is flanked by two dibasic cleavage sites (TableII). It was identified in its non-oxidized form as well as with an oxidized methionine residue. It is unclear whether this is a natural form or whether the oxidation occurred during sample preparation. The second identified peptide originating from this precursor is WFGDVNKPI and corresponds to the first nine amino acids of a Drm-sNPF2. This seems to indicate that the arginine at position 10 acts as a monobasic cleavage site. Therefore we name this novel peptide Drm-sNPF-21–9. The adipokinetic hormone (Akh) gene and the corazonin (Crz) gene display structural similarities suggesting that they have a common evolutionary origin. Adipokinetic hormones (AKH) regulate the release of lipid and carbohydrate energy substrates during flight. Drosophila AKH (13Schaffer M.H. Noyes B.E. Slaughter C.A. Thorne G.C. Gaskell S.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 315-320Google Scholar) is encoded by the Akh gene, which is structurally similar to the three AKH genes in the locust, Locusta migratoria (14Bogerd J. Kooiman F.P. Pijnenburg M.A. Hekking L.H. Oudejans R.C. Van Der Horst D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23038-23043Google Scholar). Although the level of AKH expression in the corpora cardiaca of locusts is extremely high (6Baggerman G. Huybrechts J. Clynen E. Hens K. Harthoorn L. Van der H.D. Poulos C. De Loof A. Schoofs L. Peptides. 2002; : 635-644Google Scholar, 15Oudejans R.C. Mes T.H. Kooiman F.P. Van Der Horst D.J. Peptides. 1993; 14: 877-881Google Scholar), we observed only a weak Drm-AKH signal. No other product from the AKH precursor was found. Corazonin is an insect neuropeptide having cardio-acceleratory as well as pigmentotropic activities (16Veenstra J.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 231-234Google Scholar). The Crz gene was cloned from a genomic library of D. melanogaster. In addition to a putative corazonin, it encodes for a 39-amino acid corazonin-precursor-related peptide (17Veenstra J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 292-296Google Scholar). Our data unequivocally demonstrate the presence of corazonin in the larval CNS, as the fragmentation spectrum of the double-charged ion at 685.3m/z corresponds with the amino acid sequence of corazonin. However, the peptide predicted as corazonin-precursor-related peptide (17Veenstra J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 292-296Google Scholar) could not be detected. Allatostatins are insect neuropeptides that block the synthesis of juvenile hormone (a sesquiterpenoid) synthesis by the corpora allata, two endocrine organs near the insect brain. In Drosophila, three different genes (Ast,Ast2, and MIP) encode putative allatostatins. TheAst gene encodes four putative allatostatins (18Lenz C. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1126-1131Google Scholar). We found two of them in the larval CNS: SRPYSFGL-amide (drostatin 3), which was recently isolated as a ligand for an orphan receptor (19Williamson M. Lenz C. Winther A.M. Nassel D.R. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 124-130Google Scholar), and TTRPQPFNFGL-amide (drostatin 4), which was predicted from the precursor but not yet isolated. In addition, we identified a third peptide, AYMYTNGGPGM, which is contained within the predicted drostatin 2 or Drm-AST-2, which itself was not detected. AYMYTNGGPGM is separated by a dibasic site (KR) from the remaining part of Drm-AST-2 (Table II) suggesting that this typical cleavage site had been overlooked in the prediction study (3Vanden Broeck J. Peptides. 2001; 22: 241-254Google Scholar). AYMYTNGGPGM displays no sequence similarity with any other known peptide. The single peptide, predicted from theAst2 gene was not detected in our MS read-outs. The third allatostin gene, called MIP gene has recently been cloned (19Williamson M. Lenz C. Winther A.M. Nassel D.R. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 124-130Google Scholar) and encodes five putative peptides with sequence similarities to Locusta-MIP (20Schoofs L. Holman G.M. Hayes T.K. Nachman R.J. De Loof A. Regul. Pept. 1991; 36: 111-119Google Scholar). MIPs are neuropeptides with myoinhibiting and allatostatic activities. NoDrosophila-MIP could as yet be isolated. We were able to detect and sequence 2 of the five predicted peptides in the larval CNS extract. Both peptides, AWKSMNVAW-amide (predicted as Drm-MIP-2) and DQWQKLHGGW-amide (predicted as Drm-MIP 5), are amidated, which is in agreement with the C-terminal glycine residues in the precursor (Table II). Cardio acceleratory peptide 2b (CAP2b), first isolated from the tobacco hawkmoth Manduca sexta (21Huesmann G.R. Cheung C.C. Loi P.K. Lee T.D. Swiderek K.M. Tublitz N.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 311-314Google Scholar), displays cardio-acceleratory properties and stimulates Malpighian tubule secretion (22Davies S.A. Stewart E.J. Huesmann G.R. Skaer N.J. Maddrell S.H. Tublitz N.J. Dow J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R823-R827Google Scholar). Querying the Drosophila genome for a gene that encodes for CAP2b-like peptides revealed a peptide precursor gene, which has been cloned (38Kean L. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.E. Dalies S.A. Veenstra J. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: 1297-1307Google Scholar) and which encodes two putative CAP2b-like peptides and one myotropin/pyrokinin peptide (Drm-MT) having a C-terminal FXPRL-amide motif. Myotropins are a family of peptides with members in several insect orders (23Schoofs L. Holman G.M. Paemen L. Veelaert D. Amelinckx M. De Loof A. Peptides. 1993; 14: 409-421Google Scholar, 24Schoofs L. Holman G.M. Hayes T.K. Nachman R.J. De Loof A. Gen. Comp Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 97-104Google Scholar) and in crustaceans (25Torfs P. Nieto J. Cerstiaens A. Boon D. Baggerman G. Poulos C. Waelkens E. Derua R. Calderon J., De Loof A. Schoofs L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 149-154Google Scholar). They have been found to regulate a large number of processes in insects such as oviduct and hindgut contractions, sex pheromone synthesis, egg diapause, melanization, etc. (26Schoofs L. Veelaert D. Vanden Broeck J. De Loof A. Peptides. 1997; 18: 145-156Google Scholar). In theDrosophila CNS we identified two predicted CAP2b-like peptides, namely GANMGLYAFPRV-amide (Drm-CAP-1) and ASGLVAFPRV-amide (Drm-CAP-2). However, we did not find the predicted Drm-MT. We detected in the fruit fly CNS extract a triple-charged peptide ion at 581.3 m/z , whose fragmentation spectrum corresponds to the sequence ofDrosophila leucokinin (NSVVLGKKQRFHSWG-amide). This peptide stimulates secretion in D. melanogaster Malpighian tubules (27Terhzaz S. O'Connell F.C. Pollock V.P. Kean L. Davies S.A. Veenstra J.A. Dow J.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3667-3676Google Scholar). Eight entirely novel peptides were discovered that originate from five not yet annotated genes. Three of the newly discovered peptides originate from the same gene, annotated in the flybase as CG3441. The derived peptide precursor has a structure typical for a neuropeptide precursor (Table II) as the three novel peptides are flanked by consensus processing sites (KR and GKR). The novel peptides are YIGSLRAGGLMTY-amide, NVGTLARDFQLPIPN-amide and SVAALAAQGLLNAPK (Fig. 2 b). Because nothing is as yet known about their possible functions, we named them MTY-amide, IPN-amide, and APK-amide, respectively, according to their final three C-terminal amino acid residues. The precursor was designated as neuropeptide-like precursor 1 (NPLP1) and it encodes nine other putative peptides, all flanked by dibasic cleavage sites. None of these peptides shares sequence homology to a known invertebrate or vertebrate neuropeptide. A fourth novel Drosophila peptide (SVPFKPRL-amide, designated as Drm-MT-2), also detected in this study, has an FXPRL-amide-like C-terminal amino acid sequence, typical for myotropin/pyrokinin peptides. It is not encoded by the myotropin/CAP2b (capability) gene, but by a gene annotated as HUGIN/CG6371 in which it is flanked by consensus processing sites. SVPFKPRL-amide seems to be the only peptide encoded by this precursor gene. The final three novel peptide precursors that we identified (CG13061, CG11051, and CG15361) were designated as neuropeptide-like precursor 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Within these respective precursors, the novel peptides, TKAQGDFNEF (1155.52 Da), SVHGLGPVVI-amide (975.58 Da) and VVSVVPGAISH (1134.65 Da) designated as NEF, VVI-amide, and ISH, are not flanked by typical dibasic cleavage sites. Nevertheless, one of these peptides SVHGLGPVVI-amide is indeed amidated and is, in its precursor, preceded by a lysine residue, which is a possible monobasic cleavage site. Another peptide pQYYYGASPYAYSGGYYDSPYDY (2567.0 Da, designated YDY), encoded in a genomic sequence annotated as CG15361, carries a pyroglutamic acid residue at its N terminus. The enzymes responsible for these modifications are found in the secretory pathway suggesting that these peptides are indeed secreted (28Perone M.J. Castro M.G. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 1179-1188Google Scholar). Furthermore, TargetP quer"

The coordinated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 and dephosphorylation at Thr497activates the enzyme, whereas inhibition results when Thr497 is phosphorylated and Ser1179 is dephosphorylated. We have identified two further phosphorylation sites, at Ser617 and Ser635, by phosphopeptide mapping and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Purified protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates both sites in purified eNOS, whereas purified Akt phosphorylates only Ser617. In bovine aortic endothelial cells, bradykinin (BK), ATP, and vascular endothelial growth factor stimulate phosphorylation of both sites. BK-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser617 is Ca2+-dependent and is partially inhibited by LY294002 and wortmannin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, suggesting signaling via Akt. BK-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser635 is Ca2+-independent and is completely abolished by the PKA inhibitor, KT5720, suggesting signaling via PKA. Activation of PKA with isobutylmethylxanthine also causes Ser635, but not Ser617, phosphorylation. Mimicking phosphorylation at Ser635 by Ser to Asp mutation results in a greater than 2-fold increase in activity of the purified protein, whereas mimicking phosphorylation at Ser617 does not alter maximal activity but significantly increases Ca2+-calmodulin sensitivity. These data show that phosphorylation of both Ser617 and Ser635regulates eNOS activity and contributes to the agonist-stimulated eNOS activation process.

The two most thoroughly studied phosphorylation sites have been the activation site, human Ser1177(bovine Ser1179) in the enzyme's C-terminal tail, and an inhibitory site, human Thr495 (bovine Thr497) located in the calmodulin (CaM)-binding sequence. Phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 reduces the enzyme's Ca2+-dependence (2Chen Z.-P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Protein kinase C signaling acts to increase phosphorylation of Thr497 and decrease phosphorylation of Ser1179, whereas PKA signaling does the reverse (7Michell B.J. Chen Z.-P. Tiganis T. Stapleton D.

Other sites of phosphorylation of eNOS have been reported, including Ser116 in response to shear stress (6Gallis B. Corthals G.L. Goodlett D.R. Ueba H. Kim F. Presnell S.R. Figeys D. Harrison D.G.

Bernhardt M. Smolenski A. Kotsonis P. Fröhlich L.G. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Lohmann S.M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. J. Biol.

We have found that several protein kinases, including protein kinase C and AMP kinase, phosphorylate both Thr497and Ser1179 in vitro, but only one site is accessible to each kinase in endothelial cells. In addition to Ser635, we have now found that PKA also phosphorylates Ser617 in vitro; this latter site is also an Akt target in endothelial cells. Phosphorylation of these sites in response to BK, ATP, and VEGF shows distinct time courses with transient Ser617 phosphorylation and more sustained phosphorylation of Ser635. Ser617 phosphorylation is mediated in part by Akt, whereas Ser635 phosphorylation in response to BK appears to be mediated by PKA. Mutation of the respective phosphorylation sites of eNOS from Ser or Thr to Asp shows that S1179D and S635D mutations increase maximal activity of purified eNOS, whereas a T497D mutation is inhibitory. A S617D eNOS mutant, on the other hand, has a significantly reduced Ca2+-CaM dependence but has a similar maximal activity to that of wild-type eNOS. Recombinant human eNOS (2.5 μm) (7Michell B.J.

GST-Akt was affinity-purified on GSH-Sepharose from HEK-293 cells treated with either 100 μm vanadate or 200 nm wortmannin to prepare either activated (Akt-V) or inhibited (Akt-W) enzyme, respectively (15Alessi D.R.

Rat heart or recombinant eNOS was phosphorylated by PKA in kinase assay buffer containing 250 μm ATP for Western blot analysis or 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/pmol) for phosphopeptide mapping, with either 1 mm EGTA or 100 μm CaCl2 and 1 μm CaM for 1–4 h at 22 °C. Prior to phosphorylation, native eNOS bound to 2′, 5′-ADP-Sepharose was treated with Lambda (λ)-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and washed repeatedly with 0.5 m NaCl and 2% Triton X-100. Tryptic peptides of eNOS gel bands were prepared as described previously (7Michell B.J. Chen Z.-P. Tiganis T. Stapleton D. Katsis F. Power D.A. Sim A.T. Kemp B.E. J. Biol.

The digest was dried, and peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography on a Nucleosil C18 5-μm, 300-Å (1 × 250 mm) column on an AmershamBiosciences SMART system using a linear 60 min, 0–80% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% TFA at 40 μl/min. Phosphopeptides were either separated in two dimensions on thin layer cellulose plates by high voltage electrophoresis (HVE) in the first dimension and ascending chromatography in the second dimension or HVE only (17Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. House C.M. Stapleton D. Dyck J. Gamble J. Ullrich C. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24475-24479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were visualized by phosphorimage analysis. Tryptic peptides were spotted onto the sample stage with α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid. Masses were analyzed using a linear Voyager DE (PerSeptive Biosystems) MALDI-TOF instrument operating in delayed extraction mode. λ-Phosphatase (NEB) was used to dephosphorylate phosphopeptides purified by reversed phase chromatography and native eNOS. Dephosphorylation of eNOS tryptic peptides and protein was performed by incubation with 200 units of λ-phosphatase in phosphatase reaction buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% n-octylglucoside, and 2 mm MnCl2. After 10 min the peptides were desalted by C18-ZipTip chromatography (Millipore, Bedford, MA) into 5 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to spotting on the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry sample stage. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against phosphopeptides based on the amino acid sequence of human eNOS KIRFNpSISCSDPL (Ser615), WRRKRKEpSSNTDSAGALGTLRFC (Ser633), CRIRTQpSFSLQER (Ser1177), and GITRKKpTFKEVANC (Thr495) in rabbits. Rabbits were immunized with phosphopeptides coupled to Keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH) as described previously (2Chen Z.-P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified from serum using the corresponding phosphopeptide affinity columns after preclearing with dephosphopeptide affinity columns. Enzyme-liked immunosorbent assays and Western blot analyses confirmed that the purified antibodies did not recognize dephosphorylated eNOS. The sequences of human and bovine eNOS differ within the Ser615 peptide at p + 1 position with Ile in the human sequence and Val in the bovine sequence, but the phosphospecific antibody recognized both sequences. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were passaged from primary cultures and used for experiments during passages 2–4. Cells were maintained in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% iron-supplemented calf serum, 20 μg/mll-glutamine, 0.6 μg/ml thymidine, 500 international units/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin. Serum-containing medium was replaced by serum-free medium 16 h prior to each experiment. BAECs were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4. Cells were then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmNaF, 1.5 mm Na4P2O7, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. eNOS was partially purified by affinity binding to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose. The phosphorylation status of Ser617 and Ser635 of eNOS was then analyzed by immunoblotting with the phosphospecific antibodies. Construction of a baculovirus pVL1393 plasmid transfer vector containing the wild-type bovine eNOS cDNA was described previously (18Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Arnal J.-F. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14705-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The wild-type construct was used as a template to create point mutations in the eNOS coding sequence by splicing by the overlap extension technique (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). T497D, S617D, S635D, and S1179D mutations were created by replacing the Thr497, Ser617, Ser635, and Ser1179 codons with Asp codons. The sequences of all mutated constructs were confirmed by the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Medical College of Georgia. Mutated DNAs in transfer vector were used to prepare high titer baculovirus stocks in Sf9 insect cells. Wild-type and mutant virus stocks were then used to express and purify the various forms of eNOS protein as described previously (18Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Arnal J.-F. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14705-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Enzymes were purified to >95% homogeneity in buffers containing 2 mmEGTA to remove bound Ca2+-CaM. Activities of purified wild-type and mutant forms of eNOS (1 μg) were assayed by monitoring the rate of conversion of l-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline as previously described (18Venema R.C.

Previously, we observed modest phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt in vitro at an unidentified site (9Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Tiganis T. Bozinovski S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 845-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Here we have identified this site as Ser615 in the human sequence. Recombinant human eNOS (2.5 μm) was phosphorylated by GST-Akt in vitro. Activated GST-Akt was isolated from HEK-293 cell lysates treated with vanadate (100 μm) as described under “Experimental Procedures” (15Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Marmy-Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eNOS with activated GST-Akt (Akt-V) revealed three phosphopeptides (Fig. 1 A). The major spot corresponded to the previously characterized Ser1177 site (results not shown), but the minor spots corresponded to uncharacterized phosphopeptides. The total tryptic phosphopeptides derived from eNOS phosphorylated with either Akt-V (32P incorporation, 123.2 pmol) or Akt-W (32P incorporation, 4 pmol) were subjected to high voltage electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 (V) and 2 (W)). Prior to SDS-PAGE of 32P-phosphorylated eNOS, acrylamide (1%) was added to the sample buffer to form acrylamide adducts (propionamide) of the cysteine residues. Tryptic peptides of eNOS gel bands were separated by reversed phase chromatography and the fractions analyzed by high voltage electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B). Fractions containing 32P-phosphopeptides (fractions 22, 23 and 32, 33) were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Because phosphorylated peptides are 80 mass units larger than unphosphorylated peptides, the spectra were analyzed for 80-unit differences between masses of the tryptic peptides derived from eNOS phosphorylated with either Akt-V or Akt-W. Fraction 33 contained a phosphopeptide of mass 1851.6 present in the tryptic peptides derived from Akt-V-phosphorylated eNOS that was not present in Akt-W-phosphorylated material. The corresponding dephosphopeptide of 1771 mass units was a major peak in fraction 33 of the peptides from Akt-W-phosphorylated eNOS but not the Akt-V-phosphorylated material (Fig 1 B). Phosphate release sequencing of fraction 33 revealed phosphorylation in the third cycle, consistent with a Ser at the third position, whereas in a corresponding Lys-C digest, phosphorylation in the fifth cycle was detected, again consistent with the surrounding sequence, for Ser615, KIRFNS (results not shown). The calculated masses of the theoretical eNOS tryptic peptides were generated using Promac software. The theoretical mass for a human eNOS tryptic peptide FNSISCSDPLVSSWR (613–627) was 1775 units (propionamide cysteine adduct). Because of the apparent 4 mass unit discrepancy with the dephosphorylated peptide (1771 observed versus 1775 expected), we analyzed the corresponding synthetic peptide following phosphorylation. The synthetic peptide YKIRFNSISCSDPLVSSWR (609–627) (2416.6 mass units) cysteine was modified by 1% acrylamide and then subjected to C18-SepPak purification. The modified peptide was phosphorylated, separated from unbound [γ-32P]ATP by C18-SepPak, dried, and digested with trypsin. Two tryptic phosphopeptides, IRFNpSISZSDPLVSSWR (611–627) (2120 mass units) and FNpSISZSDPLVSSWR (613–627) (1851 mass units), where Z represents a propionamide cysteine and pS represents phosphoserine, were produced from the same site. The phosphopeptide map of the synthetic peptide (Fig. 1 D) closely matched the phosphopeptide maps generated by digestion of phosphorylated eNOS protein (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the peptide masses obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry from the synthetic peptide digests (Fig. 1 E) were the same as the masses obtained from digested eNOS, confirming that the 4 mass unit difference was due to instrument error. A phosphopeptide of 1176 mass units was detected in fractions 22 and 23 in the Akt-V digest that was not present in the Akt-W digest. The 1176-unit peptide corresponds to the TQpSFSLQER (1175–1183) phospho-Ser1177 site. The corresponding dephosphopeptide of 1096 mass units, TQSFSLQER, was present as a major peak in fraction 24 from the Akt-W-phosphorylated material and as a minor peak in the Akt-V condition (results not shown). Rat heart eNOS (30 nm) purified by 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose chromatography was treated with λ-phosphatase to dephosphorylate it and ensure greater incorporation of 32P-phosphate. Phosphorylation of eNOS with the PKA catalytic subunit revealed that Ser615 is also a PKA phosphorylation site in vitro, shown by phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 2 A) with phosphopeptides corresponding to 611–627 and 613–627. In addition, another major site of phosphorylation was detected. Recombinant eNOS was used for the phosphorylation site analysis because the phosphopeptide maps were identical to native eNOS. By a combination of phosphopeptide mapping, phosphate release sequencing, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry we found that this site corresponded to the human Ser633 phosphorylation site described previously by Buttet al. (12Butt E. Bernhardt M. Smolenski A. Kotsonis P. Fröhlich L.G. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Lohmann S.M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5179-5187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Reversed phase chromatography fractions from a tryptic digest of human recombinant eNOS phosphorylated by PKA in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2 and 1 μm CaM were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In fraction 23, peptides of 1688 and 1844 mass units (Fig. 2 B) closely matched the theoretical masses of the related Ser633-containing phosphopeptides corresponding to KEpSSNTDSAGALGTLR (631–646) (1687 units) and RKEpSSNTDSAGALGTLR (630–646) (1843 units), respectively. These peptides fit the phosphate release data with a Ser at the third and fourth positions, respectively, and the expected Lys or Arg at the N terminus of the longer peptide resulting from incomplete tryptic digestion (results not shown). The Ser615 peptide FNpSISZSDPLVSSWR (1771 units) and Ser1177 peptide TQpSFSLQER (1175 units) were also present in fractions 32 and 22, respectively (data not shown). To confirm the presence of phosphopeptides, dephosphorylation with λ-phosphatase was performed. eNOS tryptic peptides were incubated with and without λ-phosphatase for 10 min and then ZipTip-purified prior to spotting on the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer sample stage. Dephosphorylation of fraction 23 generated peptides of 1608 and 1764 mass units derived from Ser633 (Fig. 2 B), whereas in fractions 22 and 32, peptides of 1096 and 1770 mass units were generated corresponding to the Ser1177 and Ser615 peptides, respectively (results not shown). Recombinant human eNOS was phosphorylated by PKA and Akt, Akt-V, or Akt-W and analyzed by immunoblotting with antiphosphopeptide antibodies directed against the Ser615, Ser633, and Ser1177 phosphorylation sites, respectively. Blots were also probed with nonphospho-specific anti-eNOS antibody. In eNOS phosphorylated by PKA and Akt-V, the Ser615 and Ser1177 residues were detected, whereas Ser633was only detected in eNOS phosphorylated by PKA, as expected (Fig.3). Because BK is one of the most potent eNOS-activating agonists known, we tested its effects on Ser617 and Ser635 phosphorylation and showed that both sites were phosphorylated in response to BK treatment. BAECs were treated with BK (1 μm) for various times, and cell lysates were prepared. eNOS was partially purified by affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and immunoblotted with the corresponding antiphosphopeptide-specific antibodies. In most experiments, no basal phosphorylation of either site was detected. However, BK stimulated a rapid and transient increase in Ser617 phosphorylation between 1 and 2.5 min (Fig.4 A). In contrast, Ser635 phosphorylation was delayed; phosphorylation appeared at 2.5 min and was maintained at maximal levels between 5 and 30 min (Fig. 4 B). In this and all other experiments with BAECs described in this study, the lack of effects of treatment on amounts of total eNOS was confirmed by immunoblotting with nonphospho-specific anti-eNOS antibody (Fig. 4 C). To determine whether other G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, such as ATP, have a similar effect to BK on eNOS phosphorylation, BAECs were incubated with ATP (10 μm) for various times, and eNOS phosphorylation was analyzed. An almost identical eNOS phosphorylation pattern was shown for Ser617, whereas Ser635phosphorylation was comparatively delayed; Ser635phosphorylation peaked at 15 min and was maintained for 60 min (the longest time tested) (Fig. 5).Figure 5ATP stimulation of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser617 and Ser635 in BAECs. BAECs were treated with ATP (10 μm) for the times indicated, and cells were lysed. eNOS was then partially purified by affinity binding to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and immunoblotted (IB) with antiphospho-Ser617 eNOS antibody (A)antiphospho-Ser635 eNOS antibody (B), and nonphospho-specific anti-eNOS antibody (C). Similar results were obtained in three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also examined the effects of VEGF stimulation on phosphorylation of Ser617 and Ser635. BAECs were treated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for various times, and eNOS phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting. VEGF stimulated a transient phosphorylation of Ser617 between 2.5 and 10 min, a slightly delayed onset compared with BK signaling, whereas phosphorylation of Ser635 was maintained at maximal levels between 10 and 30 min (Fig. 6), similar to that observed with BK. Previously we showed that Akt is activated by BK stimulation of endothelial cells (14Harris M.B., Ju, H. Venema V.J. Liang H. Zou R. Michell B.J. Chen Z.-P. Kemp B.E. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16587-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To determine whether BK-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser617 or Ser635 involves Akt, we tested the effects of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, (20Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on phosphorylation. Incubation of BAECs with LY294002 (20 μm) for 30 min partially suppressed Ser617phosphorylation in response to BK (1 μm), indicating that Akt phosphorylates this site in response to BK treatment (Fig.7). In contrast, LY294002 had no effect on BK-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser635 (data not shown). Similar results to those shown for LY294002 were also obtained with a structurally distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (21Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) (not shown). Because Akt is not the protein kinase responsible for BK-stimulated Ser635phosphorylation in BAECs, we tested the effects of PKA activation. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX (isobutylmethylxanthine), prevents the conversion of cAMP to AMP, leading to accumulation of cAMP and PKA activation. Incubation of BAEC with IBMX (300 μm) stimulated phosphorylation of Ser635 only slightly from 5 min but reached a maximum after 60 min. In contrast, IBMX treatment did not result in phosphorylation at Ser617between 1 and 60 min (Fig. 8). To confirm the involvement of PKA in BK signaling to Ser635, we tested the effect of the PKA inhibitor, KT5720 (22Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Sato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). BAECs were treated with BK (1 μm) for various times with and without pretreatment with KT5720 (500 nm for 30 min). KT5720 completely blocked BK-stimulated Ser635 phosphorylation, consistent with PKA mediating the BK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser635 (Fig. 9). KT5720 had no effect on BK-stimulated Ser617 phosphorylation (data not shown).Figure 9Effects of KT5720 on BK-stimulation of eNOS phosphorylation at Ser635 in BAECs. BAECs were treated with BK (1 μm) for the times indicated following either pretreatment or no pretreatment (Control) with KT5720 (500 nm for 30 min). eNOS was partially purified by affinity binding to 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and immunoblotted (IB) with antiphospho-Ser635 eNOS antibody (A andB) and nonphospho-specific anti-eNOS antibody (C). Results shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 is Ca2+-independent (23Montagnani M. Chen H. Barr V.A. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30392-30398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To examine whether phosphorylation of Ser617 or Ser635 is Ca2+-dependent or -independent, we utilized the intra- and extracellular Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM (10 μm for 30 min) prior to stimulation with BK (1 μm) for various times. Phosphorylation was analyzed as before. As shown in Fig.10, BAPTA-AM completely blocked BK-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser617. In contrast, no effect of BAPTA-AM on Ser635 phosphorylation was observed (data not shown). The effects of phosphorylation of a Ser or Thr residue on activity of an enzyme can be mimicked by mutation of the uncharged Ser or Thr to a negatively charged Asp where the effects of phosphorylation on enzyme conformation and activity are mainly due to the introduction of a negatively charged group. For example, an ∼2-fold increase in eNOS activity due to phosphorylation at Ser1179 has previously been shown to be mimicked by creation of a S1179D mutation (3McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J.

To determine the effects of phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser617 and Ser635 on eNOS catalytic activity and Ca2+-CaM-dependence, we expressed and purified wild-type eNOS, and Ser617 → Asp (S617D) and Ser635 → Asp (S635D) mutants of eNOS from a baculovirus expression system by procedures described previously (18Venema R.C.

Enzymes were purified to >95% homogeneity in buffers containing 2 mm EGTA to remove bound Ca2+-CaM. The activities of equal quantities of equally purified wild-type and mutant forms of eNOS were then determined by monitoring the rate of conversion of l-[14C]arginine tol-[14C]citrulline in the presence of excess cofactors and CaCl2 (2 mm) and in the presence of either no CaM or increasing concentrations of exogenously added CaM. As shown in Fig. 11 A, mimicking phosphorylation of Ser635 resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in eNOS activity at saturating concentrations of Ca2+-CaM, as well as a small increase in Ca2+-CaM sensitivity. Mimicking phosphorylation of Ser617, in contrast, increased Ca2+-CaM sensitivity but did not significantly affect maximal eNOS activity. Mutation of Ser1179 increased both Ca2+-CaM sensitivity and maximal activity (Fig. 11 B), as has been shown previously with cell lysates from cells transfected with this mutant (4Fulton D.

The relative Ca2+-CaM sensitivities of wild-type and phosphomimetic forms of eNOS were also assessed under conditions in which suboptimal Ca2+-CaM concentrations were produced by the combination of excess CaM (2 units/μl) and limiting concentrations of Ca2+. When wild-type eNOS was assayed in the presence of EGTA (2 μm)-buffered CaCl2 (1 μm), the enzyme possessed only 20% of the catalytic activity detected in the absence of EGTA (data not shown). Equal quantities of wild-type and mutant forms of eNOS were therefore assayed under these conditions of limiting Ca2+, and relative activities were compared. As shown in Fig.12, significant differences in Ca2+-CaM sensitivities were observed for the S617D, S1179D, and T497D phosphomimetics. These results further confirm that phosphorylation of Ser617 and Ser1179 increases the Ca2+-CaM sensitivity of eNOS and that Thr497 phosphorylation decreases Ca2+-CaM sensitivity. In this study, we have identified two novel phosphorylation sites, human Ser615 and Ser633(equivalent to bovine Ser617 and Ser635), in the putative “CaM autoinhibitory sequence (586–641)” within the FMN binding domain of eNOS. This sequence is proposed to retain eNOS in an inhibited state that is reversed upon CaM binding (26Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J.

Based on these observations, phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of Ser635 or Ser617 might influence the interaction of the insert sequence with the CaM-binding domain, thereby regulating the autoinhibition of eNOS. A similar insert is present in neuronal NOS but is not shared with inducible NOS. However, the insert from neuronal NOS lacks the RRKRK motif thought to be important for autoinhibition in eNOS (26Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P.

Butt et al. (12Butt E. Bernhardt M. Smolenski A. Kotsonis P. Fröhlich L.G. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Lohmann S.M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. J. Biol.

Previous studies with a S635A mutant showed that this site is not responsible for Akt-dependent activation of eNOS (4Fulton D. Gratton J.-P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser617 and Ser635 residues of eNOS have distinct roles in the overall agonist-stimulated eNOS activation process. This process appears to involve multiple phosphorylation events as well as changes in eNOS protein-protein interactions (1Fulton D. Gratton J.-P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 818-824PubMed Google Scholar). In the initial stage of eNOS activation, Ser617 is phosphorylated, rendering eNOS significantly more susceptible to activation by Ca2+-CaM. Subsequently, Ser635 is phosphorylated, increasing eNOS maximal activity to an extent equal to that produced by phosphorylation of Ser1179. We and others (28Fleming I. Hecker M. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1220-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Marrero M.B. Venema V.J., Ju, H., He, H. Liang H. Caldwell R.B. Venema R.C. Biochem.

Ser635 phosphorylation may be responsible for the longer term potentiation of eNOS activation that persists beyond peak activation.

https://openalex.org/W1964320907,"Origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins serve as a landing pad for the assembly of a multiprotein prereplicative complex, which is required to initiate DNA replication. During mitosis, the smallest subunit of human ORC, Orc6, localizes to kinetochores and to a reticular-like structure around the cell periphery. As chromosomes segregate during anaphase, the reticular structures align along the plane of cell division and some Orc6 localizes to the midbody before cells separate. Silencing of Orc6 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in cells with multipolar spindles, aberrant mitosis, formation of multinucleated cells, and decreased DNA replication. Prolonged periods of Orc6 depletion caused a decrease in cell proliferation and increased cell death. These results implicate Orc6 as an essential gene that coordinates chromosome replication and segregation with cytokinesis."

The media, prepared by colloidal templating, trap the macromolecules within a two-dimensional array of spherical cavities interconnected by circular holes. Across a broad DNA size range, diffusion does not proceed by the familiar mechanisms of reptation or sieving. Rather, because of their inherent flexibility, DNA molecules strongly localize in cavities and only sporadically “jump” through holes. Jumping closely follows Poisson statistics. By reducing DNA's configurational freedom, the holes act as molecular weight–dependent entropic barriers. Sterically constrained macromolecular diffusion underlies many separation methods and assumes an important role in intracellular and extracellular transport."

Inactivation of TOR function by rapamycin or nutrient exhaustion is accompanied by triggering various cellular mechanisms aimed at overcoming the nutrient stress. Here we report that inSaccharomyces cerevisiae the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is regulated by TOR function because upon specific Tor1 and Tor2 inhibition by rapamycin, Mpk1 is activated rapidly in a process mediated by Sit4 and Tap42. Osmotic stabilization of the plasma membrane prevents both Mpk1 activation by rapamycin and the growth defect that occurs upon the simultaneous absence of Tor1 and Mpk1 function, suggesting that, at least partially, TOR inhibition is sensed by the PKC pathway at the cell envelope. This process involves activation of cell surface sensors, Rom2, and downstream elements of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Rapamycin also induces depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton through the TOR proteins, Sit4 and Tap42, in an osmotically suppressible manner. Finally, we show that entry into stationary phase, a physiological situation of nutrient depletion, also leads to the activation of the PKC pathway, and we provide further evidence demonstrating that Mpk1 is essential for viability once cells enter G0.

FK506-binding protein glutathione S-transferase mitogen-activated protein kinase protein kinase C Rapamycin is an antibiotic macrolide, with a strong antiproliferative action in eukaryotic cells. Its target is FK506-binding protein (FKBP)112, a small protein belonging to the FKBP family of peptidylprolyl isomerases (1Harding M.W. Galat A. Uehling D.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1989; 341: 758-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 2Siekierka J.J. Hung S.H. Poe M. Lin C.S. Sigal N.H. Nature. 1989; 341: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). An FKBP12-rapamycin complex is able to bind the TOR proteins (target of rapamycin, also known as FRAP, RAFT, RAPT, or mTOR (3Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar)) and to block TOR signaling to downstream effectors. The TOR proteins are members of the phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase family, and despite displaying significant homology to lipid kinases (4Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), they have been shown to be Ser/Thr protein kinases (5Alarcon C.M. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2531-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, the TOR proteins promote association between the Sit4 and Tap42 proteins under favorable nutrient conditions (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Two other 2A protein phosphatases, Pph21p and Pph22p, also associate with Tap42 in a TOR-dependent rapamycin-sensitive manner (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The SIT4 gene codes for a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase closely related to the protein phosphatase 2A family (7Arndt K.T. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Doseff A.I. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 141: 857-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and displays a high level of identity to human protein phosphatase 6. Tap42 shows sequence homology to the mammalian α4 protein, which in turn is able to associate with protein phosphatase 6 (9Murata K., Wu, J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Tap42 can be phosphorylated directly by TOR, and this phosphorylation increases Tap42 affinity for the phosphatases (11Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, inhibition of TOR function by rapamycin results in dissociation of the Sit4-Tap42 complex (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and in cellular responses similar to those exhibited in nutrient-starved cells. These include down-regulation of translation initiation (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), repression of ribosome biogenesis (12Powers T. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), cell cycle arrest (13Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), induction of autophagy (14Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), and acquisition of thermotolerance (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Both TOR and the Tap42-phosphatase complex are also involved in the repression of the starvation transcriptional program (15Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C., Di Como C.J. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 16Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), which is achieved by preventing the nuclear translocation of specific transcription factors (17Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), and in the Tap42-mediated stabilization of amino acid permeases (18Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recently, TOR signaling has been shown to control autophagy via an Apg1 protein kinase complex, although Tap42 has been proposed not to be involved in this specific signaling (19Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Thus, most of TOR cellular functions imply the regulation of the Tap42-phosphatase complexes. Based on correlations established between the Sit4-Tap42 association state and the phosphorylation of downstream effectors, it has been proposed that Tap42 may inhibit Sit4 phosphatase activity (17Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 18Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), although no direct target of the phosphatase has been described yet. The TOR genes were originally identified in yeast by the fact that certain mutations in them conferred resistance to growth inhibition by rapamycin (3Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). The two yeast Tor proteins termed Tor1 and Tor2, can bind to the FKBP12 homolog (Fpr1)-rapamycin complex in budding yeast. TOR1 and TOR2 display a high degree of sequence homology. However, although both regulate the Sit4-Tap42 complex in response to nutrients, TOR2 plays an additional essential function that is not shared by TOR1(20Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The TOR2 essential function has been related to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (21Schmidt A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13780-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A temperature-sensitivetor2ts mutant displays lower activity levels of the GTPase exchange factor Rom2 (18Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which in turn is needed to activate the essential Rho1 small GTPase (22Bickle M. Delley P.A. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2235-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Growth and actin polarization defects of tor2ts alleles are rescued by high copy expression of Rho1 or any of the members of the protein kinase C (PKC)/cell integrity pathway (23Helliwell S.B. Schmidt A. Ohya Y. Hall M.N. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1211-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as by cell wall damage-mediated activation of the pathway (22Bickle M. Delley P.A. Schmidt A. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2235-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The PKC pathway has been proposed to maintain cell integrity by monitoring the cell wall state (for a recent review, see 24). It is accepted that the PKC pathway senses cell wall damage and plasma membrane stress through Mid2 (25Rajavel M. Philip B. Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the Wsc family of cell surface sensors (26Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13804-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), which would directly transmit the signal to Rom2 and Rho1 (27Philip B. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Among other targets, Rho1 can directly up-regulate the glucan synthase machinery (28Mazur P. Baginsky W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14604-14609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and is also needed to stimulate Pkc1 protein kinase activity allosterically (29Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9193-9196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In turn, Pkc1 activates a module of MAPKs, constituted by MAPKKK (MAPK kinase kinase) Bck1, the redundant MAPKKs (MAPK kinases) Mkk1 and Mkk2, and MAPK Mpk1/Slt2. Mpk1 is phosphorylated on both Thr190 and Tyr192residues, thus causing a conformational switch that results in its activation (30Lee K.S. Irie K. Gotoh Y. Watanabe Y. Araki H. Nishida E. Matsumoto K.

Genetics. 1997; 146: 263-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown recently that deletion of the SIT4 protein phosphatase gene leads to an increase in the activity of the PKC/MAPK cell integrity pathway (33de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Torres J. Ariño J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sit4 is also involved in mediating rapamycin-sensitive TOR signaling by its association with Tap42 in response to nutrients (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The involvement of SIT4 in the regulation of both pathways prompted us to investigate the possible link between rapamycin signaling and the cell integrity pathway. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate procedure (34Gietz D., St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H.

Chemoluminescent detection was performed using the Supersignal Substrate (Pierce) in a Lumi-Imager equipment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, centrifuged at 3,000 rpm 5 min, and fixed overnight in phosphate-buffered saline plus 4% formaldehyde. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mmethanolamine, and once more with phosphate-buffered saline.

Cells were stained for at least 2 h in the dark and washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline before resuspending in mounting solution. All centrifugations were performed at 3,000 rpm. To test whether rapamycin had any effect on the activity of the PKC pathway, we performed Western blot analysis of total cell extracts using anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibodies. These antibodies specifically recognize the doubly phosphorylated form of Mpk1 and allow accurate monitoring of Mpk1 activity (26Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13804-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 39Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Rapamycin was added to wild type cultures growing exponentially at 25 °C in rich medium (YPD), and samples were taken at the indicated times (Fig.1 A). We observed a very rapid increase in the amount of the active Mpk1 form in response to rapamycin, already detectable after 15 min of treatment. Maximum levels of Mpk1 activity were reached after 45 min and remained high for the duration of the experiment (60 min). The induction of Mpk1 activity was not the result of an increase in the Mpk1 protein levels, which remained constant throughout the experiment (Fig. 1 A), as observed after probing the same extracts with anti-Mpk1 polyclonal antibodies. Two related MAPKs, Fus3 and Kss1, are also recognized in their active, doubly phosphorylated state by the same antibody (43Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2887-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 44Sabbagh Jr., W. Flatauer L.J. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, no significant change in their activity was detected after the addition of rapamycin (Fig. 1, A and B). The latter suggests that rapamycin-mediated MAPK activation is specific for Mpk1. The transcripts up-regulated by Mpk1 activation have been described recently using whole-genome approaches and comprise mostly cell wall and stress-responsive genes (45Jung U.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The induction of all of them is expected to occur under any stress that activates Mpk1, including rapamycin treatment. To check the validity of this hypothesis, we carried out an in silico study of the behavior of Mpk1-regulated genes under different environmental perturbations that either induce or do not affect Mpk1 activity. Data on Mpk1-regulated genes was extracted from previously published works (40Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar) and plotted as a function of time (Fig. 1 C). As expected, Mpk1-regulated genes are induced by heat shock and hypotonic shock, situations that give rise to Mpk1 activation, but not by hydrogen peroxide or menadione treatment (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). In a further step, we carried out an analogous study on other published data (16Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) to check whether the same group of genes was also induced upon rapamycin treatment. As shown in Fig. 1 C, expression of Mpk1-regulated genes is induced by rapamycin treatment in a fashion that correlates with the increase in Mpk1 activity (Fig. 1, A andC), although different concentrations of the inhibitor were used in each experiment. Overall, these observations evidence that the pattern of Mpk1-regulated gene expression serves as a good marker of Mpk1 activity. Moreover, because all of those genes are up-regulated by rapamycin, it shows that the signal from rapamycin to Mpk1 is transmitted to substrates downstream from this kinase, leading to the transcriptional induction of Mpk1-regulated genes. The TOR proteins have been proposed to be central sensors of the quality of carbon and nitrogen sources (46Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and rapamycin has been reported to cause effects similar to those exhibited by nutrient-starved cells. Besides, cells in stationary phase display phenotypes similar to those caused by rapamycin (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that cells entering stationary phase could also induce Mpk1 activity, as observed when TOR proteins are blocked by rapamycin (Fig.1 A). Wild type cells were inoculated in fresh minimal medium, and samples were collected at the times indicated. As shown in Fig. 1 D, Mpk1 became strongly activated as cells progressively entered into stationary phase (2–4 days) and became less active at later time points. The increase in Mpk1 activity was not caused by changes in the levels of the Mpk1 protein, as checked with anti-Mpk1 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, although entry into stationary phase does not affect viability in wild type cultures, mpk1Δ mutant cells rapidly lost viability upon exit from exponential growth (Fig. 1 E). In a genomewide screen for genes whose deletion results in alterations on the growth response to rapamycin, it has been reported that both MPK1and SWI6 (whose product is a Mpk1 target) confer rapamycin hypersensitivity when deleted (47Chan T.F. Carvalho J. Riles L. Zheng X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Other authors have shown recently that an intact PKC pathway is needed to maintain viability upon nutritional deprivation (48Krause S.A. Gray J.V. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 588-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results, together with ours, suggest that Mpk1 activation, and the subsequent induction of its target genes, is essential for cells to remain viable once they enter stationary phase or are treated with rapamycin. To prove the direct involvement of members of the TOR pathway in mediating rapamycin signaling to Mpk1, we checked the behavior of rapamycin-resistant TOR mutants.TOR1-1 and TOR2-1 bear, respectively, chromosomal alleles of TOR1 and TOR2 which are insensitive to the immunosuppressant drug because their products cannot interact with the Fpr1-rapamycin complex. The JK9-3da wild type strain induced Mpk1 phosphorylation with kinetics identical to those of the CML128 wild type strain used above (Figs. 1 A and2 A). However TOR1-1cells displayed no change in Mpk1 activity in response to rapamycin treatment, whereas in TOR2-1 cells a mild activation was still detected (Fig. 2 A). The results clearly indicate that Tor1 inhibition mediated by rapamycin signals to Mpk1 inducing its activity. Therefore, activation of the MAPK is not the result of a direct cell wall damage effect caused by rapamycin. We hypothesized that the slight Mpk1 activation still observed in TOR2-1cells could be the result of the rapamycin-mediated blockage of a fully inhibitable Tor1 protein. Thus, inhibition of Tor2 in wild type cells could still contribute to rapamycin signaling to Mpk1. Support for this hypothesis is the observation that Fpr1-rapamycin binding to Tor1 occurs at 10-fold lower rapamycin concentrations compared with those necessary to bind to Tor2 (49Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27531-27537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); hence, the inhibitory complex has more affinity for Tor1 than for Tor2. To test whether Tor2 inhibition by rapamycin is also involved in the induction of the PKC pathway, we deleted the TOR1 gene in both the wild type and the TOR2-1 strains, and the levels of Mpk1 activation were checked in the single and double mutants. Thetor1Δ mutant displayed activation of Mpk1 in response to rapamycin treatment (Fig. 2 A), although the induction was less pronounced than in wild type cells. This result clearly indicates that in these conditions Tor2 inhibition by rapamycin mediates induction of Mpk1 activity. Furthermore, no increase in the activation of the MAPK was detectable in tor1Δ TOR2-1 double mutant cells after addition of the drug (Fig. 2 A). In light of these results, we propose that either Tor1 or Tor2 inhibition by rapamycin can mediate Mpk1 activation. Interestingly,tor1Δ mutant cells, which may be compromised for TOR function (because they rely on the single TOR2 gene), displayed higher levels of both basal and induced Mpk1 activity than wild type cells, which suggests that partial elimination of TOR function leads to a constitutive increased activation of Mpk1 (as rapamycin does). Taken together, these data show that a block in TOR function may act by up-regulating the PKC pathway. An active TOR pathway promotes the association of the Tap42 subunit with the protein phosphatase 2A and Sit4 (6Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Go"

Accumulating evidence suggests that the hydrolytic mechanism involves substrate-assisted catalysis wherein the 2-acetamido substituent acts as a nucleophile to form an oxazolinium ion intermediate. The role of a conserved aspartate residue (D313) in the active site ofSpHex was investigated through kinetic and structural analyses of two variant enzymes, D313A and D313N. Three-dimensional structures of the wild-type and variant enzymes in product complexes with N-acetyl-d-glucosamine revealed substantial differences. In the D313A variant the 2-acetamido group was found in two conformations of which only one is able to aid in catalysis through anchimeric assistance. The mutation D313N results in a steric clash in the active site between Asn-313 and the 2-acetamido group preventing the 2-acetamido group from providing anchimeric assistance, consistent with the large reduction in catalytic efficiency and the insensitivity of this variant to chemical rescue. By comparison, the D313A mutation results in a shift in a shift in the pH optimum and a modest decrease in activity that can be rescued by using azide as an exogenous nucleophile. These structural and kinetic data provide evidence that Asp-313 stabilizes the transition states flanking the oxazoline intermediate and also assists to correctly orient the 2-acetamido group for catalysis. Based on analogous conserved residues in the family 18 chitinases and family 56 hyaluronidases, the roles played by the Asp-313 residue is likely general for all hexosaminidases using a mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis.

N-Acetyl-β-hexosaminides are common in nature and are found in molecules such as chitin, which forms the exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects, in glycosaminoglycans that populate the extracellular matrix, and as an essential component of the carbohydrate structure of glycoproteins and glycolipids. There is considerable interest in the mechanism ofN-acetyl-β-hexosaminidases because of their importance in human disease (3Mahuran D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 105-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), biotechnology, and the control of fungal and insect pests (4Cohen E. Pest Manag. Sci. 2001; 57: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Glycosidases can catalyze the cleavage of the glycosidic bond with one of two possible stereochemical outcomes, retention or inversion of stereochemistry at the anomeric center (5Davies G.

Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) have classified the glycosidases into more than 84 families on the basis of similarity in their primary sequences. All enzymes within a family catalyze the hydrolysis of substrates having the same anomeric stereochemistry, and they do so with the same stereochemical outcome. Henrissat has proposed a further classification where families lacking significant sequence similarity but having similar three-dimensional structures are assigned to the same clan (10Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). According to this classification scheme, SpHex belongs to family 20 and thus to clan GH-K. Product analysis studies on family 20 enzymes have demonstrated that members of this family execute hydrolysis with a net retention of stereochemistry (11Lai E.C. Withers S.G.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) catalyze the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond through a mechanism that is thought to involve substrate-assisted catalysis (Fig.1). In this reaction, a strategically located carboxylic acid group provides general acid catalysis to the glycosidic oxygen of the bound, distorted substrate in order to facilitate the cleavage of the glycosidic linkage. As the glycosidic bond is breaking, the anomeric carbon migrates toward the oxygen atom of the 2-acetamido group of the substrate, which acts as a waiting nucleophile to accept the electrophilic anomeric center, thereby forming an oxazolinium ion intermediate. This intermediate is then hydrolyzed in a process that is the near microscopic reverse of the first step. Ring opening of the high energy oxazolinium ion intermediate results in the electrophilic migration of the anomeric carbon to a water molecule. The nucleophilicity of this water molecule is enhanced by the now deprotonated carboxylate residue that acts as a general base. The two transition states flanking the intermediate (Fig.1; I and II) are believed to have considerable oxocarbenium ion character. Convincing structural evidence in support of this proposed mechanism has accumulated through the elucidation of a number of crystal structures of family 20 β-hexosaminidases including those of the native enzyme (16Mark B.L.

In the case of the Michaelis complex formed between chitobiose and theSerratia marcescens chitobiase (SmCHB), the substrate was seen bound in the −1 and +1 subsites with the −1 saccharide modeled in a 1 S 3conformation with distinct electron density noted for its 2-acetamido moiety. This density was interpreted as showing the amide carbonyl to be poised for nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon. The crystal structure of SpHex in complex with a stable analog of the reaction intermediate, NAG-thiazoline, provides convincing evidence for a mechanism involving anchimeric assistance (16Mark B.L.

In this data set unambiguous electron density was seen for the NAG-thiazoline and revealed the saccharide moiety in a4 C 1 conformation with an aspartate residue (Asp-313) forming a short hydrogen bond (2.5 Å) to the nitrogen of the thiazoline ring. Most recently, a structure ofSpHex in complex with GalNAc-isofagomine was determined to 1.75 Å resolution (20Mark B.L. Vocadlo D.J. Zhao D. Knapp S. Withers S.G. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42131-42137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This inhibitor has a nitrogen in place of carbon at the anomeric center. In the structure of the complex, the carbonyl of the 2-acetamido moiety was directed at the piperidine nitrogen. The piperidine ring of the inhibitor adopted a conformation intermediate between a 4 E envelope and a4 C 1 chair, with a proton shared between the piperidine nitrogen and the acid/base in a 2.8 Å hydrogen bond. Collectively, these structural data reveal that the family 20 enzymes carefully control the orientation of the 2-acetamido group of the substrate through a number of interactions. They are also consistent with an electrophilic migration mechanism that has been proposed to operate for all retaining hexopyranosidases (21Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Laine R. Withers S.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent evidence has accumulated that another set of retaining β-hexosaminidases, those from family 3, proceed through a somewhat different mechanism. These enzymes are also believed to proceed by an electrophilic migration mechanism like most retaining glycosidases, but one which involves the participation of an enzymic nucleophile as originally postulated by Koshland (22Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (808) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves two suitably positioned carboxyl-containing residues, with one acting as a general acid/base catalyst in the same manner as the acid/base residue of the family 20 β-hexosaminidases. The second carboxyl group acts as the catalytic nucleophile to form a covalent glycosyl enzyme. It appears that the identity of the nucleophile is the major distinction between the mechanisms of the family 20 enzymes, where the nucleophile is the 2-acetamido group of the substrate, and the family 3 enzymes, where the nucleophile is an enzymic carboxylate. Evidence for the covalency of the glycosyl enzyme intermediate in the mechanism of the family 3 β-hexosaminidases was obtained with theVibrio furnisii N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase through studies with the slow substrate,N-acetyl-5-fluoro-α-l-idopyranosaminyl fluoride. Vocadlo et al. (23Vocadlo D.J. Mayer C., He, S. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) showed that incubation of this substrate with the enzyme afforded a steady-state amount of the glycosyl enzyme that could be detected by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry. Proteolysis of the covalently labeled enzyme and tandem mass spectrometric analysis of the labeled peptide enabled identification of the nucleophilic residue. Very recently, Vocadloet al. have provided strong evidence that hen egg-white lysozyme, a member of family 22 of the glycoside hydrolases that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage of the NAG-NAM peptidoglycan repeat, also proceeds through a mechanism involving a glycosyl enzyme intermediate (21Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Laine R. Withers S.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). This has allowed the generalization of a catalytic mechanism involving covalent participation of a nucleophile and electrophilic migration for all retaining β-hexopyranosidases (21Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Laine R. Withers S.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In the case of the family 20 SpHex, there remain significant questions as to how this enzyme achieves its catalytic prowess. While convincing evidence for the identity and role of the acid/base residue has been supplied through crystallographic studies and analysis of variants, the role of other active site residues remains indistinct. In particular, a highly conserved aspartate residue immediately preceding the acid/base residue has been found to be of varying importance in catalysis (Fig. 2) (24Hou Y. Vocadlo D.J. Leung A. Withers S.G. Mahuran D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Prag G. Papanikolau Y. Tavlas G. Vorgias C.E. Petratos K. Oppenheim A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional structure of SpHex with NAG-thiazoline described above, this residue (Asp-313) was shown to be in close proximity to the thiazoline nitrogen atom (2.5 Å) and a Coloumbic interaction was proposed to provide stabilization of the positively charged oxazolinium ring during the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (16Mark B.L. Vocadlo D.J. Knapp S. Triggs-Raine B.L. Withers S.G. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10330-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The environment surrounding Asp-313 ensures that the carboxyl group of Asp-313 bears a negative charge and remains properly positioned thoughout catalysis. In particular, Oδ1 of Asp-313 shares a proton with the carboxyl group of Asp-246 through a short 2.5 Å hydrogen bond so that Oδ2 of Asp-313 remains well positioned to stabilize the positive charge that develops upon cyclization of the substrate. Additionally, a role for this residue in distortion of the substrate to direct the 2-acetamido group toward the anomeric carbon has also been suggested. The obvious importance of Asp-313 for the activity of family 20 hexosaminidases prompted us to describe our own studies into the role played by this residue in a structurally defined system. The D313A and D313N variants of SpHex were constructed and expressed, and it is shown here that these substitutions have substantially different effects on the activities of the two variant enzymes compared with each other and to the wild-type enzyme. We have examined the activity of one of these variants in the presence of external nucleophiles and have observed significant chemical rescue of enzymatic activity. In addition, we have determined x-ray crystal structures of the wild-type enzyme and the two variants in complex with the reaction product,N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (NAG). The complex with wild-type SpHex is the first example of a product complex for a family 20 enzyme and, with other studies, permits a structural description of every stable species along the reaction coordinate throughout the course of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Moreover, the structures of the D313N and D313A variant enzymes in complex with NAG reveal the importance of Asp-313 in controlling both the conformation of the saccharide residue bound in the −1 subsite and the orientation of the 2-acetamido group. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Nucleic Acid and Peptide Service Unit at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs or Invitrogen. T4 DNA ligase and Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used for all extension and polymerase chain reactions. Plasmid minipreps were performed using the Promega Wizard kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purifications of His7-tagged proteins were performed using affinity chromatography on NiNTA agarose resin (Qiagen) as described by Mark et al. (16Mark B.L. Vocadlo D.J. Knapp S. Triggs-Raine B.L. Withers S.G. James M.N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10330-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The construction of the plasmid p3AHEX-1.8, which was created from insertion of the SpHex gene into a pET3a vector with an N-terminal His7-tag, has been described previously (2Mark B.L. Wasney G.A. Salo T.J. Khan A.R. Cao Z. Robbins P.W. James M.N.G. Triggs-Raine B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19618-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). p3AHEX-1.8 was modified by site-directed mutagenesis using a four primer cassette strategy to introduce the requisite substitution and a neighboring silent KpnI restriction site. PCR amplifications were performed using p3AHEX-1.8 as template and the following pairs of oligonucleotides (restriction sites indicated in bold, mutated residues are underlined); reaction 1: 5′-GTGGCGCCCCCGCTGTACACCG-3′ and 5′-GCGTGGAGTGCGCCTCTGCGCCGCCGATGTGGAGGTACCGGCCGGGGGTGAGCGC-3′; reaction 2: 5′-GTGGCGCCCCCGCTGTACACCG-3′ and 5′-GCGTGGAGTGCGCCTCATTGCCGCCGATGTGGAGGTACCGGCCGGGGGTGAGCGC-3′; reaction 3: 5′-GAGCGCGCCCTCGACCGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCACCCCCGGCCGGTACCTCCACATCGGCGGCGCAGAGGCGCACTCCACGC-3′; reaction 4: 5′-GAGCGCGCCCTCGACCGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCACCCCCGGCCGGTACCTCCACATCGGCGGCAATGAGGCGCACTCCACGC-3′. The product from each PCR was purified using QiaexII beads (Qiagen). The purified products from a pair of reactions (reactions 1 and 3 and reactions 2 and 4) were combined and subjected to five thermal cycles in a reaction mixture containing dNTPs withPwo polymerase. A portion of each reaction mixture containing the PCR product was used as the template for a PCR amplification using the flanking primers 5′-GTGGCGCCCCCGCTGTACACCG-3′ and 5′-GAGCGCGCCCTCGACCGGTTCC-3′. The 300-bp products were separated by electrophoresis in 3% agarose gel, excised from the gel, and then purified with QiaexII. The purified, blunt-ended PCR product was ligated into pCR-Blunt, according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Zero Blunt PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen) and the insert confirmed by sequencing. The resulting product was digested withAgeI and BsrGI and ligated into a similarly digested sample of p3AHEX-1.8. After transformation intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue, plasmid minipreps were screened for the correct insert using KpnI to confirm the presence of the unique silent mutation to afford the two desired variants, p3AHEX-1.8D313A and p3AHEX-1.8D313N. E. coli BL21DE3 cells containing the variant plasmid were grown to log-phase (OD600 0.5–0.6) at 37 °C in 2YT media containing 100 mg liter−1 ampicillin with vigorous shaking. The culture was allowed to cool to 25 °C and protein production induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. The culture was allowed to grow overnight at 25 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation and subjected to mechanical lysis using a French press. The lysate was centrifuged and the supernatant applied to a column of NiNTA agarose resin and eluted with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8) containing 100 mm NaCl and a gradient of imidazole from 20 to 250 mm. The fractions containing protein were concentrated and stored at 4 °C in elution buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and were stable for several months. ESI-MS was used to confirm the mass of the protein:m/z: wild-type, 56063 (calculated, 56053); D313A, 56013 (calculated, 56009); D313N, 56063 (calculated, 56052). Protein concentrations were measured using the Pierce Micro BCA analysis kit. Purified enzyme was dialyzed against pH 5.0 buffer containing 50 mm trisodium citrate and 300 mm NaCl and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml with a Millipore concentrator. Wild-type and the two variants ofSpHex were co-crystallized with NAG using the vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Concentrated wild-typeSpHex was incubated with 30 mm NAG for 30 min and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with mother liquor (2.1 mammonium sulfate, 100 mm trisodium citrate, pH 6.0 and 20% glycerol) to create several 8-μl hanging drops from which diffraction quality hexagonal bipyramidal crystals (P6122) were obtained within 2 weeks. The SpHex variants D313A and D313N were incubated with 250 and 500 mm NAG, respectively, and then individually mixed with a buffer identical to the mother liquor described above but lacking glycerol. Glycerol, which was used as a cryoprotectant for low temperature data collection, was found to compete with NAG for the active sites of both variant forms ofSpHex. Thus, crystals of the two SpHex variants in complex with NAG were grown in the absence of glycerol and swept through a cryoprotectant (2.1 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm trisodium citrate, pH 6.0 and 20% glycerol) just prior to data collection. Diffraction data from a single crystal of the WT_SpHex-NAG complex were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 9-1, whereas diffraction data from single crystals of the SpHex_D313A-NAG and SpHex_D313N-NAG complexes were collected with an R-axis IV2+ image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator. All crystals were flash-cooled to 100 K within a N2(g) stream during data collection, and all diffraction data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Prior to structure determination and refinement, 10% of the diffraction data from the WT_SpHex-NAG complex were randomly flagged for cross-validation using the free R factor (27Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). To remain consistent, the same hkl indices were also included in cross-validation calculations for the SpHex_D313A-NAG andSpHex_D313N-NAG complexes. All crystallographic refinements were carried out using the CNS program (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Series D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The three complexes crystallized isomorphously with WT_SpHex. Thus, using a maximum likelihood target function, rigid body refinement and several rounds of conjugate gradient minimization were sufficient to position molecular models of WT_SpHex (PDB code: 1HP4) and variant forms of the enzyme (D313A and D313N variants created using the program O, Ref. 29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Series A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) into the asymmetric unit of the appropriate crystallographic complex. Initial ς-A weighted Fo - Fc , αc and 2 Fo - Fc , αc electron density maps (where αc are the calculated phases and Fo and Fc are the measured and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively), computed prior to solvent modeling, unambiguously defined an NAG molecule bound at the −1 subsite of each of the three complexes. These maps also clearly showed two alternate conformations for the NAG molecule bound to theSpHex D313A variant. NAG models were fit into the appropriate electron density of each complex using the program O, and topology and parameter files of the sugar were generated using Xplo2D (30Kleywegt G.J. CCP4/ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar). Solvent molecules, which had been removed from all three models prior to positioning into the new asymmetric units, were relocated using the CNS program and manually inspected using the program O.R-factor convergence was reached following several subsequent rounds of solvent modeling and maximum likelihood conjugate gradient minimization. Once the atomic B-factors for theSpHex_D313A-NAG complex had been sufficiently refined, their values were fixed, and the occupancies for the alternate NAG conformations were then refined. The final refinement statistics are presented in Table I and the stereochemical quality of the models was verified using the programs PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M.

Thek cat/K m values for the hydrolysis of PhGlcNAc at each pH were determined from progress curves at low substrate concentrations as follows. For the wild-typeSpHex a solution of PhGlcNAc (100 μl, 52.5 μm, 0.1 × K m) and 0.02% bovine serum albumin in the appropriate buffer was warmed to 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 5-μl aliquot of enzyme and the release of phenolate monitored at 360 nm for 5–10 min at which time it was apparent that 5–7 half lives had passed. The pH of the reaction mixture was then checked, and it was thus established that no significant change in pH had occurred during the course of the assay. The change in absorbance with time was fitted to a first-order rate equation using the program Grafit 4.0, yielding values for the pseudo-first-order rate constant at each pH value. Because at low substrate concentrations ([S] ≪ K m) the reaction rates are given by Equation 1, V=kcat[E][S]KmEquation 1 the k obs values correspond to [E]0 k cat/K m. Thus, k cat/K m values can be extracted by division of these obtained rate constants by the enzyme concentration.

To understand the role of thiols in redox signaling, we have studied the effect of thiol alkylation on platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-induced cell survival events in vascular smooth muscle cells. PDGF-BB stimulated Akt phosphorylation predominantly at Ser-473.N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), a thiol alkylating agent, blocked PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation without affecting its upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). On the other hand, LY294002 and wortmannin, specific inhibitors of PI3K, prevented PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effector molecules, p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E. NEM also abrogated the phosphorylation of p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E induced by PDGF-BB, suggesting that thiol alkylation interferes with the PI3K/Akt pathway at the level of Akt. In addition, NEM blocked PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of BAD and forkhead transcription factor FKHR-L1, and these events correlated with increased apoptosis. NEM alone and in concert with PDGF-BB increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in VSMC. The inhibition of PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation by NEM was completely reversed by PP2A inhibitors fostriecin and okadaic acid, ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1, and ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC also attenuated the apoptosis induced by NEM, alone or in combination with PDGF-BB. Together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that PP2A mediates thiol alkylation-dependent redox regulation of Akt and cell survival.

Despite the growing body of information on the role of oxidants in the regulation of gene expression, the mechanisms by which these molecules transmit the extracellular signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus are less clear. Thiols play a critical role in the reduction/oxidation reactions as well as in the structure and function of several enzymes, transcription factors, and transporters (1Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G.

Most interestingly, cells also possess several enzymatic mechanisms such as thioredoxins and glutaredoxins for regeneration of thiols from their oxidized state, features that orchestrate these molecules as primary targets for oxidant action (22Stewart E.J.

In view of the above information, we hypothesize that the cellular thiol redox state plays a determinant role in agonist-induced cell survival/apoptotic signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus leading to induction of expression of target genes enabling the cellular response. Assuming such an important role for cellular thiols in the signal transduction pathways, one would expect that blockade of these inorganic sulfur groups should affect the signal transduction events that are dependent on oxidation/reduction of these molecules either positively or negatively. The PI3K1/Akt pathway plays an important role in cell survival and growth in response to a variety of agents, including cytokines, growth factors, and hormones (28Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Brachmann S.M.

To understand the role of thiol-sensitive redox mechanisms in the regulation of cell survival and growth, we have studied the effect of thiol alkylation on PDGF-BB-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in VSMC. Here we report that: 1) NEM, a thiol-alkylating agent, blocks PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation without affecting its upstream PI3K; 2) NEM also blocks p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB, suggesting that thiol alkylation interferes with the PI3K/Akt pathway at the level of Akt; 3) NEM attenuates PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of BAD and FKHR-L1, and these events correlate with activation of caspase-3 and induction of apoptosis; 4) The blockade of PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation by NEM was completely reversed by fostriecin, okadaic acid, and fumonisin B1, specific inhibitors of PP2A and ceramide synthase, respectively, suggesting a role for these enzymes in thiol alkylation-dependent inhibition of PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt phosphorylation; 5) NEM alone and in concert with PDGF-BB increased ROS production and PP2A activity in VSMC; 6) NAC, an ROS scavenger, reversed the inhibition of PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt phosphorylation by NEM; and 7) NAC also reduced the apoptosis induced by NEM alone or in combination with PDGF-BB. Together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that PP2A mediates thiol-sensitive redox regulation of Akt and cell survival.

VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aortae of 200- to 300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic dissociation as described earlier (34Rao G.N. Madamanchi N.R. Lele M. Gadiparthi L. Gingras A.C.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were growth-arrested by incubating in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 72 h and used to perform the experiments unless otherwise stated. This assay is based on the quantitative sandwich-enzyme immunoassay using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were seeded in a 24-well culture plate at a density of 8 × 103 cells/well in 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and grown in a humidified incubator (95% air-5% CO2) at 37 °C. At about 80% confluence, cells were growth-arrested by incubating in DMEM with 0.1% FBS for 72 h. Growth-arrested cells were then treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of NEM (20 μm) for 6 h. After the treatments, cell extracts were prepared, and histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) in the cytosolic fraction of the cell lysates were measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in a Spectra Max 190 microtiter plate reader. After appropriate treatments, VSMC were lysed and assayed for Akt activity using its immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit following the supplier's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). PI3K activity was measured as described previously (34Rao G.N. Madamanchi N.R. Lele M. Gadiparthi L. Gingras A.C. Eling T. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12925-12932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, after appropriate treatments, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 μm leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 400 μm PMSF) for 20 min on ice. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatants was determined using a Micro BCATM protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Five-hundred micrograms of protein from control and each treatment was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-PI3K antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 40 μl of 50% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose beads for an additional hour. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with wash buffer, and three times with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μmNa3VO4). The kinase activity was measured by resuspending the immunoprecipitates in 30 μl of TNE buffer and incubating with 10 μl of 2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 100 mm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 22 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 20 μl of 5 n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1) mix. The aqueous and organic phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The organic phase containing the phosphoinositol phosphates was spotted onto a Silica Gel 60A TLC plate coated with 1% potassium oxalate and separated in a solvent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (90:70:14.6:5.4, v/v). The TLC plate was exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film for 4–6 h at −80 °C and developed. PP2A activity was measured using a kit following the supplier's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). After appropriate treatments, VSMC were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μm leupeptin, 100 units/ml aprotinin and 400 μm PMSF. Cell lysates consisting of 500 μg of protein from control and each treatment were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of PP2A catalytic alpha subunit (PP2Acα) antibodies overnight at 4 °C, at which time 40 μl of 50% (w/v) protein G-Sepharose CL-4B beads was added and incubation continued for another 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 25 μl of assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.1 mm CaCl2). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 1 μg/μl phosphopeptide substrate (200 mm) (KRpTIRR) and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was then terminated by the addition of 100 μl of Malachite Green solution. The reaction mixture was spun down, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 620 nm in a Spectra Max 190 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Phosphatase activity was calculated using a phosphate standard curve. After appropriate treatments, cells were rinsed twice with DMEM and incubated for 10 min with 1 mg/ml DCFDA in DMEM. DCF fluorescence produced by ROS was measured on an arbitrary gray scale with a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 fluorescence microscope following a previously published procedure (15Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Farrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). After appropriate treatments, thiols in VSMC were determined according to the method of Ellman, using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-dinitrobenzoic acid) (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). After appropriate treatments, VSMC were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Cells were lysed by thawing in 250 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. After standing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS and 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). All the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Data for Akt, PI3K, PP2A, ROS, and apoptosis are presented as mean ± S.D. The treatment effects were analyzed by Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In the case of Western blot analysis, one representative set of data is shown. The PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in cell survival and growth in response to a variety of agents, including cytokines, growth factors, and hormones (28Ueki K. Fruman D.A. Brachmann S.M.

To understand the role of thiols in redox-signaling events related to cell survival/apoptosis, we have studied the effect of thiol alkylation on activation of Akt by PDGF-BB in VSMC. NEM has been used extensively as a specific thiol-alkylating agent (36Clottes E. Burchell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19391-19397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z., Wu, Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine thiol alkylation by NEM, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without 20 μm NEM for 30 min, and free thiols were measured using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-dinitrobenzoic acid) reagent (35Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). NEM (20 μm) alkylated 60% of the available thiols in VSMC (control, 522 ± 11 nmol/mg of protein versus NEM treatment, 213 ± 4 nmol/mg of protein). At higher concentrations, NEM was found to be toxic to VSMC, and, therefore, it was used at 20 μm concentration throughout this study. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of NEM (20 μm) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from control and each treatment were analyzed by Western blotting for Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation using its phospho-specific antibodies. PDGF-BB stimulated Akt phosphorylation both on Ser-473 and Thr-308 residues in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Increases in PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation occurred at 5 min (5-fold) and peaked by 30 min (7-fold), and these levels sustained thereafter for at least 2 h. Maximal increases in PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt-308 phosphorylation were observed at 5 min (3-fold), and these levels decreased thereafter. Furthermore, PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt was found to be severalfold higher on Ser-473 than Thr-308. NEM significantly (80%) inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation. Because PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 was severalfold higher than Thr-308, all the subsequent experiments were focused on Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. To test whether the observed changes in Akt phosphorylation levels correlate with its activity, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of NEM (20 μm) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. Equal amounts of protein from control and each treatment were assayed for Akt activity using a kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). As shown in Fig. 1 B, PDGF-BB induced Akt activity by 2- to 3-fold as compared with control, and it was significantly suppressed by NEM. PI3K is upstream to, and mediates Akt phosphorylation and activation in response to a variety of agonists, including growth factors and cytokines (31Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Therefore, to understand the mechanism by which NEM inhibits PDGF-BB-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, we studied the effect of thiol alkylation on PI3K activity. PDGF-BB stimulated PI3K activity in a time-dependent manner with a 5-fold increase at 2 h (Fig. 2). Thiol alkylation by NEM alone caused an increase in PI3K activity, and it had an additive effect on PDGF-BB-induced activation of this kinase (Fig. 2).Figure 2Thiol alkylation does not inhibit PDGF-BB-induced PI3K activity. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of NEM (20 μm) for the indicated times, and cell extracts were prepared. 500 μg of protein from control and each treatment was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of anti-PI3K antibodies, and the kinase activity in the immunocomplexes was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mean ± S.D. values of three independent experiments are shown in the bar diagram. *,p < 0.05 versus control; **,p < 0.01 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Akt is downstream to and mediates several of the PI3K-dependent events, including phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1, BAD, and FKHR family of transcriptional factors (31Vanhaesebroeck B.

Because thiol alkylation had no effect on PDGF-BB-stimulated PI3K activity, we were interested to learn the consequences of Akt inactivation by thiol alkylation on PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 and their downstream effector molecules ribosomal protein S6 and eIF4E. To gain information on this aspect, we first studied the role of PI3K on PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt. LY294002 (25 μm) and wortmannin (1 μm), two structurally different and potent inhibitors of PI3K, blocked both basal and PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3, top panel). LY294002 also inhibited PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E (Fig. 3, lower panel). These results suggest that PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E is PI3K-dependent. We now tested the effect of thiol alkylation on PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of the above molecules. NEM completely inhibited PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E (Fig. 4).Figure 4Thiol alkylation inhibits PDGF-BB-stimulated phosphorylation of p70S6K, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-BP1, and eIF4E.

Integrin signaling is initiated by ligand binding, which is thought to involve conformational changes in integrins that are propagated to their intracellular, cytoplasmic domains. The ability of integrins to function as signaling receptors is dependent on these cytoplasmic domains, which are typically short (13–70 amino acid residues in length) and lack known catalytic activity. Thus, integrins rely on either direct or indirect associations of their cytoplasmic domains with signaling and/or adaptor molecules to initiate signal transduction cascades. An early event in integrin signaling in certain cells involves activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk (3Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Bolen J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol.

Rev. 1998; 165: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and12Turner M. Gulbranson-Judge A. Quinn M.E. Walters A.E. MacLennan I.C. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Exp.

Nature. 1995; 378: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). These kinases are structurally distinct in that they contain tandem N-terminal SH2 domains followed by a C-terminal kinase domain. A helical Y-shaped linker region termed “interdomain A” joins the tandem SH2 domains. Kinase activity and subcellular localization of this kinase family within immune cells can be controlled by binding of its tandem SH2 domains to a doubly phosphorylated tyrosine ligand in immune response receptors (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM))1 (11Chu D.H. Morita C.T. Weiss A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 165: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Linking the tandem SH2 domains with the kinase domain is the “interdomain B” region. This region contains a number of tyrosines that are phosphorylated in vivo and can recruit other signaling/adaptor molecules such as Src family members (15Pelosi M., Di, B., V Mounier V. Mege D.

Residues 6–370 in Syk and 1–337 in Zap-70, which contain the tandem SH2 domains and part of the interdomain B region, directly bind the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain (7Woodside D.G. Obergfell A.

Furthermore, Syk(1–330) acts as a dominant interfering mutant with respect to integrin αIIbβ3-dependent regulation of Syk (7Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Leng L. Wilsbacher J.L. Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S.

However, the interaction between Syk and integrin β3 tails does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of the β3 tail or intact phosphotyrosine-binding sites in the Syk tandem SH2 domains (7Woodside D.G.

We now report that Syk and ZAP-70 can directly interact with integrin β1, β2, and β3 cytoplasmic domains with high affinity. Furthermore, the interaction involves the N-terminal SH2 domain of both kinases and is enhanced by the presence of the interdomain A region. Thus, the Syk/ZAP-70 integrin interaction is mediated by a phosphorylation-independent interaction of an SH2 domain. The CHO cell line A5 stably expressing integrin αIIbβ3(19Hughes P.E.

Anti-Syk mAb 4D10, anti-GST mAb, and polyclonal anti-His were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 were purchased from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Expression vectors encoding GST-Syk(6–370), GST-Syk(6–270), and GST-Syk(163–270) have been described (20Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J.

GST-Syk(6–109) was produced by inserting a stop codon at residue 109 of Syk by QuikChangeTM (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis. Construction of pGEX/GST-Syk(1–370,Δ6–109) and the expression vector EMCV/myc-sykΔ(6–109) was performed by first introducing a blunt end StuI site at position 109 in both vectors with the QuikChange system. pGEX/GST-Syk(6–370) was cut with StuI and NheI to remove the N-terminal SH2 domain of Syk. Gel-purified vector was ligated to the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-gatccgccagcagcggc and 3′-gcggtcgtcgccg encoding amino acid residues 2–5 of Syk. For EMCV/myc-Syk, vector was digested with StuI and BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated with the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-ctagcagcggc and 3′-gtcgccg encoding amino acids 2–5 of Syk. All site-directed mutagenesis and deletion mutations were verified by sequence analysis. GST-Zap-70(1–337), GST-Zap-70(1–103), and GST-Zap-70(163–254) were generated by PCR amplification of wild type Zap70 cDNA (pBS-Zap-70) and cloned into pGEX-2T. A5 CHO cells transiently transfected with full-length Syk or Syk with residues 6–109 deleted were plated on bovine serum albumin- or fibrinogen-coated bacteriological dishes, precoated as described (21Obergfell A.

After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C and 6% CO2, the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After clarification at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, 500–750 μg of lysate was incubated with primary antibody (polyclonal antibody 8053) overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with primary antibody, protein A beads (10 μl packed; Amersham Biosciences) were then added and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing beads in lysis buffer, the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and Western blotted for the indicated proteins. GST fusion proteins were produced as described (20Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, exponential growth phase bacteria were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and sonicated at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatant was incubated with glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C and then washed four times in elution buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) without GSH. Final elution was carried out in elution buffer containing 20 mm glutathione. For BIAcore analysis of Syk binding to integrin cytoplasmic domains, Syk(6–370) was cleaved from GST-Syk(6–370)-coated glutathione-SepharoseTM 4B by thrombin (1 unit/mg protein) overnight at 4 °C. Model protein mimics of integrin cytoplasmic domains αIIb, β1A, and β3 have been described previously (22Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain model protein was developed by PCR amplification of β2 cDNA using 5′-ccaagcttctgatccacctgagcgacctccgg and 3′-ttggggttcaaacgactctcaatcatccctagggg primers. This primer set introduced a 5′ HindIII restriction site into the N-terminal region of the β2 cytoplasmic domain, resulting in the mutation A725L. The 3′ primer contained a BamHI restriction site immediately downstream of dual stop codons. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 as described in the TA® cloning system (Invitrogen). After sequencing, pCR2.1-β2cyt was digested withBamHI and HindIII and subcloned into the modified bacterial expression plasmid pET15bm (22Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

All of the model proteins were verified by sequence analysis, expressed, high pressure liquid chromatography-purified, and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy as described (22Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The model peptides (1 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 6 m urea. To this, 50 μl of packed His-Bind® resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) was added, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at room temperature. Immobilized peptides were washed five times in the above buffer without urea and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer containing 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 150 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 40 mmNa4P2O7·10H20 (buffer A) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3 mmMgCl2. Purified GST fusion proteins were added to 0.5 ml of buffer A supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3 mmMgCl2. Five μl of total packed resin loaded with various integrin cytoplasmic domain model proteins was added to the GST fusion protein. The mixture was incubated for 40 min at room temperature with continuous rotation. The beads were then washed five times in buffer A with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3 mm MgCl2. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in reducing sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. For peptide competition assays, the peptides were preincubated with Syk(6–370) for 1 h before direct binding assays were performed. The peptides were used at a concentration of 1 × 10−4m, and Syk(6–370) was used at a concentration of 2 × 10−9m. Bound Syk was detected as described above. The concentration of integrin cytoplasmic tail model protein estimated in the direct binding assay is 1.7 × 10−5m. BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for real time kinetic analysis of the Syk/integrin cytoplasmic domain interactions. The experimental procedures, integrin cytoplasmic domain modifications, and data analysis were performed as described (23Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Syk tyrosine kinase (Syk(6–370)) interacts with integrin αIIbβ3 by binding to the β3cytoplasmic domain (7Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Leng L. Wilsbacher J.L. Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1799-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Syk(6–370) contains two N-terminal tandem SH2 domains separated by a linker sequence termed interdomain A. Following the tandem SH2 domains is another linker region termed interdomain B, which contains a number of tyrosine residues that are phosphorylatedin vivo and regulate Syk and Zap-70 function (reviewed in Ref. 11Chu D.H. Morita C.T. Weiss A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 165: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Syk (residues 370–635) contains its kinase domain (Fig. 1 A). To further map the integrin binding site within Syk, we tested a number of Syk constructs represented schematically in Fig. 1 A. In direct binding assays, the interdomain B (Syk(270–370)) and C-terminal SH2 domain of Syk (Syk(163–270)) were dispensable for binding (Fig.1 B, middle panels). In contrast, the N-terminal SH2 domain (Syk(6–109)) alone was sufficient for interaction with the β3 tail (Fig. 1 B, right panel). To determine whether the N-terminal SH2 domain was necessary for the interaction of Syk(6–370) with β3, it was removed (Syk(Δ6–109)). This deletion markedly reduced binding to the β3 tail (Fig. 2). Thus, the N-terminal SH2 domain of Syk is sufficient for interaction with the integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1) and is necessary for strong binding.Figure 2Removal of the N-terminal SH2 domain from Syk(6–370) decreases its direct binding to the integrin β3 tail. A, indicated concentrations of Syk(6–370) and SykΔ(6–109) were tested for binding to integrin β3 or αIIb cytoplasmic domain coated Ni2+-charged resin. Bound protein was eluted by boiling in reducing sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gels), and visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Syk mAb 4D10. One-third of the GST-Syk starting material (Rec Prt) is shown in the left panel (for the 2.5 nm test).

To test whether deletion of the N-terminal SH2 domain would affect integrin association with Syk in vivo, CHO cells stably expressing integrin αIIbβ3 were transfected with full-length Syk or Syk lacking the N-terminal SH2 domain (SykΔ(6–109)). When these cells were plated on fibrinogen, no association between αIIbβ3 and SykΔ(6–109) was observed (Fig. 3). In contrast, wild type Syk manifested adhesion-dependent association with αIIbβ3 (Fig. 3). The recombinant Syk proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3,bottom panel), and equal amounts of the β3subunit were immunoprecipitated (middle panel). The N-terminal SH2 domain (residues 6–109) is thus necessary for strong binding to the integrin β3 tail (Fig. 2) and for the physical association of Syk with integrin αIIbβ3. Zap-70 is a paralogue of Syk that binds directly to integrin β cytoplasmic domains (reviewed in Ref. 11Chu D.H. Morita C.T. Weiss A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 165: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It shares a similar domain structure with Syk (see schematic in Fig.4 A) and is essential for T cell development and function (24Chan A.C. Kadlecek T.A. Elder M.E. Filipovich A.H. Kuo W.L. Iwashima M. Parslow T.G. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 264: 1599-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 25Elder M.E. Lin D. Clever J. Chan A.C. Hope T.J. Weiss A. Parslow T.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N-terminal SH2 domain of Zap-70 could interact with the β3 integrin tail, we measured the binding of recombinant purified ZAP-70(1–103) to the β3 cytoplasmic domain. The N-terminal SH2 domain of Zap-70 (residues 1–103) directly bound the integrin β3 tail (Fig. 4 B, right panel). Binding of the C-terminal SH2 domain of Zap-70 (residues 163–254) was not detected (Fig. 4 B, middle panel). Thus, in both ZAP-70 and Syk, binding to the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain involves the N-terminal SH2 domain. In direct binding assays, the interaction between Syk and Zap-70 N-terminal SH2 domains generally appear to be of lower affinity than the tandem SH2 domains together (data not shown and Fig.5 C). Also, removal of the N-terminal SH2 domain of Syk decreases but does not prevent binding of Syk to the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2). These results suggest that regions in addition to the N-terminal SH2 domains of Syk and Zap-70 may be involved in binding to the integrin β3 tail. Because the C-terminal SH2 domain of Syk and Zap-70 failed to bind the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain, we examined the interdomain A region further. We expressed the interdomain A of Syk as a GST fusion protein to determine whether it could directly interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β3. No binding was detected (Fig. 5 A). The orientation of the SH2 domains of Syk and Zap-70 are such that the phosphotyrosine-binding domains bind to dually phosphorylated ITAM sequences (YXX(I/L)X 6–8YXX(I/L)) in a reverse colinear fashion (26Futterer K. Wong J. Grucza R.A. Chan A.C. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 27Hatada M.H., Lu, X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2 are oriented differently from those of Syk and Zap-70. The regions involved in phosphotyrosine binding are widely separated and in opposite orientation (28Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). When tested in a direct binding assay, the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-2 did not bind the β3 tails (Fig. 5 B). Thus, interaction with the integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail is not a general property of tandem SH2 domain-containing proteins. When the Syk interdomain A was inserted into the interdomain region of SHP-2, SHP-2 now bound to the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 5 B). To examine the role of the interdomain A region of Zap-70, a series of truncation mutants were tested for binding to the integrin β3cytoplasmic domain. The N-terminal SH2 domain of Zap-70, when expressed in conjunction with its intact IA domain (Zap-70(1–162)), bound β3 to a similar extent as the tandem SH2 domains (Fig.5 C). However, removal of the C-terminal half of interdomain A (residues Leu133–Pro162, Zap-70(1–132)) resulted in a decrease in binding similar to levels of the N-terminal SH2 domain alone (Fig. 5C). Thus, the interdomain A is necessary for optimal binding of Syk and Zap-70 to the β3integrin cytoplasmic domain and confers binding to the SHP-2 tandem SH2 domains. The binding of Syk to β3involves the N-terminal SH2 domain and does not require phosphorylation of the two tyrosines contained in the β3 tail (7Woodside D.G. Obergfell A. Leng L. Wilsbacher J.L. Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1799-1804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, mutation of these two tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (β3(Y747F,Y759F)) within the β3 cytoplasmic domain can alter αIIbβ3-dependent functions (29Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of the β3(Y747F,Y759F) mutation on Syk or Zap-70 binding to the β3 tail. The β3(Y747F,Y759F) mutations had no effect on the binding of Syk or Zap-70 to the β3cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 6 A). Phosphorylation of the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain occurs as a consequence of integrin engagement (30Law D.A. Nannizzi-Alalmo L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10811-10815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of the β3 cytoplasmic domain could affect Syk binding, competition assays were performed using tyrosine-phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides in the context of the last 23 amino acids of the β3 cytoplasmic domain. Peptides were used at a concentration 1 × 10−4m, and Syk was used at a concentration of 5 × 10−9m. The nonphosphorylated peptide competed for integrin β3 tail binding to Syk (Fig. 6 B). In three experiments, there was a 52 ± 3.4% decrease in Syk binding to the β3 tail model proteins in the presence of nonphosphorylated β3C-23 peptide as compared with the phosphorylated peptide (β3C-23P). The phosphorylated peptide did not detectably compete (Fig. 6 B), although this peptide preparation is active in binding Shc (18Cowan K.J. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36423-36429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of Phe residues at β3 Tyr747 and Tyr759 does not disrupt Syk binding, confirming the lack of requirement for phosphorylation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of β3(Y747F,Y759F) reduces its capacity to compete for Syk binding to the nonphosphorylated β3 tail. Syk binds to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain. Because Syk activation occurs after engagement of integrins that contain other β subunits (4Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 1426-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we tested the interaction of Syk with other integrin β cytoplasmic tails (Fig.7 A). The integrin β2 cytoplasmic domain bound Syk (6–370) to nearly the same extent as β3. Binding to β1A was detectable but modest relative to β3. No binding of GST was observed to any of the cytoplasmic domain constructs, establishing specificity. Scanning densitometry was used to quantify Syk binding relative to β3; β2 bound approximately half as much Syk as β3, and β1A bound approximately one-twentieth as much (Fig. 7 B). The integrin cytoplasmic domains were in excess (i.e. the binding of Syk(6–370) was not saturating), and only a fraction (less than 20%; data not shown) of Syk(6–370) bound the integrin β cytoplasmic domains. Thus, Syk binding was limited primarily by the affinity of the interaction rather than depletion of the interacting proteins. Consequently, the apparent affinity of Syk for integrin β tails is β3 > β2 > β1A. To determine the affinity of the interaction between various integrin cytoplasmic domains and Syk, binding parameters were measured by surface plasmon resonance. GST-Syk (6–370) was cleaved by thrombin to remove the GST and then dialyzed in BIAcore analysis buffer. This cleavage product retained the ability to specifically bind the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain (Fig.8 A). Integrin αIIb, β1A, β2, and β3 cytoplasmic domain peptides were biotinylated and immobilized (23Yan B. Calderwood D.A. Yaspan B. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28164-28170Abstra"
https://openalex.org/W1544549727,"In T-lymphocytes the Ras-like small GTPase Rap1 plays an essential role in stimulus-induced inside-out activation of integrin LFA-1 (αLβ2) and VLA-4 (α4β1). Here we show that Rap1 is also involved in the direct activation of these integrins by divalent cations or activating antibodies. Inhibition of Rap1 either by Rap GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP) or the Rap1 binding domain of RalGDS abolished both Mn2+- and KIM185 (anti-LFA-1)-induced LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Mn2+- and TS2/16 (anti-VLA-4)-induced VLA-4-mediated adhesion were inhibited as well. Interestingly, both Mn2+, KIM185 and TS2/16 failed to induce elevated levels of Rap1GTP. These findings indicate that available levels of GTP-bound Rap1 are required for the direct activation of LFA-1 and VLA-4. Pharmacological inhibition studies demonstrated that both Mn2+- and KIM185-induced adhesion as well as Rap1-induced adhesion require intracellular calcium but not signaling activity of the MEK-ERK pathway. Moreover, functional calmodulin signaling was shown to be a prerequisite for Rap1-induced adhesion. From these results we conclude that in addition to stimulus-induced inside-out activation of integrins, active Rap1 is required for cell adhesion induced by direct activation of integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4. We suggest that Rap1 determines the functional availability of integrins for productive binding to integrin ligands. In T-lymphocytes the Ras-like small GTPase Rap1 plays an essential role in stimulus-induced inside-out activation of integrin LFA-1 (αLβ2) and VLA-4 (α4β1). Here we show that Rap1 is also involved in the direct activation of these integrins by divalent cations or activating antibodies. Inhibition of Rap1 either by Rap GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP) or the Rap1 binding domain of RalGDS abolished both Mn2+- and KIM185 (anti-LFA-1)-induced LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Mn2+- and TS2/16 (anti-VLA-4)-induced VLA-4-mediated adhesion were inhibited as well. Interestingly, both Mn2+, KIM185 and TS2/16 failed to induce elevated levels of Rap1GTP. These findings indicate that available levels of GTP-bound Rap1 are required for the direct activation of LFA-1 and VLA-4. Pharmacological inhibition studies demonstrated that both Mn2+- and KIM185-induced adhesion as well as Rap1-induced adhesion require intracellular calcium but not signaling activity of the MEK-ERK pathway. Moreover, functional calmodulin signaling was shown to be a prerequisite for Rap1-induced adhesion. From these results we conclude that in addition to stimulus-induced inside-out activation of integrins, active Rap1 is required for cell adhesion induced by direct activation of integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4.

Overexpression of the active mutant RapV12 induced adhesion to immobilized ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. T cell receptor- and CD31-induced activation of integrins was abolished by the introduction of constructs that inhibit Rap1 signaling, i.e.Rap GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP), which lowers the level of Rap1GTP, the Rap1 binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS, which presumably inactivates Rap1 by binding to it, and the putative dominant negative mutant RapN17 (15Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transgenic mice constitutively expressing Rap1aV12 in their T cell lineage have been generated (17Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Expression of active Rap1A in primary T cells from these mice is sufficient to induce inside-out signaling leading to β1and β2 integrin-mediated adhesion. In these cells, active Rap1A did not modulate integrin affinity, as was measured by soluble ICAM-1 binding. However, thymocytes expressing Rap1AV12 showed integrin clustering at the surface, pointing to a role for Rap1 in integrin avidity modulation.In the present study we show that overexpression of Rap1-inhibitory signaling proteins, RapGAPs and RBD, interferes with the ability of Mn2+ and KIM185 to induce LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 and with the ability of Mn2+ and TS2/16 to induce VLA-4-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1. Both divalent cations and the activating antibodies do not induce accumulation of active Rap1GTP, consistent with the notion that they are thought to bypass the requirement for intracellular signaling events (18Kassner P.D. Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19859-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stewart M.P. Cabanas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that direct activation of integrins does not depend on further Rap1 activation. Although TPA-induced adhesion (inside-out integrin activation) may similarly not require activation of Rap1 (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that it is blocked by inhibition of Rap1 signaling. Apparently, both stimulus-induced inside-out regulation of integrins and activation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion by cations and integrin-activating antibodies require Rap1. Use of pharmacological inhibitors reveals that Mn2+-, KIM185-, but also RapV12-induced LFA-1-mediated adhesion, is critically dependent upon intracellular Ca2+ levels but independent of protein kinase C or MEK-ERK signaling. Furthermore, RapV12-induced LFA-1-mediated adhesion requires calmodulin. We propose that Rap1 activity, either basal or induced, regulates the functional availability of integrins for the adhesion process by or in combination with a calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanism.DISCUSSIONPreviously, we and others have shown that the small GTPase Rap1 is required for cytokine-induced inside-out activation of various integrins, including LFA-1, VLA-4, and αMβ2(14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this manuscript we now demonstrate that also direct activation of LFA-1-, VLA-4-, and VLA-5-mediated adhesion by Mn2+- or integrin-activating antibodies (monoclonal KIM185 for LFA-1 and TS2/16 for VLA-4 and VLA-5) is sensitive to inhibition of Rap1 signaling. This is shown by overexpression of either Rap-specific GAPs, which interfere with Rap1 signaling by reducing levels of endogenous GTP-bound Rap1, or overexpression of RalGDS-RBD, which inhibits Rap1 signaling by binding to GTP-bound Rap1 and sequestering it from potential effector proteins in Jurkat and K562 (Figs. 1 and 3). As an assay to monitor enhanced integrin function, we measured binding to immobilized integrin ligands, i.e. ICAM-1 for LFA-1, VCAM-1 for VLA-4 and fibronectin for VLA-4 and VLA-5. This unexpected finding raised the question of whether the inhibition is due to an integrin-specific effect or whether Rap1 affects a general requirement for integrin-mediated cell adhesion, like cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell spreading. However, inhibition of Rap1 signaling did not affect integrin-independent adhesion to poly-l-Lysine (Fig.4a). In addition, inhibition of TS2/16-induced adhesion by blocking Rap1 signaling could be rescued by increasing the fibronectin concentration (Fig. 4b). Moreover, inhibitors of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cytochalasin D (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and jasplakinolide,2 did not influence RapV12-induced adhesion.Basal Rap1 signaling may be sufficient to play a role in integrin-mediated adhesion, since we have not observed an increase in Rap1GTP upon treatment with either Mn2+ or activating antibodies (Fig. 5). This may imply that Rap1 only provides a favorable setting for enhanced integrin function. In agreement with a facilitating function for Rap1 are the recent findings that overexpressing Rap1bV12 in megakaryocytes itself had no effect, but augmented fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3induced by a PAR4 thrombin receptor agonist (34Bertoni A. Tadokoro S. Eto K. Pampori N. Parise L.V. White G.C. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, we have not observed increased adhesion of human megakaryoblasts overexpressing active Rap1 to immobilized fibrinogen, whereas we have found inhibition of TPA-induced adhesion by RapGAP. 2Kim M. T. de Bruyn, S. Rangarajan, K. A. Reedquist, C. G. Figdor, and J. L. Bos, unpublished results. However, RapV12 as well as Rap1-specific GEFs that activate endogenous Rap1 are able to induce increased integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Fig. 2), showing that activation of Rap1 is sufficient to enhance the function of LFA-1.We have also investigated the involvement of putative Rap1 effectors in the regulation of integrins. Although regulation of the MEK-ERK pathway is reported to be a predominant effect of Rap1 in T lymphocytes and other cell types (29Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8409-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), MEK inhibitors neither blocked RapV12- nor Mn2+-induced adhesion (Fig. 8). Interestingly, this issue was recently analyzed in an in vivo model system (17Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, transgenic mice constitutively expressing Rap1aV12 in their T cell lineage did not demonstrate a modulating role for Rap1 in the MEK-ERK pathway. Furthermore, inhibitors of the proposed Rap1 targets phospholipase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not interfere with RapV12- or Mn2+-induced adhesion. However, pretreatment of cells with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM inhibited both basal adhesion and RapV12-, Mn2+-, or integrin-activating antibody-induced adhesion to a similar extent (Fig. 7). Utilization of the SK&F 96365 inhibitor, which blocks extracellular calcium channels required for leukocyte adhesion, also blocked RapV12-induced adhesion. This result is compatible with recent evidence that extracellular stimuli inducing T lymphocyte adhesion via LFA-1, such as T cell receptor stimulation and phorbol esters, do so by inducing an influx of extracellular calcium (28Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although in several studies Rap1 has been implicated in the regulation of cellular calcium levels (35Bobe R. Lacabaratz-Porret C. Bredoux R. Martin V. Ozog A. Launay S. Corvazier E. Kovacs T. Papp B. Enouf J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Lacabaratz-Porret C. Corvazier E. Kovacs T. Bobe R. Bredoux R. Launay S. Papp B. Enouf J. Biochem.

A recent study demonstrated that Rap2b via interaction with phospholipase Cε is able to regulate intracellular calcium signaling in HEK293 cells (38Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A large number of calcium-responsive signaling proteins have been shown to regulate integrin-dependent adhesion in various cell types, like calpain (28Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (42Blystone S.D. Slater S.E. Williams M.P. Crow M.T. Brown E.J. J.

Monticone R.E. Pauly R.R. White A.J. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of RapV12-induced adhesion, calmodulin is required (Fig.7d). However, we could not demonstrate a role for calpain, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, or calcineurin in RapV12-induced integrin function (Fig. 7). The function of this calmodulin requirement is therefore still unclear.Our results indicate that all stimuli that enhance the function of integrins tested, including inside-out signaling and direct activation, require Rap1. Previously, it was reported that the phorbol ester TPA may induce integrin activation independent of Rap1 activation (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, we have found that overexpression of RapGAPs or RalGDS-RBD efficiently blocked TPA-induced adhesion, indicating that Rap1-GTP is also required for TPA-induced integrin activation. How Rap1 enhances integrin function is still elusive. Cell surface expression of integrins is not affected by Rap1 signaling interference (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This indicates that Rap1 is involved in the increase in integrin function either by inducing a conformational change or by inducing clustering of integrins, two nonexclusive modes of integrin activation (8van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat.

Importantly, the effect of Rap1 on integrin function occurs with both β1 and β2 integrins. The most plausible explanation for the role of Rap1 is regulation of auxiliary factors for integrin function. These factors may be signaling or structural proteins that associate with integrin cytoplasmic tails (46Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matsuda and co-workers utilize fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis to visualize Rap1 activation in vivo and note that growth factor-induced Rap1 activation initiates in the perinuclear region (47Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Perhaps Rap1 influences integrin processing, the repertoire of integrin-associated proteins that is delivered to surface, or modulates membrane microdomain organization (lipid rafts) (48Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 49Simons K. Ikonen E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Circulating lymphocytes require a dynamic and flexible regulation of their integrin-dependent adhesive properties. Although these cells circulate in blood and lymph or migrate through tissues, rapid transitions between adherent and non-adherent states are required.

However, rapid conversion into an active state allows the integrin to bind to its ligands, intercellular adhesion molecules 1, 2, and 3 (ICAM-1, -2, and -3) (1Marlin S.D. Springer T.A.

Nature. 1989; 342: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In addition, lymphocytes express VLA-4 (integrin α4β1), which binds to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) (7Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). The binding of ligand by LFA-1 and VLA-4 is activated through inside-out signaling (8van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin.

T cell receptor- and CD31-induced activation of integrins was abolished by the introduction of constructs that inhibit Rap1 signaling, i.e.Rap GTPase-activating protein (RapGAP), which lowers the level of Rap1GTP, the Rap1 binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS, which presumably inactivates Rap1 by binding to it, and the putative dominant negative mutant RapN17 (15Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transgenic mice constitutively expressing Rap1aV12 in their T cell lineage have been generated (17Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Expression of active Rap1A in primary T cells from these mice is sufficient to induce inside-out signaling leading to β1and β2 integrin-mediated adhesion. In these cells, active Rap1A did not modulate integrin affinity, as was measured by soluble ICAM-1 binding. However, thymocytes expressing Rap1AV12 showed integrin clustering at the surface, pointing to a role for Rap1 in integrin avidity modulation. In the present study we show that overexpression of Rap1-inhibitory signaling proteins, RapGAPs and RBD, interferes with the ability of Mn2+ and KIM185 to induce LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 and with the ability of Mn2+ and TS2/16 to induce VLA-4-mediated adhesion to VCAM-1. Both divalent cations and the activating antibodies do not induce accumulation of active Rap1GTP, consistent with the notion that they are thought to bypass the requirement for intracellular signaling events (18Kassner P.D. Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19859-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stewart M.P. Cabanas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that direct activation of integrins does not depend on further Rap1 activation. Although TPA-induced adhesion (inside-out integrin activation) may similarly not require activation of Rap1 (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that it is blocked by inhibition of Rap1 signaling. Apparently, both stimulus-induced inside-out regulation of integrins and activation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion by cations and integrin-activating antibodies require Rap1. Use of pharmacological inhibitors reveals that Mn2+-, KIM185-, but also RapV12-induced LFA-1-mediated adhesion, is critically dependent upon intracellular Ca2+ levels but independent of protein kinase C or MEK-ERK signaling. Furthermore, RapV12-induced LFA-1-mediated adhesion requires calmodulin. We propose that Rap1 activity, either basal or induced, regulates the functional availability of integrins for the adhesion process by or in combination with a calcium/calmodulin-dependent mechanism. DISCUSSIONPreviously, we and others have shown that the small GTPase Rap1 is required for cytokine-induced inside-out activation of various integrins, including LFA-1, VLA-4, and αMβ2(14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this manuscript we now demonstrate that also direct activation of LFA-1-, VLA-4-, and VLA-5-mediated adhesion by Mn2+- or integrin-activating antibodies (monoclonal KIM185 for LFA-1 and TS2/16 for VLA-4 and VLA-5) is sensitive to inhibition of Rap1 signaling. This is shown by overexpression of either Rap-specific GAPs, which interfere with Rap1 signaling by reducing levels of endogenous GTP-bound Rap1, or overexpression of RalGDS-RBD, which inhibits Rap1 signaling by binding to GTP-bound Rap1 and sequestering it from potential effector proteins in Jurkat and K562 (Figs. 1 and 3). As an assay to monitor enhanced integrin function, we measured binding to immobilized integrin ligands, i.e. ICAM-1 for LFA-1, VCAM-1 for VLA-4 and fibronectin for VLA-4 and VLA-5. This unexpected finding raised the question of whether the inhibition is due to an integrin-specific effect or whether Rap1 affects a general requirement for integrin-mediated cell adhesion, like cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell spreading. However, inhibition of Rap1 signaling did not affect integrin-independent adhesion to poly-l-Lysine (Fig.4a). In addition, inhibition of TS2/16-induced adhesion by blocking Rap1 signaling could be rescued by increasing the fibronectin concentration (Fig. 4b). Moreover, inhibitors of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cytochalasin D (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and jasplakinolide,2 did not influence RapV12-induced adhesion.Basal Rap1 signaling may be sufficient to play a role in integrin-mediated adhesion, since we have not observed an increase in Rap1GTP upon treatment with either Mn2+ or activating antibodies (Fig. 5). This may imply that Rap1 only provides a favorable setting for enhanced integrin function. In agreement with a facilitating function for Rap1 are the recent findings that overexpressing Rap1bV12 in megakaryocytes itself had no effect, but augmented fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3induced by a PAR4 thrombin receptor agonist (34Bertoni A.

In addition, we have not observed increased adhesion of human megakaryoblasts overexpressing active Rap1 to immobilized fibrinogen, whereas we have found inhibition of TPA-induced adhesion by RapGAP. 2Kim M. T. de Bruyn, S. Rangarajan, K. A. Reedquist, C. G. Figdor, and J. L. Bos, unpublished results. However, RapV12 as well as Rap1-specific GEFs that activate endogenous Rap1 are able to induce increased integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Fig. 2), showing that activation of Rap1 is sufficient to enhance the function of LFA-1.We have also investigated the involvement of putative Rap1 effectors in the regulation of integrins. Although regulation of the MEK-ERK pathway is reported to be a predominant effect of Rap1 in T lymphocytes and other cell types (29Mochizuki N. Ohba Y. Kiyokawa E. Kurata T. Murakami T. Ozaki T.

Interestingly, this issue was recently analyzed in an in vivo model system (17Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, transgenic mice constitutively expressing Rap1aV12 in their T cell lineage did not demonstrate a modulating role for Rap1 in the MEK-ERK pathway. Furthermore, inhibitors of the proposed Rap1 targets phospholipase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not interfere with RapV12- or Mn2+-induced adhesion. However, pretreatment of cells with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM inhibited both basal adhesion and RapV12-, Mn2+-, or integrin-activating antibody-induced adhesion to a similar extent (Fig. 7). Utilization of the SK&F 96365 inhibitor, which blocks extracellular calcium channels required for leukocyte adhesion, also blocked RapV12-induced adhesion. This result is compatible with recent evidence that extracellular stimuli inducing T lymphocyte adhesion via LFA-1, such as T cell receptor stimulation and phorbol esters, do so by inducing an influx of extracellular calcium (28Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Although in several studies Rap1 has been implicated in the regulation of cellular calcium levels (35Bobe R. Lacabaratz-Porret C. Bredoux R. Martin V. Ozog A. Launay S. Corvazier E. Kovacs T. Papp B.

A large number of calcium-responsive signaling proteins have been shown to regulate integrin-dependent adhesion in various cell types, like calpain (28Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J.

Monticone R.E. Pauly R.R. White A.J. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of RapV12-induced adhesion, calmodulin is required (Fig.7d). However, we could not demonstrate a role for calpain, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, or calcineurin in RapV12-induced integrin function (Fig. 7). The function of this calmodulin requirement is therefore still unclear.Our results indicate that all stimuli that enhance the function of integrins tested, including inside-out signaling and direct activation, require Rap1. Previously, it was reported that the phorbol ester TPA may induce integrin activation independent of Rap1 activation (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, we have found that overexpression of RapGAPs or RalGDS-RBD efficiently blocked TPA-induced adhesion, indicating that Rap1-GTP is also required for TPA-induced integrin activation. How Rap1 enhances integrin function is still elusive. Cell surface expression of integrins is not affected by Rap1 signaling interference (14Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 15Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This indicates that Rap1 is involved in the increase in integrin function either by inducing a conformational change or by inducing clustering of integrins, two nonexclusive modes of integrin activation (8van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat.

Importantly, the effect of Rap1 on integrin function occurs with both β1 and β2 integrins. The most plausible explanation for the role of Rap1 is regulation of auxiliary factors for integrin function. These factors may be signaling or structural proteins that associate with integrin cytoplasmic tails (46Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matsuda and co-workers utilize fluorescent resonance energy transfer analysis to visualize Rap1 activation in vivo and note that growth factor-induced Rap1 activation initiates in the perinuclear region (47Mochizuki N.

Perhaps Rap1 influences integrin processing, the repertoire of integrin-associated proteins that is delivered to surface, or modulates membrane microdomain organization (lipid rafts) (48Harder T.

https://openalex.org/W2014126697,"COX19, a nuclear gene ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, was cloned by transformation of a respiratory-deficient mutant from complementation group G188 of apet mutant collection. The gene codes for an 11-kDa protein (Cox19p) required for expression of cytochrome oxidase. Becausecox19 mutants are able to synthesize the mitochondrial and nuclear gene products of cytochrome oxidase, Cox19p probably functions post-translationally during assembly of the enzyme. Cox19p is present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it exists as a soluble intermembrane protein. This dual location is similar to what was previously reported for Cox17p, a low molecular weight copper protein thought to be required for maturation of the CuA center of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase. The similarity in their subcellular distribution, combined with the presence of four cysteines in Cox19p that align with a subset of the cysteines in Cox17p, suggests that like the latter, Cox19p may function in metal transport to mitochondria.

Cytochrome oxidase (COX) 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cytochrome oxidase; HA, hemagglutinin. is a heteroligomeric complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In eukaryotes, COX is derived from mitochondrial and nuclear genes (1Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 53-64Google Scholar). Mitochondria generally code for three subunits of the catalytic core that contains the copper and heme prosthetic groups of the complex. The remaining 9–10 subunits are products of nuclear genes. They are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes and transported to different compartments of the organelle by the TOM (protein transport machinery of outer membrane) and TIM (protein transport machinery of inner membrane) protein translocases of the outer and inner membrane, respectively (2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Google Scholar,3Schatz G. Nature. 1998; 395: 439-440Google Scholar). Even though the precise functions of these subunits are not known, mutations in most of them block assembly of the complex (1Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 53-64Google Scholar). This set of proteins may also contribute to the overall stability of the complex. Much of the current information about COX assembly has come from studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants. Approximately three dozen yeast genes have been identified that, when mutated, elicit a specific deficit in COX (4McEwen J.E., Ko, C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Google Scholar, 5Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 54: 211-225Google Scholar). Some of the genes code for accessory proteins that operate during different stages of assembly and affect a broad range of events required for expression of fully active COX. These include maturation of the mitochondrially encoded transcript for subunits 1, 2, and 3 (6Seraphin B. Simon M. Boulet A. Faye G. Nature. 1989; 337: 84-87Google Scholar, 7Seraphin B. Simon M. Faye G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1455-1464Google Scholar), translation of the resultant mRNAs (8Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 327-1335Google Scholar, 9Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 60-66Google Scholar, 10Manthey G.M. McEwen J.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4031-4043Google Scholar), and membrane insertion and post-translational processing of subunit 2 (11Hell K.

Nuclear gene products also play important roles in mitochondrial copper homeostasis (13Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 14Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Google Scholar) and in biosynthesis of heme A (15Tzagoloff A. Nobrega M. Gorman N. Sinclair P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 593-598Google Scholar, 16Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Google Scholar), both of which are required for the electron transferring activities of the enzyme. Despite recent progress, there remain a significant number of COX-specific genes whose functions remain unknown. Nor is it certain that all of the COX-specific genes have been identified. In this paper we report a new gene, COX19, that shares the hallmarks of other COX-specific genes. Mutations in COX19elicit a deficiency in COX but not in other complexes of the respiratory chain. The presence of COX19 homologues in other eukaryotic genomes including that of man, indicates that the product of this gene is likely to participate in some fundamental aspect of COX assembly in mitochondria. Cox19p has been localized in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, although a fraction of the protein is also detected in the cytosolic fraction. In this respect, Cox19p is similar to Cox17p, which has been implicated in transport of copper to mitochondrial (13Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). The biochemical properties ofcox19 mutants are consistent with a post-translational block in COX assembly. The primary structure of the Cox19p and its subcellular localization further suggest that it is likely to be involved in metal transport.

Open table in a new tab E708/U1 (MATα ura3-1, cox19-1), obtained from a cross of the original mutant E708 (MATα met6 cox19-1) to W303-1A, was transformed with a yeast genomic library by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (18Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Google Scholar). The library was constructed by ligation of partial Sau3A fragments of nuclear DNA (averaging 7–10 kb) to the BamHI site of Yep24 (19Botstein D. Davis R.W. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The molecular biology of the yeast Sacchromyces cerevisiae: metabolism and gene expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 607-636Google Scholar). Transformation of 5 × 108 cells with the library (25 μg DNA) yielded ∼60,000 uracil-independent clones, of which 20 grew on nonfermentable carbon sources. The respiratory competence cosegregated with the uracil independence, indicating that both phenotypes depend on a segregating plasmid. Plasmid DNA isolated from the transformant E708/U1/T1 was amplified in Escherichia coli and used to subclone COX19. The two reading frames located within the 700-bp HindIII fragment were amplified by PCR. The shorter reading frame in pG188/T10 was amplified with primers 5′-CAGCCTCCTGCAGGGTC and 5′-GAGTATCTCTAGAGTATGCAGCTTGTG and cloned in YEp351 (20Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Google Scholar). The longer frame corresponding to COX19 was amplified with primers 5′-CTACATCTCGGTACCTTCTCTCCG and 5′-TGTGGGCGGAGATCTATTATCG and cloned in YEp352 (pG188/T11). A partially deleted allele of COX19 was made by blunt ending the 0.7-kbHindIII fragment containing the entire gene with Klenow polymerase and ligating it to the HincII site of pUC19 (21Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid was digested with Bsu36 and AccI to remove 84 nucleotides from the middle of the gene. The gapped plasmid was blunt ended and ligated to a 2-kb fragment containing the yeast LEU2 gene. This plasmid was used to isolate a 2.6-kb fragment with the partially deletedcox19::LEU2 allele, which was substituted for the wild type allele of W303-1B by the one-step gene replacement procedure (22Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 201-211Google Scholar). One of the respiratory-deficient transformants (W303ΔCOX19L) was verified by Southern analysis of total nuclear DNA to have the mutant allele. The gene was also completely deleted by amplifying a plasmid containing the 0.7-kb HindIII fragment with COX19 in pUC18 (21Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Google Scholar) with the bi-directional primers: 5′-GGCAGATCTTGTGTTATGTTTCGTAAAAG and 5′-GGCAGATCTGGCGCCCACATCGGAATATC. The product lacking theCOX19 coding sequence but containing the entire sequence of the plasmid and the sequences flanking the gene was digested withBglII and ligated to a 1-kb BamH1 fragment containing the yeast HIS3 gene. The null allele, recovered from this plasmid as a linear PvuII fragment, was used to transform the diploid strain W303. Two histidine-independent clones obtained from the transformation were sporulated, and the tetrads were dissected. In both cases the tetrad contained two respiratory competent and two respiratory defective spores. The latter phenotype cosegregated with the histidine prototrophy. The haploid respiratory defective mutants (W303ΔCOX19H) were confirmed to have thecox19::HIS3 allele by crosses to thecox19 point mutant. Yeast was grown to stationary phase in YPGal (2% galactose, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone), and mitochondria were prepared by the procedure of Fayeet al. (23Faye G. Kujawa C. Fukuhara H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 185-203Google Scholar) except that Glusulase was replaced by Zymolyase 20,000 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) to prepare spheroplasts. COX and NADH-cytochrome c reductase were assayed as described previously (24Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Google Scholar). ATPase was determined by measuring inorganic phosphate released from ATP (25King E.J. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 292-297Google Scholar). Cytochrome spectra of mitochondrial extracts were recorded as difference spectra of sodium dithionite reducedversus potassium ferricyanide oxidized samples (24Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Google Scholar). COX19 was modified to code for a hybrid protein containing the entire sequence of Cox19p and the 9-residue-long hemagglutin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at the carboxyl terminus. The fusion gene was obtained by PCR amplification of COX19 with the primers 5′-GGCGAGCTCGCAGGCTTTGCCCACTACCC and 5′-GGCCGAGCTCTCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTATTTATTATCGGTGGCGTCTTT. The PCR product containing the fusion gene and 293 nucleotides of upstream flanking sequence was digested with SacI and cloned into the episomal plasmid YEp352 and the integrative plasmid YIp352 (20Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Google Scholar) yielding pG188/ST9 and pG188/ST10, respectively. The two plasmid constructs were used to transform the cox19 mutant aW303ΔCOX19H. In the case of pG188/ST10, the fusion gene was integrated at the URA3 locus by transformation with the plasmid linearized at the NcoI site inside URA3.Both plasmids complemented the respiratory defect of thecox19 mutant. The parental strain D273-10B/A1 and the G188 mutant E708 were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide (24Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Google Scholar). The mitochondria were prepared, and samples representing 50 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on a linear 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gel (26Chua N.H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2173-2179Google Scholar). The preparation and ligation of DNA fragments and the transformation and recovery of plasmid DNA fromE. coli were performed by standard methods (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). TheHindIII fragment of pG188/ST1 was sequenced by the chain termination method of Sanger et al. (28Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The proteins were analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide gel unless otherwise indicated by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Western blots were treated with antibodies against the Cox19p and antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by a secondary reaction with Super Signal as recommended by the supplier (Pierce). The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). E708 and N559 are two independent isolates previously assigned to complementation group G188 of a collection of respiratory-deficient strains of S. cerevisiae(5Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 54: 211-225Google Scholar). Both mutants lack COX as evidenced by enzymatic assays (TableII) and the absence of the absorption bands corresponding to cytochromes a anda 3 (Fig.1 A). The other complexes of the respiratory chain and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase are present in the mutants, indicating that the growth defect stems from the COX deficit.Table IIRespiratory and ATPase activities in wild type and cox19 mitochondriaStrainSpecific activitiesNADH-c red.Cyt. oxidaseATPase− oligomycin+ oligomycinμmol/min/mgD273-10B/A14.9 ± 0.13.82 ± 0.135.880.70E7083.0 ± 00.03 ± 0.033.70.29W303-1A4.9 ± 0.42.72 ± 0.145.640.48aW303ΔCOX19H2.0 ± 003.550.56The cox19 mutants E708 and W303ΔCOX19H are isogenic with the parental strains D273–10B/A1 and W303–1A, respectively. NADH-cytochrome c reductase and COX were measured at 23 °C, and ATPase was measured at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab The cox19 mutants E708 and W303ΔCOX19H are isogenic with the parental strains D273–10B/A1 and W303–1A, respectively. NADH-cytochrome c reductase and COX were measured at 23 °C, and ATPase was measured at 37 °C. To better understand the cause of the COX defect, the mutants were tested for their ability to express the mitochondrial and nuclear gene products. Expression of the three endogenously translated subunits was assayed by in vivo labeling of cells with [35S]methionine in the presence of cycloheximide to block cytoplasmic protein synthesis. In this assay, labeling of subunits 1, 2, and 3 of COX was comparable in the mutant and wild type strain (Fig.1 B). Subunit 2 was not separated from cytochromeb in the gel shown in Fig. 1 B. In other experiments, however, the protein was found to be as well labeled in the mutant as in wild type yeast. The steady-state concentrations of some of the nuclear gene products was also examined. This group of COX constituents is more stable than the more hydrophobic mitochondrial translation products that are proteolytically degraded in assembly arrested mutants (1Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 53-64Google Scholar). The results of the Western analysis indicate that the levels of these proteins in the cox19 mutant are similar to those seen in other COX mutants (Fig. 1 C). The lower concentration of subunit 4 is not specific to the cox19mutant but is also observed in some other mutants (see Cox5aand Cox7 in Fig. 1 C). The gene responsible for the COX defect of G188 mutants was cloned by transformation of E708/U1 with a plasmid library of yeast genomic DNA as described under “Materials and Methods.” Several plasmids with identical or overlapping fragments of nuclear DNA were obtained, and one (pG188/T1) was used to subclone the gene. The sequences of the end points of the insert in pG188/T1 allowed it to be mapped to the region of chromosome XII between coordinates 106668 and 114606 (Fig.2). The gene was localized to a 0.7-kbHindIII fragment present in subclone pG188/ST1 (Fig. 2). The sequence of this region revealed the presence of two short overlapping and oppositely oriented reading frames spanning the onlyAccI restriction site in the fragment. The insert in pG188/T5 starting at the AccI site (pG188/T5) did not restore respiration, suggesting that one of the reading frames was the gene. The HindIII fragment was dissected by PCR amplification. Two constructs helped to identify the longer of the two reading frames as the gene conferring respiration to the mutant (Fig.2). Plasmid pG188/T10 containing 112 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon and ending at the termination codon of the shorter reading frame was ineffective in restoring respiration. Because this plasmid lacked the sequence coding for the amino-terminal 37 codons of the longer reading frame, its failure to complement pointed to the latter as the gene. This was supported by the other subclone (pG188/T11), containing the sequence starting from nucleotide 141 upstream of the initiation codon and ending at the last codon of the longer reading frame. This fragment complemented the mutant, even though it lacked the sequence coding for the first five codons of the shorter reading frame. In keeping with the previous convention for naming genes related to COX assembly, the longer reading frame located between coordinates 108675 and 108971 will henceforth be referred to as COX19(GenBankTM accession number NP_013082). Two cox19 null alleles were introduced into chromosomal DNA of the respiratory competent strain W303. One (W303ΔCOX19L) had a partial and the other (W303ΔCOX19H) had a complete deletion of the gene. Both mutants were respiratory-deficient, had no COX activity, and displayed the absence of cytochromes a and a 3 (Fig. 1 and Table II). Diploid cells issued from crosses of either of the two null mutants to E708 did not respire. This combined with the similarity in the phenotype of the cox19 null and point mutants constitutes strong evidence that the mutations are allelic and thatCOX19 complements rather than suppresses the respiratory defect of E708/U1. This was shown more directly by sequencing the mutation in E708/U1 (see below). The COX19 product is a hydrophilic protein with a mass of 11,108 Daltons. Cox19p does not have any hydrophobic amino acid stretches of sufficient length to qualify as transmembrane domains. A noteworthy feature of the sequence is the presence of four cysteine residues. These residues align with four of the seven cysteines in Cox17p (Fig.3 A), a protein previously inferred to target cytoplasmic copper to mitochondria (13Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). Homologues of Cox19p are detected in a large number of organisms including man, mouse, fly, worm, plants, and fungi. The proteins shown in Fig. 3 B as well as homologous proteins from other sources share a short conserved domain with seven identities in a span of 10 residues near the amino terminus. The four cysteines of yeast Cox19p are present in all of the homologues currently in the protein data base. The arginine at position 63, mutated in the E708, is also conserved in the other Cox19p sequences. To sequence the mutation in E708, total nuclear DNA from the mutant was digested withHindIII and separated on a preparative gel. Fragments in the 700-bp size range were isolated and cloned in YEp352. Screening of the plasmid library by colony hybridization yielded several positive clones, one of which was sequenced. The sequence of theHindIII fragment from the mutant disclosed a C for a G base change at the second position of codon 63. This mutation leads to the substitution of a threonine for an arginine adjacent to the carboxyl-proximal cysteine residues in the protein. To determine whether the R63T mutation is responsible for the respiratory defect of E708, the cox19 null mutant was transformed with the mutant allele. Transformants harboring the R63T allele on a multicopy plasmid grew more slowly than wild type on nonfermentable substrates (Fig.4). The fact they also grew more slowly than the null mutant transformed with the same plasmid with the wild type gene (Fig. 4) indicates that the arginine at position 63 is important for Cox19p activity. These results further substantiate the requirement of Cox19p for expression of COX. The hydrophilic nature of Cox19p and the presence of four cysteines that align with some of the cysteine residues of Cox17p suggested that, like Cox17p, Cox19p might be involved in metal transport. An interesting feature of Cox17p is its presence in both the cytoplasm and in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (33Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 372: 33191-33196Google Scholar). This dual distribution correlates with the state of oligomerization of the protein (34Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Google Scholar). To study its subcellular location, Cox19p was expressed with a 9-residue-long hemagglutin tag fused to the carboxyl terminus. The hybrid protein was verified to be functional as evidenced by its ability to complement a cox19 null mutant in single copy. Mouse monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope detected a mitochondrial protein that migrates between the 14- and 21-kDa markers. This protein was identified as the HA-tagged Cox19p based on its absence in wild type yeast and higher abundance in the transformant with the gene on a multicopy plasmid than the transformant with the same gene integrated in single copy into chromosomal DNA. The HA-tagged Cox19p was also detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions of the multi-copy transformants (Fig.5 A). Although Cox19p is not seen in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction of the single-copy transformant in Fig. 5 A, in other experiments a faint signal was detected. No signal was detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions with an antibody against cytochrome b 2, a mitochondrial intermembrane maker (35Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Google Scholar), even when the blot was overexposed. It is therefore unlikely that the presence of Cox19p in this fraction represents leakage from mitochondria. The mass of Cox19p (∼16 kDa) estimated by SDS-PAGE, which was larger than predicted by the gene sequence, is probably an artifact of the SDS gel system. A similar discrepancy in size was observed for Cox17p (33Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 372: 33191-33196Google Scholar). The submitochondrial localization of Cox19p was examined in mitochondria prepared from a cox19 null mutant expressing the HA-tagged Cox19p from the chromosomally integrated fusion gene (aW303ΔCOX19/ST9). Mitochondria were converted to mitoplasts by incubation in hypotonic buffer, and the intermembrane proteins released by the hypotonic shock were separated from the mitoplasts by centrifugation. The different fractions were tested for susceptibility of Cox19p to proteolysis by proteinase K. The results of the fractionation indicated mitochondrial Cox19p to be located in the intermembrane space (Fig. 5 B). Cox19p was protected against proteinase K when mitochondria were diluted in an isotonic buffer solution (1.2 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5), and only a small fraction was recovered in the supernatant after sedimentation of the mitochondria. Dilution of mitochondria in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, alone, caused most of the Cox19p to be released from the mitochondria. Under these conditions, both the soluble and the small fraction of Cox19p that sedimented with the mitoplasts were completely sensitive to proteinase K. The location of Cox19p in the intermembrane space was confirmed by the similarity of its distribution with that of cytochrome b 2(Fig. 5 B). COX assembly is a complex process requiring the participation of a large number of nuclear gene products. In S. cerevisiaethese factors target specific mitochondrially encoded subunits of the enzyme at the level of transcript processing (6Seraphin B. Simon M. Boulet A. Faye G. Nature. 1989; 337: 84-87Google Scholar, 7Seraphin B. Simon M. Faye G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1455-1464Google Scholar) and translation of the mRNA (8Mulero J.J. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol.

Expression of functional COX also requires the addition of heme A and metals such as copper, zinc, and magnesium. Copper, like heme A, is an obligatory electron carrier of the enzyme (37Beinert H.

Several genes have been implicated in maturation of the two copper centers of the enzyme (13Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar, 14Glerum D.M.

In the present study we have characterized COX19, a new gene required for COX assembly. The product of this gene, Cox19p is a small protein with a mass of 11.1 kDa. The sequence of Cox19p, deduced from the gene, indicates that it is a soluble protein. This has been confirmed by its cellular localization. A fraction of Cox19p exists as a soluble cytoplasmic protein. Another fraction has been localized to the intermembrane compartment of mitochondria and is released as a soluble protein when mitochondria are lysed by hypotonic shock. The dual localization of Cox19p in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial intermembrane space is identical to previous findings on the subcellular distribution of Cox17 (33Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 372: 33191-33196Google Scholar), a small protein proposed to deliver copper to mitochondria (13Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar). Cox19p contains four cysteine residues whose spacing is similar to four of the seven cysteines of Cox17p. The four cysteines are conserved in all of the currently known homologues of yeast Cox19p, pointing to their essentiality for function. This is also true of the arginine adjacent to the most carboxyl-proximal cysteine that is mutated in thecox19 mutant E708. The coincidence in the size, solubility properties, and subcellular location of Cox17p and Cox19p suggests that they may also have related functions. COX17 does not rescue cox19 mutants, even when present on a high copy plasmid. Nor is COX19 a high copy suppressor of cox17mutants. 2M. P. Nobrega, S. C. B. Bandeira, J. Beers, and A. Tzagoloff, unpublished results. Unlikecox17 mutants that are partially rescued by addition of copper to the growth medium (13Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Google Scholar), neither copper, zinc, manganese, nor cobalt are able to promote growth of cox19 mutants on respiratory substrates.2 Homologues of COX19 exist in mammalian, plant, and fungal but not bacterial genomes. This feature, also shared by Cox17p, indicates that Cox19p is essential only for the biogenesis of mitochondrial but not prokaryotic COX. The absence of Cox19p homologues in bacteria that have “a” type oxidases is also consistent with the notion that the protein is unlikely to be directly involved in COX assembly. More likely Cox19p functions in transport of a metal or some other component essential for COX assembly to mitochondria. We thank Taissa Lukjanenko, Sabrina L. C. Oliveira, and Erika M.

https://openalex.org/W2089841991,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD52 gene is indispensable for homologous recombination and DNA repair. Rad52 protein binds DNA, anneals complementary ssDNA strands, and self-associates to form multimeric complexes. Moreover, Rad52 physically interacts with the Rad51 recombinase and serves as a mediator in the Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand exchange reaction. Here, we examine the functional significance of the Rad51/Rad52 interaction. Through a series of deletions, we have identified residues 409–420 of Rad52 as being indispensable and likely sufficient for its interaction with Rad51. We have constructed a four-amino acid deletion mutation within this region of Rad52 to ablate its interaction with Rad51. We show that the rad52Δ409–412 mutant protein is defective in the mediator function in vitro even though none of the other Rad52 activities, namely, DNA binding, ssDNA annealing, and protein oligomerization, are affected. We also show that the sensitivity of the rad52Δ409–412 mutant to ionizing radiation can be complemented by overexpression of Rad51. These results thus demonstrate the significance of the Rad51-Rad52 interaction in homologous recombination.

The RAD52 group members were first identified in the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and include RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54/TID1, MRE11, and XRS2(1Pierce A.J.

Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae and in other eukaryotes, homologous recombination is also an important means of eliminating DNA double-stranded breaks induced by ionizing radiation and other lesions that arise during the normal course of DNA replication (4Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In mammals, homologous recombination also appears to be indispensable for cell viability and tumor suppression (1Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 4Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A DNA double strand break can be repaired by pathways that are based on either end-joining or homologous recombination. In the latter case, the ends of the break are processed by a nuclease to yield 3′ ssDNA tails. These ssDNA1 tails attract recombination proteins, and the resulting nucleoprotein complex conducts a search for a homologous DNA sequence. Next, one of the ssDNA tails invades the homologous DNA target to form a DNA joint wherede novo DNA synthesis can take place, eventually leading to an exchange of genetic information between the recombining chromosomes and to restoration of the integrity of the broken chromosome (2Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,3Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic process responsible for the formation of heteroduplex DNA joints in recombination is called homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange (2Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The RAD51 encoded product, the equivalent of the Escherichia coli recombinase RecA, mediates the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analyses have indicated that Rad51, like E. coliRecA protein, forms a highly ordered nucleoprotein filament on DNA (6Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have suggested that pairing and exchange of DNA strands in recombination processes occur within the confines of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. The reaction phase in which the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is assembled is commonly referred to as the presynaptic phase, and the nucleoprotein filament as the presynaptic filament (2Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 6Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front.

Formation of the presynaptic filament requires ATP binding by Rad51 (2Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When plasmid length ssDNA substrates are used, presynaptic filament assembly is facilitated by the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA binding factor, replication protein A (RPA), which functions to remove secondary structure in the ssDNA (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 8Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The beneficial effect of RPA is seen most clearly when it is incorporated after Rad51 has been given an opportunity to nucleate onto the ssDNA template. In contrast, if RPA is added together with Rad51, it interferes with the filament assembly process by competing for binding sites on the ssDNA molecule. However, the inhibitory behavior of RPA can be alleviated by the addition of either of two recombination mediators (10Beernink H.T. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Rad52 or the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer (11Sung P.

We are interested in the molecular basis of the mediator function of Rad52 and the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer in the above mentioned reaction. Both Rad52 and the Rad55-Rad57 complex bind ssDNA and physically interact with Rad51 (15Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present study, we have performed a fine mapping of the domain in Rad52 that is responsible for the interaction with Rad51. Furthermore, we have used this information to introduce a small deletion mutation into Rad52 to ascertain the significance of Rad51-interaction in Rad52 mediator function. The combination of genetic and biochemical analyses of the mutant rad52 protein unequivocally demonstrate the requirement for a physical association of Rad52 with Rad51 to effect its mediator function. Yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium, synthetic complete (SC) medium, and synthetic complete medium without leucine (SC−Leu) and without uracil (SC−Ura) were prepared as described previously (16Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar) except that the synthetic media contained twice the amount of leucine (60 mg/liter). Yeast extract-peptone-acetate (YEPA) contained 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, and 20 g/liter potassium acetate. Sporulation medium contained 2.5 g/liter yeast extract and 15 g/liter potassium acetate supplemented with 62 mg/liter Leu and 20.6 mg/liter each of adenine, His, Trp, and uracil. All strains are derivatives of Trp-303 (17Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar) except that they are wild type for RAD5 (18Fan H.Y. Cheng K.K. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1996; 142: 749-759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zou H. Rothstein R. Cell. 1997; 90: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Standard genetic techniques were used to manipulate yeast strains (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The rad52Δ409–412 allele was integrated into the yeast genome at the RAD52 locus by a cloning-free PCR-based allele replacement method (21Erdeniz N. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1174-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Specifically, gene-targeting substrates were made by amplifying a region of the rad52 allele,which comprises the Δ409–412 mutation, from the vector pR52Δ409–412.1 by PCR using the primers and Pr-Rad52-C-Adap-B (5′-GATCCCCGGGAATTGCCATGTGGTCTTCCAACTTCTCTTCG-3′) and Pr-C-adap-A (5′-AATTCCAGCTGACCACCATGAAGGATCCCGTTGTAGCTAAG-3′). The underlined sections of the primers correspond to unique tags that match sequences upstream and downstream of Kluyveromyces lactis URA3, respectively. Next, two PCR fragments containing the upstream and the downstream two-thirds of the K. lactis URA3gene were fused individually to the rad52Δ409–412 PCR fragment as described in Erdeniz et al. (21Erdeniz N. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1174-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). GST fusion fragments of Rad52 were constructed as follows: GST-Rad52N (aa 1–168), GST-Rad52 M (aa 169–327), and GST-Rad52C (aa 328–504), encoded within theHpaII/BglII, BglII/BamHI, and BamHI/DraI fragments from theRAD52 open reading frame were subcloned intoSmaI-digested pGEX-3X, BamHI-digested pGEX-2T, and SmaI-digested pGEX-3X vector, respectively. For the expression of other GST fusion proteins, specific primers withEcoRI sites were used for the PCR reactions. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI, purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and then ligated intoEcoRI-linearized pGEX-3X vector to fuse the Rad52 fragments to the GST protein. The ligation products were transformed intoE. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The φX 174 viral (+) strand was purchased from New England Biolabs, and the replicative form (about 90% supercoiled form and 10% nicked circular form) was from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotide 1 used in the ssDNA annealing and DNA binding experiments had the sequence 5′-AAATGAACATAAAGTAAATAAGTATAAGGATAATACAAAATAAGTAAATGAATAAACATAGAAAATAAAGTAAAGGATATAAA-3′. Oligonucleotide 2 is the exact complement of oligonucleotide 1. These oligonucleotides were purified from a 15% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (22Trujillo K.M. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The two oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase for use in DNA binding and single strand annealing experiments. Varying amounts of Rad52 or rad52 Δ409–412 protein was incubated with 32P-labeled Oligo-1 (1.36 μm nucleotides) at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffer D (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 10 min. After the addition of gel loading buffer (50% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% orange G), the reaction mixtures were resolved in 12% native polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) and dried, and the DNA species were quantified using Quantity One software in the phosphorimaging device (Personal Molecular Imager FX from Bio-Rad). To release the bound DNA, the reaction mixture was deproteinized with 0.5% SDS and 500 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 10 min before being loading onto the polyacrylamide gel. Oligo-1 (3.6 μm nucleotides) and radiolabeled Oligo-2 (3.6 μm nucleotides) were incubated in separate tubes at 37 °C for 2 min in the absence or presence of RPA (0.55 μΜ) in 24 μl of buffer D. Rad52 or rad52 Δ409–412 (0.36 μm) was added in 2 μl to the tube containing Oligo-1 and then mixed with Oligo-2. The completed reactions (50 μl) were incubated at 25 °C, and at the indicated times, 9 μl of the annealing reactions was removed and treated with 0.5% SDS, 500 μg/ml proteinase K, and an excess of unlabeled Oligo-2 (20 μm) at 25 °C for 5 min in a total volume of 15 μl. The various samples (6 μl) were resolved in 12% native polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer. DNA annealing was quantified as the portion of the 32P-labeled Oligo-2 that had been converted into the double-stranded form. All of the GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and all of the protein purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. For the purification of the GST fusion proteins, lysate was prepared fromE. coli cell paste using a French press in buffer G (20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 150 mm NaCl that also contained the protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 5 μg/ml each, as well as 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 90 min), and the supernatant (20 ml) from the centrifugation step was mixed with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 20 ml of buffer G containing 150 mm KCl. The bound GST fusion protein was eluted with 5 ml of 10 mm reduced glutathione in buffer G. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer G and concentrated to 10 mg/ml in a Centricon-30 microconcentrator. Plasmids encoding untagged versions of Rad52 protein (pR52.2) and rad52Δ409–412 mutant protein (pR52Δ409–412.1) under the control of the GAL-PGK promoter were introduced into yeast strain BJ5464-6B. For the purification of these proteins, extract was prepared from 300 g of cell paste from 100 liters of culture in high salt buffer (23Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The extract was clarified by centrifugation and then subjected to the chromatographic fractionation procedure described before (12Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) except that Sephacryl 400 was used instead of Sepharose 6B in the gel filtration step. The purified GST fusion proteins (0.4 μm) were incubated with purified Rad51 (0.2 μm) in 30 μl buffer G and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h before the reaction mixture was mixed with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads in 150 μl of buffer K (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for an additional hour. The beads were then washed twice with 150 μl of buffer K with 300 mm KCl, and the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 3% SDS. The supernatant that contained unbound protein, the KCl wash (10 μl each), and also the SDS eluate (3 μl) were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-Rad51 antibodies to determine their Rad51 content. Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS eluates revealed that ∼70% of GST and all of the GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Affi-gel 15 beads containing Rad51 (Affi-Rad51; 5 mg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (Affi-BSA, 12 mg/ml) were prepared as described previously (24Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Purified Rad52 or rad52 Δ409–412 (5 μg) was mixed with 5 μl of Affi-Rad51 or Affi-BSA in 50 μl of buffer K for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with 150 μl of buffer K before being treated with 50 μl of 2% SDS to elute-bound proteins. The starting material, supernatant that contained unbound Rad52 or rad52 protein, and the SDS eluate (10 μl each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel. A Sephacryl S400 column (1 × 30 cm, 20 ml total) was used to monitor the migration of Rad51 (30 μg), Rad52 (40 μg) and rad52Δ409–412 (40 μg) and to examine complex formation between Rad51 (30 μg) and Rad52 (40 μg). The mixtures of Rad51/Rad52 and Rad51/rad52Δ409–412 were incubated on ice for 1 h in 100 μl of buffer K and then filtered through the sizing column at 0.1 ml/min in the same buffer, collecting 0.5 ml fractions. The indicated column fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis to determine their content of the Rad51, Rad52, or rad52Δ409–412 proteins, respectively. For calibration of the column, thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and dextran blue (>2000 kDa) were used. All steps were carried out at 37 °C unless stated otherwise. The standard DNA strand exchange reaction was performed as described previously (23Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rad51 (10 μm) was incubated with ssDNA (30 μmnucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer R (35 mm K-MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmATP, and 3 mm MgCl2) for 5 min. After the addition of the indicated amounts of RPA in 0.5 μl, the reaction mixtures were incubated for another 5 min before the incorporation of 1 μl of double-stranded DNA (25 μm nucleotides) and 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine hydrochloride. At the indicated times, a 4.5-μl portion of the reaction mixtures was withdrawn, deproteinized, and then analyzed in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer. The gels were treated with eithidium bromide to stain the DNA species. Gel images were recorded in a NucleoTech gel documentation system and analyzed with GelExpert software. To examine the Rad52 mediator function, reaction mixtures (12.5 μl, final volume) containing the indicated amounts of Rad51, Rad52, and RPA were incubated on ice for 45 min in 10.5 μl of buffer R followed by the addition of ssDNA and a 10-min incubation. After the incorporation of linear duplex and spermidine, the completed reactions were incubated and analyzed as described for the standard reaction. For the time course experiments in Fig. 7, the reactions were scaled up four times to 50 μl but were otherwise assembled in the same fashion. Three independent haploid spores from each strain were picked and analyzed for their sensitivity to γ-irradiation, and the average values were reported. Yeast cultures were grown in YPD at 30 °C to the mid-log phase. At this point, the cultures were sonicated using a W-385 device (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Farmingdale, NY), and the appropriate number of cells were plated on YPD plates and irradiated in a Gammacell-22060Co irradiator (Atomic Energy of Canada). In Fig.8 B, cells transformed with pYESS10-Rad51 (2μ, RAD51) and with the empty vector pRS426 (25Jiang H. Xie Y. Houston P. Stemke-Hale K. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33181-33186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were grown on selective medium (SC−Ura) containing galactose as the sole carbon source at all stages of the experiment. The yeast cultures were analyzed as described above, except that for each strain, serial 10-fold dilutions were made and 5 μl of the diluted cell suspensions were spotted in duplicate on solid media prior to irradiation. Mitotic rates of interchromosomal heteroallelic recombination were determined as described previously (26Smith J. Rothstein R. Genetics. 1999; 151: 447-458PubMed Google Scholar). For each strain, nine independent trials were performed. The meiotic interchromosomal heteroallelic recombination frequency, sporulation efficiency, and spore viability were determined as described in Lisby et al. (27Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) except that strains were grown at 30 °C. Three trials were performed for each strain. Rad52 possesses 504 amino acid residues (28Adzuma K. Ogawa T. Ogawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Results from yeast two-hybrid analyses have suggested that the carboxyl terminus of Rad52 encompassing residues 328 to 504 can interact with Rad51 (29Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Exploiting this information, we divided Rad52 into three fragments: Rad52N (aa 34–168), Rad52 M (aa 169–327), and Rad52C (aa 328–504), which were fused individually to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as depicted in Fig.1 A. These GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 1 B). We also expressed and purified a GST fusion protein, termed GST-NMC, which contain the Rad52 protein sequence starting from the third ATG codon (aa 34); the region corresponding to amino acid 1–34 is not required for in vivo Rad52 function. 3R. Rothstein and U. H. Mortensen, unpublished observation. To determine which portion of Rad52 contains the Rad51 binding domain, the purified GST fusion proteins were mixed with Rad51 and then immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing with high salt buffer, the GST fusion proteins and associated Rad51 were eluted from the glutathione beads by treatment with SDS and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rad51 antibodies (Fig. 1 C). The results show that Rad51 binds GST-NMC and GST-C, but not GST-N, GST-M, or GST alone. We then asked whether the purified GST fusions could be retained on Affi-gel 15 beads that contained covalently coupled Rad51 protein (24Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). As expected, the Affi-Rad51 beads were able to bind GST-NMC and GST-C but not GST-M, GST-N, or GST (data not shown). None of the GST-Rad52 fusion proteins was retained on Affi-gel 15 beads containing bovine serum albumin (data not shown). Thus, in agreement with yeast two-hybrid studies (29Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the results from our in vitro analyses with purified Rad52 protein fragments revealed that the Rad51 interaction domain is located within the last 177 amino acid residues of Rad52 protein. To delimit the region in Rad52 required for interaction with Rad51, additional GST-tagged fragments of Rad52 derived from the carboxyl-terminal residues were generated (Fig2 A). These GST fusions were again purified by affinity chromatography and tested for Rad51 interaction by pull-down using glutathione-Sepharose beads as described before (Fig. 1 C). The binding of the various GST-Rad52 fusions to Affi-gel-Rad51 beads was also examined. The results from these combined analyses, as summarized in Fig. 2, revealed that amino acids 407–419 of the Rad52 protein are likely involved in binding Rad51. Overexpression of the Rad52 protein from another yeast, K. lactis, confers a dominant negative phenotype in S. cerevisiae that can be overcome by overexpression of the S. cerevisiae Rad51 (29Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The authors of this study (29Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) suggested that the negative dominance of the K. lactis Rad52 inS. cerevisiae cells is due to the formation of a biologically inactive complex between KlRad52 and ScRad51. Even though the carboxyl terminus of the S. cerevisiae and K. lactis Rad52 counterparts display only a low level of identity (29%), the KlRad52 protein contains a sequence that is highly similar to the one in ScRad52 protein found here to be involved in Rad51 binding (Fig 2 B). Consistent with the suggestion that the sequence encoded within amino acid residues 407–419 of Rad52 is critical for Rad51 binding, we found that a small deletion spanning amino acid residues 409–412 within this region completely ablates the ability of Rad52 to interact with Rad51 (Fig. 2 A,panel II), as determined by the GST pull-down assay, binding of the GST fusion proteins to Affi-Rad51 beads, and other criteria (see below). The results presented above show that amino acid residues 409–412 are likely to be required for Rad51 binding. To further demonstrate the importance of these four amino acid residues, we introduced the same deletion mutation (Δ409–412) into the untagged Rad52 protein. For biochemical analyses, we overexpressed both the rad52Δ409–412 mutant and the wild-type protein by using the GAL-PGK promoter and galactose induction in the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5464-6B. The level of expression of the wild-type and mutant proteins was very similar (data not shown), and they could be purified to near homogeneity by the same chromatographic procedure (see “Materials and Methods”; Fig. 3 A). Approximately 1 mg of each of the wild-type and mutant proteins was obtained from 300 g of starting yeast paste. This represents a 5–10-fold improvement compared with protein yield obtained when thePGK promoter is used for protein expression, as described in our previously published study (12Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type Rad52 protein, the purified rad52Δ409–412 mutant protein did not bind Affi-Rad51 beads (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the four-amino acid deletion indeed eliminates the ability of Rad52 to associate with Rad51. Both Rad51 and Rad52 self-associate to form oligomeric molecules (14Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23Song B. Sung P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we subjected the purified rad52Δ409–412 mutant protein to sizing analysis in Sephacryl 400 to obtain independent verification that it does not associate with Rad51 and also to determine whether the Δ409–412 mutation affects self-association. When a mixture of Rad51 and wild-type Rad52 was analyzed, they formed a complex that emerged from the gel filtration column at an earlier position than either Rad51 or Rad52 alone (Fig. 4, comparepanel IV with panels I and III). In contrast, when the rad52Δ409–412 mutant was mixed with Rad51, no apparent shift of the elution profile of either protein was observed (Fig. 4, compare panel V with panels II andIII). Importantly, the peak of the rad52Δ409–412 mutant protein migrated at the same position as wild-type Rad52 (Fig. 4, compare panels I and II), strongly suggesting that the mutant rad52 protein has the same oligomeric composition as the wild-type protein. Thus, the results from the gel filtration analyses demonstrated that the rad52Δ409–412 mutant is defective in Rad51 interaction but maintains the ability to self-associate. As first reported by Mortensen et al. (15Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and later confirmed by others (13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C.

However, the identity of the nuclear tyrosine phosphatase(s) that inactivate STAT proteins in the nucleus has remained elusive (12Haspel R.L. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TcPTP was one of the first tyrosine phosphatases identified, and although widely expressed in different tissues, it is particularly abundant in hematopoietic cells and placenta (14Ibarra-Sanchez M.J.

TcPTP-deficient mice suffer from severe splenomegaly and die between 3 and 5 weeks of age. Two differentially spliced mRNAs account for the presence of a cytoplasmic 48-kDa form and a 45-kDa nuclear-targeted protein (14Ibarra-Sanchez M.J. Simoncic P.D. Nestel F.R. Duplay P. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This nuclear isoform of TcPTP was recently identified as the elusive STAT1 nuclear tyrosine phosphatase (15ten Hoeve J. Ibarra-Sanchez M.J., Fu, Y. Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 22: 5662-5668Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Since TcPTP is constitutively expressed and appears to require no further interferon-mediated post-translational modification for its activity, we reasoned that the Tyr-701 dephosphorylation of STAT1 by TcPTP might be regulated on the level of protein-protein interaction. TcPTP-deficient cells were provided by Dr. M. Tremblay and have been described previously (15ten Hoeve J. Ibarra-Sanchez M.J., Fu, Y. Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell.

Primary human fibroblasts and MEF, HeLa, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and U266 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium.

To generate whole cell lysates, cells were lysed on the plates with lysis buffer (1 ml) containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmvanadate. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad Protein Assay). Cytoplasmic/nuclear extracts were prepared by Dounce homogenizing cells in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and sedimentation of nuclei was done by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (=cytoplasmic extract) was removed, and nuclei were extracted with Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl (=nuclear extract). Cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 30 min and incubated with preimmune serum or antiserum to STAT1 and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. GST-STAT1 was isolated using GSH-agarose. After SDS-PAGE and transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, proteins were detected with anti-STAT1 (Transduction Labs), anti-phospho-STAT1 Tyr-701 (New England Biolabs), anti-TcPTP (Sigma), or anti-PIAS1/3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For dimethylarginine immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated with monoclonal mono-/dimethylarginine (Abcam) or an isotype control antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactive proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blots were immunoblotted with monoclonal STAT1 antibodies. All blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. 32P-Labeled riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription using T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). Labeled riboprobe and 10 μg of RNA were incubated in hybridization buffer (4:1 formamide and 5× stock; 5× stock was 200 mmPIPES, pH 6.4, 2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) overnight at 56 °C prior to digestion with T1 RNase. Protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide, urea gel. Hoeveet al. (15ten Hoeve J. Ibarra-Sanchez M.J., Fu, Y. Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 22: 5662-5668Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar) recently described the 45-kDa nuclear splice variant of TcPTP as the nuclear tyrosine phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of STAT1. As shown in the pulse-chase experiments in Fig. 1 B, a complete lack of Tyr-701 dephosphorylation of IFNβ-stimulated nuclear STAT1 is observed in TcPTP-deficient MEF cells over a 1-h period compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–4 versus 6–8). When TcPTP−/− cells were stably reconstituted with the 45-kDa form of TcPTP (Fig.1 A, lane 3), the rate of STAT1 dephosphorylation could be restored to that of wild-type cells (Fig. 1, lanes 10–12), testifying to the fact that TcPTP accounts for the majority of nuclear phosphatase activity directed against STAT1. Previously we have shown that methylation of Arg-31 of STAT1 modulates interferon-induced gene transcription (17Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Inhibition of STAT1 arginine methylation by methylthioadenosine (MTA) increased the binding of PIAS1 to STAT1. We therefore wanted to test whether arginine methylation of STAT1 would also affect its interaction with TcPTP and consequently alter its rate of dephosphorylation. As MTA is no longer commercially available, we used an alternative strategy to inhibit STAT1 arginine methylation. Incubation of U266 cells with adenosine and dl-homocysteine in the presence of the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor MDA results in the cellular accumulation ofS-adenosylhomocysteine, a potent inhibitor of protein-arginine methyltransferases (18Bergmann S. Shatrov V. Ratter F. Schiemann S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Lehmann V. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1736-1743PubMed Google Scholar). This regimen (from here on referred to as “MDA treatment”) resulted in the complete inhibition of STAT1 arginine methylation (Fig.2 A, lane 2 versus 3) and consequential abrogation of the IFNβ-induced transcription of the ISG54 gene (Fig.2 B, lane 2 versus 3) as we had previously observed after MTA treatment of cells. To evaluate the role of arginine methylation in STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation, we performed pulse-chase experiments in U266 cells in the absence or presence of the methylation inhibitors described above. Cells were treated for 30 min with IFNβ followed by the addition of the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and continued incubation for the indicated time periods in the presence of IFNβ. While MDA treatment had no effect on the initial level of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation achieved after 30 min of stimulation with IFNβ (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 7), the inhibition of arginine methylation resulted in a significant delay in the dephosphorylation of Tyr-701 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–5 versus 8–10). This effect is not restricted to U266 cells as a similar delay in STAT1 Tyr-701 dephosphorylation in the absence of its arginine methylation was observed when primary human fibroblasts were used in the experiments (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–5 versus 8–10). To investigate whether the lack of Arg-31 methylation per se accounts for the absence of TcPTP association or whether a competitive binding of PIAS1 prohibited STAT1 interaction with TcPTP, we decided to explore a possible function for PIAS1 in the delayed Tyr-701 dephosphorylation in the absence of arginine methylation. Unfortunately, PIAS1-deficient cells have not yet been reported. We therefore decided to screen several cell lines for their expression levels of PIAS1 to identify cells that express only minimal amounts of PIAS1 protein. 293T cells (Fig.4 C, lane 1) express only very low levels of PIAS1 compared with U266, HeLa, or 2fTGH fibrosarcoma cells (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2,3, and 4, respectively). When 293T cells were treated with MDA, virtually no delay in STAT1 Tyr-701 dephosphorylation was observed compared with cells with intact arginine methylation (Fig.4 D, lanes 2–4 versus 10–12). Transient introduction of PIAS1 into the 293T cellsper se also did not alter the rate of STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fig. 4 D, lanes 6–8). However, when 293T cells that were transiently transfected with PIAS1 were subjected to treatment with the methylation inhibitors, a significant delay in STAT1 Tyr-701 dephosphorylation occurred (Fig. 4 D,lanes 14–16). To further demonstrate a competitive, negative regulatory effect of PIAS1 on STAT1 dephosphorylation, increasing amounts of PIAS1 cDNA (0 μg, lanes 1–8; 2 μg, lanes 9–16; 10 μg, lanes 17–24; or 25 μg, lanes 25–32) were cotransfected with GST-STAT1 (2 μg), and pulse-chase-type experiments after IFNβ stimulation were performed in the absence or presence of the methylation inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4 E, a PIAS1 concentration-dependent inhibition of STAT1 dephosphorylation was only observed in the presence of MDA, whereas no such effect was evident in the absence of the methylation inhibitor. As IFNβ activates STAT proteins other than STAT1 that can form heterodimers with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, it seemed possible that such heterodimer formation exerts an influence over the kinetics of STAT1 dephosphorylation. We therefore performed similar STAT1 dephosphorylation experiments using IFNγ for stimulation of the cells since this interferon triggers exclusively the phosphorylation of STAT1. The effects of PIAS1 and arginine methylation on STAT1 dephosphorylation rates observed after IFNγ stimulation (Fig.4 F) parallel exactly the results obtained with the use of IFNβ (Fig. 4 E). To further demonstrate the specificity of PIAS1 in mediating the effects of the methylation inhibitors on STAT1 dephosphorylation, we also used PIAS3, which interacts with STAT3 but not with STAT1, in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 F, in contrast to PIAS1, PIAS3 is unable to alter the rate of STAT1 dephosphorylation in the presence of the methylation inhibitors. These results demonstrate that the presence of PIAS1 is essential in order for the methylation inhibitors to exert their negative regulatory effects. Furthermore, these findings also exclude the possibility that the MDA treatment might controversially affect the enzymatic activity of TcPTP. Arginine methylation has received increasing attention over the last year as several recent reports have illustrated a novel role for this post-translational modification in regulating protein-protein interaction and transcriptional induction (17Mowen K.A.

STAT1 was the first transcription factor reported to require arginine methylation for its function (17Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while STAT1 is unable to bind DNA in the absence of its arginine methylation, the lack of this modification causes a significant delay in STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation. Nevertheless, interference with the arginine methylation status of STAT1has no effect on the initial level of STAT1 Tyr-701 phosphorylation obtained after IFNα/β stimulation. Mutation of STAT1 Arg-31 results in decreased binding to TcPTP 2W. Zhu, T. Mustelin, and M. David, unpublished observation. as well as to PIAS1 (17Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In contrast, the results presented in Fig. 4, A andB, indicate that inhibition of STAT1 arginine methylation results in increased association with PIAS1 with a concomitant decrease in TcPTP binding, suggesting a possible competition of these two proteins for binding to STAT1. These results demonstrate that Arg-31 is a critical residue for binding of STAT1 to both PIAS1 and TcPTP, while methylation of the Arg-31 residue alters the relative preference for one of the two proteins. In summary, our data support a model in which arginine methylation of STAT1 regulates its interaction with PIAS1 and consequently with the nuclear tyrosine phosphatase TcPTP and thereby modulates the duration of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation.

We found that phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) was capable of inducing JNK activation and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines with distinct p53 statuses. PEITC induced JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling via a different pathway than that used by DNA-damaging agents, because genotoxicresistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells were equally sensitive to PEITC as parental LNCaP cells. PEITC did not induce significant MKK4 or MKK7 activation and did not activate JNK directly, suggesting that JNK and JNK upstream kinases are not primary targets of PEITC. The JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation rates were decreased in cells exposed to PEITC. Expression levels of M3/6, a JNK-specific phosphatase, were down-regulated by PEITC via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Taken together, our data suggest that PEITC activates JNK through suppression of JNK dephosphorylation and that PEITC may be an alternative therapeutic agent for cancers that are resistant to genotoxic agents. This study also reveals that JNK phosphatases are potential targets for the development of novel cancer therapeutic agents.

Mice whose endogenous c-jun has been replaced by a mutant jun allele (jun AA), which with serines 63 and 73 (the major JNK targets) mutated to alanines, are resistant to neuronal apoptosis induced by excitatory amino acid kainite (18Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar).jun AA fibroblasts are also resistant to UV-induced apoptosis (18Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F.

In addition,jnk1 −/− T cells hyperproliferate and exhibit decreased activation-induced apoptosis (20Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A.

Furthermore, cytochrome c release from mitochondria is not detected in UV-treated jnk1/jnk2-deficient cells, suggesting that JNK is required for cytochrome c release (22Tournier C. Hess P.

Isothiocyanates inhibit cancer formation in rat lung, esophagus, mammary gland, liver, small intestine, colon, and bladder (24Wattenberg L.W.

Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, isothiocyanates may increase the carcinogen excretion or detoxification by inducing the phase II detoxifying enzymes, including glutathione S-transferase (GST), quinone reductase, epoxide hydrolase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (30Guo Z.

Previously, we reported that phenylmethyl isothiocyanate (benzyl isothiocyanate) and phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) are capable of inducing persistent JNK activation and apoptosis in various cell types (33Yu R. Jiao J.-J. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Our study suggests the involvement of JNK-mediated apoptosis in the anticarcinogenic functions of isothiocyanates and implicates a therapeutic potential for dietary isothiocyanates. To better understand the anticancer mechanism of dietary isothiocyanates, we examined the effect of PEITC, a predominant isothiocyanate in cruciferous vegetables, on cancer cells that are resistant to genotoxic agents. We also studied the mechanism of PEITC-induced JNK activation. PEITC induced JNK-mediated apoptosis through a distinct pathway from that used by genotoxic agents, because prostate cancer cells that are resistant to DNA-damaging agents are still sensitive to PEITC. Our results indicate that JNK upstream kinases and JNK are not primary targets of PEITC. PEITC may induce JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling through suppressing the JNK phosphatase activity. M3/6, a JNK-specific phosphatase, is down-regulated by PEITC via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Our study also reveals that JNK phosphatases are potential targets for development of cancer therapeutic agents. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were kindly provided by K.-M.

DU145 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Parental LNCaP cells were exposed to 10 Gy of γ radiation twice in a 1-week interval. Cells that survived the radiation treatment were recovered and propagated to establish the radiation-resistant LNCaP-IR10 cells. Individual LNCaP clones were isolated from the LNCaP-IR10 mixed population by the limiting dilution method, and their sensitivities to genotoxic stimuli were determined by JNK activation and apoptosis in these clones in response to various genotoxic agents.

JNK assays were performed as described previously (35Chen Y.-R. Shrivastava A. Tan T.-H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MKK4 (or MKK7) assays were carried out similarly as JNK assays, except that the transfected FLAG-MKK4 (or MKK7) was affinity-purified by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, and the assays were performed using the recombinant GST-SAPK(KR) protein (4 μg per reaction) as a substrate. ATP depletion was performed as described with modifications (45Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Mosser D.D. Zon L. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell.

Cells, with or without pretreatments, were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) preheated to 37 °C, and then incubated in PBS containing 15 μm rotenone (Sigma) and 25 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose (Sigma) for indicated times to inhibit ATP synthesis. Previously, we have shown that a dietary isothiocyanate, PEITC, induces apoptosis in a JNK-dependent manner (34Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To further investigate the anticancer mechanism of PEITC, we treated various prostate cancer cell lines, including LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, and Tsu-Pr1, with PEITC. These cells have distinct p53 statuses. LNCaP cells express wild-type p53; PC-3 as well as Tsu-Pr1 cells are p53-null; and DU145 cells express mutated p53 proteins (48Carroll A.G. Voeller H.J. Sugars L. Gelmann E.P. The Prostate. 1993; 23: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 49Issacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar). Three methods were used to examine PEITC-induced apoptosis in these prostate cancer cell lines (Fig.1). Using flow cytometry analyses, we detected apoptosis induction, as defined by the appearance of cells with a sub-G1 staining pattern, in all four prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 1 A). Apoptosis was also observed in all the tested cell lines using the cleavage of HIP-55 (hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1-interacting protein of 55 kDa), a known substrate of caspases (37Chen Y.-R. Kori R. John B. Tan T.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 981-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as a readout for caspase activation (Fig.1 B). Furthermore, DNA fragmentation, a hallmark event in apoptotic cells, was also detected in the four cell lines treated with PEITC (Fig. 1 C). These results reveal that PEITC can induce apoptosis regardless of the p53 status of the target cells. We observed sustained JNK activation, which has been shown to be involved in apoptosis induction, by PEITC in all four tested cell lines (Fig. 2 A). We further examined whether PEITC induced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a p53-dependent gene. LNCaP cells were treated with various doses (2.5–40 μm) of PEITC for 24 h, and the expression levels of p21 were examined by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). The expression of p21 in LNCaP cells exposed to γ radiation was used as a positive control. In contrast to the strong p21 expression induced by γ radiation, the induction of p21 was not significant (2-fold induction) in PEITC-treated LNCaP cells (Fig. 2 B). Our results indicate that PEITC-induced JNK activation and apoptosis are not dependent on the presence of functional p53 proteins. In addition, unlike γ radiation, PEITC did not induce significant p21 expression. These results suggest that PEITC induces apoptotic signaling through a mechanism distinct from that used by DNA-damaging agents. The results in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that PEITC can be used to eliminate cancer cells that are resistant to genotoxic agents. To support this notion, we established LNCaP cell clones that are resistant to commonly used genotoxic agents for further tests of apoptotic effects of PEITC (see “Experimental Procedures”). One LNCaP clone, LNCaP-IR10.1, was established from a γ radiation-resistant mixed population. LNCaP-IR10.1 cells are more resistant to γ radiation, as well as cisplatin and 5-FU treatments in comparison to parental LNCaP cells (Fig.3, A–C). Consistent with the decreases in apoptosis induction, LNCaP-IR10.1 cells also had lower or no JNK activation in response to γ radiation, cisplatin, and 5-FU (Fig. 4). The apoptosis-resistant phenotype of LNCaP-IR10.1 cells was not due to a fundamental defect in apoptosis machinery, because this clone was equally sensitive to Fas ligation-induced apoptosis as the parental LNCaP cells (Fig.3 D), suggesting that the downstream apoptotic effectors were functional. Interestingly, we observed comparable levels of JNK activation and apoptosis induction by PEITC between parental LNCaP cells and LNCaP-IR10.1 cells (Fig. 5). These results indicate that PEITC is capable of inducing JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling in cancer cells that are resistant to multiple genotoxic agents.Figure 4LNCaP-IR10.1 cells have decreased or no JNK activation in response to cancer therapeutic agents. Parental LNCaP cells and LNCaP-IR10.1 cells (IR10.1) were treated with or without γ radiation (40 Gy, panel A), cisplatin (10 μg/ml, panel B), or 5-FU (100 μm,panel C). Cells were collected at various time points after the treatments, and the endogenous JNK activity was examined by immunocomplex kinase assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5LNCaP-IR10.1 cells are responsive to PEITC in JNK activation and apoptosis induction. A, parental LNCaP cells and IR10.1 cells were treated with PEITC (20 μm) for indicated times, and the cells were collected for JNK assays. B and C, parental LNCaP and IR10.1 cells were treated with PEITC (2.5–40 μm) for 24 h, and the cells were collected and examined for DNA fragmentation (panel B). Cleavage of HIP-55 was examined by Western blotting using an anti-HIP-55 antibody (Ab571) (panel C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To exclude the possibility that what we observed are phenomena associated with a particular cell clone, we extended the study to other LNCaP clones. As shown in Fig. 6, three additional LNCaP clones (IR10.10–12) that were more resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis also lost JNK activation in response to cisplatin (Fig. 6, A and B). When these three clones were exposed to PEITC, all of them had similar levels of JNK activation and apoptosis induction in comparison with that in the parental LNCaP cells (Fig. 6, C and D). These data, along with the results in Figs. 1 and 2, suggest that PEITC uses a distinct mechanism to induce JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling from that used by genotoxic agents, therefore, cancer cells that are resistant to DNA-damaging agents are still sensitive to PEITC. We then examined the mechanism of JNK activation by PEITC. If PEITC induces JNK activation through the activation of upstream kinases, we should be able to detect the activation of the immediate JNK upstream kinases, MKK4 or MKK7 (2Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed FLAG-tagged MKK4 or MKK7 in DU145 prostate cancer cells. The transfected cells were then treated with PEITC (20 μm) or UV-C (90 J/m2) to induce JNK activation (Fig.7 A). Potential activation of MKK4 and MKK7 were examined by immunocomplex kinase assays using GST-SAPK(KR) (a kinase-dead JNK fusion protein) as a substrate. Although UV-C induced evident MKK4 and MKK7 activation, we did not observe any significant activation of MKK4 and MKK7 by PEITC (Fig.7 A). This result suggests that activation of JNK upstream kinases may not be the major mechanism for JNK activation by PEITC. It is also possible that PEITC may activate JNK directly. We tested this possibility by examining the effect of PEITC on recombinant JNK proteins. GST-SAPK (JNK) proteins were exposed to various doses of PEITC and then were subjected to kinase assays using GST-Jun-(1–79) as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 7 B, incubation of recombinant JNK proteins with PEITC did not increase JNK activity, because the trans-phosphorylation of JNK and the phosphorylation on GST-Jun-(1–79) were not affected significantly. This result indicates that PEITC may not have an activating effect on JNK directly. Intracellular JNK activity is controlled by upstream kinases and by dual-specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate and inactivate JNK (2Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar, 9Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 1999; 14: 6-16Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Activation of JNK upstream kinases, a decrease in JNK phosphatase activity, or the combination of both can lead to JNK activation. Because we did not observe any significant activation of MKK4 and MKK7 by PEITC (Fig. 7 A), and PEITC did not activate JNK directly (Fig. 7 B), it is possible that JNK activation by PEITC was due to the decrease in JNK phosphatase activity and, subsequently, the accumulation of JNK activity through the basal activities of upstream kinases. To test this possibility, we examined the JNK inactivation rate by measuring the decrease of JNK activity post depletion of intracellular ATP, which prevented further activation of JNK by upstream kinases. DU145 prostate cancer cells were exposed to PEITC or UV-C for induction of JNK, then were treated with rotenone, an inhibitor of the respiratory chain, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, for ATP depletion (45Meriin A.B.

Physiol. 2000; 279: F688-F697PubMed Google Scholar). Upon depletion of ATP, JNK activity was rapidly decreased in cells treated with UV-C (Fig. 8, A and C). In contrast, the decrease of JNK activity was slower in cells treated with PEITC post-ATP depletion (Fig. 8, A and C). Similar results were observed in LNCaP cells treated with PEITC or UV-C (Fig. 8, B and C). These results suggest that the inactivation rate of JNK is slower in cells treated with PEITC in comparison with that in UV-C-treated cells. Because the inactivation of JNK is mainly controlled by dual-specificity phosphatases, which dephosphorylate JNK at the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif (9Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 1999; 14: 6-16Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar), we examined whether JNK dephosphorylation was suppressed in PEITC-treated cells. The JNK phosphorylation status was examined by Western blot analyses using a monoclonal antibody specifically recognized JNK that was phosphorylated at the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. Consistent with the results of kinase assays (Fig. 8,A–C), the dephosphorylation of JNK in PEITC-treated cells post-ATP depletion was slower in comparison with that in UV-C-treated cells (Fig. 8, D and E). Taken together, these results suggest that PEITC activates JNK through suppressing the dephosphorylation and inactivation process of JNK proteins. Our previous result indicates that PEITC may cause oxidative stress (34Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

To understand its broad significance, we have carried out systematic studies of PCNA-binding proteins by a combination of affinity chromatography and mass spectrometric analyses. We detected more than 20 specific protein bands of various intensities in fractions bound to PCNA-fixed resin from human cell lysates and determined their peptide sequences by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. A search with human protein data bases identified 12 reported PCNA-binding proteins from both cytoplasmic (S100 lysate) and nuclear extracts with substantial significance and four more solely from the nuclear preparation. CHL12, a factor involved in checkpoint response and chromosome cohesion, was a novel example found in both lysates. Further studies with recombinant proteins demonstrated that CHL12 and small subunits of replication factor C form a complex that interacts with PCNA."

We propose that selective binding of p53 to various promoters may be determined by the DNA conformation within p53 cognate sites. A major function of the tumor suppressor p53 is that of a pleiotropic transcription factor controlling the expression of target genes by either activating or inhibiting the activity of p53-responsive promoters. p53 has several DNA binding activities of which sequence-specific DNA binding (SSDB) 1The abbreviations used are: SSDB, sequence-specific DNA binding; CON, control; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; DBD, DNA binding domain; dec, decamer; EGF-R, epidermal growth factor receptor; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; MUT, mutated; ODN, oligonucleotide; PRE, p53-response element; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; wt, wild-type. (1el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Google Scholar) is the most important because it is indispensable for the transcriptional activity of the protein. The importance of SSDB is highlighted by the fact that the most frequent p53 mutations found in human cancers are located within the DNA binding domain encoding region (2Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar, 3Hussain S.P. Harris C.C. Mutat. Res. 1999; 428: 23-32Google Scholar) and abrogate the SSDB of p53. The specific interaction of p53 with target DNA is complex and tightly regulated. Promoter recognition by p53 is determined by the presence of p53-response elements (PREs), which share homology with the consensus sequence 5′-(PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy)n-3′ (1el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Google Scholar). C-terminally unmodified p53 seems to be inactive in SSDB; however, modifications at the C terminus, like binding of the C-terminal-specific antibody PAb421, phosphorylation, or deletion of the 30 C-terminal amino acids, strongly enhance SSDB under certainin vitro conditions (4Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Google Scholar). The data indicate that the C terminus regulates binding of p53 to target DNA, although the underlying mechanisms are not entirely understood. Several models have been proposed to explain the influence of the C-terminal domain on SSDB by p53. The conformation model postulates that the p53 protein exists in two conformationally distinct forms termedlatent (for DNA-binding inactive p53) andactivated (for DNA-binding active p53). According to this model, the C-terminal domain in latent p53 interacts directly with the core domain and thereby inhibits SSDB of p53 (5Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Google Scholar). A conformational switch was proposed as the mechanism that relieves the allosteric inhibition by the C terminus and converts p53 from latent into an activated form. However, such a hypothesis is not supported by the results of structural studies that recently demonstrated that the conformation of DNA binding-inactive and DNA binding-active p53 forms is largely identical (6Ayed A. Mulder F.A., Yi, G.S., Lu, Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the C terminus may regulate SSDB by other mechanisms. The competition modelexplains the inhibitory effect of the C-terminal domain by its ability to bind DNA unspecifically (7Anderson M.E. Woelker B. Reed M. Wang P. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6255-6264Google Scholar). According to this model, unspecific DNA binding of the C terminus interferes with the sequence-specific interaction with DNA mediated by the core domain. Modifications of the C terminus, such as phosphorylation or binding of PAb421, may displace unspecific bound DNA and thereby facilitate SSDB (7Anderson M.E. Woelker B. Reed M. Wang P. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6255-6264Google Scholar). Both models suggest that SSDB is inhibited by the C terminus directly (conformation model) or indirectly (competition model), thereby necessitating the activation of p53 for SSDB. However, an alternative view is that SSDB of p53 is not inhibited by the C terminus and therefore does not need activation under more physiological conditions. Espinosa and Emerson (8Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar) observed that the p53 C terminus inhibited SSDB to the p21 promoter only in short naked DNA, but not when the p21 promoter was assembled into chromatin in vitro (8Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar). Moreover, deletion of the C terminus decreased SSDB and, consequently, transactivation of the chromatin-assembledp21 promoter (8Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar). The findings indicate that SSDB of p53 requires a certain level of structural DNA organization, which may be missing in short linear DNA. Commonly, two identical repeats of the 5′-(PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy)n-3′ sequence are used in DNA binding assays as a p53 target binding site. However, the comparison of such “optimized” binding sites with functional PREs identified in various p53-regulated promoters reveals that “natural” p53 binding sites differ significantly from the optimized version. Notably, known PREs are never composed of identical decamers (Table I). Furthermore, because of the high frequency of bases deviating from the consensus, PREs exhibit significant sequence diversity (Table I). Typically, only one decamer (half-site) stringently adheres to the consensus, whereas the other decamer(s) deviate from the consensus to a varying extent. In PREs of some p53-regulated genes, all decamers contain bases that violate the consensus (e.g. c-Ha-ras, pig3,fas/apo1, tgf-α). Contente et al. (11Kim E. Rohaly G. Heinrichs S. Gimnopoulos D. Meissner H. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7310-7318Google Scholar) have recently reported that the p53-dependent transcription of the pig3 gene is critically dependent on the presence of a (TGYCC)n pentanucleotide repeat and not on the p53-consensus sequence identified previously (9Contente A. Dittmer A. Koch M.C. Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 315-320Google Scholar). The (TGYCC)n pentanucleotide repeat is part of a microsatellite sequence and bears only very limited sequence homology to the p53 consensus. Nevertheless, this sequence mediates sequence-specific transactivation of pig3 by p53, whereas the consensus-like binding site from the pig3 promoter appears to be dispensable (9Contente A. Dittmer A. Koch M.C. Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 315-320Google Scholar). The sequence variance among PREs is puzzling because it remains unclear how the sequence heterogeneity of PREs is compatible with the required high specificity for their interaction with p53. As an explanation, we and others have proposed that the sequence variance of PREs may be important to provide DNA with structural flexibility, which appears to be an important parameter determining p53 interactions with DNA (8Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar, 10Kim E. Albrechtsen N. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 857-869Google Scholar, 11Kim E. Rohaly G. Heinrichs S. Gimnopoulos D. Meissner H. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7310-7318Google Scholar). p53 binding to unusual DNA structures has been demonstrated in studies investigating the involvement of p53 in repair and recombination pathways (12Degtyareva N. Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8778-8784Google Scholar, 13Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Google Scholar, 14Dudenhoffer C. Rohaly G. Will K. Deppert W. Wiesmuller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5332-5342Google Scholar). So far, the two modes of p53 interaction with DNA, sequence-specific and DNA structure-dependent, have been studied independently from each other. With regard to SSDB, only the presence of the specific cognate motif has been considered. However, it is likely that the presence of the specific sequence motif is not the only parameter determining specific binding of p53 to its cognate sites, which may also be influenced by structural features of DNA (8Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Google Scholar, 10Kim E. Albrechtsen N. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 857-869Google Scholar,15Palecek E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brazda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R.

Boldface and underlined sequences correspond to decamers that perfectly conform to the p53 consensus. In this study we analyzed the impact of DNA structure on the sequence-specific interaction of p53 with PREs derived from known p53 regulated promoters and with target binding sites containing variations of the consensus motif. We demonstrate that the presentation of specific binding sites in a nonlinear stem-loop conformation determines strong binding of p53 which does not require C-terminal modification by PAb421. Our data demonstrate that the C-terminal domain exerts opposite effects on the interaction of p53 with target sites depending on the conformation of the DNA; while inhibiting the specific interaction of p53 with linear DNA, the C terminus is required for the specific binding to stem-loop DNA. Our data may therefore provide a base for understanding the complex regulation of p53 interactions with DNA. With regard to transcriptional activation, selective promoter recognition might be determined by both binding of other proteins at the C terminus of p53 and by structural organization of the DNA within the p53 target binding sites. All DNA substrates were prepared from synthetic oligonucleotides (ODNs) listed in TableII. To obtain the PRE-p21 in a linear form, the PRE-p21(lin/s) DNA was end labeled with T4 polynucleotide DNA kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with unlabeled complementary PRE-p21(lin/as) DNA at a molar ratio of 1:1. Non-linear DNA substrates containing short stem-loop structures on one strand were obtained by annealing of two oligonucleotides from which only the shorter, T3-1 oligonucleotide was radiolabeled at the 5′-end. The longer oligonucleotides contained 13 bases at the 5′-end which were complementary to 13 bases at the 3′-end of T3-1 DNA, and 12 bases at the 3′-end complementary to 12 bases at the 5′-end of T3-1. The central parts of the longer oligonucleotides were comprised of self-complementary sequences either containing or lacking p53-specific cognate motifs (Table II). Annealing of the T3-1 ODN with a stem-loop-forming oligonucleotide allowed the formation of a three-way junction structure that contained a stem-loop on one strand. Such DNA structures can be easily distinguished from single-stranded or linear double-stranded DNA molecules in 8% native polyacrylamide gels (shown in Fig. 2 A) allowing their purification. Eluted DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8) and 60 mm NaCl, and used in electromobility shift assay (EMSA) or DNase I protection experiments.Table IIOligonucleotides used for the preparation of DNA substrates in linear or in stem-loop DNA conformationODNs for linear dsDNAads, double-stranded.

Recombinant p53 proteins expressed in insect cells were isolated as described by Bessard et al. (16Bessard A.C. Garay E. Lacronique V. Legros Y. Demarquay C. Houque A. Portefaix J.M. Granier C. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 883-890Google Scholar) and purified by ion exchange chromatography (FPLC, AmershamBiosciences). DNA binding experiments were performed using 50 ng of recombinant p53 proteins in a reaction mixture containing 5 ng of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 50 mmNaCl. After a 20-min preincubation at room temperature, 20,000 cpm of the labeled DNA probe was added, and the incubation was continued for another 25 min. Samples were loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm NaOAc, and 8 mm acetic acid at 200 V for 2.5 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. DNA binding was performed in the same binding buffer as in EMSA. After the binding step, the samples were supplemented with equal volumes of 10 mmCaCl2 and 20 mm MgCl2 solution and treated with 10 units of DNase I (Promega) for 10 min at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by adding an inactivating buffer containing 0.15m NaOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.05 mg/ml yeast RNA. After treatment with phenol-chloroform, labeled DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dried. After resuspension, samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 20% denaturing gels containing 8 m urea. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The oligomeric status of p53 bound to DNA was analyzed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking as described by Wang et al. (17Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Google Scholar). Briefly, p53 was incubated with radioactively labeled DNA to allow complex formation. The p53-DNA complex was resolved by electrophoresis in a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (TBE buffer, 2 h at room temperature) along with the mixture of p53 oligomers used as a reference for the mobility of different oligomeric forms of p53. Various oligomers of p53 were obtained by incubating purified wt p53 protein with different concentrations of freshly diluted glutaraldehyde for 60 min on ice. Before electrophoresis the cross-linked protein samples were boiled in 2% SDS to reverse cross-linking. After electrophoresis, semidry double-membrane transfer was performed as described by Demczuk et al. (18Demczuk S. Harbers M. Vennstrom B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Google Scholar) using two membranes, nitrocellulose and Hybond N+, which selectively bind proteins or DNA, respectively. After blotting, p53 protein bound to nitrocellulose was immunodetected with a mixture of p53-specific antibodies PAb421, PAb240, DO-1, and PAb1801. Radioactively labeled DNA bound to the Hybond N+membrane was detected by autoradiography. Stem-loop DNA with a 64-bp stem was prepared from four unlabeled oligonucleotides as depicted in Fig.6 A. Phosphorylated Stem-1 DNA was annealed with unphosphorylated Stem-2 DNA at a 1:1 molar ratio. 12 nucleotides at the 3′-end of the Stem-1 DNA (56 bp) and 13 nucleotides at the 5′-end of the Stem-2 DNA (51 bp) were complementary to the T3-1 DNA (25 bp) but not to each other. The resulting DNA I contains 12- and 13-nucleotide single-stranded ends and six protruding bases at the 5′-phosphorylated end formed by the Stem-1 DNA. DNA I was ligated with a third, self-complementary oligonucleotide loop, which was self-annealed prior to ligation. Loop DNA was phosphorylated at the 5′-end and contained six protruding nucleotides that were complementary to six nucleotides protruding at the 5′-end of Stem-1 DNA. The presence of phosphorylated 5′-ends in Stem-1 and Loop DNAs permitted unidirectional ligation of compatible ends in DNA I and self-annealed Loop DNA (step 2). After ligation, samples were loaded onto a 1.6% agarose gel, and the slowest migrating DNA band was isolated from the gel (step 3). DNA II was recovered by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in annealing buffer, and quantified by spectroscopy at 260 nm. To confirm that ligation had occurred between the 3′-end of the Stem-2 and the 5′-end of the Loop oligonucleotides, 0.1 μg of isolated DNA II was end labeled with T4 polynucleotide DNA kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and sequenced by the Maxam-Gilbert chemical degradation method. DNA II was annealed with T3-1 oligonucleotide at a 1:1 molar ratio (step 4), and the resulting structure (DNA III) was isolated from a 1.6% agarose gel (step 5). After ethanol precipitation DNA III was resuspended in 10 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.5) buffer and used for electron microscopy experiments. As a linear DNA binding substrate we used a 474 bp fragment obtained from a pPGM1 plasmid containing a specific p53 cognate motive (5′-AGACATGCCTAGACATGCCT-3′) located at ∼40% from one end of the fragment (19Cherny D.I. Striker G. Subramaniam V. Jett S.D. Palecek E. Jovin T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1015-1026Google Scholar). For electron microscopy, DNA-p53 complexes were prepared by incubating the DNA and p53 in 10 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 0.01% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30–40 min. The molar protein:DNA ratio was as indicated in the legend of Fig. 6 B. After incubation, an aliquot (1–2 μl) was taken from the mixture, diluted 20-fold in a 10 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl-containing buffer, and applied to the surface of carbon film mounted on an EM grid. 3–4-nm carbon films were activated by glow discharge in the presence of pentylamine vapor (residual pressure ∼150 millitorr, discharge current 2–3 mA, duration of discharge 30 s as described in Ref. 20Dubochet J. Ducommun M. Zollinger M. Kellenberger E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1971; 35: 147-167Google Scholar). The adsorption continued for 2–4 min, then the grids were rinsed with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, blotted with filter paper, and air-dried. The samples were analyzed with a Philips CM12 electron microscope in a tilted dark field mode at × 60,000 magnification. The negatives were scanned with an Agfa Studio Scan IIsi scanner at 1,200 dpi. For printing, images were processed using a high pass filter with a radius of 250 pixels. We selected PREs from the p53-regulated p21,egf-r, and tgf-α promoters to analyze the binding of recombinant human wt p53 protein. The PREs share little homology in sequence and in the number of decamers composing the p53 binding site (Table I). However, they all exhibit a 2-fold symmetry that allows intrastrand base pairing of self-complementary regions either between different decamers (structures (b) in Fig.1) or within the same decamer (structures (c)). For example, PRE-p21 has the potential to form two different stem-loop structures. Structure (b) would be formed by both decamers aligned symmetrically against each other; in structure (c) only one decamer would be fully located within stem-loop, and the other decamer would mostly be located at the junction of the structure. We reconstituted both types of stem-loops that may be formed by either two or by one decamer from PRE-p21 by using an approach commonly used for the preparation of cruciform DNA and stem-loop structures (21Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Google Scholar, 22Pearson C.E. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Zorbas H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1571-1580Google Scholar). Briefly, two ODNs of different length are annealed, with only the longer ODN containing the PRE-specific sequence. A shorter oligonucleotide is complementary only to the PRE-flanking sequences in the longer oligonucleotide but is lacking the PRE-complementary sequence. Annealing of the longer and the shorter oligonucleotides yields an asymmetric structure in which the upper, PRE-specific sequence is folded back on itself and forms a stem-loop, locked by the shorter, PRE-lacking oligonucleotide (Fig.2 A). We analyzed binding of p53 to linear or to stem-loop DNA by EMSA using recombinant human wt p53 protein purified from insect cells (Fig.2 B). The results showed that p53 did not bind to PRE-p21 when it was present in linear DNA conformation unless antibody PAb421, directed against a C-terminal epitope of p53, was added (Fig.2 C, compare lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, when two decamers of PRE-p21 formed a stem-loop, p53 bound strongly in the absence of PAb421 (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). Moreover, in contrast to the enhancement of p53 binding to linear PRE-p21, PAb421 inhibited binding to stem-loop DNA (comparelanes 2 and 3). Complex formation with PRE-p21 in stem-loop conformation was strictly dependent on the p53 concentration. As shown in Fig. 2 D, nearly all DNA probe representing stem-loop PRE-p21 was bound in the presence of 100 ng of p53 in the absence of PAb421, whereas with linear PRE-p21, no binding could be detected under the same conditions (compare lanes 10 and20). Surprisingly, stem-loop DNA formed by only one decamer of the PRE-p21 was also bound strongly by p53. The binding did not require PAb421 (Fig. 2 E, lane 2); in contrast, addition of PAb421 led to a significant inhibition of p53 binding (lane 3). The same decamer in linear DNA form was not bound by p53 at all, regardless of the presence or absence of PAb421 (Fig.2 E, lanes 4–6). The results demonstrate that the presence of only one specific decamer may already be sufficient for strong binding of p53 provided that it is presented in a stem-loop and not in a linear conformation of DNA. A similar binding pattern was observed with stem-loop structures containing p53 cognate motifs derived from PRE-TGF-α and PRE-EGF-R (Fig. 2 F), indicating that the interaction of p53 with target binding sites in non-linear DNA conformation is a general phenomenon, and not a peculiar feature of PRE-p21. Transcriptionally competent p53 must be present as a tetramer (23Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Google Scholar,24Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. el-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Google Scholar). Therefore, the question of whether or not p53 binds to stem-loop DNA in its transcriptionally active (tetrameric) form is of physiological relevance. We analyzed the oligomerization status of p53 bound to stem-loop DNA by using an approach optimized for the analysis of the oligomeric status of p53 in complex with DNA (17Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Google Scholar). The results show that in complex with stem-loop DNA (Fig.3, lanes 3 and 3′) p53 was present predominantly as a tetramer (lane 3 in theprotein blot panel). We conclude that the interaction of tetrameric p53 with linear and stem-loop DNA is determined by different modes of DNA binding: p53 tetramer binds readily to stem-loop DNA, but its binding to linear DNA requires modification at the C terminus such as interactions with other proteins, which mimic binding of PAb421. An important question arising from the high affinity interaction of p53 with stem-loop DNA is whether stem-loop binding is sequence-specific. To address this question we prepared a set of stem-loops containing either a pe"

We examined the activities of recombinant variants of CD46, including different isoforms as well as engineered truncations and molecular chimeras with decay-accelerating factor, a related protein in the family of regulators of complement activation (RCA). We observed strong receptor activity for all four CD46 isoforms, which differ in the membrane-proximal extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, indicating that the critical determinants for HHV-6 receptor activity reside outside the C-terminal portion of CD46. Analysis of the short consensus repeat (SCR) regions that comprise most of the extracellular portion of CD46 indicated a strong dependence on SCRs 2 and 3 and no requirement for SCRs 1 or 4. Fusion-inhibition studies with SCR-specific monoclonal antibodies supported the essential role of SCRs 2 and 3 in HHV-6 receptor activity. These findings contrast markedly with fusion mediated by measles virus glycoproteins for which we observed a strict dependence on SCRs 1 and 2, consistent with previous reports. These results expand the emerging notion that CD46 and other members of the RCA family are co-opted in distinct manners by different infectious pathogens.

Both subgroups preferentially replicate in CD4+ T lymphocytes, although they can infect, productively or nonproductively, a broader range of human cell types. HHV-6 B is virtually ubiquitous in the adult human population worldwide and is the cause of exanthema subitum, a febrile disease of infancy which is usually benign but may be accompanied by neurologic complications. Under conditions of immunosuppression, HHV-6 can cause serious opportunistic infections, and may have direct immunosuppressive effects. Moreover, HHV-6 infection may act as a cofactor to accelerate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression. Consistent with the ability of HHV-6 to infect the central nervous system, the virus has been suggested to play a role in multiple sclerosis, although this notion remains controversial (4Jacobson S. J. Neuroviro. 1998; 4: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Like other well studied herpesviruses (5Spear P.G. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Virology. 2000; 275: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), HHV-6 appears to enter target cells by a process involving direct pH-independent membrane fusion between the virion envelope and the plasma membrane. Infection can be mediated by both virion/cell and cell/cell fusion. We recently demonstrated that human CD46 (also known as membrane cofactor protein) is a major cellular receptor for HHV-6 (both subgroups A and B) (6Santoro F. Kennedy P.E. Locatelli G. Malnati M.S. Berger E.A. Lusso P. Cell. 1999; 99: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Our conclusions were based on analyses of virus entry/infectivity as well as the related process of HHV-6 glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion; in both types of assays, expression of recombinant CD46 rendered nonpermissive cells susceptible to HHV-6 entry and cell fusion (gain of function) and specific CD46 blocking agents inhibited both processes in target cells endogenously expressing CD46 (loss of function). CD46 is a member of a family of glycoproteins called regulators of complement activation (RCA); these proteins serve to protect autologous host cells from complement-mediated lysis (reviewed in 7, 8). The human genome encodes at least 6 RCA glycoproteins, some membrane-associated and others fluid-phase. Most are characterized by the presence of partially homologous short consensus repeats (SCRs). Each SCR motif contains ∼60 amino acids including 4 cysteines that form two conserved disulfide bonds, as well as a few additional conserved residues. The SCRs are tandemly linked beginning at the N terminus. CD46 is a 57- to 67-kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on most or all human nucleated cell types; it regulates complement activity by binding C3b or C4b and promoting their proteolytic cleavage by plasma serine protease factor I. Most of the extracellular portion of CD46 is composed of 4 SCRs (1Lusso P. Antiviral Res. 1996; 31: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Yamanishi K. Baillieres Clin. Infect. Dis. 1996; 3: 507-518Google Scholar, 3Campadelli-Fiume G. Mirandola P. Menotti L. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Jacobson S. J. Neuroviro. 1998; 4: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); SCRs 1, 2, and 4 contain sites for N-linked glycosylation. The SCRs are followed by a region rich in serine, threonine, and proline (STP region, containing sites for O-linked glycosylation), a small region of unknown significance, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Four distinct CD46 isoforms generated by alternative RNA splicing are expressed differentially in various cell types; all contain the same SCRs but differ in the STP and cytoplasmic regions. Decay accelerating factor (DAF, also designated CD55) is another membrane-associated RCA protein widely distributed on different cell and tissue types; it regulates complement activity by promoting the irreversible dissociation of complement convertases. Like CD46, DAF contains four SCRs followed by an STP region but is attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. CD46, DAF, and some other RCA proteins have been exploited by diverse viral and bacterial pathogens (recently reviewed in 7–10). The most extensively studied interaction is the use of CD46 as a binding and entry receptor for certain strains of measles virus (MV), first reported in 1993 (11Dorig R.E. Marcil A. Chopra A. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 12Naniche D. Varior-Krishnan G. Cervoni F. Wild T.F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J.

Subsequent studies focused on identifying critical domains of CD46 required for MV receptor function, using functional assays of viral infectivity and/or cell fusion as well as binding assays of MV virions or hemagglutinin (HA) (13Manchester M.

The results point to a critical role of CD46 SCRs 1 and 2 for MV receptor activity. In the present report, we examined the CD46 determinants required for HHV-6 receptor function. We used a quantitative cell fusion assay to test the functionality of the different CD46 variants (isoforms or genetic constructs), as well as the blocking effects of mAbs directed against defined CD46 domains. Our results highlight major differences in the CD46 determinants necessary for HHV-6 versus MV receptor activity. Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were derived from Leukopak preparations obtained from healthy adult blood donors by gradient (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) centrifugation. HSB-2, RK13, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. PBMCs and HSB-2 T-lymphocytes were maintained in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated for 45 min at 56 °C), 1% l-glutamine, and gentamicin (10 μg/ml). RK13 cells were maintained in Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and gentamicin (10 μg/ml). HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and gentamicin (10 μg/ml). Effector cells expressing the desired viral surface glycoproteins were generated either by using infected cells (HHV-6) or by using vaccinia recombinants encoding the desired glycoproteins. In all cases, the effectors also contained bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase encoded by vaccinia recombinant vTF7–3 (21Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). A multiplicity of infection of 10 was used for each vaccinia recombinant. For HHV-6 effectors, we used the immature human T-cell line HSB-2 infected with HHV-6; these were preferable over the previously used PBMCs (6Santoro F. Kennedy P.E. Locatelli G. Malnati M.S. Berger E.A. Lusso P. Cell. 1999; 99: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) because they give a markedly higher efficiency of fusion activity. To generate these HSB-2 effectors, 20 × 106PBMCs (at 2 × 106 cells/ml) were activated with phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) at 5–10 μg/ml for 2–3 days, then infected with cell-free HHV-6A (strain GS) (22Salahuddin S.Z. Ablashi D.V. Markham P.D. Josephs S.F. Sturzenegger S. Kaplan M. Halligan G. Biberfeld P. Wongstaal F. Kramarsky B. Gallo R.C. Science. 1986; 234: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C for 7 days. The infected PBMCs were then mixed with HSB-2 cells (1:5 ratio) in 2 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h; the co-cultures were diluted to 0.5 × 106 cells/ml with complete RPMI 1640 medium and incubated at 37 °C. Every 3–4 days the infected HSB-2 cells were co-cultured with uninfected HSB-2 cells (1:5 ratio); cultures could be maintained in this way for several weeks. For the cell fusion assay, HHV-6-infected HSB-2 cells were harvested when cell-surface viral glycoprotein expression was maximal (generally 3–4 days after initiation of a new co-culture); the cells were then infected with vaccinia virus vTF7–3. For MV effectors, NIH 3T3 cells were co-infected with vaccinia recombinants vT7-FMV and vT7-HMV encoding measles virus fusion (F) and HA glycoproteins, respectively (23Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Moss B. Stern L.B.L. Rozenblatt S. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as with vTF7–3. For the HIV-1 effectors, NIH 3T3 cells were co-infected with vaccinia recombinant MVA-89.6 (24Belyakov I.M. Wyatt L.S. Ahlers J.D. Earl P. Pendleton C.D. Kelsall B.L. Strober W. Moss B. Berzofsky J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8264-8272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the envelope glycoprotein from the 89.6 strain and with vTF7–3. The cells were diluted to 5 × 105 cells/ml with modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, incubated overnight at 31 °C to allow recombinant protein expression, and then washed and resuspended in the same medium.

HeLa target cells (which express endogenous CD46 and CXCR4) co-infected with vaccinia recombinants vCB-3 (encoding full length CD4) (33Broder C.C. Dimitrov D.S. Blumenthal R. Berger E.A. Virology. 1993; 193: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and vCB21R (described above) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with the designated concentrations of the indicated mAbs. The target cells were then mixed with effector cells expressing the designated glycoproteins, and the fusion assay was performed as indicated above. The relative cell-surface expression levels of CD46 and related constructs were determined by flow cytometry. 0.5 × 106 cells were suspended in 100 μl of medium and incubated 10 min at room temperature with the CD46 mAb J4.48 at 10 μg/ml; in experiments examining expression of constructs lacking CD46 SCR 1, a suitable mAb against a common SCR was employed. Cells were washed with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal bovine serum and suspended in 100 μl of this buffer. The cells were treated with 1 μl of anti-mouse phycoerythrin (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% formaldehyde. Fluorocytometric analysis was performed using a FacScan analyzer (BD Biosciences). 5,000 events were accumulated for each sample. We compared the ability of each of the four CD46 isoforms (BC1, BC2, C1, and C2) to function as a receptor for HHV-6. These differ in both their STP regions (B and C, or just C) and cytoplasmic tails (1 or 2). Each isoform was transiently expressed in RK13 cells using vaccinia-based transfection/infection technology. Flow cytometry was used to measure cell-surface expression on RK13 cells. As shown in Fig.1, similar expression levels were observed for all four isoforms. Immunoblot analysis also confirmed total expression of all isoforms (data not shown). Indeed, for all constructs analyzed in this report, efficient surface expression was documented by flow cytometry (data not shown). To study the HHV-6 receptor activity of CD46 variants, a vaccinia-based reporter gene cell fusion assay (29Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as previously modified for HHV-6 (6Santoro F. Kennedy P.E. Locatelli G. Malnati M.S. Berger E.A. Lusso P. Cell. 1999; 99: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) was employed. Effector cells were generated by infecting HSB-2 cells with HHV-6 (subgroup A, strain GS); after 3–4 days, the cells were infected with a vaccinia recombinant encoding bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. For targets, nonhuman RK13 cells were transfected with plasmids containing the genes for the various CD46 isoforms linked to a vaccinia promoter (or with the pSC59 parental vector as a negative control); the cells were then infected with a vaccinia recombinant containing the E. coli LacZ gene linked to the T7 promoter. After a 2.5-h incubation, cell fusion was scored by measuring β-galactosidase activity in nonionic detergent cell lysates. In this and all subsequent experiments, we compared results of HHV-6 fusion with MV fusion, which also depends on CD46 as a receptor; in this case effector NIH 3T3 cells co-expressed vaccinia-encoded MV F and HA glycoproteins. As shown in Fig. 2, HHV-6 effector cells used each of the four isoforms comparably (within a 2-fold range). These results indicate that the critical determinants on CD46 for HHV-6 receptor function do not reside in the STP B domain, and are independent of the cytoplasmic tail (1 or 2). Similar findings were obtained for MV fusion, consistent with previous reports (13Manchester M. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Oldstone M.B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2161-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,34Maisner A. Schneider-Schaulies J. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6299-6304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further delineate the CD46 determinants involved in HHV-6-mediated fusion, we examined target cells expressing chimeras between CD46 and DAF, the most closely related member of the RCA family. Fig. 3shows that full length DAF did not function for HHV-6 fusion. By contrast, fusion activity was observed with a chimera (CD46-GPI) containing all four SCRs of CD46 plus the STP B domain, linked to a small portion of the DAF STP region and GPI anchor. The HHV-6 receptor activity of the CD46-GPI chimera was comparable to that of wild-type CD46 (compare Figs. 3, 4, and 5; also data not shown). Together with the results described above, we concluded that the C-terminal regions of CD46 (membrane-proximal B and C STP domains and the unknown region, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail) are not required for HHV-6 receptor activity. Rather, the critical determinants are located in the SCR domains. Consistent with previous reports (14Manchester M. Valsamakis A. Kaufman R. Liszewski M.K. Alvarez J. Atkinson J.P. Lublin D.M. Oldstone M.B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), similar results were observed for MV fusion.Figure 4Fusion mediated by CD46 deletion mutants. Fusion was quantitated between effector cells (HHV-6,top panel; MV, bottom panel) expressing T7 RNA polymerase and NIH 3T3 target cells containing the LacZ gene and expressing the indicated CD46 deletion mutants; targets expressing no CD46 served as a negative control (NC).

Error bars indicate the standard deviations for duplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we tested chimeras with distinct CD46 SCRs cloned into the DAF background. Fig. 3 shows that no HHV-6 fusion occurred with any of the single CD46 SCR substitutions (chimeras DM1, DM2, DM3, and DM4). The same result was obtained for MV glycoprotein-mediated fusion, consistent with previous findings (14Manchester M. Valsamakis A. Kaufman R. Liszewski M.K. Alvarez J. Atkinson J.P. Lublin D.M. Oldstone M.B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, chimera DM234, containing SCR1 of DAF and SCRs 2, 3, and 4 of CD46, supported robust HHV-6 fusion, indicating that CD46 SCR1 is dispensable. However chimera DM12 containing SCRs 1 and 2 of CD46 and SCRs 3 and 4 of DAF failed to support HHV-6 fusion. The results for MV receptor activity were strikingly different; chimera DM234 was nonfunctional, whereas chimera DM12 gave potent activity. These results clearly demonstrate that distinct CD46 determinants are required for CD46 to serve as a receptor for HHV-6 versus MV: HHV-6 depends on some combination of determinants present in SCRs 2, 3, and 4, whereas MV requires SCRs 1 and 2, as previously reported (14Manchester M. Valsamakis A. Kaufman R. Liszewski M.K. Alvarez J. Atkinson J.P. Lublin D.M. Oldstone M.B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Iwata K.

To reconfirm the requirement for CD46 SCR1 and to test the need for CD46 SCR2 in HHV-6 fusion, we examined fusion mediated by two deletion mutants, one lacking SCR1 (Δ1-CD46) and another lacking SCR2 (Δ2-CD46). Consistent with the results presented in Fig. 3, HHV-6 effector cells were able to fuse with targets expressing Δ1-CD46. However, no fusion was observed with Δ2-CD46 (Fig. 4). By contrast, MV glycoproteins were unable to mediate fusion with targets expressing either deletion mutant, consistent with previous findings on the importance of SCRs 1 and 2 for MV receptor function (14Manchester M. Valsamakis A. Kaufman R. Liszewski M.K. Alvarez J. Atkinson J.P. Lublin D.M. Oldstone M.B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We concluded that determinants in CD46 SCR2 are required for HHV-6 receptor activity. To further delineate the CD46 determinants for HHV-6 fusion, we examined additional chimeras in which specific SCR domains of DAF were substituted for the corresponding domains in CD46 (Fig.5). Consistent with the above results, neither HHV-6 nor MV effectors fused with targets expressing chimera x1/2-DAF, which contains SCRs 1 and 2 of DAF within the CD46 background. Moreover, HHV-6 fusion did not occur with chimera x3-DAF, in which SCR3 of DAF replaced the corresponding region of CD46; by contrast, this chimera functioned efficiently for MV fusion, consistent with the MV dependence on only SCRs 1 and 2 of CD46. These results indicate the critical importance of CD46 SCR3 for HHV-6 receptor function, in marked contrast with the requirements for MV. Neither HHV-6 nor MV fusion required CD46 SCR4, as illustrated by the results with chimera x4-DAF, in which this region was replaced by SCR4 of DAF. As an additional approach to examine the CD46 domains essential for HHV-6 receptor function, we examined the effects of mAbs against individual SCRs in the fusion assay (Fig.6). Consistent with the results obtained with the genetic constructs, we observed that HHV-6 fusion with target cells expressing endogenous CD46 was inhibited by mAb M177, which is directed against SCR2 (15Iwata K. Seya T. Yanagi Y. Pesando J.M. Johnson P.M. Okabe M. Ueda S. Ariga H. Nagasawa S. J. Biol.

These results provide further support for the involvement of CD46 SCRs 2 and 3 in HHV-6 fusion. However, unexpected results were obtained with mAb Tra2.10 directed against SCR1 (18Buchholz C.J.

Many of the currently available antibiotics target enzymes involved in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall components. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are unique and complex glycolipids embedded in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. They are made of galactose, mannose, rhamnose, 4-acetamido-4, 6-dideoxyglucose, andN-acetylglucosamine. LPS consists of three structural domains, namely the hydrophobic lipid A, the core oligosaccharide, and the O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) (1Godfroid F. Cloeckaert A. Taminiau B. Danese I. Tibor A. de Bolle X. Mertens P. Letesson J.J. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Surface polymers have essential roles in the survival of bacteria with the enzymes involved in their formation often found critical to virulence (2Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and potentially a source of novel targets for therapeutic intervention. The enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) is a unique cell surface glycolipid that is present in all gram–negative enteric bacteria (3Kuhn H.M. Meier-Dieter U. Mayer H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 4: 195-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes involved in ECA synthesis cluster near the rfflocus. The product of the rffh gene is a glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.24) that catalyzes the reaction that combines dTTP with α-d-glucose 1-phosphate (G-1-P) 1The abbreviations used are: G-1-P, glucose 1-phosphate; GlmU, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase; NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; dTTP, deoxythymidine triphosphate; RffH, glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase; rms, root-mean-squares; dTDP, dioxythymidine diphosphate to yield pyrophosphate and dTDP-glucose. This reaction constitutes the first step in the synthesis of l-rhamnose, a component of the cell walls of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (4Shibaev V.N. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1986; 44: 277-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the Escherichia coli K12 genome, the rffh gene is paralogous to the rfba gene that encodes protein RmlA. The rfba gene is contained within the rfb gene cluster responsible for the synthesis of O-antigen (5Reeves P.R. Hobbs M. Valvano M.A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D. Kido N. Klena J. Maskell D. Raetz C.R. Rick P.D. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and its product RmlA catalyzes the same reaction as RffH. This duplication of function is reflected in a ∼68% amino acid sequence identity between these two enzymes. In addition, a second pair of closely related genes that encode two dTDP-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratases are also present in both clusters: rffg(rff cluster) and rfbb (rfb cluster). The presence of closely related genes in the rff andrfb clusters (both involved in the biosynthesis ofO-polysaccharides) is not unique for these two families (5Reeves P.R. Hobbs M. Valvano M.A. Skurnik M. Whitfield C. Coplin D. Kido N. Klena J. Maskell D. Raetz C.R. Rick P.D.

A similar duplication of functions has been reported for the GDP-mannose biosynthesis genes rfbM and rfbK with genes cpsB and cpsG from the cps cluster involved in the biosynthesis of colonic acid (7Stevenson G. Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rfb cluster also encodes three other enzymes involved in the l-rhamnose synthesis pathway, rmlB, rmlC, andrmlD (8Tsukioka Y. Yamashita Y. Oho T. Nakano Y. Koga T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway is not found in mammals, which makes these enzymes potential targets for development of antibacterial drugs. The structure of RmlB has also been described recently (9Allard S.T. Giraud M.F. Whitfield C. Graninger M. Messner P. Naismith J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Allard S.T. Beis K. Giraud M.F. Hegeman A.D. Gross J.W. Wilmouth R.C. Whitfield C. Graninger M. Messner P. Allen A.G.

Recently, three-dimensional structures of three enzymes belonging to the glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase family and their complexes with substrate(s), products, and inhibitors have been reported. These include RmlA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa(11Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), RmlA from E. coli (12Zuccotti S. Zanardi D. Rosano C. Sturla L. Tonetti M. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and RmlA from Salmonella enterica LT2 (13Barton W.A. Lesniak J. Biggins J.B. Jeffrey P.D. Jiang J. Rajashankar K.R. Thorson J.S. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These studies revealed high structural similarity among these enzymes, localized their substrate binding sites, defined the arrangement of the substrates and the product in the active site, and showed that dTTP binds to the enzyme in a strained conformation. While the kinetic mechanism of these enzymes is now well established to follow a sequential ordered bi-bi mechanism (12Zuccotti S. Zanardi D. Rosano C. Sturla L. Tonetti M. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5548-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and proceeds by a S n2 nucleophilic attack of the phosphoryl group of glucose 1-phosphate at the α-phosphate of dTTP (11Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), these studies have not clarified the role in catalysis of a strictly required Mg2+ ion (12Zuccotti S. Zanardi D. Rosano C. Sturla L. Tonetti M. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Bernstein R.L. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither Mg2+ nor Mn2+ ions were observed in the crystal structures of P. aeruginosa or E. colienzymes despite the co-crystallization efforts, which at the same time showed that this ion is not necessary for binding of the first substrate, dTTP. In the structure of the S. enterica enzyme (13Barton W.A. Lesniak J. Biggins J.B. Jeffrey P.D. Jiang J. Rajashankar K.R. Thorson J.S. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) a feature in the electron density map was interpreted as a Mg2+ ion. However, this ion contacts only the β-phosphate of dTTP and would make no contacts with the phosphate of the second substrate, glucose 1-P (13Barton W.A. Lesniak J. Biggins J.B. Jeffrey P.D. Jiang J. Rajashankar K.R. Thorson J.S. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since the other two structures showed that dTTP binding does not require Mg2+, the strict requirements for this ion in catalysis can not be explained by its observed position in the S. enterica structure. Therefore, the binding site of Mg2+ and its precise role in catalysis is still uncertain in this family of enzymes. RffH and RmlA belong to the superfamily of glucose-1-phosphate NTP-transferases, which also includes bacterial uridylyltransferases (e.g. GalF, GalU) and adenylyltransferases (e.g. GlgC). The enzymes from this superfamily in E. coli show 22–26% sequence identity within the ∼240-residue-long catalytic domain compared with RffH. RffH also shows low sequence identity (19% for 230 amino acids) withE. coli N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GlmU). Indeed, the catalytic domains of all these enzymes share the same fold and have conserved key catalytic residues. All of them require Mg2+ for catalysis, therefore indicating a common catalytic mechanism. Yet, whereas no metal ion has been identified in the structures of RmlA enzymes, the three-dimensional structures of GlmU from various sources complexed with the NDP-sugar product in the presence of either 10 mm Mg2+ (16Kostrewa D. D'Arcy A. Takacs B. Kamber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or 2–10 mm Co (17Olsen L.R. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) contain a well ordered metal ion. We have succeeded in obtaining crystals of RffH from E. coliin the presence of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and Mg2+, with both ligands clearly visible in the electron density maps. The location of the Mg2+ ion in our structure differs from that described in S. enterica RmlA, and in combination with the previously determined structures of RmlA complexes from the three species, our data provide a clear explanation for the essential role of Mg2+ in the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes. This Mg2+-binding site coincides with that observed in GlmU enzymes, providing additional evidence for a common catalytic mechanism. Comparison of all available structures allows us to make hypotheses regarding conformational flexibility at the active site during catalysis. The rffH gene was cloned into a derivative of the pET-15b vector (Amersham Biosciences) containing a thrombin cleavage site to obtain an in-frame N-terminal fusion with His6. Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli DL41 (18Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) for selenomethionine protein production. The transformed bacteria were grown at 37° to anA 600 of ∼0.8 in defined LeMaster medium supplemented with 25 mg/liter of l-selenomethionine. A 1 liter culture was induced with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and the culture continued at room temperature for an additional 15 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 4 °C, 25 min) and re-suspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β mercaptoethanol) in which one tablet of complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Canada) was dissolved. Cells were lysed by sonication on ice for a total of five 30s cycles with 45s between cycles. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 4 °C, 30 min). The protein supernatant was first loaded on an equilibrated 5-ml DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column, and the eluted proteins were loaded on a 5-ml bed volume nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen). The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole and the bound proteins eluted with buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. Purified RffH ran as a single band on both SDS-PAGE and native PAGE gels, and its behavior in solution was evaluated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a DynaPro-801 molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA). Crystals of RffH were obtained with the intact His-tag in the presence of dTTP/Mg2+. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration and crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. A volume of 2 μl of protein solution in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm dTTP) was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.1 m 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.4 m MgCl2 and suspended over the reservoir solution. Crystals grew to the size of ∼0.3 × 0.15 × 0.1 mm3 in 7 days. Diffraction data to 2.6 Å resolution were collected at 295 K on an Raxis IiC area detector mounted on a RU-300 rotating anode generator (Molecular Structure Corporation, The Woodlands, TX). These crystals belong to space group P21212 with a = 59.3 Å, b = 71.7 Å, c = 144.3 Å, and Z = 8. Data integration and scaling was accomplished using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z.

The crystal structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with the program Amore (20Navaza J.

The rigid body refinement after determining the translation components gave a correlation coefficient of 0.202 and R = 52.6%. Non-crystallographic averaging was carried out with the program package RAVE (21Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The final R-factor is 0.223 (R free = 0.284) for all measured data (R = 0.203 and R free = 0.261 for data with I>ς) to 2.6 Å resolution. The model is of good quality as judged by the low root-mean-squares (rms) deviation for bond lengths and bond angles from target values and the Ramachandran plot (Table I). Only one residue, Tyr-29, is found in the disallowed region. This residue is located in a tight turn and is well defined in the electron density map.

The structure of RffH was determined by molecular replacement using the RmlA structure fromP. aeruginosa (11Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) as a starting model. There are two molecules of RffH in the asymmetric unit. The histidine tag is present in the protein sample used for crystallization. Only one histidine from the construct is visible in the density and is included in the model. The last two C-terminal residues, Gln-292–Tyr-293 are disordered. The final model in the asymmetric unit contains two RffH molecules, each consisting of residues from His(−1)–Met1 to Pro-291 for each molecule, one Mg2+ ion, one dTTP molecule, and a total of 165 water molecules. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The RffH molecule belongs to the α/β fold class (Fig.1). The overall size of the monomer is ∼35 × 41 × 55 Å3. As the RffH structure is similar to that of RmlA (11Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Zuccotti S. Zanardi D.

Thorson J.S. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) we will not describe the structure in detail but provide only a general overview. The molecule is built from several β-strand/α-helix units that assemble into a central seven-stranded β-sheet, with six parallel and one antiparallel strands and helices lining both sides of the sheet. The C terminus is capped with an antiparallel bundle of three α-helices, each being two turns long. Two additional two-stranded β-sheets are formed, one along the edge of the central sheet, and the other on top, near the C-terminal ends of the central sheet. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) data of purified RffH measured at a protein concentration of ∼7 mg/ml indicates the presence in solution of a single species with a molecular weight of ∼120 KDa. This molecular weight corresponds to a tetrameric form of the enzyme, similar to that of RmlA proteins from E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. enterica. The arrangement of molecules in the crystal lattice clearly shows the presence of tetramers. Two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit form a dimer with the pseudo 2-fold axis nearly parallel to the crystallographic y axis and pack very closely with a dyad symmetry-related dimer (rotation along z axis) into a tetramer. Therefore, the tetramer has an approximate 222 symmetry. The size of the tetramer is ∼55 × 80 × 80 Å3. The surface area of monomer A is ∼11,650 Å2 of which ∼1,380 Å2 is in contact with monomer B and ∼625 Å2 contacts the symmetry-related monomer A'. In total, 17% of the monomer surface area is utilized for tetramer formation. Superposition of a monomer of RffH and RmlA gives an rms deviation of 1.25 Å (283 Cα atom pairs), 1.20 Å (293 Cα atom pairs), and 1.10 Å (281 Cα atom pairs) for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. enterica, respectively. Comparison of the RffH tetramer with tetramers of RmlA shows that a better description of these tetramers is that of dimers of dimers (Fig.2). Molecules A and B have a larger interface then A and A' (symmetry related to A), and this A/B dimer overlaps well with the equivalent dimers of each of the three RmlA structures (rms of 1.45 Å). There is, however, a difference of ∼15o in the relative orientation and ∼5 Å translation of the dimers within a tetramer when comparing RffH with RmlA. This modification of the quaternary arrangement has important consequences. Namely, the second, presumably allosteric dTTP binding site found in RmlA tetramers that is located at the interface between the two dimers is no longer available for binding dTTP in the RffH tetramer. The sidechain of an arginine, which in RmlA forms a salt bridge with a glutamate (Arg-219–Glu-255) and provides a stacking surface for the thymidine base, is shifted in RffH (Arg-217) into the position occupied by dTTP in the former, while maintaining interactions with the equivalent Glu-253. In the RffH-dTTP complex the dTTP binds at the C-terminal ends of the middle strands β1 and β4 of the central β-sheet. The triphosphate backbone assumes a conformation nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ribose ring, with the α-phosphate (Pα) and β-phosphate (Pβ) oxygen atoms in an eclipsed conformation, indicating some conformational strain. The phosphate backbone makes numerous hydrogen bonds with the protein, compensating for its conformational strain. The γ-phosphate (Pγ) is particularly well anchored and binds in a pocket formed by the segment Gly-8–Arg-13, which encompasses the highly conserved motif (G)GXGXR(L) (Fig.3). This sequence is also conserved in the related NTP transferases GlmU and GalF and is similar to that found in the GlgC family. Pγ forms two hydrogen bonds to the guanidine group of Arg-13, one to Thr-12OG and through a bridging water molecule to an oxygen atom of Pα and weakly to Glu-194. A H-bond is formed between the Pβ-O-Pγ bridging oxygen and NH of Gly-11, while the Pα-O-Pβ bridging oxygen forms a H-bond to Lys-23NZ, a residue potentially involved in catalysis (11Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This conformation of dTTP is very similar to that observed in the previous RmlA structures. In the E. coli RmlA complex with the reaction product, dTDP-glucose, a sulfate ion is located in the same place as Pγ of dTTP, indicating high specificity of this binding pocket for such ions. The recognition of a pyrimidine base is primarily achieved by interactions with the loop Gln-80–Gly-85 (Fig. 3). The residue Gln-80 makes one hydrogen bond with N3 of the base. The O4 atom of the base is also hydrogen bonded to the backbone NH groups of Asp-84 and Gly-85. This interaction may explain the absence of activity with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP), where the amino group replaces the O4 carbonyl group, resulting in a loss of a hydrogen bond to the mainchain NH group. The O2atom forms a hydrogen bond to the NH of Gly-8 from the same segment that tightly binds the triphosphate. There is also a hydrogen bond between the O3′ of deoxyribose and the sidechain of Gln-24. Superposition of the various RmlA complexes with bound dTTP clearly shows that the binding of this substrate is the same in all of these enzymes. The electron density map for RffH shows significant density near the Pα of dTTP in each monomer located ∼2.2 Å from several neighboring oxygen atoms, and the coordination environment suggests that this is a bound Mg2+ ion. Our observation of bound Mg2+is unique for structures of RmlA enzymes and is likely caused by the high (400 mm) concentration of MgCl2 in the protein crystallization solution. Five ligands in the Mg2+ion coordination sphere are: an oxygen atom from Pα of dTTP, two oxygen atoms from the Asp-223 sidechain, one oxygen atom from the Asp-108 sidechain, and one water molecule (Fig. 3). The sixth ligand, on the solvent-exposed side of the ion, is most likely another water molecule. However, it was not clearly visible in the electron density at this resolution. The two aspartates coordinating the Mg2+ ion, distant in the linear sequence, are strictly conserved in the proteins from the RffH/RmlA family (PFAM entry PF00483, www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/). The position of the Mg2+ ion corresponds almost exactly to the position of a metal ion in the structures of GlmU complexed with the product, strongly supporting the notion that this is the catalytically important ion. At the same time, the requirement of a much higher concentration of Mg2+ for binding as compared with GlmU indicates most likely a significantly lower K D for Mg2+in the former. The position of the Mg2+ ion observed here is different from that in the structure of S. enterica RmlA where this ion is bound near Pβ of dTTP, on the side opposite to the binding site of G-1-P. This ion is coordinated by the mainchain atoms and by the oxygen of a glutamine sidechain, not conserved in other RffH/RmlA sequences. The location of this putative Mg2+ ion far from the G-1-P binding site, the lack of conservation of the sidechain providing coordination, and a rather atypical ligand environment makes this binding site unlikely to correspond to that for the catalytically essential Mg2+ ion. It is well established that catalysis in the RmlA family involves S n2 nucleophilic attack of a phosphoryl oxygen atom of glucose-1-P at Pα of dTTP and requires the presence of Mg2+ ions (11Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Zuccotti S. Zanardi D. Rosano C. Sturla L. Tonetti M. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

The presence of two conserved aspartate residues that act as ligands to the Mg2+ ion in our structure, reveals the catalytically essential Mg2+ binding site for this family of enzymes. Superposition of RmlA with bound d-glucose 1-phosphate onto the structure of RffH with bound dTTP and Mg2+ shows that the phosphate group ofd-glucose 1-phosphate is in proximity to the Mg2+ ion (∼3.2 Å) and to the α-phosphate (<3 Å). The presence of the Mg2+ ion at the position observed in our structure would provide bridging interactions between the two phosphate groups upon binding of G-1-P, with oxygens of both phosphates participating in the coordination of this ion as equatorial ligands. Formation of a coordination bond to the Mg2+ ion by one of the oxygens of the G-1-P would affect the orientation of this phosphate. One of the remaining P-O bonds of G-1-P would point directly inline toward the α-phosphate of dTTP between the three oxygens, well positioned for nucleophilic attack. Consistent with this observation, a metal ion, either Co2+ (17Olsen L.R. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1913-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or Mg2+ (16Kostrewa D. D'Arcy A. Takacs B. Kamber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), has been observed to bridge the α and β phosphoryl groups of the UDP-GlcNAc product complexed with GlmU. In the structures of complexes of RmlA with either G-1-P or dTTP in the absence of bound Mg2+ the position of Asp-108 (or its equivalent) is maintained, whereas that of Asp-223 is found in two different conformations, forming either a salt bridge with an Arg residue (equivalent to Arg-142 of RffH) or a hydrogen bond to Trp (equivalent to Trp-221 of RffH). Superposition of GlmU and RffH fromE. coli reveals that the position of the first metal-coordinating residue, Asp-108, is conserved, whereas the second ligand is an asparagine originating in a different location than Asp-223, the second ligand in RffH. This Asn coordinates the metal at a different position within the coordination sphere. Importantly, in GlmU these two residues are found in approximately the same position in all structures, independent of the presence or absence of substrate or product. The preformed nature of the Mg2+ binding site in GlmU contrasts with the more flexible site in RffH/RmlA and is reflected by differences in affinity for Mg2+ in these two enzymes. Comparison of the structures of RmlA and GlmU NTP-transferases complexed with the product (NDP-glucose or NDP-glucosamine) shows a rather small spread in the positions of the base and the sugar, with two populations of conformations differing in the position of the phosphoryl group attached to the sugar (Fig.4). Its position is proximal to either the metal ion on one side or a water molecule on the other side. In each of these two conformations there is one close contact between the Pα and Pβ oxygen atoms but they occur on the opposite sides of the phosphate backbone (Figs. 3 and5 a). In the RmlA enzymes these two oxygen atoms are bridged by a water molecule that is also hydrogen bonded to an aspartate. In the GlmU enzymes, the two oxygen atoms on the opposite side are ligands of the metal ion (Fig.4). Comparison of the complexes containing sugar-1-P shows a similar same distribution of the 1-phosphate between two conformations (Fig.5 b). This distribution of the position of the phosphate group attached to the sugar suggests that this group may reorient during catalysis.Figure 5Stereo views of the superposition of reaction products. a, NDP-glucose from a complex with RmlA (1G1L,gray carbon-carbon bonds) and NDP-glucosamine from the complex with GlmU (1G97, green carbon-carbon bonds) and neighboring residues.

Labels initalics refer to RmlA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The kinetic data for NTP transferases indicate an ordered bi-bi kinetic mechanism. The NTP binds first in the active site. This event is neither associated with nor requires the presence of Mg2+, but is guided by interactions of the γ-phosphate with the highly conserved GGXGXRL sequence (Gly-8–Leu-14 loop in RffH) and by specific contacts made by the nucleotide base. In this conformation at least three bonds along the phosphate backbone are eclipsed, introducing steric strain into the NTP molecule. Binding of the phosphosugar occurs next. On its own this molecule can bind with two orientations of the phosphate, both stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds through bridging water molecules (Fig. 5 b). We speculate that in the presence of bound NTP the phosphosugar binds with its phosphate facing away from the α-phosphate of NTP (Fig.5 b). Binding of the second substrate completes the Mg2+ binding site. The approach of the Mg2+ ion induces a rearrangement of Asp-223 (or its equivalent in RmlA enzymes) and a reorientation of the phosphoryl group of the phosphosugar to coordinate the ion. The orientation of the phosphate oxygen necessary to complete the octahedral coordination around Mg2+correctly orients the second phosphate oxygen for an inline attack on the NTP α-phosphate (on the side opposite to β-phosphate). In addition to these orientation effects, the Mg2+ would serve to lower the activation energy required for formation of the transition state, by neutralizing the doubly-negatively charged phosphorane intermediate as proposed for GlmU (16Kostrewa D. D'Arcy A. Takacs B. Kamber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Release of pyrophosphate concurrent with the formation of the bond to the phosphosugar occurs with an inversion of configuration on the NTP α-phosphate. The change of charge distribution on the diphosphate of the product likely destabilizes Mg2+ coordination and leads to its release with a concurrent shift of the phosphate bound to the sugar into an alternate conformation with a new hydrogen bond network (Fig. 4). Release of the product might be driven by the approach of another NTP molecule, whereby the γ-phosphate could bind to the now empty site formed by the GGXGXRL sequence. The proposal that Asp-110 of P. aeruginosa RmlA plays a key factor in enhancing catalysis by hydrogen bonding to the α-phosphoryl group of dTTP (11Blankenfeldt W. Asuncion M. Lam J.S. Naismith J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) requires re-evaluation in light of our structural results for RffH. Based on our model, the primary function of Asp-108 and equivalent residues in related enzymes is to coordinate Mg2+, which in turn would enhance catalysis by a combination of charge neutralization of the substrates, decreasing the electronegativity of the α-phosphoryl group and correctly positioning the 1-phosphate of the second substrate poised for nucleophilic attack.

Here, we demonstrate that SDF-1-dependent chemotaxis can be induced by treating cultured cortical astroglia with either dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP; 10−4m) or interleukin-6 (IL-6; 10 ng/ml). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that both the dbcAMP- and IL-6-induced onset of SDF-1-dependent chemotaxis of astroglia are due to the increased cell surface expression of CXCR4. In addition, dbcAMP and IL-6 also increased CXCR4 transcript levels, further suggesting that both treatments primarily affect CXCR4 surface expression in astroglia by stimulation of gene expression. Moreover, unlike the case with IL-6 and dbcAMP, which allowed for an optimal chemotactic response to SDF-1 only after 48 h, a similar chemotactic response, associated with an increase in CXCR4 cell surface expression, already occurred after 24 h when astroglial cultures were maintained with medium conditioned by IL-6- or dbcAMP-pretreated astrocytes, indicating that the stimulatory effects of IL-6 and cAMP on CXCR4 cell surface expression involve a secondary mechanism.

Recently, great attention was attracted by the capability of CXCR4 to mediate neuronal cell death upon binding of the HIV envelope protein, gp120, a process believed to underlie HIV dementia (16Hesselgesser J.

The understanding of the physiological functions of CXCR4/SDF-1 in the central nervous system (CNS) is just beginning to emerge (18Asensio V.C. Campell I.L. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 504-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). One crucial role seems to consist in the control of neural cell migration. During brain development, CXCR4 is highly expressed in migrating neuroepithelial cells (19McGrath K.E. Koniski A.D. Maltby K.M. McGann J.K. Palis J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 442-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Moreover, inactivation of the genes encoding either CXCR4 or SDF-1 perturbs the migration of granule cells within the developing cerebellum from the outer external to the inner granule layer (20Tachibana K. Hirota S. Ilzasa H. Yoshida H. Kawabata Y. Kitamura Y. Mastushima K. Yoshida N. Nishikawa S.-I. Kishimoto T. Nagasawa T.

Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). In addition, SDF-1 acts as a potent chemoattractant for microglial cells (14Tanabe S. Heesen M. Yoshizawa I. Berman M.A. Luo Y. Bleul C.C. Springer T.A. Okuda K. Gerard N. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 905-911PubMed Google Scholar), further pointing to a modulatory role of this chemokine during neuroinflammation. Inflammation of the brain leads to reactive gliosis, a process characterized by proliferation and migration of astroglia and the subsequent formation of a glial scar (23Ridet J.L. Malhotra S.K. Privat A. Gage F.H. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 570-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). The participation of chemokines in these reactive processes has recently been suggested (18Asensio V.C. Campell I.L. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 504-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, the role of SDF-1 remains elusive. Whereas SDF-1 activates distinct signaling pathways in astroglia (14Tanabe S. Heesen M. Yoshizawa I. Berman M.A. Luo Y. Bleul C.C. Springer T.A. Okuda K. Gerard N. Dorf M.E. J.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1226-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a previous study failed to demonstrate a chemotactic response of astrocytes toward SDF-1 (14Tanabe S. Heesen M. Yoshizawa I. Berman M.A. Luo Y. Bleul C.C. Springer T.A. Okuda K. Gerard N. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 905-911PubMed Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, SDF-1-dependent chemotaxis is modulated via CXCR4 cell surface expression levels (27Cole S.W. Jamieson B.D. Zack J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1392-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 28Peled A. Petit I. Kollet O. Magid M. Ponomaryov T. Byk T. Nagler A. Ben-Hur H. Many A. Shultz L. Lider O. Alon R. Zipori D. Lapidot T. Science. 1999; 283: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in these cells, CXCR4 cell surface expression level and SDF-1-dependent chemotaxis are enhanced with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and factors positively coupled to cAMP, signals previously also found to increase at the site of reactive gliosis (23Ridet J.L. Malhotra S.K. Privat A. Gage F.H. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 570-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have assessed the putative role of SDF-1/CXCR4 in reactive gliosis by determining how IL-6 and the cell membrane-permeable cAMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) affect CXCR4 cell surface expression and SDF-1-dependent chemotaxis in cultured cortical astroglia. Astroglial cultures were initiated from the cerebral hemispheres of postnatal (P)1 mouse pups obtained by either mating fos-lacZ transgenic mice (generously provided by Dr. J. Morgan, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) orfos-lacZ transgenic animals with BALB/c mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany). A detailed protocol of the cultivation procedure has been recently published elsewhere (29Franke B. Figiel M. Engele J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These cultures predominantly consist of astrocytes (90–95%) as well as small populations of oligodendrocytes and glial progenitor cells and are virtually free of neurons and microglial cells. Briefly, dissected tissue pieces were incubated for 20 min in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Trypsin action was terminated by transferring tissue pieces to Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The tissue was gently dissociated by trituration through a plastic pipette. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 ×g for 5 min and resuspended in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated into 100-mm culture dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) coated with poly-d-ornithine (0.1 mg/ml; molecular mass 30–70 kDa; Sigma). Upon reaching confluence, cultured cells were trypsinized and replated. After the second passage, cells obtained from the offspring of c-Fos-lacZ/c-Fos-lacZ crosses were seeded into 48-well cluster plates (Costar) for subsequent c-Fos assay. Cells obtained from the offspring of c-Fos-lacZ/BALB/c crosses were seeded into 100-mm culture dishes; these cells were subsequently used for RT-PCR analysis and migration assay. In both cases, cultures were further maintained with serum-free N2 medium additionally supplemented with the indicated concentrations of IL-6 (Pepro Tech, Rocky Hill, NJ), dbcAMP (Sigma), or conditioned medium (CM). Functional SDF-1 signal transduction coupling was assessed by analyzing SDF-1-included c-Fos-lacZ expression as described previously (30Engele J. Schilling K. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Glial cultures were stimulated for 3 h with SDF-1α (100 ng/ml; PeproTech) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. β-Galactosidase activity was visualized by incubating cultures for 24 h at 37 °C with X-Gal (1 mg/ml; Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany). The chemotactic response of cortical glia to chemokines was evaluated using a modified 48-well Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD), as previously described (31Waltenberger J. Mayr U. Frank H. Hombach V. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1523-1529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For cell harvest, astroglial cultures were rinsed three times with N2 medium, and cells were resuspended in fresh N2 medium. Fifty μl of the cell suspension were added to the upper well of the chamber. The lower well received 28 μl of N2 medium supplemented with the indicated concentrations of either SDF-1α or macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α; PeproTech). The upper and lower wells were separated by collagen-coated Nucleopore® polycarbonate filters (Corning, Acton, MA) with 8-μm pore size, and the chamber was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. After incubation, nonmigrating cells were scraped off from the upper surfaces of the filters. Migrating cells, attached to the lower surfaces, were fixed in ethanol for 10 min and stained with Diff Quick (Baxter, McGaw Park, IL). Labeled cells were counted microscopically at 400× within a total area of 2 mm2. Data were normalized by calculating the migration index, which was defined to be the ratio of cells migrating in the presence and absence of chemokines. In both the fosand migration assays, the astrocytic nature of reactive cells was confirmed by immunocytochemical detection of the astroglial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Glial cultures or polycarbonate filters were subsequently incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with anti-GFAP antibodies (1:1000; Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY) and for 2 h at room temperature with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (1:400; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The immunoreaction was visualized using the Vectastain ABC-kit (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Total RNA was isolated from cortical glial cultures using the PeqGold isolation kit (Peqlab, Schwalbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA concentration was measured by spectrophotometric absorbance at 260 nm. A total of 5 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using 200 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and 2 μg of random hexamer primers (Thermo Hybaid, Ulm, Germany). Obtained templates were amplified in a final volume of 50 μl. For initial detection of CXCR4 expression in astroglia by conventional RT-PCR analysis, the following primers were designed: sense, 5′-CTA CAA TGA GCT GCG TGT GGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CAG GTC CAG ACG CAG GAT GGC-3′. The expected size of the reaction product is 458 bp. Amplification was carried out with 30 PCR cycles of 58 °C for 1 min in the presence of 15 pmol of each primer. Reaction products were separated in an agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. RNA levels were quantified by real time PCR using the following primers: CXCR4, sense (5′-AGT GGC TGA CCT CCT CTT TGT-3′) and antisense (5′-GCC CAC ATA GAC TGC CTT TTC-3′); CCR5, sense (5′-GGA ATG AGA AGA AGA GGC ACA-3′) and antisense (5′-AGA TGA CAG GGT TTA GGC AGC-3′); GAPDH, sense (5′-CCG TGT TCC TAC CCC CAA TG-3′) and antisense (5′-GTC CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT GTA-3′) (all from Thermo Hybaid, Ulm, Germany). Thermocycling for each reaction was done in a final volume of 10 μl containing 1 μl of cDNA sample (or standard), 1 μl of LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR-Green I (Roche Diagnostics), MgCl2 (2.5 mm), and sense and antisense primers (10 pmol each). The thermal cycling conditions were 95 °C for 30 s followed by 45 cycles of 58 °C for 5 s and 72 °C for 10 s. Data were collected using the LightCycler instrument (Roche Diagnostics). To confirm the specificity of the amplified products, melting curves were performed at the end of the amplification by cooling samples at 20 °C/s to 65 °C for 15 s and then increasing the temperature to 95 °C at 0.1 °C/s with continuous fluorescence measurement. Each sample was tested in duplicate. For generation of standard curves, PCR products (CXCR4, CCR5, GAPDH) were purified using QIAquick (Qiagen) spin columns and serially diluted in double-distilled water. The second derivative maximum method as provided by the manufacturer's software was applied to determine the maximum acceleration of the amplification process, and the respective cycle number was used as a crossing point value. The concentrations of unknown samples were determined by setting their crossing points to the standard curve and were normalized to GAPDH. Cell surface expression of CXCR4 was quantified by flow cytometric analysis. Cultured glial cells were suspended in PBS supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide and subsequently incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with either goat anti-rat CXCR4 antibodies (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-goat antibodies (1:200; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), as an isotype control, and for another 20 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (1:500; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The forward narrow angle light scatter was used to exclude dead and aggregated cells. Astroglial cultures were maintained for 48 h with N2 medium in the presence or absence of IL-6 (10 ng/ml) or dbcAMP (10−4m). After extensively rinsing three times with minimal essential medium/F-12 medium (1:1; v/v), cultures were subsequently incubated with N2 medium (200 μl/well) in the absence of IL-6 or dbcAMP. After 24 h, the CM was collected and centrifuged at 3000 × g to remove cells and membrane fragments. The CM was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. RT-PCR of RNA isolated from second passage rat cortical glia with primers specific for CXCR4 allowed the amplification of a single product with the expected molecular size of 458 bp (Fig.1 A). Subsequent restriction analysis of the amplified product resulted in fragments of the predicted size (data not shown). This confirms that CNS glia express CXCR4 (14Tanabe S. Heesen M. Yoshizawa I.

Glia. 2001; 34: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To further determine whether glia express CXCR4 at their cell surface, cultured glial cells were stained with anti-CXCR4 antiserum and subjected to flow cytometric analysis (Fig.1 B). In three independent experiments, an average of 27 ± 6% (mean ± S.D.) of the cultured cells showed CXCR4 surface expression. In the next step, we set out to determine whether CXCR4 expressed by cultured glia are functionally active. To this end, we exploited the fact that activation of many growth factor and cytokine receptors leads to the rapid and transient expression of immediate early genes, most prominent among them, c-fos (33Schilling K. Luk D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5665-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SDF-1-induced c-fos expression was monitored in second passage cortical glia initiated from the offsprings of fos-LacZ ×fos-lacZ crosses. This transgenic approach allows the selective and sensitive detection of c-fos expression (33Schilling K. Luk D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5665-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,34Smeyne R.J. Schilling K. Robertson L. Luk D. Oberdick J. Curran T. Morgan J.I. Neuron. 1992; 8: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and further favors the rapid phenotypic characterization of c-fos-positive and thus CXCR4-expressing cells by double labeling with antibodies against cell type-specific markers (30Engele J. Schilling K. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transgene expression was assessed after exposing cortical glia for 3 h to SDF-1 (100 ng/ml). We have previously demonstrated that this stimulation protocol leads to maximal transgene expression (30Engele J. Schilling K. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Subsequent staining of the stimulated cultures for β-galactosidase histochemistry revealed that SDF-1 induced transgene expression in 33.6% of the cultured cells (β-galactosidase-positive cells, 15,350 ± 4050 cells/cm2, n = 18 wells pooled from three independent experiments; total cell number, 45,730 ± 8150 cells/cm2) (Fig.2). In untreated controls, 4450 ± 950 β-galactosidase-positive cells were present. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (25 ng/ml), which served as a positive control (30Engele J. Schilling K. Neuroscience. 1996; 73: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), induced β-galactosidase activity in 29,150 ± 7250 cells/cm2. To further confirm that the SDF-1-responsive/CXCR4-expressing cells are astrocytes, the predominant cell type in our glial cultures (29Franke B. Figiel M. Engele J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), cells were double-labeled with antibodies against the astrocytic marker, GFAP. The majority (>95%) of the β-galactosidase-expressing cells were immunoreactive for GFAP (Fig. 2). The relative number of astrocytes responding to SDF-1 with c-fos expression remained unaffected when astroglial cultures were initiated from the offsprings of fos-LacZ × BALB/c crosses (data not shown), cultures used for all following experiments. Together these findings reveal that cultured cortical astrocytes show functional signal transduction coupling for SDF-1. The chemotactic response of astrocytes to SDF-1 was assessed in a migration assay using a modified Boyden chamber. Exposure of second passage cortical glia to SDF-1 at 100 ng/ml completely failed to induce cell migration (Fig.3 A). A migratory response was, however, detectable with glia previously maintained with either IL-6 or the cell membrane-permeable cAMP analog, dbcAMP (Fig. 3 A). Specific cell migration toward SDF-1, as indicated by a migration index of >1, first occurred after a 24-h pretreatment with either IL-6 or dbcAMP, although this increase in the migration index was statistically not significant. With both substances, the migration index peaked after 48 h and declined up to 72 h. The combined pretreatment of cultured cortical glia with IL-6 and dbcAMP for up to 72 h did not further increase the number of migrating cells beyond that seen with the single factors. Maintaining cortical glia for 48 h with serial dilutions of IL-6 or dbcAMP further demonstrated that the inductive effects on SDF-1-dependent cell migration were concentration-dependent and required IL-6 and dbcAMP at concentrations of >1 ng/ml and >10−5m, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). A similar concentration dependence applied for SDF-1-induced chemotactic response (Fig. 3 D). In glial cultures maintained for 48 h with dbcAMP (10−4m), SDF-1 at concentrations up to 50 ng/ml failed to evoke glial cell migration, whereas a maximal migratory response was induced by SDF at 100–500 ng/ml. Similar SDF-1 concentrations have been previously reported to induce maximal chemotactic responses in a variety of other cell types, including neurons, microglial cells, late streak gastrula cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes (14Tanabe S.

Casanovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Increasing SDF-1 concentrations to ≥750 ng/ml resulted in a decline in the number of migrating glial cells. Since our glial cultures also contained small numbers of oligodendrocytes and glial precursors in addition to the large portion of astrocytes (≥90%) (29Franke B. Figiel M. Engele J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), polycarbonate filters were fixed after incubation and stained with antibodies against GFAP. The vast majority of the migrated cells (99 ± 2%; n= 18 wells pooled from two independent experiments) expressed immunoreactivity for GFAP, thus confirming that SDF-1 preferentially induced the migration of astrocytes. Together, these findings demonstrate that IL-6 or the activation of cAMP-dependent signaling pathways is required for the onset of a migratory response of astroglia to SDF-1. MIP-1α is a chemokine recently shown to act as a chemoattractant for astrocytes (14Tanabe S. Heesen M. Yoshizawa I. Berman M.A. Luo Y. Bleul C.C. Springer T.A. Okuda K. Gerard N. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 905-911PubMed Google Scholar). In apparent contrast to SDF-1, cultured cortical glia specifically migrated toward MIP-1α at 10 ng/ml, a concentration previously reported to induce maximal chemotactic response in glial cells (14Tanabe S. Heesen M. Yoshizawa I. Berman M.A. Luo Y. Bleul C.C. Springer T.A. Okuda K. Gerard N. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 905-911PubMed Google Scholar), without prior exposure to IL-6 or dbcAMP (Fig.4). Treatment of cortical glial cultures with either IL-6 or dbcAMP alone or a combination of both substances for 6–48 h did not further modulate the MIP-1α−induced migratory response of cortical astroglia. Taken together, these findings reveal that IL-6 and dbcAMP specifically modulate the chemotactic response of cortical astroglia to SDF-1 but not to MIP-1α. Since both IL-6 and dbcAMP modulate CXCR4 cell surface expression levels in lymphocytes (27Cole S.W. Jamieson B.D. Zack J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1392-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 28Peled A. Petit I.

Science. 1999; 283: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), we determined whether similar regulatory influences apply to astrocytes. Flow cytometry demonstrated that treatment of cortical glia with either dbcAMP or IL-6 for 48 h up-regulated CXCR4 cell surface expression (Table I and Fig.5). CXCR4 cell surface expression levels did not further increase in cultures co-treated with IL-6 and dbcAMP. These findings suggest that IL-6 and dbcAMP induce SDF-1-dependent chemotaxis by up-regulating CXCR4 cell surface expression in glia.Table IUp-regulation of CXCR4 cell surface expression by dbcAMP and IL-6TreatmentNo. of gated cells%None27 ± 5dbcAMP (10−4m)54 ± 9*IL-6 (10 ng/ml)48 ± 8*dbcAMP (10−4m) + IL-6 (10 ng/ml)48 ± 7*Cortical astroglial cultures were maintained for 48 h with the indicated factors and subsequently analyzed for CXCR4 cell surface expression lev"

Proliferating myoblasts must exit from the cell cycle prior to their differentiation. The muscle regulatory factor and myocyte enhancer factor-2 protein families play a major role in promoting muscle cell differentiation. Conversely, members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors that promote cell proliferation antagonize muscle cell differentiation. Here we tested the role of the c-Jun dimerization protein JDP2 in muscle cell differentiation. Endogenous expression of JDP2 was induced in both C2C12 myoblast and rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells programmed to differentiate. Ectopic expression of JDP2 in C2C12 myoblast cells inhibited cell cycle progression and induced spontaneous muscle cell differentiation. Likewise, constitutive expression of JDP2 in RD cells reduced their tumorigenic characteristics and restored their ability to differentiate into myotubes. JDP2 potentiated and synergized with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to induce muscle cell differentiation of RD cells. In addition, JDP2 induced p38 activity in both C2 and RD cells programmed to differentiate. This is the first demonstration of a single transcription factor that rescues the myogenic program in an otherwise non-differentiating cancer cell line.

Parham D.M. Shapiro D.N. Webber B.L. Houghton P.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 1283-1291PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dias P. Parham D.M. Shapiro D.N. Tapscott S.J. Houghton P.J.

Transcription factors that promote cell proliferation such as those from the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family and the AP-1 family (10Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar) are potent inhibitors of muscle cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of c-Jun, v-Jun, and JunB in myogenic cells inhibits muscle differentiation (11Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J. Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. Verma I. Cell. 1992; 68: 507-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 12Li L. Chambard J.C. Karin M. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The antagonism between MyoD and Jun proteins may be related to the competition of these proteins for a limited amount of an essential coactivator. Indeed, following the onset of muscle cell differentiation, c-Jun and JunB levels decrease (13Lehtinen S.K. Rahkila P. Helenius M. Korhonen P. Salminen A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas JunD remains constant (1Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recently, we isolated a cDNA encoding an 18-kDa protein, a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors designated JDP2 (14Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). JDP2 was isolated based on its ability to bind c-Jun and was shown to bind activating transcription factor-2 (15Jin C. Ugai H. Song J. Murata T. Nili F. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-γ (16Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the progesterone receptor (17Wardell S.E. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Adelman J.S. Aronheim A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5451-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The JDP2 protein is constitutively expressed in multiple cell lines tested and represses AP-1 transcriptional activity (14Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Recently, JDP2 was shown to inhibit retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells by recruitment of the histone deacetylase-3 complex to the c-jun promoter (18Jin C., Li, H. Murata T. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Chiu R. Yokoyama K.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4815-4826Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). JDP2 binds both CRE and TRE DNA elements as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with activating transcription factor-2 and Jun family members, respectively (14Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar,15Jin C. Ugai H. Song J. Murata T. Nili F. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). JDP2 expression levels remain constant following a wide range of stress stimuli, but JDP2 is phosphorylated at threonine 148 by JNK (19Katz S. Heinrich R. Aronheim A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we show that the expression of endogenous JDP2 was induced during the differentiation of C2 myoblasts. Ectopic expression of JDP2 in myoblasts and rhabdomyosarcoma tumor cells strongly promoted muscle cell differentiation. JDP2 efficiently induced the spontaneous differentiation of C2 cells growing in high serum-containing medium and accelerated the differentiation of myoblasts growing in serum-free medium. Moreover, JDP2 expression in rhabdomyosarcoma cells caused a partial cell cycle arrest, induction of myogenic markers, and partial fusion of these tumor-derived cells. We suggest that JDP2 is actively involved in down-regulation of cell cycle progression and induces muscle cell differentiation. This is the first demonstration of a single transcription factor that promotes muscle cell differentiation of a rhabdomyosarcoma-derived tumor cell line.

Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1-luciferase was a generous gift of Dr. R. G. Pestell. The full-length jdp2 cDNA was inserted into the pCLBabe retroviral expression plasmid (21Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by EcoRI digestion. C2 and RD myoblast cells were infected with replication-defective retroviruses to generate C2 cell lines overexpressing JDP2. Retroviruses expressing the different proteins were generated by cotransfection of retroviral expression vectors with an expression vector encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein gene into the viral packaging cell line 293gp, expressing the gag andpol genes (21Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium of transfected 293gp cells containing retroviruses was used to infect C2 or RD cells. Infected cells were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml), and resistant clones were pooled together 1 week later. Cells were kept in culture for no more than 3 weeks. Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), penicillin, and streptomycin (growth medium (GM)). To induce differentiation, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μg/ml insulin and 10 μg/ml transferrin (differentiation medium (DM)). C2 cells were a gift of Dr. David Yaffe (22Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation for 293gp cells or using X-tremeGENE transfection reagent (10 μl/60-mm plate; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions for C2 cell lines. Myoblast cells were transfected with 3 μg of total plasmid DNA mixture composed of 2 μg of the corresponding luciferase reporter plasmid and 1 μg of the transfection control CMV-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid. Following transfection, the medium was replaced with DM or GM for 24–48 h. Total protein lysates were prepared and used to measure luciferase activities using the Promega luciferase assay system. CMV-β-galactosidase was used to normalize differences in transfection efficiency between plates. The luciferase activity obtained in each transfection was divided by the β-galactosidase activity obtained in each transfection. Cells were fixed and immunostained as described (23Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The primary antibody used was anti-MHC monoclonal antibody MF-20. The immunochemically stained cells were visualized using an Olympus Model BX50 fluorescence microscope at a magnification of ×200 and were photographed with a digital camera. Cells were lysed, and whole cell extracts were collected as described (23Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract was prepared as described (19Katz S. Heinrich R. Aronheim A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracted proteins (50 μg) were loaded, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated in blocking buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. All incubations and washes were performed with blocking buffer. Primary antibody incubations were performed at 1:1000 dilution, unless otherwise indicated. The following antibodies were used: anti-JDP2 (1:1000 dilution), anti-c-Jun (1:1000), anti-myogenin (1:500), anti-cyclin D1 (1:500), anti-p21 (1:500), anti-phospho-p38 (1:500), anti-p38 (1:1000), anti-MHC (1:2.5), anti-CREB (1:200), and anti-tubulin (1:1000). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BrdUrd staining was performed with cells grown on coverslips as previously described (23Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In principle, BrdUrd was added to cell media at 10 μm for 2–3 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with methanol (10 min), and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 (10 min). Following a wash with PBS, the cells were incubated in 2 n HCl solution for 1 h, followed by a neutralization step composed of washing the cells three times with 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 8.5). Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 6 mg/ml anti-BrdUrd antibody in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h. Staining was performed as described above, but prior to the acid incubation step, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h. Following three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1.5 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Subsequently, cells ware fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (10 min), and after extensive washing with PBS, staining was performed as described above. The AP-1 transcription factor plays a major role in mediating cell response to growth stimulation (10Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Because JDP2 was shown to repress AP-1 activity (14Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 15Jin C. Ugai H. Song J. Murata T. Nili F. Sun K. Horikoshi M. Yokoyama K.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of JDP2 to inhibit cell proliferation. C2 myoblast cells were infected either with retroviruses encoding the JDP2 protein (JDP2-C2 cells) or with a noncoding control retrovirus (control-C2 cells). Puromycin-resistant cells were selected, and their proliferation profile was measured using BrdUrd incorporation assay. The number of BrdUrd-incorporating nuclei was calculated relative to the total number of DAPI-stained nuclei. Fewer JDP2-C2 cells in S phase were observed relative to control-C2 cells growing in GM (45% versus 60%, respectively) (Fig.1, A and B). Interestingly, the nuclei of the JDP2-expressing cells were of smaller dimensions relative to the those of the control-C2 cells (Fig.1 A). As expected, following transfer of C2 cells to DM for 24 h, the number of cells in S phase was reduced dramatically (25–30%) (Fig. 1 C, left panel), indicating their withdrawal from the cell cycle. In JDP2-C2 cells, a smaller fraction of nuclei were stained, and their staining was significantly less intense compared with the nuclei of control-C2 cells (Fig.1 C, right panel), indicating a slower cell cycle progression. To investigate how JDP2 may inhibit cell proliferation, we examined the expression levels of two major cell cycle regulatory markers, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and cyclin D1, by Western blot analysis (Fig.2, A and C) and reporter gene assay (Fig. 2, B and D). Control-C2 cells grown in GM exhibited lower p21 levels compared with JDP2-C2 cells (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 1 and4). Following transfer of cells to DM, p21 expression levels gradually increased in control-C2 cells with time of incubation, whereas the already high p21 levels in JDP2-C2 cells increased only modestly (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2–3 and5–6). To analyze whether this effect is mediated at the transcriptional level, we transfected the stable cell lines with the p21-luciferase reporter plasmid and assessed the luciferase activity of cells growing in GM (Fig. 2 B). The expression of the p21-luciferase reporter gene was significantly higher in the JDP2-C2 cells relative to the control-C2 cells (Fig. 2 B), thus suggesting that JDP2 caused an increase in p21 transcription. A similar analysis was performed for cyclin D1; however, whereas control-C2 cells expressed high levels of cyclin D1 protein when grown in GM, JDP2-C2 cells expressed significantly reduced levels of cyclin D1 (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 1 and 5). Following transfer of cells to DM, cyclin D1 levels declined in both cell lines, yet its levels were always lower in JDP2-expressing cells relative to control cells at each time point in DM (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 2–4 and lanes 6–8). To examine whether JDP2 affected cyclin D1 transcription, we measured the expression of the luciferase reporter gene regulated by the cyclin D1 promoter elements. JDP2-C2 and control-C2 cells were transiently transfected with the cyclin D1-luciferase reporter plasmid and grown for 24–48 h in GM. The expression of cyclin D1-luciferase was significantly lower in JDP2-C2 cells relative to control-C2 cells (Fig.2 D). These results suggest that JDP2 interferes with cell cycle progression by modulating the expression of two key regulators, cyclin D1 and p21. The cyclin D1 promoter is regulated by both AP-1 and CRE DNA elements (24Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N., Vu, D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 25Allan A.L. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LaMarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27272-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) found in its promoter and their corresponding DNA-binding transcription factors c-Jun and CREB. Because JDP2 is able to bind both CRE and TRE DNA elements (14Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether JDP2 effects on the cyclin D1 promoter are direct or through a decrease in c-Jun and/or CREB protein levels. We performed Western blot analysis on stable C2 cell lines with anti-CREB and anti-c-Jun antibodies. No differences in CREB and c-Jun protein expression levels were observed in control-C2 and JDP2-C2 cells (Fig.2 E). This result suggests that cyclin D1 inhibition may represent a direct effect mediated by JDP2.Figure 2JDP2-dependent inhibition of cell cycle regulatory markers in C2 cells. Whole cell extract (50 μg) (A and C) or nuclear extract (E) was derived from either JDP2-C2 or control-C2 cells grown in GM or for the indicated times in DM, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. The levels of p21waf1(A), cyclin D1 (C), CREB (E,right panel), and c-Jun (E, left panel) were determined with the appropriate antibodies. The level of tubulin served as a loading control using anti-tubulin antibody. InB and D, JDP2-C2 and control-C2 cells were cotransfected with p21-luciferase (Luc) and cyclin D1-luciferase reporter genes, respectively, together with the CMV-β-galactosidase reporter gene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following transfection, cells were grown in GM for 24–48 h. Transfected cells were harvested, and the β-galactosidase levels were determined and used to normalize the luciferase activity obtained. The resulting normalized activity of control-C2 cells was set as 1, and the activity obtained with JDP2-C2 cells was calculated accordingly. The results represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Collectively, these data indicate that JDP2 inhibits cell cycle progression at least in part by reducing the expression levels of cyclin D1 and increasing the levels of the p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. These two opposite effects are mediated at least in part at the transcriptional level, coordinately resulting in down-regulation of cell cycle progression. The fact that JDP2 expression reduced cell cycle progression prompted us to test the ability of JDP2-C2 cells to induce muscle cell differentiation. JDP2-C2 and control-C2 cells were grown in GM at subconfluent density, followed by fixation and staining with anti-MHC antibody. Even under these growth conditions, we observed that JDP2-C2 cells formed multiple multinucleated myotubes consisting of 5–17 nuclei/myotube that stained positively for MHC (Fig.3, A, upper right panel; and B). Control-C2 cells grown under identical conditions formed only a small number of multinucleated myotube cells consisting of one to three nuclei/myotube. These differences were even more pronounced after 24 h of growth in DM (Fig. 3, A,middle panels; and B). The number of nuclei/myotube was ∼10-fold higher in JDP2-C2 expressing cells than in control-C2 cells (Fig. 3 B). In addition, myotubes formed in JDP2-C2 cells exhibited an elongated morphology and were significantly larger in size. Control-C2 cells were able to spontaneously differentiate in GM when grown to high density for 72–96 h, resulting in hypertrophic multinucleated myotubes (Fig.3 A, lower left panel). JDP2-C2 cells grown at identical density in GM formed multi-giant hypertrophic myotubes that bundled into large skeletal fibers (Fig. 3 A, lower right panel). To examine the myogenic activity induced by JDP2, we transiently transfected JDP2-C2 and control-C2 cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid placed under the control of the promoter of the early myogenic marker myogenin (myogenin-luciferase). The myogenin reporter activity in JDP2-C2 cells was ∼10-fold higher than that in control-C2 cells grown in either GM or DM (data not shown). To study the expression of endogenous early and late muscle-specific markers, we performed Western blot analysis with anti-myogenin and anti-MHC antibodies (Fig.4 A). In control-C2 cells, the expression level of the muscle-specific markers was low when cells were grown in GM and gradually increased following their growth in DM. By contrast, in JDP2-C2 cells, myogenin and MHC expression levels were already high in GM and increased only modestly during growth in DM (Fig. 4 A, left panel). JDP2-C2 cells grown in GM at high density, which exhibited the hypertrophic phenotype (Fig.3 A), also displayed a marked increase in MHC expression compared with control-C2 cells (Fig. 4 A, right panel). To examine the expression levels of JDP2 during the differentiation of myoblasts, we performed Western blot analysis with anti-JDP2 antibody on nuclear extract derived from differentiated control-C2 and JDP2-C2 cells. JDP2 levels was mildly increased during differentiation in control-C2 cells (Fig. 4 B). The expression of JDP2 in JDP2-C2 cells was ∼3-fold higher than in control-C2 cells grown in GM. This level of JDP2 expression was not significantly changed during differentiation. Together, these data indicate that ectopic expression of JDP2 strongly promotes both morphological as well as biochemical differentiation of C2 myoblasts. To exclude the possibility that the JDP2 effects were due to clonal selection of the stable cell lines, we examined the ability of JDP2 to induce muscle differentiation of C2 cells in transient transfections assays. Toward this end, C2 cells were cotransfected with either control or JDP2 expression plasmids together with a reporter plasmid under the control of either the myogenin or cyclin D1 promoter (Fig.4 C). Consistent with the results in stable cell lines, transient expression of JDP2 increased myogenin reporter activity by 3-fold and reduced cyclin D1 activity by 10-fold. In addition, we transiently transfected JDP2 into C2 cells, followed by cell fixation and staining with either anti-myogenin or anti-MHC antibody (Fig. 4 D). JDP2-transfected cells exhibited 40 and 27% increases in myogenin and MHC staining, respectively, compared with control plasmid-transfected cells. RD cells are tumor cells of muscle origin that, even in the absence of mitogens, fail to withdraw from the cell cycle and to undergo terminal differentiation to myotubes. To test the possible role of JDP2 in the rescue of RD cell differentiation, we first analyzed the expression level of JDP2 protein in control-RD cells grown in GM and DM (Fig. 5, A, left panel, and B). The JDP2 protein could hardly be detected in control-RD cells grown in GM; however, its expression was markedly increased following 48- and 72-h growth in DM. The increase in JDP2 was followed by a subsequent increase in the muscle-specific MHC protein marker, which was detected 72 h following growth of control-RD cells in DM (Fig. 5, C, left panel; and D). To test the possibility that the expression of the JDP2 protein may induce further differentiation of these cells, we infected RD cells with JDP2-expressing retroviruses (JDP2-RD cells) and selected for puromycin-resistant cells. The expression of JDP2 in JDP2-RD cells was ∼10-fold higher than in control-RD cells (Fig.5 A, right panel). Surprisingly, JDP2-RD cells expressed detectable levels of MHC even in GM, and its expression was induced significantly during their growth in DM. The expression of MHC in JDP2-RD cells was significantly higher than in control-RD cells at any time point examined (Fig. 5, C, compare lanes 1–4 and 5–8; and D). To compare muscle-specific transcriptional activity of JDP2-RD with control-RD cells, we transiently transfected these cell lines with a myogenin-luciferase reporter plasmid. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h following transfection and growth in DM (Fig. 5 E). The transcriptional activity of the myogenin reporter gene in JDP2-RD cells was 3.7-fold higher than in control-RD cells (Fig.5 E). The ability of JDP2 to promote the induction of early and late muscle-specific genes prompted us to examine its effect on morphological differentiation of RD cells. Both control-RD and JDP2-RD cell lines grown in DM for 48 and 72 h were fixed and stained with anti-MHC antibody (Fig. 6 A). Whereas control-RD cells poorly differentiated and rarely fused to form myotubes, JDP2-RD cells formed multinucleated myotubes that were intensely stained with anti-MHC antibody (Fig. 6, A andB). These results are consistent with the observed increase in MHC protein levels and myogenin promoter transcription (Fig. 5,C and E). Moreover, the effect of JDP2 expression was even more pronounced in RD cells grown in GM to h"
https://openalex.org/W2082847848,"Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes involving cell adhesion and migration in addition to fibrinolysis. In a previous study we found that two-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (tcuPA) stimulates phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction of isolated rat aortic rings. In the present paper we report that uPA−/−mice have a significantly lower mean arterial blood pressure than do wild type mice and that aortic rings from uPA−/− mice show an attenuated contractile response to phenylephrine. In contrast, the blood pressure of urokinase receptor knockout (uPAR−/−) mice and the response of their isolated aortic rings to phenylephrine were normal, indicating that the effect of uPA on vascular contraction is independent of uPAR. Addition of mouse and human uPA almost completely reversed both the impaired vascular contractility and the lower arterial blood pressure in vivo. The in vitro and in vivo effects of infused uPA on aortic contractility and the restoration of normal blood pressure in uPA−/− mice were prevented by antibody to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP). A modified form of uPA that lacks the kringle failed to restore the blood pressure in uPA−/− mice, notwithstanding having a longer half-life in the circulation. Ligands that regulate the interaction of uPA with LRP, such as PAI-1 or the PAI-1-derived peptide (EEIIMD), abolished the vasoactivity of tcuPA in vitro and in vivo. These studies identify a novel signal transducing cellular receptor pathway involved in the regulation of vascular contractility.

The in vitro and in vivo effects of infused uPA on aortic contractility and the restoration of normal blood pressure in uPA−/− mice were prevented by antibody to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP). A modified form of uPA that lacks the kringle failed to restore the blood pressure in uPA−/− mice, notwithstanding having a longer half-life in the circulation. Ligands that regulate the interaction of uPA with LRP, such as PAI-1 or the PAI-1-derived peptide (EEIIMD), abolished the vasoactivity of tcuPA in vitro and in vivo. These studies identify a novel signal transducing cellular receptor pathway involved in the regulation of vascular contractility. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; tcuPA, two-chain urokinase plasminogen activator; WT, wild type; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor; PE, phenylephrine; RAP, receptor-associated protein; rRAP, recombinant RAP; ATF, amino-terminal fragment; MABP, mean arterial blood pressure; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; uPAR, urokinase receptor. is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including fibrinolysis. Transgenic mice with a targeted disruption in the uPA gene (uPA−/−) are prone to form thrombi when exposed to endotoxin (1Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degan J.

Haemostasis. 1996; 26 Suppl. 4: 132-153Google Scholar, 3Pinsky D.J. Liao H. Lawson C.A. Yan S.-F. Chen J. Carmeliet P. Loskutoff D.J. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 919-928Google Scholar) or when the uPA gene is disrupted in otherwise healthy tPA−/−mice (1Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degan J. Bronson R., De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 419-424Google Scholar, 4Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Danton M.J.S. Daugherty C.C. Romer J. Dano K. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Degen J.L. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5899-5904Google Scholar). We recently reported that clearance of pulmonary microemboli in uPA−/− mice is delayed, despite the presence of an intact tPA system (5Bdeir K. Murciano J.C. Tomaszewski J. Koniaris L. Martinez J. Cines D. Muzykantov V. Higazi A.-A.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 1820-1826Google Scholar). uPA has also been implicated in other pathophysiological processes, such as pulmonary inflammation and repair, in which the relationship to fibrinolysis is less clear. For example, uPA−/− mice are more susceptible to lethal pulmonary infection (6Gyetko M. Chen G.-H. McDonald R.A. Goodman R. Huffnagle G.B. WIlkinson C.C. Fuller J.A. Toews G.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1818-1826Google Scholar) and to the development of pulmonary fibrosis (7Sisson T.H. Hattori N., Xu, Y. Simon R.H. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 2315-2323Google Scholar), end-points that might reflect contribution of uPA in cell adhesion (8Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Google Scholar) and migration to these phenotypes. However, the mechanism by which uPA is involved in these processes has not been established. In a previous study we found that uPA enhances phenylephrine and endothelin-induced vasoconstriction of aortic rings isolated from rats (9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar). The possibility that uPA contributes to the regulation of vascular tone may help to explain some of the phenotypic changes described in uPA−/− mice and perhaps provide a broader understanding of the role played by uPA in certain physiological and pathological processes, such as inflammation (6Gyetko M. Chen G.-H. McDonald R.A. Goodman R. Huffnagle G.B. WIlkinson C.C. Fuller J.A. Toews G.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1818-1826Google Scholar) and metastasis. It was, therefore, of interest to examine the contribution of endogenous uPA to the regulation of vasoactivity in vivo. These experiments, having been performed using rat aortic rings and human uPA, also raised a question as to the nature of the vascular receptor that mediates the contractile properties of uPA (9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar). Because rat uPAR does not bind human uPA (10Quax P.H.A. Pederson N. Masucci M.T. Weening-Verhoeff E.J.D. Dano K. Verheijen J.H. Blasi F. Cell. Reg. 1991; 2: 713-803Google Scholar), the results suggest that uPAR is not directly responsible for the observed vasoactivity, but they leave the identity of this other “uPA receptor” unresolved. Also uncertain is the effect of PAI-1, which binds to tcuPA with high affinity and neutralizes its proteolytic activity (11Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophy. 1988; 262: 199-210Google Scholar). The results of several studies indicate that PAI-1 is elevated in the plasma of patients with hypertension, and reduction of blood pressure by certain classes of anti-hypertensive agents is associated with a decrease in PAI-1 concentration (12Brown N.J. Agirbashi M. Aughan D.E. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 285-290Google Scholar, 13Sakata K. Shirotani M. Yoshida H. Urano T. Takada Y. Takada A. Am. Heart J. 1999; 137: 1094-1099Google Scholar, 14Mitsui T.

Whether this is a cause or result of therapy is unclear. To address these questions, we turned to uPA−/− mice. In the present paper we report that uPA−/− mice have lower blood pressure than wild type (WT) animals and that the contractility of their blood vessels is attenuated in vitro and in vivo. We also report that the stimulatory effect of tcuPA on vascular smooth muscle cell activation is mediated by LRP and through a process that inhibited by PAI-1 but independent of its proteolytic activity. Recombinant full-length uPA and a uPA variant lacking the kringle were prepared in S2 cells and purified as in Ref. 9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar. Phenylephrine (PE) was purchased from Sigma. uPA−/− and uPAR−/− mice on a C57/black background and wild type C57/black mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Four-month-old male mice were used in all studies. Recombinant 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (rRAP) and purified soluble LRP were generously provided by Dr. D. Strickland (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). Anti-LRP antibodies were also provided by D. Strickland and by American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). The peptides (EEIIMD and REIIMD) were synthesized as previously described (16Zhang L. Strickland D.K. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27053-27057Google Scholar). tcuPA and its amino-terminal fragment (ATF) were prepared and purified as in Ref. 9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was measured as in Ref. 9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/Kg−1 ketamine and 50 mg/Kg xylazine. One cannula was placed in the left carotid artery to record the mean arterial blood pressure, and a second through which PE (0.3 μg per animal) was administered was placed in the right jugular vein. Blood pressure was monitored continuously through a transducer placed in the left carotid cannula using the CARDIOSYS computerized system (ExperimentiaÆ, Budapest, Hungary). In some experiments, tcuPA, ATF, tcuPA/PAI-1, or tcuPA/EEIIMD complex were infused through the cannula placed in the right jugular using a multisyringe pump at a rate of 5 μl/min (maximum 60 min), and the MABP was determined beginning 10 min later. In other experiments, anti-LRP antibody or control IgG was administered by constant infusion for 5 min followed by co-infusion of antibody with tcuPA or ATF for the remainder of the experiment. Experiments were performed as described in Ref. 9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar. Mice were sacrificed by exsanguination. Thoracic aortae were removed with care to avoid damage to the endothelium, dissected free of fat and connective tissue, and cut into transverse rings 5 mm in length (17Kyong S.K. Chang K.S. Stevens W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 983-990Google Scholar, 18Yohtaro O. Hisao K. Yuichi H. Morio K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 131: 75-78Google Scholar, 19Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 20Oyama Y. Kawasaki H. Hattori Y. Kanno M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 132: 75-78Google Scholar). In another set of experiments, the rings were gently rotated on a stainless steel rod to remove the endothelium (denuded aorta). To record isometric tension the rings were mounted in a 10-ml bath containing oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) solution of Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer (144 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.6 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mmNaHCO3, and 11.1 mmd-glucose). Each aortic ring was then contracted by adding PE in stepwise increments from 10−10m to 10−5m. In other experiments, uPA was added 15 min before addition of PE. In each experiment, rings exposed to KH buffer alone were analyzed in parallel. Isometric tension was measured with a force displacement transducer and recorded online using a computerized system (ExperimentiaÆ). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) was calculated by measuring the response of the aortic rings to increasing concentration of PE. In all studies, results are shown as the mean ± S.E. from three experiments. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) was calculated from data that show the response of the aortic rings to increasing concentration of PE and includes the data from at least three repetitions of the same experiment. After drawing a figure portraying the outcome, two lines that intersect with the yand x axes were drawn to determine the PE concentration that induces 50% of the maximal effect. The life-time of uPA in the circulation was determined as described previously (5Bdeir K. Murciano J.C. Tomaszewski J. Koniaris L. Martinez J. Cines D. Muzykantov V. Higazi A.-A.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 1820-1826Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were injected intravenously with a single dose of125I-labeled tcuPA or 125I-labeled Δk-tcuPA (0.1 mg/kg). Blood was withdrawn by intracardiac injection at the indicated time points and counted for radioactivity. We previously reported that tcuPA, its ATF, and kringle domain enhance PE-induced vasoconstriction of rat aortic rings (9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar). In the present paper, we examined the contribution of endogenous uPA to blood pressure regulation in mice. To do so, we first compared the MABP of uPA−/− mice with that of WT controls. The data presented in Table I show that the blood pressure of uPA−/− mice was significantly lower than that of WT animals. The MABP in WT mice was 73.17 ± 3.97 mm Hg (n = 6), whereas the uPA−/− mice had an MABP of 53.83 ± 3.54 mm Hg (n = 6;p = 0.0005 in the paired t test). The lower MABP in uPA−/− mice reflected both a lowered systolic and diastolic pressures. The systolic and diastolic pressures in the uPA−/− mice were 63.17 ± 2.88 and 44.51 ± 4.43 mm Hg, while those in the WT mice were 87.6 ± 3.93 and 58.81 ± 3.86 mm Hg, respectively.Table IBasal MABP of wild type and knock-out miceMABP (mmHg)Wild typeKnock-out755077496655725673587655The mean arterial blood pressure was determined in WT or uPA−/− mice by introducing a sensor through the carotid artery, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab The mean arterial blood pressure was determined in WT or uPA−/− mice by introducing a sensor through the carotid artery, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Similar differences were observed when the contractions of isolated aortic rings from the two sets of mice were compared. Aortic rings from uPA−/− mice had a reduced response to phenylephrine,i.e. rings from WT mice had an EC50 of 7.94 nm PE, whereas uPA−/− had an EC50of 251 nm (Fig. 1). Although aortic rings from uPA−/− mice showed an impaired contractile response to PE, their maximal response did not differ from that of WT animals at high concentrations of agonist (Fig.1), indicating that these mice do not lack vascular receptors and that the downstream intracellular signal transduction mechanisms are intact. In support of this conclusion, injection of PE (0.3 μg) increased MABP in the WT and uPA−/− animals to the same level (127 ± 3 mm Hg in the WT compared with 128 ± 4 mm Hg in uPA−/− mice). Moreover, the impaired contractility of aortic rings from uPA−/− mice was almost completely reversed by the addition of 1 nm mouse or human tcuPA (Fig.2). These results indicate that it is the deficiency of uPA itself and not a secondary defect in the vasculature of these mice that underlies the difference in phenotype. Having observed that uPA is involved in the regulation of the vasoactivity in vivo, our next goal was to identify the responsible cellular receptor. The finding that human and mouse uPA had a similar effect on the tension in mouse aortic rings (Fig. 2) suggests strongly that uPAR is not directly involved in the uPA-mediated vasocontractility. However, to examine the involvement of uPAR directly, we measured mean aortic blood pressure in uPAR−/− mice. The MABP of uPAR−/− mice (71 ± 4.29 mm Hg, n = 6) and WT mice were virtually identical. Second, the response of isolated aortic rings from uPAR−/− mice to PE was similar to that of WT mice, with an EC50 of 8.45 nm. It is known that tcuPA binds to LRP (21Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Google Scholar, 22Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Google Scholar) and that binding of ligands, such as α2-macroglobulin, to LRP triggers mobilization of Ca2+ in certain cell types (23Bacskai B. Xia M. Strickland D. Rebeck G. Hyman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated LRP as a candidate receptor involved in uPA-mediated vasoconstriction. To examine the potential involvement of LRP in the tcuPA-induced vasoactivity, we used two different approaches. First, we studied the effect of the receptor-associated protein (RAP) on tcuPA-mediated contractility. RAP is a 39-kDa protein that co-purifies with LRP and inhibits the binding of tcuPA (24Krieger M. Herz J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Google Scholar). rRAP (20 nm) prevented uPA from restoring normal contractility to aortic rings from uPA−/− mice. Second, anti-LRP antibodies prevented (20 nm) tcuPA-enhanced contraction, whereas a blocking antibody to the LDL receptor had no effect (Fig.3). Neither rRAP nor anti-LRP affected PE-induced vasoconstriction in the absence of uPA (Fig. 3). LRP has been shown to mediate the clearance of uPA from the circulation in vivo, i.e. blocking LRP by RAP increases the half-life of uPA (25van der Kaaden M.E. Rijken D.C. Kruijt J.K. van Berkel T.J. Kuiper J. Thromb Haemost. 1997; 77: 710-717Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effect of anti-LRP antibodies on the regulation of blood pressure by uPA in vivo. Injecting human uPA to uPA−/−mice (0.1 mg/kg) restored the MABP to normal (Fig.4 A); higher doses of uPA had no additional effect (not shown). Preinjection of anti-LRP abolished the restoration of blood pressure by uPA (Fig. 4 A) and increased its half-life in the circulation (Fig. 4 B). We previously reported (9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar) that the stimulatory effect of uPA on PE-induced vasoconstriction is mediated by its kringle. In agreement with this, a uPA variant in which the kringle was deleted (Δk-uPA) was unable to restore blood pressure in uPA−/− mice (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the half-life of Δk-uPA was prolonged comparably to that of WT uPA measured in the presence of anti-LRP (Fig.4 B). Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) binds tightly to tcuPA and enhances the affinity of the resultant complexes for LRP (26Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnenfeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Google Scholar, 27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Google Scholar). To examine the effect of PAI-1 on uPA-mediated contractility, aortic rings were contracted by adding increasing concentrations of PE in the presence of 1 nm tcuPA alone or together with equimolar concentrations of PAI-1. As expected, tcuPA (1 nm) augmented the PE-induced contraction of aortic rings from uPA−/− mice, decreasing the EC50 of PE from 254 to 9.43 nm (Fig. 5). In the presence of an equimolar concentration of PAI-1 the effect of tcuPA was abolished (EC50 248 nm) (Fig.6).Figure 6Effect of PAI-1 on tcuPA-induced vasoactivity of aortic rings from uPA −/− mice. The EC50 of PE-induced vasoconstriction of aortic rings of uPA−/− mice was determined without further additions (Cont.) or in the presence of 2 nm tcuPA (uPA), 2 nm tcuPA preincubated with an equimolar concentration of PAI-1 (uPA+PAI-1), 10 nm PAI-1 alone (PAI-1), 2 nm tcuPA preincubated with 1 μm PAI-1-derived peptide (uPA+EE), 1 μm EEIIMD alone (EE), 2 nm tcuPA and 1 μm REIIMD (uPA+RE), or 10 μm REIIMD alone (RE).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) tcuPA binds to PAI-1 through two distinct epitopes, one involving its catalytic site. The other site, EEIIMD, comprises residues 350–355 in PAI, which interacts with residues 179–184 in uPA (28Adams D.S. Griffin L.A. Nachajko W.R. Reddy V.B. Wei C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8476-8482Google Scholar). We previously found that the isolated EEIIMD peptide inhibits the binding of PAI-1 to tcuPA and regulates the binding of scuPA to cell-associated and purified LRP (16Zhang L. Strickland D.K. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27053-27057Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of EEIIMD on the vasocontractile properties of tcuPA. EEIIMD (1 μm) abolished the capacity of tcuPA to restore PE-induced vasoconstriction of aortic rings from uPA−/−mice to normal (Fig. 6). In contrast, the control peptide, REIIMD, which has almost no effect on PAI-1 binding to uPA (16Zhang L. Strickland D.K. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27053-27057Google Scholar), did not affect tcuPA-mediated vasoactivity. Neither did PAI-1 nor EEIIMD alone alter the contraction of aortic rings. The inhibitory effect of PAI-1 and the PAI-1-derived peptide on tcuPA vasoactivity was also seen using aortic rings from WT mice (not shown). The vasoactive effect of the uPA ATF is similar to that of tcuPA (9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar), but ATF lacks proteolytic activity and the binding epitopes for PAI-1 and EEIIMD peptide. PAI-1 had no effect on ATF-induced vasoactivity (Fig. 7). The same result was obtained with 1 μm EEIIMD (not shown), excluding an effect of PAI-1 or EEIIMD on other components of the system. PAI-1 also modulated the procontractile effect of tcuPA in vivo. tcuPA (0.1 mg/kg) no longer was able to restore the blood pressure of uPA−/− mice in the presence of an equimolar concentration (∼40 nm) of PAI-1 (Fig.8); the same outcome was observed after infusion of EEIIMD. In contrast, ATF (0.1 mg/kg), which had the same procontractile effect as full-length tcuPA, was refractory to PAI-1 and to EEIIMD (Fig. 8). To examine the role of the endothelium and specifically that of eNO synthase in uPA-mediated vasoconstriction, we first studied the effect of tcuPA on denuded rat aortic rings. We used rat aortic rings because it is technically difficult to denude aortic rings from mice completely and atraumatically. As previously reported by us (9Haj-Yehia A. Nassar T. Sachais B. Kuo A. Bdeir K., Al- Mehdi A.-B. Mazar A. Cines D. Higazi A.A.-R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1411-1422Google Scholar), tcuPA stimulated the PE-induced constriction of isolated rat aortic rings but had no vasoactive effect on denuded rings (Fig.9). Second, L-NAME inhibited uPA-mediated contraction of rat (Fig. 9) and mouse (not shown) aortic rings. Our data show that uPA participates in the endogenous regulation of blood pressure in vivo. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First, uPA−/− mice have reduced systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures. Second, aortic rings isolated from uPA−/− mice have impaired contractile responses to low doses of phenylephrine. Third, the lower blood pressure in uPA−/− mice and the attenuated response of isolated aortic rings from these mice are restored to normal by addition of uPA exogenously. Fourth, ligands that bind to uPA, such as PAI-1 or the PAI-1-derived peptide, neutralize its vasoactivity. The observations that aortic rings from uPAR−/− mice respond normally to PE and that these mice have a normal blood pressure indicates that the effect of uPA is independent of this receptor. The difference in blood pressure observed in uPA−/− and uPAR−/− mice is reminiscent of other differences in their phenotypes (4Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Danton M.J.S. Daugherty C.C. Romer J. Dano K. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Degen J.L. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5899-5904Google Scholar) and supports the existence of additional uPA receptors. The finding that anti-LRP antibodies and rRAP abolish the effect of uPAin vitro and in vivo suggests that the effect of uPA on vascular contractility is mediated through LRP. This conclusion is supported by the observation that ligands that affect the interaction of tcuPA with LRP (PAI-1 and EEIIMD) attenuate the vasoactive effect of uPA. Our findings support the hypothesis of Bacskai et al. (23Bacskai B. Xia M. Strickland D. Rebeck G. Hyman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11551-11556Google Scholar) that LRP can act as a signal-transducing receptor to mobilize release of intracellular Ca2+, which is necessary for contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells. The ability of PAI-1 to neutralize the provasocontractile effects of uPA is relevant to understanding the behavior of LRP as well as smooth muscle cell contraction. PAI-1 binds to LRP (26Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnenfeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Google Scholar, 27Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Google Scholar), but does not affect PE-induced vasoconstriction unless complexed with tcuPA. Indeed, PAI-1 and its derived peptide (EEIIMD) inhibit the vasocontractile effect of uPA although both augment binding of urokinase to LRP (16Zhang L. Strickland D.K. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27053-27057Google Scholar, 26Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonnenfeld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol.

These findings indicate that not all LRP ligands transduce signals leading to vasoconstriction. Additional study is needed to understand how LRP differentially handles the diverse ligands that it encounters. Several groups have reported that PAI-1 levels are elevated in hypertensive patients and that reduction of blood pressure by certain, but not all, forms of medical treatment are associated with a decrease in PAI-1 (12Brown N.J. Agirbashi M. Aughan D.E. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 285-290Google Scholar, 13Sakata K. Shirotani M. Yoshida H. Urano T. Takada Y. Takada A. Am. Heart J. 1999; 137: 1094-1099Google Scholar, 14Mitsui T.

Whether changes in PAI-1 are a cause or consequence of changes in vascular tone is unknown. Nevertheless, our studies raise the possibility that vascular tone and other critical behaviors of vascular smooth muscle cells are regulated in part through LRP and can be modified by PAI-1-derived peptides. The mechanism by which uPA internalized by LRP signals intracellularly requires additional study. It is widely accepted that LRP is an endocytic receptor that delivers ligands to lysosomes. Recently, LRP has also been shown to initiate intracellular signaling. The human immunodeficiency virus-Tat protein binds to LRP and is internalized into endosomes and later translocated to the nucleus, by a process that is poorly understood, where it stimulates transcription (29Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C., Bu, G. Laribee N. Tanzi R.E. Moir R.D. Nath A. He J.J. Nat. Med. 2000; 12: 1380Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which mediates ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 in the cytoplasm, enters the cell exclusively via LRP (30Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Google Scholar). The toxin is composed of a single-chain polypeptide that harbors a fusogenic domain that mediates its translocation into the cytoplasm (30Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Google Scholar). It is possible that a fraction of the unbound uPA may escape proteolysis and exit the lysosomes to reach another location where it can initiate signal transduction. Conversely, binding of uPA to PAI-1 may change its destination by accelerating its degradation, thereby impeding signal transduction. This hypothesis is in accord with our previous data that show that PAI-1 and PAI-1-derived peptide (EEIIMD) increases the degradation of uPA (16Zhang L. Strickland D.K. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27053-27057Google Scholar, 31Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R. Cohen R. McCrae K.R. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. Kounnas M. Strickland D. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the differences we found in blood pressure of anesthetized WT (and uPAR−/−) compared with uPA−/− mice were recorded in the absence of any exogenous vasoactive compounds. Injection of PE increased the MABP in WT and uPA−/− mice to the same level, and a similar effect was seen in isolated aortic rings. These findings suggest that under certain physiological and/or pathological conditions, such as pain or stress, the decreased blood pressure in uPA−/− may not be evident. This is consistent with the absence of an effect of uPA on aortic blood pressure measured through an open abdominal incision in a setting associated with significant hypotension (32Levi M. Moons L. Bouché A. Shapiro S.D. Collen C. Carmeliet P. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2014Google Scholar). Although we have shown that urokinase acts on LRP as a ligand to modulate blood vessel reactivity, the details of the downstream signaling pathway and the involvement for eNOS will also require additional study. Better insights into this process may provide information that will help to elucidate the relationship among the fibrinolytic and inflammatory systems, vasoactivity, and cancer invasiveness, in which urokinase and PAI-1 are known to play key roles (33Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N. Holst-Hansen C. Skobe M. Fusenig N.E. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Foidart J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 923-928Google Scholar). Furthermore, a better understanding of the mechanism by which uPA regulated vasoactivity may facilitate the design of thrombolytic agents with more selective fibrinolytic activity or antagonists that block vascular effects that contribute to untoward inflammatory reactions or tumor cell migration."

We recently demonstrated that PAP could also inhibit translation of mRNAs and viral RNAs that are capped by binding to the cap structure and depurinating the RNAs downstream of the cap. Cell growth is inhibited when PAP cDNA is expressed in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. Here, we show that overexpression of wild type PAP in yeast leads to a decrease in PAP mRNA abundance. The decrease in mRNA levels is not observed with an active site mutant, indicating that it is due to theN-glycosidase activity of the protein. PAP expression had no effect on steady state levels of mRNA from four different endogenous yeast genes examined, indicating specificity. We demonstrate that PAP can depurinate the rRNA in trans in a translation-independent manner. When rRNA is depurinated and translation is inhibited, the steady state levels of PAP mRNA increase dramatically relative to the U3 snoRNA. Using a PAP variant which depurinates rRNA, inhibits translation but does not destabilize its mRNA, we demonstrate that PAP mRNA is destabilized after its levels are up-regulated by a mechanism that occurs independently of rRNA depurination and translation. We quantify the extent of rRNA depurination in vivo using a novel primer extension assay and show that the temporal pattern of rRNA depurination is similar to the pattern of PAP mRNA destabilization, suggesting that they may occur by a common mechanism. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that a single chain RIP targets not only the large rRNA but also its own mRNA. These findings have implications for understanding the biological function of RIPs.

The enzymatic removal of specific purines from the S/R loop has been reported to interfere with the binding of eEF-2 (elongation factor 2) and inhibit protein synthesis at the translocation step (4Montanaro L.

Biochem. 1990; 193: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RIPs are protein toxins produced by organisms ranging from bacteria to plants. Because of their selective toxicity, they have been used as biological weapons, to protect plants against pathogens, and as therapies against cancer. Their biological function in the organisms that produce them is unknown. PAP is thought to be a defense protein because it is a potent inhibitor of animal and plant viral pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, herpes simplex virus, influenza, potato virus X, and brome mosaic virus (6Aron G. Irvin J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 17: 1032-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Lodge J.K. Kaniewski W.K. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Nature. 1990; 347: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because of its cytotoxicity to dividing cells, PAP is currently under clinical trials as a potent anticancer agent (11Waurzyniak B. Schneider E.A. Tumer N. Yanishevski Y. Gunther R. Chelstrom L.M. Wendorf H. Myers D.E. Irvin J.D. Messinger Y., Ek, O. Zeren T. Langlie M.C. Evans W.E. Uckun F.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PAP inhibits cell growth or viral infection is not well understood. Translation inhibition by PAP and the resulting host cell death have been hypothesized to be responsible for the antiviral activity of PAP. However, a nontoxic C-terminal deletion mutant of PAP inhibited viral infection without depurinating host ribosomes, indicating that antiviral activity could be separated from rRNA depurination (12Tumer N.E. Hwang D.J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of nontoxic forms of PAP in transgenic plants induced a stress-associated signal transduction pathway and provided resistance to viral and fungal infection (13Zoubenko O. Uckun F. Hur Y. Chet I. Tumer N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Zoubenko O. Hudak K. Tumer N.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PAP is very active against both animal and plant ribosomes. It accesses the S/R loop by binding to ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3), a highly conserved protein associated with the peptidyltransferase center of ribosomes (15Hudak K.A. Dinman J.D. Tumer N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3859-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our recent results indicate that in a cell-free system, PAP can inhibit translation of mRNAs and viral RNAs that are capped by recognizing the cap structure and depurinating the capped RNAs (3Hudak K.A. Wang P.G. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Incubation of brome mosaic virus RNAs or capped luciferase RNA with PAP resulted in depurination of either RNA. In contrast, uncapped luciferase RNA was not depurinated after incubation with identical concentrations of PAP (3Hudak K.A. Wang P.G. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Analysis of the interaction between the cap structure and PAP indicated that PAP binds to the m7GpppG cap structure but does not remove the cap (16Hudak K.A. Bauman J.D. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2002; 8: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PAP depurinates the RNA downstream of the cap at specific sites (16Hudak K.A. Bauman J.D. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2002; 8: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The relative affinity of PAP for capped RNA is similar to its affinity for the S/R loop of rRNA, suggesting that rRNA might not be the only target of PAP (16Hudak K.A. Bauman J.D. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2002; 8: 1148-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In our previous studies with transgenic plants, we observed that mRNA corresponding to wild type PAP was not detected by Northern blot analysis (13Zoubenko O. Uckun F. Hur Y. Chet I. Tumer N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) even though PAP protein was detected (12Tumer N.E. Hwang D.J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, PAP mRNA was detected in transgenic lines expressing the inactive form, PAPx (or PAPE176V), which contains the point mutation, E176V, at its active site (13Zoubenko O. Uckun F. Hur Y. Chet I. Tumer N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effect of PAP on the stability of its own mRNA and cellular mRNAs in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiaewhere PAP expression can be tightly controlled. We have previously shown that PAP expression in yeast duplicates the effects of PAP in plant cells (12Tumer N.E. Hwang D.J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that PAP overexpression leads to a pronounced decrease of its mRNA levels. By comparison, PAP mRNA abundance is not affected in cells expressing an active site mutant, indicating that an intact active site is necessary for down-regulation of PAP expression. By examining the relationship between rRNA depurination and mRNA decay, we establish that PAP regulates the stability of its mRNA by a mechanism that can be separated from rRNA depurination and inhibition of translation. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that a ribosome inactivating protein targets its own mRNA, in addition to rRNAin vivo. We discuss the significance of these observations for the biological function of RIPs. S. cerevisiae strain W303 (MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 his3-11, 15 can1-100) was used for all of the assays. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD rich medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or synthetic dropout (SD) medium (0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids (17Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A., Li, P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To induce expression of PAP and PAP variants, transformed yeast were grown initially at 30 °C in 150 ml of selective medium containing 2% raffinose to a starting A 600 of 0.6. At zero time the medium was replaced with 300 ml of selective medium (SD−Leu) containing 2% galactose to a startingA 600 of 0.3. Subsequently, 5 ml of culture was taken for protein isolation, 25 ml for RNA isolation, and 1 ml for a growth reading (A 600) at various times post-induction. The medium was diluted periodically to maintain the cells in the logarithmic phase (A 600 between 0.3 and 0.6). Doubling times were calculated based on exponential growth between 4 and 10 h post-induction. For measuring the effect of translation and transcription on rRNA depurination, yeast were grown at 30 °C in 150 ml of SD−Leu, 2% raffinose to an initialA 600 of 0.6. Cells were then pelleted, washed once, and resuspended in 13 ml of SD−Leu, 2% galactose to induce PAP expression. At 1 h post-induction, 2% glucose with or without cycloheximide to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml was added to the medium, and 2 ml of pellets were collected for RNA and protein isolation at the indicated times. PAP expression plasmids used in this study were described previously (3Hudak K.A. Wang P.G. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of PAP in NT188 and the nontoxic PAP variants PAPE176V and PAPL71R in NT224 and NT538, respectively, is under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter in the YEp351-based high-copy plasmid. The NT616 contained the firefly luciferase cDNA from pLUC0 (18Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A., Li, P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) downstream of the GAL1 promoter in YEp351. Total RNA from cells expressing PAP, PAPE176V, and PAPL71R was analyzed with the RNase protection assay according to Tumer et al. (18Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A., Li, P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNase protection assay was performed using several gene-specific antisense RNA probes to measure the steady state levels of mRNA. A 281-nt CYH2-specific probe was generated from an SP6 RNA polymerase run-off transcript of HincII-digested p3433 (18Tumer N.E. Parikh B.A., Li, P. Dinman J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 90-nt U3-specific probe was generated from a T3 RNA polymerase run-off transcript of SspI-digested pJD161 (19Hagan K.W. Ruizechevarria M.J. Quan Y. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 809-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), constitutively expressed from an RNA polymerase III promoter, was used as loading control. A 252-nt RNA probe that hybridizes to the 3′ end of PAP mRNA was generated from a SP6 RNA polymerase transcript of XhoI-digested pMON8588. A 200-nt XRN1-specific probe was generated from a T3 RNA polymerase run-off transcript of DdeI-digested pNT404. The pNT404 has a 2-kb BglII/HincII fragment of theXRN1 gene from pXRN1 cloned into theBamHI/HincII sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). A 260-nt LEU2-specific probe was generated from a T3 RNA polymerase transcript of EcoRI-digested pNT403. pNT403 was constructed by inserting a 745-bp HincII/ClaI fragment of the LEU2 gene from YEp351 into pGEM3Zf(+) digested with the same restriction enzymes. A 250-nt RPL3-specific probe was generated from a T7 RNA polymerase transcript of XbaI-digested pRPL3, which carries the ribosomal protein gene RPL3. A 180-ntPGK1-specific probe was generated from a T7 RNA polymerase run-off transcript of SalI-digested pRS314-PGK1. Protected fragments were separated on a 7 m urea 5% acrylamide denaturing gel, visualized with radiographic film (Kodak), and quantified on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Protein from frozen yeast cells expressing PAP, PAPE176V, and PAPL71Rharvested during the time course of induction, was extracted as described by Hudak et al. (15Hudak K.A. Dinman J.D. Tumer N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3859-3864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Total protein (7.5 μg) from each time point was separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with affinity-purified anti-PAP polyclonal antibody (1:5000). PAP was visualized by chemiluminescence using the Renaissance kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The blots were then stripped for 30 min with 8 m guanidine hydrochloride and reprobed with antibody to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) (1:5000) as an internal loading control. Ribosomal RNA depurination was assayed by primer extension analysis as described previously (20Hudak K.A. Hammell A.B. Yasenchak J. Tumer N.E. Dinman J.D. Virology. 2001; 279: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of total yeast RNA from cells expressing PAP was hybridized with 106 cpm of reverse primer (5′-AGCGGATGGTGCTTCGCGGCAATG-3′). This depurination primer was end-labeled by T4 kinase (Invitrogen) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and it hybridized 73 nt 3′ of the depurination site. The presence or absence of depurination was noted by synthesis of a 73-nt extension product that terminated at the depurination site. Superscript II-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used in the primer extension assay following the protocol described in Hudak et al. (3Hudak K.A. Wang P.G. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Extension products were separated on a 7 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and visualized and quantified on a Phosphor-Imager (AmershamBiosciences). Further studies requiring more accurate quantification of depurination employed the use of a second primer serving as an internal control. For these analyses, either 1.25 μg of total yeast RNA isolated from yeast expressing PAP, PAPE176V, or PAPL71R, as described above, or 1.0 μg of rRNA isolated from ribosomes was hybridized to two different reverse primers. The second primer hybridized upstream of the depurination site close to the 5′ end of the 25 S rRNA. For in vitro depurination assays, yeast ribosomes were isolated as described previously (20Hudak K.A. Hammell A.B. Yasenchak J. Tumer N.E. Dinman J.D. Virology. 2001; 279: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ribosomes were then either incubated in buffer alone or depurinated with 250 ng of purified PAP to completion as described previously (20Hudak K.A. Hammell A.B. Yasenchak J. Tumer N.E. Dinman J.D. Virology. 2001; 279: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To quantify the extent of depurination, the target RNA was hybridized initially in the presence of excess amounts (700 pmol) of the two [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled negative strand primers. The depurination primer described above annealed 73 nt 3′ of the depurination site (A3137) on the 25 S rRNA. The 25 S control primer (5′-TTCACTCGCCGTTACTAAGG-3′) annealed 100 nt 3′ of the 25 S rRNA 5′ end. To allow for accurate quantification, the labeled 25 S control primer was diluted 1:4 with unlabeled 25 S control primer. Superscript II-reverse transcriptase was used in the primer extension assay as above. Extension products for the control and depurination fragments (100 and 73 nt, respectively) were separated on a 7m urea, 5% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and visualized and quantified on a PhosphorImager. The amount of total yeast RNA and rRNA used was determined previously to be in the linear range of detection. Yeast cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.6 in SD−Leu, −Met, 2% raffinose. Cells were then resuspended at anA 600 of 0.3 in 2% galactose for 4–10 h to induce either wild type PAP or PAP variant expression. At time zero, [35S]methionine was added to cells growing on galactose. At the times indicated, 800 μl of yeast cells were removed for growth measurements, and additional aliquots of 800 μl were assayed for methionine incorporation in duplicate as described by Carr-Schmidet al. (21Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the yeast were added to 200 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min on ice followed by 20 min at 70 °C. The precipitate was then filtered through 24-mm glass microfiber filters (VWR), washed with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by ice cold 95% ethanol. Filters were dried for several hours, and incorporation was quantified in a scintillation counter. The cpm was normalized to the A 600 reading. Rates of translation were determined from these results and tabulated as CPM/A 600/min. To obtain translation inhibition in PAPE176V cells comparable to wild type PAP inhibition at 4 h post-induction, ∼5 μg/ml final concentration of anisomycin was added to the medium at 2 h post-induction. This amount was titrated previously to achieve 75% translation inhibition (data not shown). To determine whether PAP affects the stability of its own mRNA in vivo,cDNAs encoding the wild type PAP or nontoxic variants were placed under the regulation of the GAL1 promoter and expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The variants used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. They include the nontoxic PAPE176V, which contains a point mutation (E176V) at its active site and produces an inactive protein, and PAPL71R, which contains a point mutation (L71R) at the putative RNA binding domain and has reduced toxicity compared with wild type PAP. We have previously shown that yeast cells transformed with plasmids carrying PAPE176V or the vector alone (YEp351) were able to grow on SD−Leu plates containing galactose (17Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, yeast cells harboring the wild type PAP plasmid (NT188) failed to grow on plates containing galactose (17Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, the growth of cells expressing the wild type PAP but not PAPE176V was inhibited in liquid SD−Leu medium containing galactose compared with cells harboring the same vector (YEp351) with luciferase cDNA (VC). The doubling time of cells expressing PAPE176V was similar to the vector control, 3.9 ± 0.1 h, whereas the doubling time of cells expressing wild type PAP was 11.9 ± 1.7 h. Growth of cells expressing PAPL71R was also inhibited in liquid medium containing galactose but not to the same extent as wild type PAP. This was evident from its doubling time of 8.5 ± 0.8 h and ability to grow on plates containing galactose (data not shown). The addition of anisomycin to cells expressing PAPE176Vresulted in complete inhibition of growth (doubling time: 24.9 ± 2.0 h). These results suggested that the inhibition of growth observed in cells expressing wild type PAP might be due to inhibition of translation.Figure 2Growth of yeast expressing PAP and the PAP variants. Expression of PAP, PAPL71R, PAPE176V, PAPE176V + anisomycin, and vector control (VC) was induced by growing cells in SD−Leu medium containing 2% galactose. An A 600 reading was taken for growth measurement at the indicated times after induction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether reduction of growth is correlated with inhibition of translation, we examined total translation in cells expressing PAP, PAPE176V, and PAPL71R compared with control cells harboring the same vector with luciferase cDNA. Total translation was examined by [35S]methionine incorporation at 4 and 10 h post-induction (21Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, cells grown in galactose for 4 h to induce expression of PAPE176V were not significantly inhibited in translation as compared with vector control cells. The rate of translation in cells expressing PAPE176V, judged from the slope of the curve in Fig.3 A, was 88.7 ± 2.9% of the rate of translation in vector control cells (Table I). The rate of translation in yeast expressing active PAP was 27.4 ± 3.0% of the vector control as determined by averaging the results of five independent experiments (Table I). These results indicate that total translation is significantly inhibited in cells expressing PAP but not PAPE176V.Table ITranslation rates of PAP and PAP variantsPAP or PAP variantTranslation RateaTranslation rates were determined at 4 h post-induction by measuring the slope of the methionine incorporation curve shown in Fig. 3 A and expressed as a percent of the translation rate for the vector control.

The rates were confirmed by at least two independent experiments.b Approximately 5 μg/ml anisomycin was added to cells expressing PAPE176V at 2 h post-induction, and translation was analyzed at 4 h as described in footnote a. Open table in a new tab The growth inhibition observed in the presence of anisomycin in Fig. 2suggested that inhibition of growth might be due to inhibition of translation. Under these conditions, we would expect cells expressing PAPL71R to be inhibited in translation. As shown in Fig.3 A, total translation was significantly inhibited in cells expressing PAPL71R at 4 h post-induction. The rate of translation in cells expressing PAPL71R was 33.8 ± 0.7% of the vector control (Table I). Analysis of total translation at 10 h post-induction indicated that translation remained inhibited in cells expressing wild type PAP and PAPL71R but not in PAPE176V (Fig. 3 B). These results provide evidence that the reduction in growth observed in cells expressing wild type PAP and PAPL71R correlates with the inhibition of translation observed in these cells. Because our previous results had indicated that PAP can inhibit translation by depurinating capped RNAs (3Hudak K.A. Wang P.G. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), to determine whether translation inhibition correlated with the activity of PAP on mRNAs in vivo, we examined the abundance of PAP mRNA and cellular mRNAs in yeast expressing the wild type and mutant forms of PAP. Cells were harvested at various times after induction on galactose, and the level of PAP mRNA was measured by RNase protection assay (Fig. 4 A). A 252-nt 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe corresponding to the 3′ end of PAP mRNA was transcribed and hybridized with total RNA extracted from cells harboring PAP, PAPE176V, and PAPL71R plasmids. A 90-nt 32P-labeled antisense probe specific for U3 snoRNA, which is constitutively expressed from an RNA polymerase III promoter, was used as a loading control (19Hagan K.W. Ruizechevarria M.J. Quan Y. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 809-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were separated electrophoretically, and the intensities of the protected bands were quantified using a Phosphor- Imager. The ratios for signals of the PAP, PAPE176V, or PAPL71RmRNAs to the U3 snoRNA were used as relative measures of the steady state abundance of the PAP, PAPE176V, or PAPL71R mRNAs. The cells harboring the vector alone (YEp351) grown for 8 h on raffinose or galactose did not show any detectable background (data not shown). Similarly, RNase protection analysis using tRNA did not show any protected fragments corresponding to either PAP or U3 (Fig. 4 A). As expression of wild type PAP was induced, the level of PAP mRNA decreased dramatically relative to the U3 snoRNA (Fig. 4 A). By 10 h post-induction, PAP mRNA levels decreased to about 10% of the levels observed at 4 h post-induction (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, PAPE176V mRNA levels increased up to 10 h post-induction and reached steady state levels after 10 h. Although the overall increase in PAPE176V mRNA was highly reproducible, the extent of the increase was subject to some variation. The amount of mRNA present at 10 h in cells expressing PAPE176V was between 2.5 and 8 times greater than that at 4 h. The error bars in Fig. 4 Brepresent averaging of three independent quantifications, and the RNase protection analysis was repeated at least three times with similar results. These results indicated that PAP mRNA is destabilized in cells expressing wild type PAP. This regulation is impaired when the active site mutant, PAPE176V, is expressed in yeast, indicating that mRNA destabilization is due to theN-glycosidase activity of PAP. RNase protection analysis beyond 10 h post-induction indicated that PAP mRNA is not detectable after 12 h, whereas PAPE176V mRNA remains at steady state levels (data not shown). RNase protection analysis of yeast expressing PAPL71Rindicated that as observed with wild type PAP, mRNA levels increased up to 4 h post-induction. However, PAPL71RmRNA remained at elevated steady state levels and was not destabilized after 4 h of induction (Fig. 4). These results indicated that PAPL71R behaves similarly to wild type PAP during the early stages of induction. Although both growth and translation were inhibited in cells expressing PAPL71R, mRNA was not destabilized, indicating that the L71R mutation did not affect the ability of PAP to i"

Significant controversy exists over how to model this absorption accurately.

Our measurements and accompanying calculations suggest that the best currently available potential and dipole surfaces do not accurately model intensities in the optical spectrum of water."
https://openalex.org/W2112056921,"Abstract SAM (sterile alphamotif) domains are protein-protein interaction modules found in a large number of regulatory proteins. Byr2 and Ste4 are two SAM domain-containing proteins in the mating pheromone response pathway of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Byr2 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that is regulated by Ste4. Tu et al. (Tu, H., Barr, M., Dong, D. L., and Wigler, M. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. 17, 5876–5887) showed that the isolated SAM domain of Byr2 binds a fragment of Ste4 that contains both a leucine zipper (Ste4-LZ) domain as well as a SAM domain, suggesting that Byr2-SAM and Ste4-SAM may form a hetero-oligomer. Here, we show that the individual SAM domains of Ste4 and Byr2 are monomeric at low concentrations and bind to each other in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a relatively weak dissociation constant of 56 ± 3 μm. Inclusion of the Ste4-LZ domain, which determines the oligomeric state of Ste4, has a dramatic effect on binding affinity, however. We find that the Ste4-LZ domain is trimeric and, when included with the Ste4-SAM domain, yields a 3:1 Ste4-LZ-SAM:Byr2-SAM complex with a tight dissociation constant of 19 ± 4 nm. These results suggest that the Ste4-LZ-SAM protein may recognize multiple binding sites on Byr2-SAM, indicating a new mode of oligomeric organization for SAM domains. The fact that high affinity binding occurs only with the addition of an oligomerization domain suggests that it may be necessary to include ancillary oligomerization modules when searching for binding partners of SAM domains."

Giardia APRTase is a symmetric homodimer with the monomers built around Rossman fold cores, an element common to all known purine phosphoribosyltransferases.

Erwin M.J. Buchanan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 228: 201-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary functions of APRTase, present in bacteria, yeast, plants, and mammals, are adenine salvage and adenine recycling (2Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 3Myers R.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10547-10551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Parasites. Academic Press Ltd., London1995: 89-117Crossref Google Scholar). In humans, APRTase has the sole metabolic function of recycling adenine formed in the polyamine pathway. A deficiency of APRTase results in the inappropriate oxidation of adenine to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine, an insoluble metabolite that causes urolithiasis and is capable of causing kidney failure after several decades of accumulation (5Sahita A.S. Tischfield J.A. Kamatani N. Simmonds H.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York2001: 2571-2583Google Scholar). The symptoms are variable and are reversible upon removal of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine. The relatively mild effects of APRTase deficiency in humans make APRTase a possible target for the treatment of parasite infections by disrupting the pathways of adenine salvage and polyamine biosynthesis. Giardia lamblia is a human and animal parasite that causes the most common protozoan infection in North America (6National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Giardiasis Fact Sheet. U. S. Department of Health of Human Services, Washington, D. C.1998Google Scholar, 7Despommier D.D. Gwadz R.W. Hotez P.J. Parasitic Diseases. 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag, New York1994: 144-149Google Scholar). Protozoan parasites, including G. lamblia, are deficient in de novo purine synthesis and require purine uptake from the host, as well as efficient purine salvage. The stringent purine economy makes APRTase especially important in these organisms. Giardiaexpresses two distinct purine ribosyltransferases (PRTases), APRTase and GPRTase, for purine base salvage rather than the broad-specificity HGXPRTase found in the Plasmodia (8Wang C.C. Aldritt S. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 138: 1703-1712Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GPRTase fromGiardia prefers guanine as the purine substrate; its catalytic mechanism has been well studied by enzyme kinetics, mutagenesis, and x-ray crystallography (9Sommer J.M., Ma, H. Wang C.C.

The deduced sequences of APRTases from genome sequences were summarized recently, but only two crystallographic studies have been reported, neither of which exhibit closed catalytic loops (12Shi W.

The first APRTase crystal structures were the enzyme fromLeishmania donovani in complex with adenine, AMP, and citrate-sulfate ions (13Phillips C.L. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). APRTase possesses a Rossman fold core resembling other purine PRTases (15Sinha S.C. Smith J.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It also contains a long catalytic loop that is proposed to close on the active site during catalysis. The catalytic site loop was found in the open conformation and has been well defined as a consequence of crystal packing forces in the L. donovani APRTase structure. The L. donovani enzyme is classified as a long-APRTase that has N- and C-terminal extensions of over 50 amino acids relative to the amino acid sequences of the short-APRTases, which include the human, yeast, Escherichia coli, and Giardia enzymes. The structure of the first short-APRTase structure was recently reported using the enzyme expressed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10800-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Giardia APRTase is also a short-APRTase and shares a 35% amino acid sequence identity with the enzyme from yeast. The goal of the present work was to establish the crystal structures of an APRTase with a closed catalytic site loop. In other PRTases, this loop makes contact with substrates in the catalytic sites and is required for catalysis. Resolution of the loop contacts in the APRTases is required to understand the molecular basis for adenine specificity, the atomic excursions during catalysis, as well as to assist in inhibitor design. Giardia APRTase crystallized in the presence of 9-deazaadenine (9dA) or 9dA/PRPP yielded APRTase·9dA·SO4 and APRTase·9dA·MgPRPP complexes. Both complexes demonstrated ordered catalytic loops closed over the active site. One Mg2+ ion is bound to the pyrophosphate group of PRPP in contrast to the two Mg2+ ions observed in other purine PRTases including human, Trypanosoma cruziand Toxoplasma gondii HGPRTases and Plasmodium falciparum HGXPRTase (16Shi W., Li, C.M.

For crystallization of the GiardiaAPRTase·9dA·SO4 complex, protein in 50 mmHepes, pH 6.0, 8 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmDTT was mixed with 1:2 molar ratio of 9dA and iminoribitol, and 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min before preparing crystallization drops. The crystals were obtained by mixing 2 μl of 10 mg/ml protein with an equal volume of mother liquid containing 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 24% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.05 m urea followed by equilibration against 1.0 ml of the mother liquid at 18 °C. For crystallization of the APRTase·9dA·MgPRPP complex, protein was mixed with a 1:2 molar ratio of 9dA and 10 mm PRPP prior to the crystallization. The precipitant for the APRTase·9dA·MgPRPP crystals was similar to that for the APRTase·9dA·SO4 crystals except that ammonium acetate replaced ammonium sulfate. Single rod-shaped crystals with hexagonal faces appeared overnight and grew to a maximum size of 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.3 mm3. These crystals exhibited diffraction consistent with the space group P3121 witha = 54.3 Å, b = 54.3 Å, andc = 108.8 Å. The crystals contain a monomer in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to V m = 2.2 Å3/Da and a solvent content of 44%. APRTase crystals were soaked in crystallization buffer containing 20% glycerol for 2 min and rapidly frozen in cold nitrogen stream at −178 °C. X-ray diffraction data were collected from single crystals of APRTase using a Quantum CCD detector at beam line X9B (λ = 0.98 Å, NSLS, Brookhaven National Light Source).

A single solution with a correlation coefficient of 29.3% was generated using 8.0–4.0 Å data.

Peptide segment Glu61–Ser62 adopts a trans peptide bond conformation in the APRTase·9dA·SO4 complex but is in the cis conformation in the APRTase·9dA·MgPRPP complex. In both structures, these amino acids fit well in their corresponding electron densities in the 2F o −F c maps. The overall fold of Giardia APRTase is closely related to those of the yeast and Leishmania donovani APRTase structures (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L.

The GiardiaAPRTase monomer is a compact single-domain structure composed of six α-helices and nine β-strands (Fig.2 a), which can be divided further into the hood (residues 1–34; α1, β1, β2, and α2 segments), and the core, consisting of the remaining α-helices and β-strands (residues 35–180). As in all type I PRTases, the core subdomain is a Rossman fold structure consisting of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (β4, residues 77–84; β3, 55–61; β7, 119–127; β8, 149–158; and β9, 173–180) and four α-helices (α3, residues 35–49; α4, 62–75; α5, 131–143; and α6, 163–169). The hood subdomain of Giardia APRTase is composed of two β-strands and two α-helices (β1, residues 12–16; β2, 23–27; α1, 5–11; and α2, 29–33) and is similar to the hoods found in the yeast (short) and L. donovani (long) APRTases. In all of these APRTases, the hoods are significantly smaller than those described in other type I PRTases. The segment consisting of residues 91–109, including β5-(91–98) and β6-(105–109), forms the flexible catalytic loop that serves to sequester the active site from the solvent. The catalytic mechanisms in related PRTases are thought to involve a transition state that resembles a highly reactive ribooxacarbenium ion that must be protected from solvent to prevent hydrolytic reactions (11Shi W.

The enzyme crystallized in the trigonal space group P3121 with a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Application of the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry operator generates a dimer that buries a total surface area of 1400 Å2 from each monomer (2800 Å2total). The dimer interface for Giardia APRTases includes α2−α3 and α4 of the first monomer with β4 and α4 of the second monomer (Fig. 2 b). These interactions consist of 4 salt bridges, 20 neutral hydrogen bonds, and 190 van der Waals interactions (Table II). Of the 12 residues involved in hydrogen bonds at the dimer interface, only Asp27 and Arg83 are completely conserved throughout the known short-APRTases (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R.

In contrast, the long-form L. donovani APRTase has an extra 30 amino acid residues at the C terminus that are wrapped around the neighboring monomer to contribute an additional 1250 Å2 buried surface area from each monomer (5300 Å2 total) (13Phillips C.L.

Open table in a new tab The adenine binding site is defined by the position of 9dA, which is bound in a cleft formed by the hood and by the loop connecting β8 and α6 in the large β-sheet central to the core (Fig. 4 a). The 9dA ring is stacked between the hydrophobic side chains of Phe25from the hood and Val126 from the core. The backbone carbonyl of Ala24 and the ε-amino of Lys26from the hood form hydrogen bonds to the exocyclic N-6 amine and to N-1 of 9dA. A carboxyl oxygen of Glu100 from the catalytic loop forms a 2.7 Å hydrogen bond with N-7 of 9dA, a major contact between the substrate and the catalytic loop in its closed conformation. The reactions catalyzed by PRTases have been proposed to involve oxacarbenium transition states in which the purine leaving group is activated by protonation or strong hydrogen bond formation to N-7 (19Shi W., Li, C.M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In human HGPRTase, Glu137 is proposed to play the same role as Glu100 in Giardia APRTase (16Shi W., Li, C.M. Tyler P.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4114-4124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the amino acid sequence alignment between APRTases and HGPRTases reveals insufficient homology to predict this role for Glu100 in APRTase (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39973-39980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the sequence alignment of APRTase, this Glu is conserved in all enzymes with demonstrated APRTase activity (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10800-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Sarver A.E. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39973-39980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this conserved Glu to Leu in yeast APRTase reduced k cat/K m by a factor of 106 and mutation from Glu to Gln decreasedk cat/K m by 103, as a Gln residue at this position retains the ability for hydrogen bond formation but is not competent to act as an acid/base (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10800-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The initial crystallization of Giardia APRTase occurred in the presence of 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4, resulting in a total of three sulfate ions in the APRTase·9dA·SO4 structure. One sulfate ion is bound at the site typically occupied by the 5′-phosphate of AMP or PRPP molecules (Fig. 4, a andb). This sulfate ion binds to the turn formed by residues128ATGGT132, which is defined as the 5′-phosphate binding loop. The peptide backbone amide groups of these residues orient toward the sulfate and contribute four direct hydrogen bonds. The hydroxyl groups of Thr129 and Thr132provide two additional hydrogen bonds to this sulfate ion. Amino acids corresponding to Ala128–Thr132 in the 5′-phosphate binding loop are highly conserved in all APRTases, which is consistent with the requirement of a 5′-phosphate for substrate activity. The APRTase·9dA·SO4 complex has Arg63 located near the sulfate ion site. However, when the catalytic site is full, Arg63 swings across the active site to bind pyrophosphate (Fig. 4, a and b; Fig.5). A second sulfate ion is bound near the active site but does not occupy any site involved in substrate or product binding. It participates in hydrogen bonds with backbone and side-chain atoms of Glu61–Ser62. Residues Glu61, Ser62, and Arg63 are highly conserved throughout all APRTases and are essential elements of the pyrophosphate binding site. In the APRTase·9dA·SO4 complex, the peptide segment connecting Glu61 and Ser62 is in trans conformation in contrast to a cisconformation found in the APRTase·9dA·MgPRPP complex (Fig. 5). The equivalent peptide bond in related HGPRTases has been proposed to shift from trans to cis conformation to bind the β-phosphoryl moiety in phosphoribosyltransferase reactions; however, both trans and cis conformations have been observed in high resolution crystal structures of type I PRTases when the pyrophosphate binding site is empty (11Shi W. Munagala N.R. Wang C.C., Li, C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Grubmeyer C. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E.

Structure. 2000; 8: 1309-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The sulfate ion in the Giardia APRTase·9dA·SO4 complex is bound in a location opposite to the β-phosphoryl binding site, stabilizing the Glu61–Ser62 peptide segment in a trans conformation and preventing formation of the pyrophosphate binding site. The third sulfate ion is bound near the C terminus and forms hydrogen bonds with two of the histidine residues in the His-tag. This sulfate ion is a result of the His tag expression system and is not relevant to catalysis; however, it may have facilitated the crystallization of the enzyme. Replacing (NH4)2SO4 in the crystallization buffer with NH4Ac allowed Mg2+ and PRPP to fill the active site in the APRTase·9dA·MgPRPP complex (Fig.3 b). The overall structures of APRTase in the two complexes are very similar, with root-mean-square deviations of 0.35 Å for all Cα atoms. Binding of 9dA is in a similar hydrophobic and hydrogen bond network as observed in the APRTase·9dA·SO4 complex (Fig. 4, a and b). Beneath the 9dA, PRPP binds in the active site with C-1 of the ribose ring 3.4 Å away from C-9 of 9dA. The monophosphate group of PRPP is bound in the highly conserved 5-phosphate binding loop. The O-2 and O-3 hydroxyl oxygens of ribose are anchored by hydrogen bonds (2.6 and 2.7 Å) to carboxyl groups of Glu124 and Asp125, the two highly conserved acidic residues found at the catalytic sites of all known purine PRTases. The Mg2+ ion is octahedral-coordinated, making contact with O-2 and O-3 (both at 2.5 Å), O-2A and O-3B (2.3 and 2.2 Å, respectively) of PRPP, and two water molecules (both at 2.1 Å; Fig. 6). The Mg2+ ion orients the ribose ring and neutralizes part of the negative charge from the pyrophosphate moiety. Both APRTase and OPRTase utilize a single Mg2+ ion at the catalytic site, whereas other purine PRTases sandwich the pyrophosphate group between two Mg2+ions (Fig. 4, b and d). OPRTase and APRTase solve the problem of pyrophosphate charge stabilization by replacing the second Mg2+ ion with Arg or Lys groups. Residues Glu61, Ser62, and Arg63provide the major amino acid contacts in the pyrophosphate binding site. Peptide Glu61–Ser62 exhibits the unusualcis conformation that orients the amide nitrogen atoms of Ser62 and Arg63 to participate in hydrogen bonds with the β-phosphoryl of PRPP (2.9 and 3.0 Å, respectively). The side chain of Arg63 is also involved in hydrogen bonds with the β-phosphoryl and the N-3 of 9dA (3.0 and 2.8 Å, respectively). Arg63 is completely conserved throughout all APRTases, and mutation of this Arg residue to Ala in yeast APRTase resulted in a 105-fold decrease ink cat/K m (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10800-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Tyr101 from the catalytic loop hydrogen bonds to the α-phosphoryl group of PRPP and is also completely conserved throughout APRTases. Mutation of the corresponding Tyr to Phe in the yeast enzyme reduced thek cat/K m by 10-fold (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10800-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bond network at the catalytic site of the GiardiaAPRTase·9dA·MgPRPP complex indicates at least one hydrogen bond or metal-chelate interaction at every donor/acceptor site found on the ligands, except for O-3A (Fig.7). Giardia APRTase shares 33–35% sequence identity with the APRTases from S. cerevisiae and L. donovani. The overall structures are similar, with root-mean-square deviations of 1.3 and 1.7 Å, respectively, over the conserved 163 Cα atoms with the catalytic loop excluded from the comparison. The present structure of Giardia APRTase departs from both the yeast and L. donovani structures reported previously by the closed catalytic site loop and from the L. donovani structure by the absence of the C-terminal extension (12Shi W. Tanaka K.S.E. Crother T.R. Taylor M.W. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10800-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,13Phillips C.L. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite the missing residues at the C terminus, GiardiaAPRTase still forms an extensive dimer interface. The structure of L. donovani APRTase was solved with AMP and citrate ion (a component in the crystallization buffer) in the active site (Fig. 4 c). The location of the adenine group of AMP is similar to that of 9dA observed in Giardia APRTase, which stacks Phe27 and Val126 corresponding to Phe42 and Val148 in the L. donovaniAPRTase. Hydrogen bond patterns for the purine rings in the two complexes are also similar except for N-7, which is hydrogen bonded to the protein only in the closed-loop Giardiaenzyme. The 5′-phosphate binding pocket is highly conserved for all type I PRTases, and the complexes of GiardiaARTase·9dA·MgPRPP and L. donovani APRTase·AMP·cit provide no exception, except for the hydrogen bond from the amide Glu100 (Glu107 in L. donovani), which does not form in the L. donovani complex because of the open catalytic loop. The ribose groups of AMP and PRPP in the APRTase complexes show substantial differences in sugar pucker near C-1. The C-1 ribosyl atoms are positioned ∼2.1 Å apart in the superimposed structures, consistent with the enzymatic mechanism of nucleophilic substitution by electrophile migration that has been recognized for several sugar transferases (27Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 28Schramm V.L. Shi W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Laine R. Withers S.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The PRTase reactions are nucleophilic substitutions in which both attacking and leaving group nucleophiles are held tightly in their respective binding pockets, and the C-1′ carbon of AMP translocates between the relatively immobile nucleophiles during catalysis (27Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 28Schramm V.L. Shi W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This distance is also 2.1 Å in the HGPRTases, and the 2.1 Å distance observed between the C-1 atom of PRPP and C-1′ of AMP provides supporting evidence thatGiardia APRTase uses this same catalytic strategy (see below). The electron density assigned as a Mg2+ ion and reported in the L. donovani APRTase·AMP·cit complex is ∼1.5 Å distant from that observed here for GiardiaAPRTase·9dA·MgPRPP. However, this atomic assignment is questionable for the L. donovani complex because the proposed Mg2+ ion has only three ligands in the coordination sphere, and these are all at 2.7–2.9 Å (13Phillips C.L. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3533-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Magnesium ions in crystallographic complexes typically demonstrate six coordinated ligands at distances from 2.0–2.5 Å (30Katz A.K. Glusker J.P. Beebe S.A. Boch C.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5752-5763Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar), suggesting that the electron density assigned as a Mg2+ ion in the L. donovani complex may represent a solvent molecule. Despite the molecular differences between citrate and pyrophosphate ions, the amino acids that form the pyrophosphate binding sites are in similar positions in the Giardia and L. donovanicomplexes with bound PPi and citrate, respectively. The closed-loop structure at the active site of GiardiaAPRTase·9dA·MgPRPP demonstrates closer contacts between the protein and catalytic site contents than those observed in the L. donovani APRTase·AMP·cit complex (Fig.8). This loop motion moves the tip of the loop (Glu100) by >10 Å to exclude solvent access to the otherwise exposed adenine in its binding site and also to cover a portion of the PRPP site. Motion of this loop is required for entry and release of components to the catalytic site. It is proposed that catalysis occurs only in the closed-loop complex because of the contacts to substrate. N-7 deprotonation/protonation of the adenine is an important feature of APRTase catalysis and the 2.7 Å carbonyl group of Glu100 interaction to N-7 of the 9dA is seen only in the closed-loop complex. This interaction provides the general acid/base catalyst, and in the other purine PRTases, forms a novel downfield hydrogen bond in complexes with transition state analogue inhibitors (19Shi W., Li, C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Cahill S.M. Girvin M.E. Grubmeyer C. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9872-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Li C.M. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Kicska G., Xu, Y. Grubmeyer C. Girvin M.E. Schramm V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As discussed above, the E100L mutation in the yeast APRTase reduced catalytic efficiency to 10−6 of the parental enzyme. Despite the closely related chemistry found in other purine PRTases, APRTase shows no near relatives in sequence homology except for the phosphate binding loop regions. The closest homologue to APRTase is OPRTase, found in the type I PRTase family. Giardia APRTase shares 17% sequence identity with Salmonella OPRTase, and the core structures of these enzymes are similar, with a root-mean-square deviation of 3.1 Å between Giardia APRTase and Salmonella OPRTase for 148 Cα atoms (32Panneerselvam K. Shi W. Grubmeyer C. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). As might be expected for the difference between purine and pyrimidine substrate specificities, the catalytic hoods that determine substrate specificity differ in APRTase and OPRTase. The hood in OPRTase includes two α-helices from the C terminus (residues 1–36, 184–213: α1, 2–15; β1, 17–25; β2, 29–36; α6, 184–192; α7, 197–212) and is twice as large as that observed in APRTase (residues 1–34: α1, 5–11; β1, 12–16; β2, 23–27; α2, 29–33). The dimer interfaces of APRTase and OPRTase are also similar but differ from those of other members in the type I PRTases. However, the catalytic site loops of APRTase and OPRTase differ in that the catalytic loop in Salmonella OPRTase closes onto the active site of the adjacent monomer, whereas the catalytic loop in APRTase closes onto a self-contained active site (32Panneerselvam K. Shi W. Grubmeyer C. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). GiardiaAPRTase crystallized to give a monomer in the asymmetric unit, thus the two active sites in the dimeric structure are related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis and are identical to each other. The recently reported Salmonella OPRTase·orotate·MgPRPP complex showed asymmetric properties between monomers in its homodimer (32Panneerselvam K. Shi W. Grubmeyer C. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). One active site is fully occupied and is closed with the catalytic loop from the adjacent monomer. The other active site is open and disordered, suggesting a single-site binding sequential catalysis mechanism for OPRTase. The catalytic sites of APRTase are identical and equally filled. The structural similarity between OPRTase and APRTase suggests that these enzymes share a common evolutionary progenitor, which is distinct from other PRTases. The availability of APRTase structures with bound substrate and product analogues (compare Fig. 4, panels b and c), permits comparison of these molecules in relation to portions of the proteins that are constant through the reaction. This approach has been used previously for the N-ribosyltransferases: purine nucleoside phosphorylase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (27Fedorov A. Shi W. Kicska G. Fedorov E. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Hanson J.C. Gainsford G.J. Larese J.Z. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar,28Schramm V.L. Shi W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When the AMP from the catalytic site of L. donovani is overlaid with 9dA and PRPP in Giardia, it is apparent that the major atomic motion involves translation of the C-1 portion of the ribosyl ring, whereas the purine base, 5-monophosphate, and the pyrophosphate remain relatively fixed (Fig.9). The 2.1-Å excursion of C-1 of the ribosyl groups is within the range of 1.5 to 2.1 Å observed in the other N-ribosyltransferases (28Schramm V.L. Shi W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the APRTases represent another example in which nucleophilic displacements occur with inversion of configuration by migration of the electrophile between two fixed nucleophiles. The structures of GiardiaAPRTase·9dA·SO4 and APRTase·9dA·MgPRPP are the first APRTase complexes with a closed flexible catalytic site loop. Glu100 at the tip of the catalytic loop has been identified as an acid/base for catalysis. Similar to OPRTase, APRTase utilizes only one Mg2+ ion in the active site with Arg63replacing the second Mg2+ found in HGPRTases. A comparison of APRTases with substrate and product analogue complexes in the catalytic sites supports a reaction mechanism of ribosyl group migration between relatively fixed adenine and Mg2+-pyrophosphate groups. This mechanism has been recognized in other N-ribosyltransferases."

Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). In nucleated cells, however, protein 4.1 is not exclusively associated with the plasma membrane-associated cytoskeleton. Protein 4.1 epitopes are detected at several important subcellular locations crucial to cell division (4Marchesi V.T. Huang S. Tang T.K. Benz Jr., E.J.

The complex localization patterns of 4.1 in nucleated cells may reflect that although red cells contain predominantly one 80-kDa isoform, nucleated cells generally express multiple 4.1 isoforms generated via alternative splicing, posttranslational modifications, and expression of multiple related genes (10Conboy J.G.

Analysis of 4.1R has revealed several functional domains important for its interactions in red cells, but the potential roles of these domains in nucleated cells have not been completely determined. A 4.1 domain that specifically interacts to form ternary complexes with spectrin and actin was mapped to exons 16,17 (spectrin-actin-binding domain, SABD) 1The abbreviations used are: SABD, spectrin-actin-binding domain; CTD, C-terminal domain; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (15Cohen C.

The 4.1 30-kDa/FERM (4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin) domain (beginning within exon 4 and ending within exon 12; see Fig.1 A) was shown to interact with membrane proteins such as glycophorin C, anion exchanger Band 3, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK/p55), a cell surface receptor promoting tumor growth (CD44), ICAM-2, a chloride channel regulator (pICln), and calmodulin (1Conboy J.G.

In nucleated cells, both the FERM domain and the SABD interact with importin α for nuclear import of protein 4.1 (26Gascard P. Nunomura W. Lee G. Walensky L. Krauss S. Chasis J. Mohandas N. Conboy J.

Additionally, exons 20,21 in the 4.1 C-terminal domain (CTD; see Fig.1 A) recently were shown to interact with the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA (27Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C.

Thus in nucleated cells these 4.1 functional domains may serve as important linkers to actin structures, membrane-associated proteins, or microtubule-based structures. Here we report that 4.1 is essential for proper assembly of nuclei, involving interactions of two distinct 4.1 domains. We have used Xenopus egg extracts, a very powerful in vitro experimental system that mimics in vivo events such as assembly of nuclei and spindles, semiconservative DNA replication, and cell cycle regulation (30Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 941-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J.

Maller J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). When incubated with interphasic Xenopus egg extract, demembranated sperm DNA decondenses and recruits chromosomal and scaffold proteins to form mature nuclei containing a double membrane with pores, nuclear lamina, and a perinuclear centrosome derived from the sperm basal body. The reconstituted nuclei replicate DNA and import proteins bearing appropriate nuclear localization signals. Using this system we established that 4.1 is essential for nuclear assembly. Depletion of 4.1 from extracts prevents nuclear assembly, which is restored by addition of recombinant 4.1R. We identified two 4.1R domains critical to nuclear assembly in assays utilizing dominant negative peptides corresponding to protein 4.1 domains. This strategy has several advantages because peptides can be added in controlled concentrations to reactions, may mediate effects by competitive binding to 4.1 substrates, and may circumvent issues of steric hindrance in antibody inhibition experiments by antibodies bound to endogenous 4.1 proteins. One 4.1 domain, the SABD, appears to require interaction with actin to have a critical role in nuclear assembly. The other domain critical for nuclear assembly, the CTD, was shown previously to interact with NuMA (27Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that protein 4.1 is essential for proper assembly of nuclei and identify two distinct 4.1 domains, initially characterized in cytoskeletal interactions, with crucial and versatile functions in nuclear assembly. Expression vectors for His6 fusion peptides were either pMW172 (the gift of Dr. M. Way, EMBL, Heidelberg) or pET 28 (Novagen). The NuMA Tail I construct and antibody L046F7 against Xenopus lamin were very generous gifts of Dr. A. Merdes (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK). IgGs against 4.1R SABD and 4.1R CTD have been described (7Krauss S.W. Chasis J.A. Larabell C.A. Lockett S. Gascard P. Blaschke R. Mohandas N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The antibodies from commercial sources were α-Sm (Y12; Neomarkers), monoclonal antibody 414 against nuclear pore complex protein (Babco), α-BrdUrd (BD Biosciences), α-His6epitope tag (CLONTECH), and fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). BrdUrd was from Sigma, and protein A Affiprep was from Bio-Rad. 10,000 × g cytoplasmic Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described (36Murray A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and made interphasic with 400 μm Ca2+. For nuclear assembly, demembranatedXenopus sperm were added to 20 μl of egg extract on ice with 0.2 mg/ml Texas Red-labeled bovine brain tubulin (37Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Mitchison T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) as indicated, and the mixtures were incubated at 20 °C for 40–60 min. Assays with His6 peptides (1–8 μg) were preincubated on ice 10 min and then incubated at 20 °C. The reactions diluted with BRB80 (80 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) containing 15% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100 were spun through 25% glycerol-BRB80 cushions onto coverslips. For Western blots, extract first was cleared of nonspecific aggregates by centrifugation at 1500 × g prior to incubation with sperm. After nuclear assembly, the reactions were diluted, and the nuclei were pelleted through cushions by centrifugation at 1500 ×g in Eppendorf tubes. The nuclear pellets were rinsed with BRB80 and dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Aliquots of resuspended pellets fixed on coverslips produced only intranuclear immunofluorescence when probed with 4.1 antibodies. Although a range of 1–8 μg was tested for each peptide, the data presented are from experiments using 8 μg of the indicated peptide. In vitro assembled nuclei on coverslips were fixed in −20 °C methanol and probed by immunofluorescence as described (38Heald R. Tournebize R. Habermann A. Karsenti E. Hyman A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The concentrations of primary antibodies were: SABD IgG, 5 μg/ml; CTD IgG, 10 μg/ml; monoclonal antibody 414, 1:2500 dilution; L046F7, 1/10 dilution; and Y12, 1 μg/ml. Secondary fluorescent antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution. The samples probed without primary antibody or with equal amounts of control nonimmune IgG or sera showed no fluorescent patterns. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a CCD camera and processed using Adobe Photoshop. Protein 4.1-related peptides were expressed as His6 fusion proteins in BL21/DE3, pLysS grown at 30 °C and induced for 3 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. His6-tagged peptides were purified by nickel-agarose chromatography (Qiagen), then dialyzed into XB buffer (0.1m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1m CaCl2, 50 mm sucrose, and 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.7), and analyzed by Western blot for both protein 4.1 and His6 tag epitopes. Interactions between NuMA Tail I peptide and 4.1R CTD and CTDmut3V were measured using the IAsysTm system (Affinity Sensors) and FASTfitTM software as detailed (22Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6360-6367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,39Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24540-24546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Purified peptides were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline prior to binding reactions at 25 °C. The nuclei were assembled in interphasic Xenopus egg extract made 20 μm in BrdUrd and fixed in cold methanol. DNA was denatured in 2 n HCl/0.5% Triton X-100 and then neutralized with 0.1 m borate, pH 8.5, and the coverslips were probed with 10 μg/ml αBrdUrd for indirect immunofluorescence. For depletion of 4.1 fromXenopus extracts, protein G-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal) from 100 μl of slurry were mixed with 15 μg of 4.1R SABD or CTD IgGs or nonimmune rabbit IgG for 1 h at 4 °C; the beads washed twice with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (57.7% Na2HPO4 and 42.3% NaH2PO4, v/v) and three times with XB buffer and then divided into three aliquots. The extract (100 μl) was successively depleted three times by rotation with IgG-coupled beads at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were collected magnetically, and the extract was used for nuclear assembly and Western blotting. Extract depletion was determined by densitometry of Western blots using an Alpha Imager 2200 and software. In rescue experiments, 1–9 μg of purified bacterially expressed 80-kDa 4.1R was added to 20-μl reactions and incubated on ice for 10 min prior to initiation of nuclear assembly. The reactions in three independent experiments were sampled during 30–90 min of incubation. To dissect protein 4.1 function in nuclear assembly, we performed experiments usingXenopus egg extracts. Our previous work in cultured mammalian cells established that nuclear protein 4.1R epitopes are distributed throughout non-nucleolar nuclear domains (7Krauss S.W. Chasis J.A. Larabell C.A. Lockett S. Gascard P. Blaschke R. Mohandas N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Comparisons of regions of Xenopus 4.1 sequence with those of mammalian family members revealed strong conservation in the SABD as well as the CTD (Fig. 1 B). In studies exploring the evolutionary conservation of 4.1 function, a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding theXenopus SABD specifically bound to and mechanically stabilized 4.1-deficient human erythrocyte membranes (40Winardi R. Discher D. Kelley C. Zon L. Mays K. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Blood. 1995; 86: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing a precedent of functional domain interchange between Xenopus4.1 SABD and mammalian 4.1R. Initially we verified that nuclei of cultured Xenopusfibroblasts as well as Xenopus nuclei assembled in vitro contained 4.1 epitopes. In vitro assembled nuclei stained with αCTD produced a diffuse intranuclear immunofluorescent pattern, whereas αSABD staining revealed a diffuse pattern as well as larger intranuclear circular or toroidal structures (Fig.2 A). Sperm basal bodies, precursors to mitotic spindle poles, also displayed 4.1 epitopes inXenopus (Fig. 2 A) as well as in murine and porcine samples (41Krauss S. Heald R. Lee G. Berger T. Chasis J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9 (abstr.): 294Google Scholar). To further explore the nature of the nuclear toroidal structures detected with αSABD, reconstituted nuclei were probed with a variety of antibodies against splicing factors because 4.1 epitopes previously were observed to colocalize with splicing factors (7Krauss S.W. Chasis J.A. Larabell C.A. Lockett S. Gascard P. Blaschke R. Mohandas N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 42Lallena M.J. Martinez C. Valcarcel J. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lallena M.J. Correas I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar). Double label experiments revealed a strong coincidence of immunofluorescent signals for Sm antigens (monoclonal Y12) with SABD epitopes in intranuclear toroids along with additional coincidence in some of the smaller more diffuse intranuclear foci (Fig.2 B). In confocal sections, larger toroidal structures inXenopus nuclei appeared to be composed of multiple smaller domains (Fig. 2 A), consistent with mammalian cells (44Mintz P.J. Spector D.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus Xenopus extracts appear to be a valuable and appropriate experimental system for deciphering 4.1 functions. To dissect 4.1 function in nuclei, we added bacterially expressed peptides encoding 4.1 domains to nuclear assembly reactions and then observed and quantified the morphological characteristics of the resulting structures. For these experiments, His6-tagged peptides were constructed based on their relationship to either exons 16,17 (amino acids 644–705) in the 4.1R SABD or exons 20,21 (amino acids 800–858) of the 4.1R CTD (Fig.3), because these domains already have important defined functions and are highly conserved between frog and mammals (Fig. 1 B). For purposes of simplicity, these domains will be referred to as SABD or CTD peptides. As controls for the 4.1R SABD peptide, we used a variant 4.1N SABD peptide with low amino acid sequence homology to the 4.1R peptide (Fig. 3). As a second control, we expressed a 4.1R SABDΔNF peptide with a deletion of two amino acids within its actin-binding domain. This mutant SABD cannot bind actin but retains spectrin binding (45Gimm J.A., An X.L. Nunomura W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7275-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Importantly, both of these control peptides are incapable of forming ternary complexes with spectrin and actin (45Gimm J.A., An X.L. Nunomura W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7275-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As control for the 4.1R CTD peptide, a peptide was engineered containing the 4.1R CTD sequence, except that three valines were mutated to alanines (Fig. 3) based on a preliminary report that these residues are part of the 4.1R NuMA-binding site (46Mattagajasingh S. Huang S. Benz Jr., E. Blood. 1997; 90 (abstr.): 408Google Scholar). In experiments measuring the relative affinities of 4.1R to NuMA Tail I peptides (47Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) containing the 4.1 binding site (9Mattagajasingh S. Huang S. Hartenstein J. Benz Jr., E.J. Blood. 1998; 92 (abstr.): 5Google Scholar), we determined that the binding affinity of the mutated 4.1R CTD peptide is decreased about 60-fold compared with the unmutated peptide sequence (TableI). Interestingly, the dissociation constants of the CTD peptide and the 80-kDa red cell 4.1 for Tail I are similar, implying that other 4.1 domains do not significantly contribute to NuMA Tail I binding. 2S.

Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of 4.1R 20,21 and 4.1R 20,21 mut3V are presented in Fig. 3. NuMA Tail I (1.3 mm) was introduced into aminosilane curvettes with either immobilized 4.1R 20,21 or 4.1R 20,21 mut3V peptides. The binding data indicate that mutation of three alanines to valine residues in 4.1R 20,21 mut3V decreased its affinity for NuMA Tail I about 60-fold. The addition of SABD peptides produced nuclei that were smaller, multilobed, and surrounded by disarrayed microtubules relative to control nuclei (Fig. 4 A,top row). Both nuclear membrane pores and the underlying lamin network were disorganized in nuclear structures assembled in reactions containing the 4.1R SABD peptides (Fig. 4 A,middle and bottom rows). By contrast, a deletion mutant in the 4.1R SABD (ΔNF) did not affect nuclear assembly because the nuclei were normal in size, had continuous rims of pores and lamin, and displayed microtubule arrays similar to control nuclei (Fig.4 A). A variant SABD from 4.1N (neuronal) had only a very weak effect, suggesting that this domain in a 4.1N isoform does not have a similar function to that of 4.1R SABD in the nucleus. In fact, in extracts of murine fibroblast nuclei we did not detect 4.1N by Western blot analysis, consistent with our observations that 4.1N peptides had little effect on in vitro nuclear assembly inXenopus egg extracts. Quantitation shows that dominant negative effects of 4.1R SABD peptides on both proper nuclear assembly and efficiency of assembly are profound and quite sequence-specific (Fig. 4 B). Thus the 4.1 SABD, capable of forming ternary complexes with spectrin and actin, is critical for proper assembly of nuclei in vitro. A second 4.1 domain, the CTD, was also critical for assembly of normal nuclei. CTD peptides encoding exons 20,21 strongly perturbed formation of nuclei qualitatively and quantitatively (Fig. 4); microtubules, pores, and lamina were disorganized relative to control nuclei. However, the 4.1R CTD peptide with three mutated valines and decreased affinity for binding NuMA (Table I) produced nuclei with morphologies intermediate between control and aberrant nuclei assembled in the presence of either 4.1R SABD or 4.1R CTD peptides. Nuclei isolated from these reactions were ovoid, although smaller than controls, had relatively normal distributions of pores and lamin, but displayed miniature centrosomal asters. Given the strong dominant negative effect of unmutated 4.1R CTD peptides on nuclear assembly (Fig. 4), this observation implies that an interaction with NuMA might mediate peptide effects on nuclear reconstitution. In support of this possibility, we observed that NuMA Tail I peptides containing sequences capable of binding 4.1 CTD (Table I) perturbed nuclear assembly reactions (Fig.5 A), producing small irregularly shaped DNA structures. Furthermore, preincubation of 4.1R CTD and NuMA Tail I peptides prior to initiation of nuclear assembly rescued or restored normal nuclear reconstitution relative to the dominant negative effect produced in reactions containing either peptide species alone (Fig. 5 A). Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that 4.1-NuMA interactions may be critical for nuclear assembly. To further analyze the extent of nuclear assembly perturbation produced by SABD and CTD peptides, we assayed the capacity to replicate DNA. In extracts supplemented with 20 μm BrdUrd, nucleotide analogue incorporation into DNA by control nuclei was readily detected by immunofluorescence, whereas aberrant nuclei from reactions containing either 4.1R SABD or CTD peptides had no or very low amounts of detectable BrdUrd (Fig. 5 B). Thus in addition to gross morphological abnormalities observed in nuclear structures formed in the presence of either 4.1R SABD or 4.1R CTD peptides, these data demonstrate that the aberrant nuclei are metabolically incapacitated. To test whether dominant negative effects of SABD or CTD peptides were due to incorporation of SABD or CTD peptides into abnormal nuclear structures, we probed isolated assembly reaction products with CTD and SABD IgGs. We observed that aberrant nuclei had very reduced or no detectable immunofluorescent signals (Fig. 5 C). Thus it appears that relatively little exogenous peptide was incorporated and also that endogenous Xenopus 4.1 was displaced from abnormal nuclear structures. To confirm an essential role for 4.1 in nuclear assembly and the importance of the SABD and CTD domains, we depleted 4.1 from Xenopus egg extracts using 4.1 domain-specific IgGs bound to protein G magnetic beads. Although normal nuclei assembled in control extracts, a dramatic morphologic disruption of nuclear assembly was apparent in extracts depleted with either SABD or CTD IgGs (Fig. 6 A).

The analogs (3′-deoxy-3′-azidothymidine (AZT), 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T), and other dideoxynucleosides) are sequentially converted into triphosphate by cellular kinases of the nucleoside salvage pathway and are often poor substrates of these enzymes. Nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase phosphorylates the diphosphate derivatives of the analogs with an efficiency some 104 lower than for its natural substrates. Kinetic and structural studies of Dictyosteliumand human NDP kinases show that the sugar 3′-OH, absent from all antiviral analogs, is required for catalysis. To improve the catalytic efficiency of NDP kinase on the analogs, we engineered several mutants with a protein OH group replacing the sugar 3′-OH. The substitution of Asn-115 in Ser and Leu-55 in His results in an NDP kinase mutant with an enhanced ability to phosphorylate antiviral derivatives. Transfection of the mutant enzyme in Escherichia coliresults in an increased sensitivity to AZT. An x-ray structure at 2.15-Å resolution of the Dictyostelium enzyme bearing the serine substitution in complex with theR p-α-borano-triphosphate derivative of AZT shows that the enhanced activity reflects an improved geometry of binding and a favorable interaction of the 3′-azido group with the engineered serine.

Nucleotide analogs such as dideoxynucleosides, AZT,1and d4T are widely used in clinics for their antiviral effects, in particular in the treatment of AIDS. Because the sugar moiety of these nucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) lacks a 3′-OH group, their incorporation by viral DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase leads to DNA chain termination. To be substrates of DNA synthesis, an analog must first be converted to the 5′-triphosphate form, which is done intracellularly by kinases of the nucleoside salvage pathway. Whereas the first two phosphorylation steps are catalyzed by enzymes specific for the nucleobase, the γ-phosphate is added by nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase, which exhibits little specificity toward the nucleobase and the sugar moiety (1Parks R.E.J. Agarwal R.P. The Enzymes. 1973; 8: 307-334Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The γ-phosphate transfer from N1TP to N2DP catalyzed by NDP kinase involves a phosphohistidine intermediate, E+N1TP⇆E∼P+N1DP E∼P+N2DP⇆E+N2TPAll eukaryotic NDP kinases are homohexamers with a 17-kDa subunit (2Lacombe M.L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2000; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In humans, where eight isoforms have been reported, the major isoforms NDPK-A and NDPK-B, respectively encoded by the genesnm23-H1 and nm23-H2, display 88% sequence identity and have very similar kinetic parameters (3Gonin P., Xu, Y. Milon L. Dabernat S. Morr M. Kumar R. Lacombe M.-L. Janin J. Lascu I. Biochemistry. 1999; 22: 7265-7272Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). They closely resemble the NDP kinase from the lower eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd-NDPK), which for most purposes is as a reliable model of other eukaryotic NDP kinases (4Janin J. Dumas C. Moréra S., Xu, Y. Meyer P. Chiadmi M. Cherfils J. J. Bioener. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), easier to purify and crystallize than human NDP kinases. NDP kinases have a very high turnover rate on natural nucleotides, but their catalytic efficiency drops by a factor of 104 on the analogs AZT diphosphate or ddNDP (5Bourdais J. Biondi R. Lascu I. Sarfati S. Guerreiro C. Janin J. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7887-7890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is attributed to the substrate-assisted catalysis mechanism of NDP kinase, where the 3′-OH plays a major role. Using fluorescence stopped-flow experiments to study the two half-reactions (Reactions 1 and 2), we have previously shown that affinity is reduced 10-fold and phosphotransfer 500- to 1000-fold slower in the absence of the 3′-OH (6Schneider B., Xu, Y.W.

The poor activation of NRTI by NDP kinase, resulting in low amounts of the triphosphate form of NRTI within infected cells, is of clinical importance. It is a major cause of incomplete suppression of viral DNA synthesis, allowing the selection of resistance mutations (7Larder B. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors and Drug Resistance. CSHL Press, 1992: 205-222Google Scholar).To overcome this limitation, we designed new NRTIs with increased reactivity toward NDP kinase: the α-borano derivatives of AZT and d4T (8Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alternatively, we may consider modifying the kinase based on its known structure and reaction mechanism. In the present study, we attempt to substitute a hydroxyl group of the enzyme for the missing 3′-OH of the analogs. The 3′-OH of natural nucleotides is involved in a key hydrogen bonds network with the β-phosphate and two side chains of the active site. We hypothesized that the presence of a hydroxyl provided by the protein could compensate for the absence of the 3′-OH and enhance either the substrate binding or the rate of phosphotransfer for antiviral analogs activation.DISCUSSIONThe substitution of a serine at the Asn-119 (Dictyostelium) or Asn-115 (human) position improves the capacity of NDP kinase to use as substrates nucleotide analogs lacking a 3′-OH. The gain in catalytic efficiency is less than an order of magnitude in Dd-NDPK, but it reaches two orders of magnitude when the N115S and L55H mutations are combined in NDPK-A. It can be noted that directed mutagenesis aimed at a small number of sites leads here to an efficient improvement of the kinetic parameters of the target. The improvement factor is actually larger than was obtained by directed evolution methods when, for instance, the thymidine kinase of herpes virus was modified by random DNA shuffling (25Christians F.C. Scapozza L. Crameri A. Folkers G. Stemmer W.P.C. Nat. Bio/Technol. 1999; 17: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or by random sequence mutagenesis (26Black M.E. Newcomb T.G. Wilson H.-M.P. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 325-329Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar).To understand the mutation effects, we determined the x-ray structure of a Dictyostelium protein carrying the N119S mutation, in complex with a derivative of AZT. The structure indicates that the mutation has no effect on the protein conformation. However, the engineered serine OH does not replace the 3′-OH of a natural substrate in activating the oxygen bridging the β- and γ-phosphates, as we had supposed. The distance from the serine side chain to the phosphates is too large for a hydrogen bond. Instead, it makes favorable interactions with the azido group in the 3′ position, so that the analog can bind almost exactly like a natural substrate. In the previously studied N119A mutant, unfavorable interactions forced both the sugar ring and the Lys-16 side chain to move away from their optimal position. These observations are compatible with the observed better affinity of the N119S mutant for AZT derivatives and the resulting gain in catalytic efficiency. In the mutant bearing the N119S substitution, this side chain remains in the same position as when a natural substrate binds, and its ε-amino group interacts with the γ-phosphate of RP-AZTTP as it would with a natural donor nucleotide.In NDPK-A, the gain in catalytic efficiency is accompanied with an even larger change of specificity factor, particularly favorable in the case of AZT, d4T, and acyclovir derivatives. The biochemical data indicate that the N115S mutation improves the affinity for the antiviral drugs, whereas natural substrate binding is disfavored. The change probably arises from the constraints put on the analogs by the geometry of the active site. The detailed interpretation offered for AZT by the x-ray structures of the complexes with Dd-NDP kinase is certainly valid for the human enzyme but not necessarily for the other two types of analogs. Most theories of enzyme catalysis incorporate proximity effects: the activation free energy decreases as the substrate and the enzyme catalytic groups are held in the right orientation and position for the reaction (27Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25527-25528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The correlation between affinity and catalytic efficiency is excellent for NDP kinase. 2S. Gallois-Montbrun, B. Schneider, Y. Chen, V. Giacomoni- Fernandes, L. Mulard, S. Morera, J. Janin, D. Deville-Bonne, and M. Veron, unpublished results. Other major enhancements of the affinity of an enzyme for a transition state analog by a single hydroxyl group have been reported (for example see Ref.28Kati W.M. Wolfenden R. Science. 1989; 243: 1591-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Our results suggest that the N115S and L55H mutations might be of particular interest for improving the cellular activation of AZT or d4T. Gene transfer of such a potentiated mutant could improve the cytotoxicity of the analog on the transfected cells. An application could be cell therapy strategies in reparative medicine (29Keller R. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 83: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The clinical potential of cell therapies is widely accepted for neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and others. The use of embryonic or bone marrow stem cells as a therapy presents a problem of proof of safety, linked to proliferation and differentiation (30Parenteau N.L. Hardin-Young J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 951: 27-39Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The improved NDP kinase gene could render cells used in reparative medicine sensitive to AZT doses that are otherwise harmless for non-transfected cells. The mutant NDP kinase could then play the role of a suicide enzyme in case of uncontrolled proliferation (31Encell L.P. Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. Nat. Bio/Technol. 1999; 17: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3232 Gallois-Montbrun, S., Schneider, B., Giacomoni-Fernades, V., Deville-Bonne, D., and Veron, M. (April 29, 2002) U.S. (10/133,628) and Canada (2 382 470) patent,Google Scholar). The overexpression of the mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines was reported to enhance sensitivity of the cells to CdA, araG, and dFdG (33Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Promising results have already been obtained by transfection with herpes simplex thymidine kinase that increases the cells sensitivity to ganciclovir (34Guettari N. Loubiere L. Brisson E. Klatzmann D. Virology. 1997; 235: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the use of the herpes thymidine kinase is limited by the immunogenicity of the viral protein (35Brundiers R. Lavie A. Veit T. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Ostermann N. Goody R.S. Konrad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35289-35292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In case of human L55H-N115S NDP kinase, it is unlikely that an immunological reaction might occur because both L55H and N115S mutations are buried inside the active site. A first cellular validation of the usefulness of the double mutant was obtained by expressing the mutant enzyme into bacterial cells, resulting in an enhanced sensitivity of bacteria to AZT. Further experiments are needed to investigate the potential of improved NDP kinase to alter the response of mammalian cells to antiviral drugs.

The clinical potential of cell therapies is widely accepted for neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and others. The use of embryonic or bone marrow stem cells as a therapy presents a problem of proof of safety, linked to proliferation and differentiation (30Parenteau N.L. Hardin-Young J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 951: 27-39Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The improved NDP kinase gene could render cells used in reparative medicine sensitive to AZT doses that are otherwise harmless for non-transfected cells. The mutant NDP kinase could then play the role of a suicide enzyme in case of uncontrolled proliferation (31Encell L.P. Landis D.M. Loeb L.A. Nat. Bio/Technol. 1999; 17: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3232 Gallois-Montbrun, S., Schneider, B., Giacomoni-Fernades, V., Deville-Bonne, D., and Veron, M.

The overexpression of the mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines was reported to enhance sensitivity of the cells to CdA, araG, and dFdG (33Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Promising results have already been obtained by transfection with herpes simplex thymidine kinase that increases the cells sensitivity to ganciclovir (34Guettari N. Loubiere L. Brisson E. Klatzmann D. Virology. 1997; 235: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the use of the herpes thymidine kinase is limited by the immunogenicity of the viral protein (35Brundiers R. Lavie A. Veit T. Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Ostermann N. Goody R.S. Konrad M. J.

In case of human L55H-N115S NDP kinase, it is unlikely that an immunological reaction might occur because both L55H and N115S mutations are buried inside the active site. A first cellular validation of the usefulness of the double mutant was obtained by expressing the mutant enzyme into bacterial cells, resulting in an enhanced sensitivity of bacteria to AZT. Further experiments are needed to investigate the potential of improved NDP kinase to alter the response of mammalian cells to antiviral drugs. We thank Dr. J. M.

We observed that adapter protein SKAP55, the Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein, formed homodimers through its SH3 domain and SK region. SKAP55 as a substrate interacted with Fyn kinasein vivo. In Jurkat cells, interaction between SKAP55 and Fyn kinase depended on TCR activation. Stable overexpression of SKAP55 in Jurkat cells caused mitogen-activated protein kinase activation following TCR engagement. Anti-CD3 stimulation also promoted the interaction of SKAP55 with Grb-2 in T cells.

Intriguingly, T cell receptor engagement dramatically induced the translocation of endogenous SKAP55 to lipid rafts where SKAP55 was found to interact with Fyn kinase, suggesting that the positive function of SKAP55 via its association with Fyn and other signaling components may have been involved in raft-mediated T cell activation.

Engagement of the antigen-presenting cell (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, antigen-presenting cell; TCR, T cell receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: APC, antigen-presenting cell; TCR, T cell receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. leads to activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) and induces a series of signaling events including a variety of aspects of gene transcription, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar, 2Lin J. Weiss A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 243-244Google Scholar, 3Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Google Scholar). The earliest signaling events in TCR activation involve the Src family kinases (Fyn and Lck), which are activated through CD45-mediated dephosphorylation on the C-terminal negative regulatory site of the kinases. The activated Src kinases are capable of phosphorylating the two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) within the intracellular tails of TCR. It has been established that the rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs provide docking sites for binding of the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine kinases, Syk and ZAP-70, which are subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylated and become fully activated. Hence, it is established that protein interactions through signaling binding motifs in vivo are regulated directly or indirectly by both protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases during T cell activation. Furthermore, recent data documents that lipid rafts, specialized membrane microdomains of the cell membrane, are involved in both TCR- and BCR-mediated signal transduction (4Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Google Scholar). Upon TCR engagement, various signaling molecules involved in TCR signal transduction, such as Vav, Grb-2, and TCRζ, are enriched in rafts, strongly suggesting that lipid rafts play an important functional role in TCR signaling. Presently, the mechanism responsible for recruitment of these TCR signaling molecules to rafts is largely unknown. CD45, the most abundant membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase in T lymphocytes, has not been unequivocally demonstrated to localize to rafts. However, it is certain that CD45 plays a critical role in TCR-mediated signal transduction in T-cells in which this phosphatase is thought to positively regulate T cell activation. Conclusive evidence supporting the critical role of CD45 in TCR signaling comes from an analysis of a CD45-deficient cell line in which TCR signal transduction was totally abrogated (5Thomas M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 247-252Google Scholar, 6Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Google Scholar). Consistent with the positive function of CD45 in TCR signaling, it has been shown that in CD45-deficient cells the kinase activities of Src family kinases, such as Fyn and Lck, were largely suppressed by increased tyrosine phosphorylation at the negative regulatory site located on the C terminus. These data have led to the conclusion that Fyn and Lck interact with CD45 and are putative substrates for the phosphatase. However, there is no clear evidence to support that CD45 directly interacts with these two Src kinases. A recent study suggests that CD45 is unlikely to interact directly with Fyn for dephosphorylation. Rather, it transiently recruits adapter protein SKAP55 as a linker to access the negative regulatory tyrosine-phosphorylated site of Fyn for dephosphorylation, and thus positively regulates TCR signaling (7Wu L., Fu, J. Shen S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2673-2686Google Scholar). A number of adapter proteins, including LAT, VAV, and SLP-76, have been identified in hematopoietic cells. Involvement of these adapters in signaling is strongly suggested by the fact that following their tyrosine phosphorylation, many adapter proteins are able to positively or negatively regulate T cell activation (8Koretzky G.A. Myung P.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 95-107Google Scholar). Adapter proteins bearing protein-interacting modules act as signaling linkers to facilitate multiple protein-protein interactions required for intermolecular switches occurring in signaling events. For instance, adapter LAT, a substrate of protein tyrosine kinase Zap-70 (9Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Google Scholar), contains a long cytoplasmic tail rich in tyrosine residues that are highly phosphorylated upon T cell activation. The phosphorylated LAT recruits Grb2, PLC-γ1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the membrane leading to the activation of several signaling events, such as Ras/MAPK pathway and calcium influx (9Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Google Scholar, 10Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Google Scholar). Likewise, adapter SLP-76, another substrate of Zap-70 kinase, has been shown to interact with Grb2 and SLAP130/Fyb, and to activate Ras and MAPK pathways (11Clements J.L. Yang B. Ross-Barta S.E. Eliason S.L. Hrstka R.F. Williamson R.A. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1998; 281: 416-419Google Scholar). SKAP55, the Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein, was first identified as a Fyn SH2 domain binding protein. SKAP55 is exclusively expressed in T cells (12Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E. Eckerskorn C. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16077-16080Google Scholar), but its biological function in T cells has been elusive since its identification. It was later reported that a novel proline-independent motif in SKAP55 could bind to SH3 domains. Very recently it was found that SKAP55, as a substrate, couples with CD45 and links CD45 with Fyn kinase for dephosphorylation, thus positively regulating TCR-mediated gene transcription (7Wu L., Fu, J. Shen S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2673-2686Google Scholar). However, little is known in terms of the downstream effectors of SKAP55-mediated signaling during TCR activation. In the present report, we demonstrate that SKAP55, as a substrate, was phosphorylated by Fyn kinase. SKAP55 formed homodimers through its SH3 domain and SK region. Stable overexpression of SKAP55 significantly increased MAP kinase phosphorylation in response to anti-CD3 stimulation in vivo. Furthermore, in Jurkat cells, stimulation with anti-CD3 promoted the translocation of SKAP55 to lipid rafts, where it interacted with Fyn kinase. From these results, together with our previous findings, we conclude that SKAP55 in association with both CD45 and Fyn kinase plays a positive role in raft-mediated T cell activation. Jurkat cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 50 mmHepes. 293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-CD3 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal and anti-Fyn p59 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho MAPK was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; anti-MAPK (ERK1/ERK2) antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Zhao (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Anti-SKAP55 and anti-CD45 antibodies were from BD Biosciences. SKAP55 was subcloned in-frame with the C-terminal Myc-His tag into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Fyn (p59) and its kinase-dead mutant Fyn-K299A in pRK5 vector was a kind gift from Dr. Stamm (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Germany). The N-terminal FLAG-tagged LAT construct was kindly provided by Dr. Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and the N-terminal Flag-tagged SLP-76 was kindly provided by Dr. Korezkey (University of Pennsylvania, State College, PA). For the site-directed mutagenesis, the tyrosine residues of SKAP55 at positions 219, 232, and 271 were selected and mutated into phenylalanine (F) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mutant SKAP55-Y219F, SKAP55-Y232F and SKAP55-Y271F were also cloned into pCDNA3.1-Myc-His vector. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cells were well maintained in log phase and fed the day before transfections. 50–70% confluent 293T cells were transfected overnight in a 37 °C incubator at 3% CO2 using highly efficient calcium phosphate transfection reagents. The transfection efficiency was monitored using 1 μg of CMV-GFP plasmid as control and at least 30–50% green cells were observed under immunofluorescence microscopy 18 h after transfection. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and were fed with fresh complete culture medium 1 day before transfection. 10 × 107 Jurkat cells for each transfection were washed twice using RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 mm Hepes and mixed with 50 μg of appropriate plasmid and electroporated at 300 volts, 10 ms in 300-μl volume using a BTX820 electroporator (BTX Corp., San Diego, CA). After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the transfected cells were recultured with fresh full culture medium for an additional 48 h. For anti-CD3 stimulation, cells were treated with anti-CD3 antibody (5 μg/ml) and then treated with a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (20 μg/ml) for 5 min. The reaction was stopped with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS before adding lysis buffer. Cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed with 1% Triton lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1.5 mm MgCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min on ice. The samples were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were transferred to clean tubes and subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies conjugated to protein A Sepharose (Sigma). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with PBS, and then subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with appropriate antibodies. The membranes were incubated with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h, incubated with the first antibody, and washed for 30 min, followed by the second antibody incubation. The membranes then were washed for 15 min and rinsed with PBS once before for Western blot analysis. SKAP55 and its mutants were transfected into Jurkat cells, and stable cell lines were selected with 200 μg/ml G418 in RPMI 1640 medium. The selected clones were poured together and divided equally into two portions. One portion was treated with anti-CD3 antibody, while the other portion was left untreated. For each treatment, 1.5 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in 200 μl of 1% Triton lysis buffer for 15 min on ice. The total cell lysates (4%) were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phospho MAPK antibody, anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibody, and anti-Myc antibody, respectively. Jurkat cells (5 × 108) in log phase were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in a full culture medium and divided into two portions. One portion was left untreated, and the other portion was treated with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) plus goat anti-mouse antibody (20 μg/ml) for 5 min. Both the treated and untreated cells were immediately washed once with ice-cold PBS before lysis with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer on ice for 30 min. The lysates were homogenized by 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. One ml of cell lysates was mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose dissolved in 1% Triton lysis buffer and added to the bottom of a centrifuge tube. The tube was overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose on the top. The sucrose gradient samples were centrifuged at 38,400 rpm with a Beckman SW55Ti rotor at 4 °C for 20 h. After centrifugation, 12 gradient fractions each containing 0.4 ml of sample were carefully collected. In some experiments, aliquots from the raft fractions (fractions 3–5) were combined for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. It is known that SH3 domains bind to proline-rich motifs. Because the SK region of SKAP55 contains proline-rich sequences, it is likely that self-association of SKAP55 may occur in vivo. To test this possibility, we made two SKAP55 constructs, one with a HA tag at the N terminus (HA-SKAP55) and the other with a Myc tag at the C terminus (SKAP55-Myc). Both constructs were cotransfected into Jurkat cells, and the transfected cells were treated with anti-CD3 stimulation or left untreated. Coimmunoprecipitations were performed with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies, and precipitants were analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig 1 A, in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitants, SKAP55 was detected with anti-HA antibody, indicating that the HA-tagged SKAP55 interacted with Myc-tagged SKAP55. Anti-CD3 stimulation enhanced the formation of SKAP55 homodimers (Fig.1 A, right panel). Similarly, in the reciprocal experiment, the Myc-tagged SKAP55 was detectable in the anti-HA immunoprecipitants (data not shown). The conserved tryptophan residue in the SH3 domain is known to be critical for the binding of proline-rich motifs. To determine whether the SH3 domain of SKAP55 is involved in self-association, a mutant, SKAP55-W333R, with the replacement of arginine for tryptophan 333 at the SH3 domain was made. Both the Myc-tagged mutant SKAP55-W333R (SKAP55-W333R-Myc) and the Myc-tagged wild type SKAP55 (SKAP55-Myc) were cotransfected with HA-SKAP55 into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the amount of mutant SKAP55-W333R-Myc precipitated with HA-SKAP55 was dramatically decreased in comparison with that of SKAP55-Myc wild type. This mutant also suppressed the SKAP55-mediated MAPK activation (see Fig. 6 below). These results suggest that the SH3 domain of SKAP55 contributes to the self-interaction in vivo. (Fig.2).Figure 6SKAP55 functions as a positive regulator for the MAPK pathway in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were transfected with vector alone, SKAP55, or the mutants SKAP55-Y271F, SKAP55-Y219F, SKAP55-Y232F, or SKAP55-W333R. The stable transfected Jurkat cells were poured together and treated with anti-CD3 for 5 min or left untreated. Total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (upper), anti-ERK1/ERK2 antibody (middle), or anti-SKAP55 anti body (lower).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2SKAP55 interacts with Fyn kinase. A, SKAP55 interacts with wild-type Fyn kinase, but not with kinase-dead mutant Fyn-K299A. SKAP55-Myc was co-transfected with wild-type Fyn kinase and kinase-dead mutant Fyn K299A into 293T cells. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with antibodies as indicated. B, SKAP55 associates with endogenous Fyn in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were transfected with SKAP55-Myc. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with anti-CD3 antibody for 5 min or left untreated. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SKAP55 was first identified as a Fyn kinase-interacting protein (12Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E. Eckerskorn C. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16077-16080Google Scholar). Later, it was reported that SKAP55 was tyrosine-phosphorylated when cotransfected with Fyn kinase, but not with Lck kinase or with ZAP-70 kinase (13Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A.M. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Google Scholar), indicating that SKAP55 is a potential substrate for Fyn kinase. To investigate the substrate nature of SKAP55 for Fyn, we compared the interaction of SKAP 55 with the wild-type Fyn and with the Fyn kinase-dead mutant Fyn-K299A (14Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Schwaiger F.W. Obermeier A. Stamm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3909-3926Google Scholar)in vivo in conjunction with its tyrosine phosphorylation. SKAP55 tagged with Myc at the C terminus was transfected either with wild type Fyn or with the kinase-dead mutant Fyn-K299A into 293-T cells. The interactions of SKAP55 with Fyn and its mutant were characterized by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 2 A,left panel, whereas SKAP55 was largely coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type Fyn kinase, it was barely detectable in immunoprecipitants produced by the kinase-dead mutant Fyn-K299A. The status of the tyrosine phosphorylation of SKAP55 in the immunoprecipitants was examined by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 2 A, SKAP55 was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in immunocomplex with wild-type Fyn kinase, whereas its tyrosine phosphorylation was not detectable in the immunoprecipitants generated by kinase-dead mutant Fyn-K299A. The interaction of SKAP55 with Fyn kinase was further examined in T lymphocytes where both SKAP55 and Fyn are predominantly expressed. SKAP55 was transiently transfected with Fyn kinase into Jurkat cells. After transfections, the cells were treated with anti-CD3 antibody for 5 min or left untreated. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Fyn antibody and anti-Myc antibody, respectively. SKAP55 was readily detected in the immunocomplex prepared from anti-CD3-stimulated cells but not from non-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these data show that SKAP55 interacts with Fyn kinase in response to TCR activation in Jurkat cells and that Fyn kinase activity is required for this interaction and for the tyrosine phosphorylation of SKAP55 in vivo. The requirement of tyrosine phosphorylation for interaction of SKAP55 with Fyn kinase prompted us to define Fyn kinase-binding sites in SKAP55. There are three potential tyrosine residues in SKAP55 for binding to the SH2 domain of Fyn, namely, tyrosine 219, tyrosine 232, and tyrosine 271 (15Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, a tyrosine (Y) to phenylalanine (F) mutant was made for those tyrosine residues in SKAP55 that was tagged with Myc at the C terminus. A Fyn kinase expression vector was cotransfected with a vector alone, or containing SKAP55 or one of its mutants (Y219F, Y232F, and Y271F), into 293T cells. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunodetections following immunoprecipitations with anti-Fyn antibody and anti-Myc antibody, respectively. Fig.3 A shows that Fyn was detected in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitants from cells transfected with wild-type SKAP55 and SKAP55-Y219F. In the latter case, a large amount of SKAP55-Y219F was observed, probably due to its very high level of expression in the transfected cells as shown in Fig.3 B,lower panel. Fyn was also detectable in the SKAP55-Y232F-transfected cells, although a reduced precipitant was observed with this mutant when compared with wild type SKAP55. In contrast, Fyn was not detected from the cells transfected with SKAP55-Y271F. The reciprocal experiments also confirmed that SKAP55-Y271F was not able to interact with Fyn kinase (Fig.3 B). Taken together, these data show that the tyrosine at position 271 within the EDIYXXL motif of SKAP55 contributes to its interaction with the SH2 domain of Fyn kinase. The components of lipid rafts are disassembled in resting T cells but are rapidly assembled when T cells are triggered by anti-CD3 stimulation (16Leitenberg D. Balamuth F. Bottomly K. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 129-138Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that SKAP55 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the membrane in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, and CD45 is required for such dynamic translocation of SKAP55 in Jurkat cells (7Wu L., Fu, J. Shen S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2673-2686Google Scholar). Because rafts are well correlated with TCR activation, we were interested in further examining whether the observed translocation of SKAP55 in Jurkat cells is related to the localization of lipid rafts. Jurkat cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3, and the cell lysates were ultracentrifuged over a sucrose step gradient. The distribution of endogenous SKAP55 in the sucrose gradient was examined by immunoblotting. Without anti-CD3 stimulation, SKAP55 was hardly detectable in the raft fractions. However, after TCR cross-linking a significant amount of SKAP55 was distributed in the raft fractions (Fig.4, upper panel infractions 3, 4 and5). Consistent with other reports (16Leitenberg D. Balamuth F. Bottomly K. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 129-138Google Scholar, 17Harder T. Kuhn M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 199-208Google Scholar), the endogenous Fyn kinase was constitutively present in the raft fractions, although its amount slightly increased with anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 4, lower panel). These results suggest that SKAP55 is recruited to lipid rafts upon TCR activation whereas Src kinases and other characterized TCR signaling molecules are pre-targeted into membrane rafts without TCR stimulation (Fig.4). We have shown that SKAP55 was phosphorylated by its interaction with Fyn in vivo (Fig. 2). To investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the recruitment of endogenous SKAP55 to lipid rafts, we tested whether there is a physiological association between SKAP55 and Fyn in rafts following anti-CD3 stimulation in vivo. To this end, lipid raft fractions 3, 4, and 5 (see Fig. 4) were combined from Jurkat cells before and after CD3 stimulation. The association of SKAP55 with Fyn in rafts was examined by coimmunoprecipitation and immunodetection. As shown in Fig. 5, SKAP55 was readily detected in the coimmunoprecipitants produced from the CD3-stimulated cells, but not in the immunocomplexes obtained from the unstimulated cells in which, as shown in Fig. 4, little SKAP55 was localized in the raft fractions. Taken together, these results suggest that upon TCR engagement, endogenous SKAP55 recruits to rafts probably through its association with Fyn, and it may thereby exert its regulatory function in raft-mediated T cell activation (Fig.5). It has been well established that there is a cross-talking between the TCR signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway through lymphocyte-specific adapter proteins such as SLP-76 and LAT. These two adapters, the two common effectors downstream of T cell signaling (18Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Google Scholar), bind to Grb-2, which in turn leads to Ras activation. Because SKAP55 plays a positive role in TCR-mediated gene transcription (7Wu L., Fu, J. Shen S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2673-2686Google Scholar), we examined whether SKAP55 has any effects on the MAPK pathway. For this purpose, Jurkat cells were stably transfected with SKAP55 and its mutants, SKAP55-Y219F, SKAP55-Y232F, and SKAP55-Y271F. The cell lysates were prepared from cells either treated with anti-CD3 or left untreated. The prepared cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody. Fig. 6 shows that in comparison with control vector alone, overexpression of wild-type SKAP55 dramatically induced MAPK phosphorylation in the CD3-stimulated cells. Mutant SKAP55-Y219F exhibited a moderate increase in MAPK phosphorylation in response to CD3 stimulation when compared with vector alone. In contrast, the other two mutations, SKAP55-Y271F and SKAP55-Y232F, nearly completely abolished the observed enhancing effect of wild-type SKAP55 on MAPK activation after TCR cross-linking. In the rest Jurkat cells, the inactive MAPK remained unphosphorylated regardless of the expression of wild-type SKAP55 or its mutants. In addition, we also transfected mutant SKAP55-W333R into Jurkat cells and found that the activation of MAPK phosphorylation was significantly reduced when compared with the transfectants of wild-type SKAP55 (Fig.6, upper panel), indicating that dimerization of SKAP55 may have contributed to its regulatory functions in the signaling. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SKAP55 positively mediates the MAPK pathway in conjunction with TCR activation (Fig.6). It has been demonstrated that several adapter proteins, such as Grb-2 (18Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Google Scholar), SLP-76 (11Clements J.L. Yang B. Ross-Barta S.E. Eliason S.L. Hrstka R.F. Williamson R.A. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1998; 281: 416-419Google Scholar), and LAT (9Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Google Scholar), are involved in the MAPK pathway in conjunction with TCR activation. Following TCR cross-linking, these adapter proteins are rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated (19Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 5-8Google Scholar). To study the mechanism by which SKAP55 mediates the activation of MAP kinase, we examined whether these adapter proteins associate with SKAP55 during TCR activation. In this regard, SKAP55 tagged with Myc at the C terminus was cotransfected with Grb-2 into Jurkat cells. The transfected cells were either treated with anti-CD3 antibody or left untreated. Cell lysates were prepared from both the treated and untreated cells, and coimmunoprecipitations were performed with the corresponding antibodies. Grb-2 protein was readily detected in the immunocomplex prepared from SKAP55-transfected Jurkat cells following anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 7 A,right panel), whereas Grb-2 was undetectable in the immunoprecipitants obtained from the unstimulated Jurkat cells (Fig. 7 A,left panel). In parallel, the Myc-tagged SKAP55 was cotransfected either with LAT tagged with FLAG at the N terminus or with SLP-76 tagged with FLAG at the N terminus, into Jurkat cells. After the transfections, the cells were either treated with anti-CD3 or left untreated. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, both FLAG-LAT and FLAG-SLP-76 proteins failed to coimmunoprecipitate with Myc-tagged SKAP55 protein, irrespective of the treatment with anti-CD3 antibody; hence, the interaction between SKAP55 and Grb-2 is of a relatively specific nature. Because the SH3 domain of Grb-2 failed to interact with SKAP55 (20Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Google Scholar), we suspect that the interaction between Grb-2 and SKAP55 probably occurs through the binding of the tyrosine-phosphorylated SKAP55 to the SH2 domain of Grb-2. To reveal the nature of the interaction between the two proteins, mutants of SKAP55, designated SKAP55-Y271F, SKAP55-Y219F, and SKAP55-Y232F, were tested for their interaction with Grb-2 after stimulation with anti-CD3 in Jurkat cells. Whereas mutants SKAP55-Y219F and SKAP55-Y232F displayed their interactions with Grb-2 similar to that of wild-type SKAP55, the interaction of mutant SKAP55-Y271F with Grb-2 was significantly reduced (Fig. 7 D). These results clearly show that SKAP55 associates with Grb-2 through its phosphorylated residue 271 following TCR engagement. Previously, we have shown that CD45 recruits adapter protein SKAP55 as a linker to access the negative regulatory site in Fyn kinase for dephosphorylation, leading to activation of TCR signaling. Thus, SKAP55 positively regulates TCR-mediated gene transcription (7Wu L., Fu, J. Shen S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2673-2686Google Scholar). In this report, we further demonstrated that SKAP55 itself, while acting as a linker between CD45 and Fyn, was tyrosine-phosphorylated by Fyn kinase, and the phosphorylated SKAP55 subsequently interacted with Fyn. The interaction between SKAP55 and Fyn requires the kinase activity of Fyn because the kinase-dead mutant Fyn-K299A failed to interact with SKAP55. In Jurkat cells, anti-CD3 stimulation greatly promoted interaction between SKAP55 and Fyn kinase. It is very likely that such CD3 stimulation-dependent association of SKAP55 with Fyn kinase results in localization of the adapter protein to the membrane, thereby facilitating exertion of its positive regulatory function in TCR signaling (see below). Such tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent association of SKAP55 with Fyn was somehow unnoticed in a previous report (21Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1175-1187Google Scholar). Studies using Tyr→Phe site-directed mutants of SKAP55 proved that tyrosine residue 271, which resides within EDIYXXL motif, is the only tyrosine residue critical for binding to the SH2 domain of Fyn. Together with the previous reports (12Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E. Eckerskorn C. Kirchgessner H. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16077-16080Google Scholar, 13Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A.M. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Google Scholar), our results indicate that Fyn is the main kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of SKAP55 in vivo, although the possibility of phosphorylation by other tyrosine kinases in the TCR complex cannot be excluded. TCR activation triggered by engagement of the antigen-presenting cell ultimately leads to transcriptional activation through a series of signaling events in which the MAP kinase pathway is thought to be involved. We demonstrated that in Jurkat cells, overexpression of SKAP55 resulted in activation of MAP kinase following anti-CD3 stimulation. Both Y271F and Y232F mutations in SKAP55 did not exhibit any enhanced MAP kinase activation observed with wild-type SAKP55 (Fig.6). The fact that the interaction of CD45 with SKAP55 is via residue Tyr 232 and that Tyr 271 is critical for interaction of SKAP55 with Fyn supports the notion that the positive regulatory function of SKAP55 in TCR signaling is exerted through its interaction with both CD45 and Fyn kinase. The SKAP55-mediated downstream effectors in TCR signaling were further targeted to an adapter protein, Grb-2, which is known to be involved in activation of the MAPK pathway. In Jurkat cells, interaction of SKAP55 with Grb-2 was induced by anti-CD3 stimulation. Interestingly, the interaction between SKAP55 and Grb-2 depends on Tyr 271, the same residue that is targeted for phosphorylation by Fyn. Thus, on TCR activation, protein-protein interactions may facilitate SKAP55 translocation to the cell membrane, allowing it to access and interact with Grb-2 and other targets for regulation of TCR signaling. It has been shown that the homodimerization/oligomerization of some adapter proteins, such as p62Dok (22Songyang Z. Yamanashi Y. Liu D. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2459-2465Google Scholar) and SLAP (23Tang J. Sawasdikosol S. Chang J.H. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9775-9780Google Scholar), plays a functional role in signal-transduction pathways. We presented evidence that SKAP55 formed homodimers via binding of its SH3 domain to the proline-rich motif in the SK-region. Homodimerization of SKAP55 was induced by anti-CD3 stimulation in Jurkat cells but was significantly antagonized by mutant SKAP55-W333R due to the fact that Trp 333 is a key residue of the SH3 domain involved in binding to proline-rich motifs. At present, it is largely unknown as to how homodimerization of SKAP55 contributes to its regulatory function in TCR signaling. However, the transfection of dimerization-impaired mutant SKAP55-W333R indeed significantly suppressed the observed wild-type SKAP55-mediated MAPK activation (Fig.6). It has been proposed that dimerization of CD3ζ facilitates intermolecular interactions between associated ZAP-70 kinases and the phosphorylation-dependent dimerization of STAT family proteins promotes their function in transcriptional activation. For SKAP55, dimerization may amplify its effects on signaling cascades in T cells by providing its multiple functional domains for intermolecular interactions. Dimerization of SKAP55 may also increase its stability. Recent studies support a model in which lipid rafts play a key role in the process of TCR triggering as well as in the propagation of the TCR-induced signaling cascade (4Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Google Scholar, 24Viola A. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 322-327Google Scholar). A number of key signaling molecules are selectively associated with raft microdomains in resting T cells, including acylated Src kinases Lck and Fyn, adapter protein LAT, Syk, and others. After TCR engagement, several components of the TCR signaling cascade, such as kinase ZAP-70, phosphatase SHP-1, and adapter Grb-2, are recruited to the rafts to form a signaling complex. Previously, we found that in Jurkat cells, TCR engagement greatly promoted the translocation of SKAP55 from the cytoplasm to the membrane, indicating a possible recruitment of SKAP55 to rafts. Indeed, we demonstrate here that endogenous SKAP55, a linker for CD45 and Fyn (7Wu L., Fu, J. Shen S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2673-2686Google Scholar), was dramatically recruited to rafts upon TCR cross-linking, and SKAP55 was found to be associated with Fyn in rafts upon TCR cross-linking. Our results also suggest that the TCR activation-dependent interaction of SKAP55 with Grb-2 takes place in lipid rafts. Previously, we also showed that the TCR-activation-dependent translocation of SKAP55 to the membrane required CD45 activity. However, the recruitment of CD45 itself to rafts is still a controversial issue for this key positive regulator in TCR signaling. It remains unclear exactly how SKAP55 is translocated into rafts, and the question of which component(s) of the TCR signaling cascade is directly responsible for the recruitment of SKAP55 to lipid rafts demands further investigation. Nevertheless, it has been well established that under resting conditions TCRs reside outside rafts but are recruited into rafts upon activation, indicating that membrane compartmentation is a prerequisite for TCR signal transduction. Thus, the TCR-activated translocation of SKAP55 to rafts and its association with Fyn in rafts strongly suggest that the positive function of SKAP55 in TCR signaling may have been involved in raft-mediated T cell activation.

The human ASGP-R contains two subunits, H1 and H2. Cytoplasmic residues Cys36 in H1, as well as Cys54 and Cys58 in H2 are palmitoylated (Zeng, F.-Y., and Weigel, P. H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 32454). In order to study the function(s) of ASGP-R palmitoylation, we mutated these Cys residues to Ser and generated stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cell lines expressing either wild-type or nonpalmitoylated ASGP-Rs. Compared with wild-type ASGP-Rs, palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs showed normal ligand binding, intracellular distribution and trafficking patterns, and pH-induced dissociation profiles in vitro. However, continuous ASOR uptake, and the uptake of prebound cell surface ASOR were slower in cells expressing palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs than in cells expressing wild-type ASGP-Rs. Unlike native ASGP-Rs in hepatocytes or hepatoma cells, which mediate endocytosis via the clathrin-coated pit pathway and are almost completely inhibited by hypertonic medium, only ∼40% of the ASOR uptake in SK-Hep-1 cells expressing wild-type ASGP-Rs was inhibited by hyperosmolarity. This result suggests the existence of an alternate nonclathrin-mediated internalization pathway, such as transcytosis, for the entry of ASGP-R·ASOR complexes into these cells. In contrast, ASOR uptake mediated by cells expressing palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs showed only a marginal difference under hypertonic conditions, indicating that most of the nonpalmitoylated ASGP-Rs were not internalized and processed normally through the clathrin-coated pit pathway. Furthermore, cells expressing wild-type ASGP-Rs were able to degrade the internalized ASOR, whereas ASOR dissociation was impaired and degradation was barely detectable in cells expressing nonpalmitoylated ASGP-Rs. We conclude that palmitoylation of the ASGP-R is required for its efficient endocytosis of ligand by the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway and, in particular, for the proper dissociation and delivery of ligand to lysosomes.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the post-translational modification of integral membrane proteins by palmitoylation plays a role in regulating specific protein functions (1Resh M.D. Biochim.

For example, CHO cells expressing nonpalmitoylated mutant transferrin receptors show a significant increase in the rate of receptor internalization when compared with the wild-type receptor, indicating that palmitoylation inhibits the rate of transferrin receptor endocytosis (6Alvarez E. Girones N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16644-16655Google Scholar). Tanakaet al. (7Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Nishihara E. Nambe H. Yamashita S. Niwa M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 803-806Google Scholar) demonstrated that abolition of palmitoylation reduced the rate of intracellular trafficking of the human thyrotropin receptor, which resulted in delayed surface expression of newly synthesized receptor. Moreover, Blanpain et al. (8Blanpain C. Wittamer V. Vanderwinden J.M. Boom A. Renneboog B. Lee B., Le Poul E., El Asmar L. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23795-23804Google Scholar) found that failure of the CC-chemokine receptor CCR5 to be palmitoylated hindered its trafficking and thus led to the sequestration of CCR5 in intracellular biosynthetic compartments. Thus, one of the potential mechanisms for regulating intracellular trafficking may be through the covalent attachment of palmitic acid to a protein.

Native ASGP-Rs in isolated hepatocytes or hepatoma-derived cell lines endocytose asialoglycoproteins via the clathrin-dependent pathway. The internalized ligands are ultimately delivered to lysosomes for degradation, while the receptors recycle to the plasma membrane. Based on a series of studies on ASGP-R-mediated endocytosis, we have previously shown that ASGP-Rs operate in two distinct pathways, called the State 1 and State 2 pathways (reviewed in Refs. 16Weigel P.H. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Mechanisms and Control of Glycoconjugate Turnover. Marcel-Dekker, New York1992: 421-497Google Scholar, 17Weigel P.H. Subcell.

Receptors functioning in the State 2 pathway can be distinguished from those in the State 1 pathway based on their sensitivity to modulation by a variety of agents, such as monensin, chloroquine, microtubule drugs, or by ATP depletion (20McAbee D.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1942-1945Google Scholar, 21McAbee D.D. Clarke B.L. Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 629-635Google Scholar, 22McAbee D.D. Lear M.C. Weigel P.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 59-68Google Scholar). During the process of endocytosis, only the receptors in the State 2 pathway undergo an I/R cycle that may be regulated by changes in the palmitoylation status of the receptors (23Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27186-27190Google Scholar, 24Weigel P.H. Medh J.D. Oka J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 227-235Google Scholar, 25Zeng F.-Y. Kaphalia B.S. Ansari G.A.S. Weigel P.H. J.

This two-pathway endocytosis system has also been genetically validated by Stockert et al. (27Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Google Scholar) with the isolation of a trafficking defective mutant cell line, Trf1, derived from HuH-7 cells. Although a functional State 1 pathway is present in the Trf1 cells, they are defective in endocytosis mediated by the State 2 pathway. The human ASGP-R is composed of two subunits, H1 and H2 (28Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1985; 82: 6465-6469Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic Cys36 in H1, as well as the analogous Cys54 and the juxtamembrane Cys58 in H2 are palmitoylated (29Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32454-32460Google Scholar, 30Saxena A. Yik J.H.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12S (abstr.): 215Google Scholar). 2A. Saxena, J. H. N. Yik, R. J. Fallon, and P. H. Weigel, manuscript in preparation. In order to elucidate the effects of palmitoylation on ASGP-R mediated endocytosis, the Cys residues that are palmitoylated in the H1 and H2 subunits were replaced by Ser using site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type or mutant subunits were then stably expressed in SK-Hep-1 cells. Here we report that stable cell lines expressing either wild-type or nonpalmitoylated ASGP-Rs have a similar cellular distribution pattern of the receptors. However, cells expressing nonpalmitoylated ASGP-Rs are defective in ligand uptake, dissociation, and degradation. ASOR was prepared by desialylation of human orosomucoid (Sigma) with neuraminidase as described previously (31Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1201-1207Google Scholar). Na125I (10–20 mCi/μg of iodine) was from AmershamBiosciences. [9,10-3H]palmitate (30–60 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 1,2,4,6-Tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenylglycouril (Iodogen) and protein assay reagents were from Pierce Chemical Co. Bovine serum albumin was from Intergen Co. 125I-ASOR, iron-saturated human125I-transferrin, and 125I-anti-H1 and -H2 antibodies were prepared as described previously (32Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Google Scholar). ASOR conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (fl-ASOR) was prepared using the Alexa Fluor® 488 Protein Labeling Kit from Molecular Probes according to the manufacturer's instructions. The generation and purification of the polyclonal rabbit anti-H1 and goat anti-H2 IgGs have been described previously (32Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Google Scholar). Sheep anti-rabbit IgG Fab' fragment conjugated to Cy3 was from Sigma. Lysotracker Red DND-99 and donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 were from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Buffer 1 contains 150 mmNaCl, 6.7 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Hanks balanced salt solution and PBS were made following standard recipes. DMEM and MEM were from Invitrogen. Medium 1 contains MEM supplemented with 2.4 g/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mg/ml sodium succinate, 75 mg/ml succinic acid, and 0.22 g/liter NaHCO3. Complete medium is DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology), 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). cDNAs encoding wild-type H1 and the H2 splice variant H2b (28Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1985; 82: 6465-6469Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Martin Spiess (University of Basel, Switzerland). The generation of H1(C36S) by site-directed mutagenesis has been described (29Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32454-32460Google Scholar). The generation of H2(C54S/C58S) will be described elsewhere.2 For the generation of single transfectants expressing either wild-type H1 or H1(C36S), the corresponding cDNAs were subcloned into pIRES/neo (Clontech) and stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cell lines were selected and cloned.2 Wild-type H2 and H2(C54S/C58S) cDNAs were inserted into pcDNA3.1(+)/zeo (Invitrogen) using the BamHI and EcoRI sites. Each H2 cDNA was transfected into cell lines expressing H1 or H1(C36S), and stable double transfectants were selected and cloned. This resulted in the generation of four types of cell lines expressing either wild-type H1 and H2, wild-type H1 and mutant H2, mutant H1 and wild-type H2, or mutant H1 and H2 subunits. All transfections were performed using the Calcium Phosphate Transfection Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lines were selected, cloned, and maintained in complete medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech) and 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines were grown in 12- or 24-well plates to confluence, washed, and incubated in DMEM without serum for 30–60 min. Cells were then chilled on ice and incubated with 1.5 μg/ml 125I-ASOR, or 0.5 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-H1 or anti-H2 125I-IgG in Medium 1, in the presence (to assess total cellular ASGP-Rs) or absence (to assess cell surface ASGP-Rs) of 0.055% (w/v) digitonin for 1 h (33Weigel P.H. Ray D.A. Oka J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 437-449Google Scholar). Unbound ASOR or IgG was removed by extensive washing with ice-cold Medium 1. Cells were then solubilized with 0.3 m NaOH, and the radioactivity and protein content of the cell lysates were measured. Various stable cell lines were allowed to internalize 125I-ASOR for 30 min at 37 °C and chilled rapidly on ice, and unbound ligand was removed by washing three times with ice-cold Buffer 1. The rest of the procedure was performed on ice. Cells were permeabilized with 0.055% (w/v) digitonin in Buffer 1 for 15 min. Cells were washed again and then subjected to two 20-min incubations in Buffer 1 with different pH values, ranging from pH 5.0 to 7.4. The cells were washed once with Buffer 1, and the remaining cell-associated radioactivity was then determined. Stable cell lines were grown to confluence in 35 mm dishes and washed with PBS. One ml of prewarmed medium containing 1 mg/ml proteinase-K (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C. At the desired time, the cells were chilled on ice, scraped, and collected in a microcentrifuge tube, pelleted at 4 °C, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then solubilized in the latter buffer containing 1% Triton-X 100, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA, and the lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose and the H1 and H2 subunits were detected by Western analysis using subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies (32Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Google Scholar). Images of the Western blots were captured digitally, and the density of the protein bands was quantified using a Fluorchem™ 8000 Imaging System from Alpha Innotech Corp. The stable cell lines were grown in 24-well plates to confluence and then serum-starved for 30–60 min, washed, and incubated with DMEM containing 1.5 μg/ml125I-ASOR for various times at 37 °C. In some experiments hyperosmolarity was used to block clathrin recycling by including 0.4 m sucrose in the medium. The cells were chilled rapidly on ice, washed three times with ice-cold Hanks, and lysed with 0.3 m NaOH. Radioactivity and protein content in the cell lysates were quantified. The degradation of125I-ASOR was determined by measuring the appearance of acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium (31Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1201-1207Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with 125I-ASOR as described above and at each time point, the medium was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 10% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid in 2 n HCl. After at least 15 min incubation on ice, the precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, and the radioactivity remaining in the supernatant was quantified. Stable cell lines were grown in 12-well plates to confluence and serum-starved for 30–60 min. Cells were then incubated on ice for 1 h in Hanks containing 1.5 μg/ml125I-ASOR. Unbound 125I-ASOR was removed by washing three times with Hanks. The cells were then resuspended in Hanks and incubated at 37 °C. In some experiments hyperosmolarity was used to block clathrin recycling by including 0.4 msucrose in the medium. After the desired internalization period, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were chilled rapidly on ice, followed by a 10-min incubation with Hanks containing 20 mmEGTA to remove the remaining surface-bound 125I-ASOR. The medium was collected, and the cells were washed again and lysed. The radioactivity recovered in the EGTA wash (cell-surface associated125I-ASOR) and the cell lysates (internalized125I-ASOR) were then quantified. Stable cells were grown in Lab-Tek® II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) to ∼70% confluence and then serum-starved for 30 min. Cells were washed, incubated with 1.5 μg/ml fl-ASOR in DMEM, in the presence or absence of 0.4 m sucrose, for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed again and then incubated in DMEM containing 150 μg/ml unlabeled ASOR for 30 min. The lysosomal marker Lysotracker Red DND-99 was added at a concentration of 50 nm, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. After rinsing with PBS, the live cells were examined at room temperature using a Leica TCS confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser. Digital images of samples that had dual fluorescence staining were captured with Leica TCS NT Version 1.6.587 software. The extent of co-localization of green pixels (fl-ASOR) with red pixels (lysosome) was determined using Adobe Photoshop v5.5 and the image analysis protocol of Setiadi et al. (34Setiadi H. Sedgewick G. Erlandsen S. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 142: 859-871Google Scholar). Cells grown in 12-well plates to confluence were pulse-labeled with 1.5 μg/ml 125I-ASOR in DMEM for 3 min at 37 °C and then incubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ASOR for various times, after which the cells were chilled rapidly on ice. Remaining surface-bound 125I-ASOR was removed by washing in Hanks containing 20 mm EGTA. The cells were then incubated in 0.5 ml of Hanks, with or without 0.055% (w/v) digitonin, to measure the amount of receptor-bound ligand and the total amount of intracellular ligand (both free and receptor-bound), respectively. After 15 min on ice, the cells were washed and solubilized in 0.3 m NaOH. Cell-associated radioactivity and protein content were determined. The difference in the radioactivity associated with cells in the presence or absence of digitonin represents ligand that was lost due to the permeabilization of cells and was therefore not bound to receptor (33Weigel P.H. Ray D.A. Oka J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 437-449Google Scholar). Cells grown in 12-well plates to confluence were preincubated with DMEM with or without 0.4 m sucrose for 10 min. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were pulse-labeled with 1.5 μg/ml125I-ASOR in DMEM, in the presence or absence of 0.4m sucrose, for 10 min at 37 °C and then chilled rapidly on ice. Unbound ligand was removed by washing with ice-cold Hanks. Cell surface-bound 125I-ASOR was then removed by a 15-min wash with Hanks containing 20 mm EGTA. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 0.5 ml of Hanks in the presence or absence of 0.4 m sucrose. At the desired time, intact or degraded125I-ASOR released into the medium, and remaining cell-associated radioactivity were measured. 125I radioactivity was measured using a Packard COBRA 5002 Gamma Counting System. The protein content in the cell lysates was determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Specific binding was determined by subtracting the value of nonspecific binding from the total binding. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating SK-Hep-1 cells, transfected with either the empty plasmids or plasmids containing H1 and H2 cDNAs, with 125I-ASOR or 125I-IgG by including a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ASOR or IgG in the mixes. Nonspecific binding was routinely ∼20–30% of the total bound radioactivity. The sequences of the cytoplasmic domains of H1 and H2, depicting the location of the palmitoylated Cys residues, are shown in Fig. 1 A. In order to study the effects of Cys palmitoylation on receptor activity and function, stable cell lines expressing either wild-type or partially or completely palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs were created in SK-Hep-1 cells, a human hepatoma-derived cell line lacking endogenous ASGP-Rs (37Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4429-4432Google Scholar). The expression of wild-type or mutant H1 and H2 subunits in all stable cell lines was confirmed by Western blot analysis using subunit-specific antibodies (not shown). All four ASGP-R types containing combinations of wild-type or Cys-variant H1 or H2 subunits have similar ligand-binding affinities in the range of 1–3 nm, as determined by equilibrium binding and Scatchard analysis. 3Yik, J. H. N., Saxena, A., Weigel, J. A., and Weigel, P. H. (2002) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 297,980–986. To verify that ASGP-Rs from a cell line expressing [H1(C36S) and H2(C54S/C58S)] subunits were indeed unable to be palmitoylated, two different clonal cell lines that had been sequentially transfected with either [H1 and H2], or with [H1(C36S) and H2(C54S/C58S)] cDNAs were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate (Fig.1 B). The results confirmed that ASGP-Rs containing wild-type H1 and H2 were radiolabeled with [3H]palmitate (lanes 1 and 2), whereas ASGP-Rs containing H1(C36S) and H2(C54S/C58S) were not labeled (lanes 3 and4). We next determined the effect of Cys-to-Ser mutations in the H1 or H2 cytoplasmic domains on the distribution of active intracellular and cell surface receptors (TableI). All cell lines expressed comparable amounts of total cellular ASOR binding sites, assessed after digitonin permeabilization. Based on Scatchard analyses, there is a difference of only ∼25% between the cell lines with the highest [H1(C36S)+H2] and the lowest [H1+H2(C54S/C58S)] number of ASOR binding.3 The cell surface ASOR-binding capacities of nonpermeabilized cells were also similar among all cell lines (TableI). Roughly 75% of the total ASOR binding was intracellular. All three palmitoylation-defective ASGP-R cell lines expressed levels of H1 and H2 subunits similar to cells expressing wild-type ASGP-Rs, as determined by the amount of subunit-specific 125I-IgG binding (Table I). We conclude that the Cys-to-Ser mutations in the H1 and H2 cytoplasmic domains have no effect on ASGP-R ligand binding activity or the distribution of active intracellular and cell surface receptors.Table ICellular distribution of 125I-ASOR binding sites and total cellular content of ASGP-R subunitsASGP-R type125I-ASOR binding125I-IgG bindingSurfaceTotalAnti-H1Anti-H2fmol/106cellsdpm/103 cellsH1 + H217.3 ± 0.363.0 ± 3.933.5 ± 11.375.4 ± 3.8H1(C36S) + H2(C54S/C58S)12.7 ± 1.856.7 ± 1.230.2 ± 8.982.0 ± 19.5H1(C36S) + H218.2 ± 3.666.1 ± 0.932.0 ± 1.584.1 ± 15.4H1 + H2(C54S/C58S)12.1 ± 0.347.6 ± 1.235.0 ± 5.463.0 ± 6.7The surface or total cellular specific 125I-ASOR binding capacities and the total cellular anti-H1 or anti-H2 125I-IgG binding in each of the stable cell lines were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The surface or total cellular specific 125I-ASOR binding capacities and the total cellular anti-H1 or anti-H2 125I-IgG binding in each of the stable cell lines were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rapid continuous uptake of ligand by a recycling receptor system requires an efficient process for dissociation of receptor-ligand complexes. Therefore, we examined the pH sensitivity of ASOR dissociation from the Cys-variant ASGP-Rs. The wild-type, partially palmitoylated and the palmitoylation-deficient ASGP-Rs showed similar profiles of ASOR dissociation as a function of decreasing pH (Fig. 2). Thus, the lack of palmitoylation did not significantly alter the sensitivity of the ASOR·ASGP-R complexes to pH. Using a proteinase K digestion method, we compared the rates of receptor subunit trafficking to the cell surface in cells expressing either the wild-type H1 and H2 subunits or their Cys-to-Ser variants (Fig.3). The abundance of total cellular H1 after proteinase K treatment was estimated by quantifying the ∼46-kDa mature H1 protein bands (solid arrows in Fig 3). The intracellular ∼41-kDa precursor polypeptides of H1 (38Geffen I. Wessels H.P. Roth J. Shia M.A. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2855-2861Google Scholar) remained unaffected by the protease digestion (open arrows), indicating that cells were intact during the experiment. Thus the decrease in the amount of the mature H1 observed at various times was due to degradation by the exogeneous protease of subunits recycling to the cell surface. When the amount of H1 remaining was quantified and compared with the amount recovered at time 0 (TableII), the rates of H1 and H1(C36S) degradation, and thus trafficking from the cell interior to the cell surface, were almost identical with an apparent half-life of ∼7 min. The apparent recycling rate of the wild-type H2 was also similar to that of H2(C54S/C58S), with a half-life of ∼7 min, when analyzed using the same protocol (not shown). These results indicate that the palmitoylation defect in the receptor subunits does not affect the rate at which H1 or H2 recycles between intracellular compartments and the cell surface.Table IIIntracellular trafficking of wild-type or nonpalmitoylated ASGP-R subunits to the cell surfaceSubunitTime (minutes)51015total protein remaining (% time-zero)H169.0 ± 5.726.0 ± 9.95.9 ± 1.6H1(C36S)57.0 ± 7.824.7 ± 15.96.8 ± 0.1The densities of the H1 bands from four experiments, performed as in Fig. 3, were quantified, and the percentage of H1 subunit loss at each time point, relative to the amount of H1 protein recovered at time 0 (100%), was determined.

Open table in a new tab The densities of the H1 bands from four experiments, performed as in Fig. 3, were quantified, and the percentage of H1 subunit loss at each time point, relative to the amount of H1 protein recovered at time 0 (100%), was determined. Results are the mean ± S.D. (n = 4). We next determined the rates of 125I-ASOR uptake in cell lines expressing wild-type or palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs. Cells expressing palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs internalized ASOR at a reduced rate compared with cells expressing the wild-type ASGP-R (Fig.4 A). This result suggests that abolishing palmitoylation of the ASGP-R inhibited the rate of receptor internalization and ligand accumulation. In control experiments, specific uptake of ASOR was undetectable in SK-Hep-1 cells transfected with the backbone plasmids or in cells transfected with H1 cDNA alone (not shown). The rates of ASOR uptake in both of these control cell lines were comparable to the nonspecific uptake in cells transfected with both ASGP-R subunits. We also determined the rates of 125I-ASOR degradation in these stable cell lines (Fig. 4 B). Wild-type ASGP-Rs mediated the specific degradation of ASOR at a rate at least 7-fold faster than that of the nonpalmitoylated ASGP-Rs, which was only marginally above the nonspecific rate of ASOR degradation. The overall specific ligand processing ability of cells expressing palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs was ∼50% compared with cells expressing wild-type ASGP-Rs (Fig. 4 C). The above results indicate that although cells expressing nonpalmitoylated ASGP-R are able to endocytose ASOR, they are defective in their ability to degrade the internalized ligands. In addition, cells expressing partially palmitoylation-defective ASGP-Rs, in which only H1 or H2 is not palmitoylated, showed essentially the same rates of ASOR uptake and degradation as cells expressing the completely nonpalmitoylated ASGP-Rs.3 The differences in the rates of ASOR uptake and degradation in these stable cell lines could be explained by a general defect in the coated pit endocytic pathway in an individual cell line. To test this possibility, we measured the endogenous rate of transferrin uptake and its sensitivity to hyperosmolarity as a control (Fig. 5). The rates of transferrin uptake were essen"

The regulated pathways include the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity and N-type and l-type Ca2+ channels and the activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels. The activation of these opioid receptors also increases phospholipase C activity and causes a transient increase in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),1 ERK1, and ERK2–2 (9Smart D.

Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The genetic basis underlying the ontogenesis of KOR gene has been revealed in transgenic animal models in our laboratory (17Hu X. Cao S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The mouse gene contains four exons and utilizes two promoters. A total of three KOR mRNA isoforms designated as a, b, and c can be generated (18Wei L.-N., Hu, X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported the activities of dual promoters of mouse KOR gene in the P19 cell line (19Lu S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated the up-regulation of the endogenous KOR mRNA by depleting vitamin A in developing animals and the down-regulation of KOR mRNA in differentiating P19 cells treated with retinoic acid (RA) for 2 days or longer. This is mediated by a negative regulatory element, which contains an Ikaros binding site within intron I (promoter II) of the KOR gene (20Bi J., Hu, X. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1590-1599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hu X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4597-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a short term (within 24 h) treatment with RA induces KOR expression in P19. We now report the mechanism mediating the early inducing effect of RA on KOR gene expression in P19 cells. We first identified a cis-acting element containing a putative Sp1 binding site (GC box) in the promoter I of the mouse KOR gene. We then demonstrated that Sp1 could bind to this GC box, and the hypophosphorylation of Sp1 enhanced its DNA binding affinity to this element. The inhibition of ERKs pathway enhanced RA induction of this promoter activity, whereas the phosphatase inhibitor suppressed RA induction of this promoter. These results demonstrated that RA-induced KOR gene expression could be mediated by the enhanced binding of Sp1 to this promoter, a consequence of hypophosphorylation of Sp1 by blocking the ERK pathway. Luciferase fusion plasmids were constructed by inserting various upstream regulatory sequences into a promoterless and enhancerless luciferase vector pGL3B (Promega, Madison, WI). The K45 and K19 plasmids were constructed as described previously (21Hu X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4597-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). K45 contains a KOR-genomic fragment of 1320 bp from the BamHI site to the ATG codon. K19 was a truncation of K45 that contains a 904-bp KOR-genomic fragment fromBamHI site to the end of exon I. Kd36, Kd37, and Kd38 constructs were generated by restriction digestion of the KOR promoter and ligation into pGL3B. Kd40 was prepared by PCR with the upstream primer bearing a NheI site and the downstream primer bearing a HindIII site. The PCR product was subcloned intoNheI and HindIII sites of the pGL3B vector, and the correct clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Kd39 was prepared by PCR amplification of the KOR promoter fragment (bases −1019 to −883) and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. This clone was then digested with SphI and SalI and subsequently subcloned into SphI and SalI sites of the thymidine kinase promoter. Clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. P19 cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 7.5% heat-inactivated calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RA was added at the concentration of 1 μm in ethanol. RNA was isolated from P19 cells using a TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) as described previously (18Wei L.-N., Hu, X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar), and endogenous KOR mRNA isoforms were detected with an established RT-PCR protocol (18Wei L.-N., Hu, X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar). Actin-specific primers were included for internal control in each RT-PCR. P19 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (22Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter (0.5 μg) and a β-galactosidase, LacZ, internal control (0.2 μg) were used in each transfection. Cells were harvested, and luciferase reporter activity was measured. Luciferase activity was normalized to the LacZ internal control and presented as relative luciferase units as described previously (22Lee C.-H. Chinpaisal C. Wei L.-N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6745-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). P19 cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min) and washed in low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell pellet was resuspended in the same low salt buffer supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 15 min. The nuclei were extracted with high salt buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10% glycerol), incubated on ice for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were then collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 30 min) and stored at −80 °C. EMSA was carried out by using the double-stranded oligonucleotide designated as L204 (5′-GCATCAGACCGCCCGCCAGG-3′) end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. This probe was incubated with nuclear extract in EMSA buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg poly(dI·dC) for 30 min at 4 °C. For competition analysis, a 100-fold molar excess of cold probe was also added. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels followed by Phosphor- Imager analysis. For the antibody supershift assay, 1 μl of Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and nuclear extract were allowed to react at 4 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of L204-labeled probe for 30 min at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing confluent P19 cells in CytoBusyer protein extraction reagent (Novagen). Protein concentration was determined with a Bradford assay. 60 μg of whole cell extract or nuclear extract was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were then probed with Sp1 polyclonal antibody (sc-59-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:1000), and bound antibody was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). P19 nuclear extracts were prepared as described above with the addition of 10 mmsodium fluoride and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate to the final resuspension buffer. 10 μg of nuclear extract (20 μl of total reaction volume) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in 1× phosphatase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture solution) with 40 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega). After phosphatase treatment, 10 μl of 5× EMSA buffer was added, and the sample was analyzed for L204 probe binding. P19 cells were treated with RA, PD98059, or vehicle for 20 h. Whole cell lysate was prepared after formaldehyde cross-linking as described previously (21Hu X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4597-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.125m glycine. One-tenth diluted lysate was used for input, and the residual lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C using 2 μg of antibody against Sp1 (Upstate Biotechnology) or preimmune rabbit serum (Pierce). Following the reverse cross-linking step, DNA was precipitated following phenol/chloroform extraction and dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). PCR reactions contained 2 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin sample with primer spanning the KOR promoter region containing the GC box, i.e.5′-GATGCACAGTAGCTTTCC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCCTGGCGGGCGGTCTG-3′ in 25 μl of total volume. After 27–30 cycles of amplification, 8 μl of PCR product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Previously, we showed that RA was a potent suppressor of KOR gene expression in P19 cells after a long term treatment (3–5 days), and the negative regulatory sequence of the KOR was located in an element of intron I of this gene (20Bi J., Hu, X. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1590-1599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hu X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4597-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In an attempt to examine KOR gene expression after a short term treatment with RA, we used an established RT-PCR procedure (18Wei L.-N., Hu, X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar) to detect the expression of specific KOR mRNA. We found that all three of the KOR mRNA isoforms, A, B, and C, were induced by RA within 24 h in P19 cells (Fig. 1,A and B). Actin expression remained constant during the time of examination as also shown in our previous study of KOR expression in P19 cells (20Bi J., Hu, X. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1590-1599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the induction of KOR messages by RA was statistically significant (*, p < 0.001; **, p = 0.006). To first determine which promoter of the KOR gene mediated the inducing effect of RA on KOR expression, we constructed two luciferase reporters under the control of two different segments from the mouse KOR gene promoter (Fig.1 C). K45 contained both the promoters I and II, and K19 contained only promoter I. It appeared that RA was able to induce the reporter expression from both reporters within 24 h (Fig.1 C), suggesting that promoter I contained the required sequence for RA induction of this gene expression in P19 cells. To further dissect the regulatory elements responsible for RA induction of KOR gene in P19 cells, serial deletion analyses were performed for various portions of promoter I. Reporter constructs of promoter I and its deletions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and designated as K19, Kd36, Kd37, Kd38, Kd39, and Kd40, respectively (Fig.2 A). The promoter activity of each construct was tested in P19 cells. Because the fragment between −1019 and −883 is devoid of promoter sequence, a thymidine kinase promoter was used as the basal promoter in the construct Kd39. As shown in Fig. 2 B, four reporters (K19, Kd36, Kd38, and Kd40) that retained the sequence between −903 and −743 were induced within 24 h of RA treatment, whereas the reporters deleted in this sequence (Kd37 and Kd39) were apparently defected in RA induction. A detailed examination of the 160-bp sequence revealed a GC box (CCCGCC) located between positions −761 and −755, which is a putative binding site for transcription factor Sp1 family (23Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 24Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Therefore, the RA induction of the KOR gene was mediated by a DNA sequence containing a putative Sp1 binding site of promoter I. It was interesting that Kd37 appeared to be moderately induced by RA despite the lack of Sp1 binding site. However, it was noted that a putative nuclear factor-interleukin 6 element is present in this sequence, which might contribute to the moderate effect of RA on this reporter. To determine whether RA induction mediated by the GC box containing segment (−903/−743) correlated with Sp1 binding to this GC box, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from P19 cells. The oligonucleotide L204 containing the putative binding site for Sp1 was used as the probe. As shown in Fig.3 A, nuclear extracts from untreated and RA-treated cells produced two major DNA-protein complexes. The formation of the larger complex, the Sp1·DNA complex, was greatly enhanced in the reactions using nuclear extracts from RA-treated P19 cells (lanes 2, 6, and 10). Complex formation was specifically competed out by unlabeled wild-type L204 probe (lanes 3 and4) but was not affected by the same amount of L204 mutant oligonucleotide (lanes 7 and 8). Three sets of experiments were conducted, and one representative set was presented here. A supershift experiment was performed to establish the band representing Sp1·DNA complex. As shown in Fig. 3 A,lanes 9–12, the slower migrating protein-DNA complex was retarded by anti-Sp1 antibody and yielded a new complex with a slower electrophoretic mobility (lanes 11and 12). The signal of the supershifted Sp1·DNA complex was also stronger in reactions using RA-treated P19 extract as compared with that using the untreated P19 extract, further supporting that either Sp1 expression or its DNA binding affinity was increased in RA-treated cells. Interestingly, the faster migrating complex was also competed out but failed to be supershifted by anti-Sp1, supporting the nonspecific nature of this complex. To examine the in vivo Sp1 binding, P19 cells were treated with 1 μm RA or 0.01% ethanol and cross-linked with formaldehyde for chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin co-precipitated with anti-Sp1 antibody was amplified with PCR using primers spanning ∼300 bp, which included this Sp1 binding site. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Sp1 bound to the KOR promoter I in control P19 (lane 5), and the binding was greatly increased in RA-treated cells (lane 6), which was further enhanced by a MEK inhibitor PD98059, consistent with the results of gel shift assays shown in Fig. 3 A and in Fig.5 B. Because DNA protein interactions were found in both RA-treated and untreated cells, we were interested in determining the expression level of Sp1 in RA-treated and control P19 cells. Western blot analysis using Sp1 antibody revealed that P19 cells expressed nearly the same amount of Sp1 in both control and RA-treated cultures (Fig. 4). This result suggested that an increase in the binding affinity, rather than the level of Sp1 expression, probably accounted for the increased Sp1·DNA complexes in RA-treated P19 cells. A role of phosphorylation in post-translational modification of Sp1 and its DNA binding activity has been described previously (25Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Alroy I. Soussan L. Seger R. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphorylation status of Sp1 was related to its binding ability to this GC box of KOR gene in P19 cells, P19 cell extract was incubated in the absence or presence of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and then subjected to EMSAs. As shown in Fig.5 A, Sp1 binding activity was increased by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase treatment (lanes 3 and 4), which was blocked by incubating the reaction with 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate (NaPi) (lanes 5 and 6), a general phosphatase inhibitor. The complete blockage of DNA·Sp1 complex formation by NaPi (lanes 5 and 6) suggested that phosphorylation probably still occurred in prepared nuclear extract. In the presence of NaPi, the equilibrium of Sp1 phosphorylation could be shifted toward hyperphosphorylation; thus DNA binding was completely inhibited. We have also observed an inhibition of Sp1 binding to DNA in the presence of NaPi alone (data not shown), which was inconsistent with results shown here. To extend this finding to an in vivo situation, a MAPK inhibitor, PD98059, was used to treat cells prior to the preparation of nuclear extracts for gel shift as shown in Fig. 5 B. It is obvious that RA induced the Sp1·DNA complex formation (compare lanes 1and 2), which was further enhanced by PD98059 (comparelanes 2 and 3). The effect of PD98059 was readily detectable within 30 min (lane 5) as compared with untreated cells (lane 4) and even more dramatic in longer treatment (lane 6 for 8 h and lane 7for 24 h). To confirm that dephosphorylation of Sp1 affected KOR expression, the GC box containing reporter Kd38 was used to transfect P19 cells in the presence of sodium pyrophosphate for 4 h with or without RA. A dramatic decrease in RA induction was observed in NaPi-treated cells (Fig. 5 C). Western blot analysis using Sp1 antibody showed no marked difference in the amount of Sp1 expressed in RA-treated and control P19, analyzed for both whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts. Furthermore, NaPi had no effects on Sp1 protein levels (Fig. 5 D). These results suggested that hypophosphorylation of Sp1 enhanced Sp1 binding to the GC box of the KOR promoter, which resulted in enhanced KOR gene expression. RA induction of KOR gene in P19 was correlated with the decrease in Sp1 phosphorylation. Sp1 has been recognized as one target of the transcription factors phosphorylated by protein kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and MAPKs (27Merchant J.L., Du, M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26277-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We have shown that hypophosphorylation of Sp1 contributed to its enhanced ability to bind to the KOR promoter. To examine which kinase pathways could be involved in the RA induction of KOR in P19, we used various inhibitors for different kinases to treat P19 cells transfected with KOR reporter Kd38 for either control or RA-treated cultures. Transfected cells were induced with RA for 24 h followed by an incubation with different concentrations of PKA and PKC inhibitors (H7, chelerythine chloride, and calphostin C) and two inhibitors of the MAPK pathway (the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190) for 30 min. It appeared that only PD98059 enhanced RA stimulation of this reporter as shown in Fig.6 A. The negative results of other kinase inhibitors were not shown. Furthermore, this reporter was up-regulated by PD98059 without RA treatment, and the enhancing effect of PD98059 was time-dependent (Fig. 6 B). These results revealed that hypophosphorylation of Sp1 by blocking the ERK signaling pathway up-regulated the KOR gene activity and that RA induction of the KOR gene involved such a blockage of this signaling pathway in P19 cells. We have previously reported that the repression of the mouse KOR gene by RA treatment for a long duration in P19 cells was mediated by an Ikaros binding site located within intron I of this gene. The repression was attributed to the later induction of Ikaros protein by RA in P19 (20Bi J., Hu, X. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1590-1599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hu X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4597-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This study was conducted to investigate the early effect of RA treatment on KOR gene expression in P19 and to examine the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. RA induced all three mRNA isoforms of the mouse KOR gene in P19, and promoter I was responsible for this positive regulation of RA within 24 h. Based on the deletion analyses, it was concluded that a cis-acting element containing a GC box in promoter I of the mouse KOR was crucial for its induction by RA. Sp1 was shown to bind to this GC box, and its DNA binding ability was greatly increased in RA-treated P19 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). However, Sp1 protein expression was not affected by RA in P19 cells after 24 h treatment as shown in Western blot analyses (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the enhanced binding of Sp1 to KOR promoter I after RA treatment was because of its hypophosphorylation. Several studies have indicated that the phosphorylation of Sp1 enhance its DNA binding activity (31Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lee Y.-I. Lee S. Lee Y. Bong Y.S. Hyun S.W. Yoo Y.D. Kim S.J. Kim Y.W. Poo H.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2367-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Zhu et al. (33Zhu Q. Lioa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) reported that the dephosphorylation of Sp1 increased its binding to the Sp1-like cis-motif in the adipocyte amino acid transporter gene promoter in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Our results provided evidence that increased Sp1 binding to the KOR promoter could also involve its dephosphorylation in P19 cells as nuclear extract treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase significantly increased the binding affinity of Sp1 to this GC box (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the kinase pathways responsible for modification of Sp1 was probably related to the ERKs as the induction was enhanced by PD98059 (Figs. 3 B and 5 B). Sp1 is a target of the MAPK pathway (27Merchant J.L., Du, M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 29Park S.K. Lee J.-H. Shin J.-H. Lee Y.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and MAPK is central to a signal transduction pathway that triggers cell proliferation or differentiation. The activation of ERKs through phosphorylation results in their translocation into the nucleus where they can phosphorylate distinct transcription factors (34Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 1921-1933Crossref Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 35Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). These kinases can be inactivated by a family of dual specificity tyrosine phosphatases such as the MAPK phosphatase and the protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (36Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 37Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1275-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The fact that ERK signaling pathway could be involved in the early inducing effect of RA on KOR promoter correlates well with the biological effects of ERK pathways in cell differentiation. It is possible that RA increased either one of the protein phosphatases, thereby dephosphorylating Sp1 in P19 cells. Alternatively, RA could inhibit ERK activity and somehow shift the balance of phosphorylationversus dephosphorylation of Sp1 toward its hypophosphorylated state. This remains to be examined experimentally. An interesting construct Kd37, which lacks this Sp1 site, was slightly induced by RA. It was noted that a putative nuclear factor-interleukin 6 element was present in this sequence. Further experiments are needed to evaluate its potential interaction with the RA signaling pathway in KOR gene regulation. This is the first report showing that the opioid receptor gene expression in P19 cells can be up-regulated by RA treatment Thus, RA obviously can exert a biphasic effect on the expression of this opioid receptor gene. The early effect (within 24 h) of RA on the mouse KOR gene expression in P19 is an induction, which is mediated through a GC box containing the regulatory sequence of promoter I of this gene. Enhanced binding of Sp1 to this GC box is attributed to its hypophosphorylation, which involves a blockage of ERK signaling pathway in P19 cells. The late effect (2–3 days) of RA is a repression (21Hu X., Bi, J. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4597-4603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is mediated by the recruitment of histone deacetylases through the induced Ikaros transcription factor, to promoter II (the intron I) of this gene. It is very interesting that promoter I of the KOR gene plays a role in its up-regulation, whereas promoter II (intron I) plays a role in its down-regulation. P19 cells have been used as a model system to examine neuronal gene expression and regulation by various hormones and cytokines. It is clear that opioid receptor gene expression, at least for the KOR gene, is highly sensitive to a disturbance in hormonal homeostasis in animals (17Hu X. Cao S. Loh H.H. Wei L.-N. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The study of KOR gene regulation by RA in P19 cells represents one of our goals to dissect the hormonal regulatory events and pathways for KOR gene expression. It is tempting to speculate that the biphasic response of the KOR gene to RA may underlie the unique expression pattern of this gene as seen in transgenic mice. It will also be interesting to examine how the ERK signaling pathway may play a role in the integration of hormonal signals to the regulation of this particular family of neural genes.

They are present in a wide variety of organisms including plants, mammals, and parasitic protozoa. Giardia lamblia, the causative agent of giardiasis, lacks de novo purine biosynthesis and relies primarily on adenine and guanine phosphoribosyltransferases (APRTase and GPRTase) constituting two independent and essential purine salvage pathways. The APRTase from G. lamblia was cloned and expressed with a 6-His tag at its C terminus and purified to apparent homogeneity. Adenine and α-d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) haveK m values of 4.2 and 143 μm with ak cat of 2.8 s−1 in the forward reaction, whereas AMP and PPi have K mvalues of 87 and 450 μm with ak cat of 9.5 × 10−3s−1 in the reverse reaction. Product inhibition studies indicated that the forward reaction follows a random Bi Bi mechanism. Results from the kinetics of equilibrium isotope exchange further verified a random Bi Bi mechanism in the forward reaction. In a mutant enzyme, F25W, with kinetic constants similar to those of the wild type and a tryptophan residue at the adenine binding site, the addition of adenine or AMP to the free mutant enzyme resulted in fluorescence quenching, whereas PRPP caused fluorescence enhancement. The dissociation constants thus estimated are 16.5 μm for adenine, 14.3 μm for AMP, and 83.0 μm for PRPP. PPi exerted no detectable effect on the tryptophan fluorescence at all, suggesting a lack of PPibinding to the free enzyme. An ordered substrate binding in the reverse reaction with AMP bound first followed by PPi is thus postulated."

Using a different isozyme, we have placed histidine residues in HCA III at positions 64 and 67 and in another mutant at positions 64 and 7. Each of these histidine residues can act as a proton transfer group in catalysis when it is the only nonliganding histidine in the active site cavity, except His7 in HCA III.

The crystal structure of Y7H HCA II, which contains both His7 and His64 within the active site cavity, shows the conformation of the side chain of His64 moved from its position in the wild type and hydrogen-bonded through an intervening water molecule with the side chain of His7.

This suggests a cause of decreased proton transfer in catalysis. human carbonic anhydrase The carbonic anhydrases in the α class include the mammalian isozymes and are all zinc-containing monomeric enzymes, generally with molecular masses near 30 kDa. These isozymes of carbonic anhydrase catalyze the dehydration/hydration of HCO 3−/CO2 by a two-stage or ping-pong mechanism in which the first step (Equation 1) is the reaction of bicarbonate with the enzyme containing zinc-bound water resulting in the formation of CO2 and leaving zinc-bound hydroxide at the active site (1Christianson D.W.

BH+ represents a proton donor that is a residue of the enzyme itself or buffer in solution. In the carbonic anhydrases, the maximal velocities of catalysis and the rates of exchange of 18O between CO2 and water are limited by the intramolecular proton transfers indicated in Equation 2. This was initially determined by observation of a solvent deuterium isotope effect of 3.8 on k cat for hydration catalyzed by human carbonic anhydrase (HCA)1 II, among the most efficient isozymes in the α class of carbonic anhydrases (3Steiner H.

Moreover, the range of rate constants for proton transfer is rather large, from 103s−1 for isozyme III to 106 s−1for intramolecular proton transfer in HCA II. Recent discussion has focused on the features of the enzyme that influence this rate of intramolecular proton transfer and why it cannot be made faster (11Lu D. Voth G.A. J. Am. Chem.

To investigate this possibility we have constructed mutants of HCA II and HCA III each containing two histidine residues; each histidine residue, with one exception, acts as a proton shuttle in the absence of the second. We first comment on the proton transfer capacity of histidine residues at single sites in carbonic anhydrase and then discuss the data with two histidine residues in the cavity.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have two histidine residues in the active site of HCA II at residues 7 and 64. Using a different isozyme, we have placed two histidine residues in HCA III at residues 64 and 67 and, in a different experiment, at residues 64 and 7. Each of these histidine residues can act as a proton transfer group when it is the only nonliganding histidine in the active site cavity, except His7 in HCA III. We investigate the properties in catalysis by variants of carbonic anhydrase with two proton shuttle sites within the active site cavity and along the proton transfer pathway extending from the zinc-bound solvent molecule to solution.Human Carbonic Anhydrase IIWe have presented evidence in Table III and Fig. 1 that His7 in HCA II can act as a proton donor to the zinc-bound hydroxide during catalysis. The rate constant for this intramolecular proton transferk B is described by Equation 6. The maximum value of k B for Y7H/H64A HCA II from Fig. 1 is near 120 ms−1 (Table III), which means that His7 in Y7H/H64A HCA II appears to be only about 15% as efficient in proton transfer as His64 in wild type HCA II, for whichk B is 800 ms−1 (Table III). Tyr7 in HCA II has its phenolic hydroxyl 7 Å from the zinc and extends into the active site cavity; moreover, the hydroxyl of Tyr7 participates in hydrogen bonding with the water structure in the active site that also forms hydrogen bonds with the zinc-bound water (9Eriksson A.E. Jones T.A. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Hence, this residue is placed within the active site cavity such that proton transfer involving His7 is readily explained. The replacement of Tyr7 in HCA II by Phe resulted in marginally reduced activity, indicating that Tyr7 does not have a significant role in proton transfer (33Liang Z. Xue Y. Jonsson B.-H. Lindskog S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), probably a result of its basic pK a. His7 occurs naturally in murine carbonic anhydrase V and has no significant proton transfer role in catalysis (34Heck R.W. Tanhauser S.M. Manda R., Tu, C.K. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24742-24746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We used a double mutant cycle (35Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) to compare our estimates of the rate constants for proton transfer k B for catalysis by the mutants of HCA II containing both His7 and His64. His7 and His64 in Y7H HCA II have an antagonistic interaction when values ofk B and the changes in free energy calculated from them are compared (Fig.4 a). In Fig. 4 a we consider two single mutations, each of which introduces a proton shuttle in the enzyme. These alter the activation barriers to catalysis, described by ΔG1 and ΔG2 when acting separately (ΔG = −RTln[k B (mutant2)/k B (mutant1)). The change in the activation barrier for the double mutant is ΔG 1+2. The value of ΔG 1+2 in Fig. 4 a for Y7H HCA II (−1.4 kcal/mol) is greater than ΔG 1 for the variant resulting in the most change (−2.6 kcal/mol). This is an antagonism in the classification of double mutant interactions as described by Mildvan et al. (Ref. 36Mildvan A.S. Weber D.J. Kuliopulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar; however, because we have observed increases in enzyme activity, the signs of the changes in free energy barriers ΔG corresponding to antagonistic and synergistic interactions are reversed compared with the notation of Mildvan et al.). That is, in the presence of His7 the proton shuttle efficiency of His64 is reduced.The crystal structure of Y7H HCA II suggests the source of this result. It may arise from a hydrogen bonding interaction between the nearby residues His7 and His64 that hinders the mobility of the side chains; that is, both His7 and His64 are hydrogen-bonded to water molecule 305 shown in Fig. 2 B. The orientation of the side chain of His64 is considerably altered in this structure of Y7H HCA II compared with wild type (Fig. 2 A). One of the suggested requirements of a functional proton shuttle is flexibility of its side chain (37Jude K.M. Wright K., Tu, C.K. Silverman D.N. Viola R.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); comparison of these structures shows that the mobility of His64 may be altered in such a manner that a new predominant conformation has the side chain of His64 in a position not effective for proton transfer. Another possibility is that His7 alters the hydrogen-bonded water network in the active site cavity and thereby reduces proton transfer rates, in a manner found by Jackman et al. (38Jackman J.E. Merz K.M. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16421-16428Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for variants of human carbonic anhydrase II containing replacements of Ala65.Human Carbonic Anhydrase IIIHCA III is unique among the α class of carbonic anhydrases because it has the lowest catalytic activity in the hydration/dehydration of CO2/HCO 3−. It has a catalytic turnover in the hydration of CO2 k cat, which is about 10 ms−1 at its greatest (4Jewell D.A., Tu, C.K. Paranawithana S.R. Tanhauser S.M. LoGrasso P.V. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), smaller by at least a factor of 10 when compared with the other carbonic anhydrases in this class. One reason for this smaller catalytic turnover for carbonic anhydrase III is that it lacks a proton shuttle residue in the active site. HCA III has Lys64, which does not function as an efficient proton shuttle (4Jewell D.A., Tu, C.K. Paranawithana S.R. Tanhauser S.M. LoGrasso P.V. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Silverman D.N., Tu., C.K. Chen X. Tanhauser S.M. Kresge A.J. Laipis P.J.

Genet. 1993; 16: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), rat (40Mallis R.J. Poland B.W. Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. Darmawan S. Honzatko R.B. Thomas J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and human (41Duda D.M. Yoshioka C. Govindasamy L., An, H., Tu, C.K. Silverman D.N. McKenna R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) carbonic anhydrase III are very similar to that of HCA II with root mean square deviations of less than 1 Å, with the similarity strong especially in the active site region (39Eriksson A.E. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of HCA III has been enhanced by replacements of Lys64 with His (4Jewell D.A., Tu, C.K. Paranawithana S.R. Tanhauser S.M. LoGrasso P.V. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and Arg67 with His (29Ren X., Tu, C.K. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8492-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); in both cases there was convincing evidence that the newly introduced His was functioning as a proton shuttle (Table IV). These residues are located in the active site cleft with their α carbons both about 9.5 Å from the zinc. Both side chains Lys64 and Arg67 extend into the active site cavity and have few interactions with other residues in the crystal structures of carbonic anhydrase III.Catalysis of 18O exchange by the double mutant K64H/R67H HCA III is dominated by a proton donor group or groups of pK a near 7.3 and a proton acceptor group, the zinc-bound hydroxide, the conjugate acid of which has a pK a value near 5.1 (Fig. 3 and Table IV). There is little evidence from the 18O exchange data for a significant donor group with pK a near 5.6 in K64H/R67H, even though such a group was observed in the single mutant R67H (Fig. 3 and Table IV). It is not surprising that the double mutant has values of pK a that are altered for His64 and His67; it is not possible with these data to determine which histidine side chain is predominant in proton transfer or whether both contribute. Our best estimates of the rate constants for intramolecular proton transfer k Bfrom proton shuttles to the zinc-bound hydroxide (Equation 6) show a considerably larger value for the single mutant R67H than for either K64H or K64H/R67H (TableIV). 2This is probably related, at least in part, to the value of ΔpK a between the acceptor and donor groups, which is close to 0 for R67H. Proton donation from His67 to the zinc-bound hydroxide has less of a thermodynamic barrier than for His in K64H or K64H/R67H (TableIV). Fig. 4 bshows an antagonistic interaction between His64 and His67 in proton transfer.It is notable that over a considerable range of pH in Fig. 3, the rate of release from the enzyme of H218O (R H2O/[E] of Fig. 3) for the double mutant K64H/R67H HCA III is greater than those of either of the corresponding single mutants. Two factors contribute to this result. First, the donor group in K64H/R67H has a pK a that is more basic (pK a 7.3) than the donor group in R67H (pK a 5.6). This broadens the pH profile ofR H2O/[E] for K64H/R67H in comparison with that of R67H. Second, the rate constant for proton transferk B is about 2-fold greater for K64H/R67H than for K64H (Table IV).Unlike the insertion of histidine at residue 7 in H64A HCA II, the insertion of histidine in HCA III does not show convincing evidence supporting proton transfer. The most significant effect of the replacement Tyr7 to His in HCA III appears to be a substantial increase in the pK a of the zinc-bound water molecule from 5.3 to near 6.7 (Table IV). There was no comparable shift in pK a with this replacement in HCA II (TableIII). This certainly is a clue to the different active site environments of carbonic anhydrase II and III, although the distance from the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr7 to the zinc is nearly identical at 7 Å in each (9Eriksson A.E. Jones T.A. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 39Eriksson A.E. Liljas A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There is a small increase ink B, the rate constant for proton donation to the zinc-bound hydroxide, in Y7H HCA III compared with wild type (TableIV), but this may result from the increased basicity of the zinc-bound water in Y7H compared with wild type rather than to introduction of a new proton shuttle residue. It is not surprising then to find that the changes made in k B by introduction of His7, which is probably not a proton shuttle in HCA III, and His64, which is a proton shuttle in mutants of HCA III (4Jewell D.A., Tu, C.K. Paranawithana S.R. Tanhauser S.M. LoGrasso P.V. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Silverman D.N., Tu., C.K. Chen X. Tanhauser S.M. Kresge A.J. Laipis P.J. Biochemisty. 1993; 32: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), are simply additive (Fig. 4 c). That is, the replacement of Tyr7 by His alters the pK a of the zinc-bound water by a mechanism that is separate and independent of the proton transfer steps involving His64.We have repeated these experiments using a mutant containing the replacement Phe198 → Leu. Leu198 is found in the most efficient carbonic anhydrases including HCA II, and the replacement of Phe198 with Leu in HCA III enhances its catalytic activity and makes it more like carbonic anhydrase II (TableIV and Ref. 42LoGrasso P.V., Tu, C.K. Jewell D.A. Wynns G.C. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8463-8470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mutant Y7H/F198L HCA III is 10-fold greater than wild type (3-fold greater than F198L) in the rate constant for proton transfer k B (Table IV), and we conclude that His7 in Y7H/F198L HCA III is functioning as a proton shuttle. (It is noted here thatk cat/K m for this double mutant is also considerably increased, as shown in Table IV.) It is interesting to note that when these two replacements, Tyr7to His and Lys64 to His, are made in the mutant also containing Leu198, then the double mutant cycle (Fig.4 d) shows a partially additive interaction between sites 7 and 64: ΔG 1 > ΔG 1+2> ΔG 1 + ΔG 2(36Mildvan A.S. Weber D.J. Kuliopulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).ConclusionsIn two separate cases, the insertion of two proton donor groups in the active site cavity of carbonic anhydrase (His7 and His64 in HCA II and His64and His67 in HCA III) results in an antagonistic interaction in intramolecular proton transfer with respect to the corresponding single mutants. The crystal structure of Y7H HCA II suggests interactions that orient the proton donating side chain of His64 away from the active site and possibly restricts the mobility of the side chain of His64 and/or alters the water structure through which proton transfer proceeds. Although there is a formal antagonism in rate constants for proton transfer caused by the presence of the proton shuttles in the active site of carbonic anhydrase, there is a kinetic advantage in specific ranges of pH for the mutant of HCA III containing two histidines. Moreover, these studies show that residue 7 is a site from which efficient proton transfer can occur; His7 in the double mutant Y7H/H64A HCA II transfers protons at a rate of 120 ms−1. Hence, these studies show no significant advantage in catalysis and mostly a suppression of proton transfer when two histidine residues are located within the active site cavity of carbonic anhydrase. It should be pointed out that the cases of two histidine residues we investigated are not positioned for a sequential proton transfer through a long channel but are located at sites roughly equidistant from their proton acceptor, the zinc-bound hydroxide. The carbonic anhydrases in the α class include the mammalian isozymes and are all zinc-containing monomeric enzymes, generally with molecular masses near 30 kDa. These isozymes of carbonic anhydrase catalyze the dehydration/hydration of HCO 3−/CO2 by a two-stage or ping-pong mechanism in which the first step (Equation 1) is the reaction of bicarbonate with the enzyme containing zinc-bound water resulting in the formation of CO2 and leaving zinc-bound hydroxide at the active site (1Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 331-339Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Lindskog S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). HCO3−+EZnH2O⇄CO2+EZnOH−+H2OEquation 1 EZnOH−+BH+⇄EZnH2O+BEquation 2 The second stage is the regeneration of the zinc-bound water through proton transfer (1Christianson D.W. Fierke C.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 331-339Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 2Lindskog S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). BH+ represents a proton donor that is a residue of the enzyme itself or buffer in solution. In the carbonic anhydrases, the maximal velocities of catalysis and the rates of exchange of 18O between CO2 and water are limited by the intramolecular proton transfers indicated in Equation 2. This was initially determined by observation of a solvent deuterium isotope effect of 3.8 on k cat for hydration catalyzed by human carbonic anhydrase (HCA)1 II, among the most efficient isozymes in the α class of carbonic anhydrases (3Steiner H. Jonsson B.-H. Lindskog S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The solvent hydrogen isotope effect was 2.4 for 18O exchange catalyzed by HCA III, the least efficient of the α class (4Jewell D.A., Tu, C.K. Paranawithana S.R. Tanhauser S.M. LoGrasso P.V. Laipis P.J. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subsequent results including pH profiles, buffer activation, and computer simulations for these isozymes support the rate-limiting nature of proton transfer in these isozymes (4Jewell D.A., Tu, C.K.

For this isozyme the predominant shuttle residue has been identified as His64 (3Steiner H. Jonsson B.-H. Lindskog S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 59: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 5Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Forsman C. Jonsson B.H. Lindskog S.

Genet. 1988; 4: 274-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The imidazole ring of His64 is about 7.5 Å from the zinc when this side chain is in the “in” conformation pointing toward the metal (8Nair S.K. Christianson D.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9455-9458Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This is too far for direct proton transfer to the zinc-bound hydroxide requiring proton transfer through intervening hydrogen-bonded water bridges.

Carbonic anhydrase is a good model system for investigating properties of proton transfer in a protein environment; in many cases we know the identity of the proton donor and acceptor, and the rate constant for proton transfer can be easily determined because it is often rate-determining in catalysis. Moreover, the range of rate constants for proton transfer is rather large, from 103s−1 for isozyme III to 106 s−1for intramolecular proton transfer in HCA II. Recent discussion has focused on the features of the enzyme that influence this rate of intramolecular proton transfer and why it cannot be made faster (11Lu D. Voth G.A. J. Am. Chem.

ATP binding to Kir6.2 induces channel closure, thus accounting for the inhibitory action of the nucleotide (11Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Google Scholar). SUR is a member of the ATP-binding cassette protein superfamily (7Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Google Scholar, 12Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzáles G. Herrera-Soza H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A.

A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Google Scholar), and for the sulfonylureas and the openers (12Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzáles G. Herrera-Soza H. Nguy K.

Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Google Scholar). SUR also is encoded by either one of two genes. SUR1, expressed in the pancreatic β-cell and predominantly in neurons, exhibits high affinity for the sulfonylureas and low affinity for the openers. SUR2 is expressed in the various muscle types and shows high affinity for the openers but lower affinity for the sulfonylureas (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar,15Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Google Scholar) (for reviews, see Refs. 5Gribble F.M. Reimann F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 333-339Google Scholar and 16Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 439-445Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the SUR2 mRNA leads to two isoforms, SUR2A and SUR2B, which differ only in the last carboxyl-terminal exon. SUR2A is expressed in skeletal and heart muscle; SUR2B is expressed in smooth muscle (17Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV J.P. Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Google Scholar, 18Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Google Scholar). The nucleotides not only gate the channel, they also profoundly affect the potency and efficacy of the synthetic KATP channel modulators by allosteric interactions. First, there is a positive allosteric interaction between nucleotide and opener binding, enabling SUR to bind openers with high affinity (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar, 15Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J.

Conversely, openers enhance the ATPase activity of SUR2A, thereby promoting channel activation (21Bienengraeber M. Alekseev A.E. Abraham M.R. Carrasco A.J. Moreau C. Vivaudou M. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1943-1952Google Scholar). Second, there is a negative allosteric interaction between nucleotide and sulfonylurea binding (22Schwanstecher M. Löser S. Rietze I. Panten U. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1991; 343: 83-89Google Scholar, 23Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 995-1004Google Scholar). Third, there is a negative allosteric coupling between opener and sulfonylurea binding, generally leading to mutually exclusive binding of the two ligands to SUR (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar, 15Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11689-11692Google Scholar). In varying the cyanoguanidine structure, Khan and colleagues (25Khan S.A. Higdon N.R. Hester J.B. Meisheri K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1207-1213Google Scholar) discovered that introduction of a phenyl ring in the side chain (Fig.1) gave compounds that potently reversed the vasodilation produced by various KATP channel openers but not that by other vasodilatory maneuvers; in addition, the inhibitory effect resided in one (i.e. the R-) enantiomer. It was concluded that the novel compounds acted as KATP channel blockers. The results of their study may be interpreted in two ways. First, the compounds may have acted as “neutral antagonists” (i.e.by displacing the opener from SUR without directly affecting channel activity); channel closure would then be induced by the high intracellular ATP concentrations in the vascular smooth muscle cell. Alternatively, the compounds may have acted as “inverse agonists” (i.e. they displaced the opener, and, similar to the sulfonylureas, their binding induced channel block also in the absence of ATP). In order to decide between these alternatives, the enantiomers of one such compound, PNU-94750 (Fig. 1), were examined in electrophysiological experiments using recombinant KATP channels. Since KATP channel openers and blockers (such as sulfonylureas) differ in their allosteric coupling to MgATP binding (see above), we also investigated the effect of MgATP on the binding of the enantiomers in radioligand binding assays. The study showed that the enantiomers of PNU-94750 differed in their coupling to MgATP binding and that the R-enantiomer (PNU-96293) was negatively coupled and inhibited KATP channels, whereas theS-enantiomer (PNU-96179) was positively coupled and was an opener. SUR2B(Y1206S) was constructed from murine SUR2B (GenBankTMD86038 (18Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Google Scholar)) as described (26Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Russ U. Lange U. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 190-199Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing glutamine and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamycin (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing the coding sequence of murine SUR2B, SUR2B(Y1206S), murine SUR2A (GenBankTMD86037 (18Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Google Scholar)), or rat SUR1 (GenBankTMX97279), and cell lines stably expressing these proteins were generated as described (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar). Cotransfection of SUR with murine Kir6.2 (D50581(17Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement IV J.P. Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Google Scholar)) was done transiently at a molar plasmid ratio of 1:1 using LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) as described previously (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar). In cotransfections prepared for electrophysiological experiments, the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), encoding for green fluorescent protein, was added for easy identification of transfected cells. 2–4 days after transfection, cells were used for binding studies and electrophysiological experiments. The patch-clamp technique was used in the inside-out, the cell-attached, and the whole-cell configuration as described by Hamill et al. (27Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were drawn from borosilicate glass capillaries (GC 150 or GC 150T; Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, UK) and heat-polished using a horizontal microelectrode puller (Zeitz, Augsburg, Germany). For experiments using inside-out patches, bath and pipette were filled with a high K+-Ringer solution containing 142 mmKCl, 2.8 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mmd-(+)-glucose; 10 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH at 22 °C. After filling with buffer, pipettes had a resistance of 1–1.5 megaohms. After excision of the patch, the pipette was moved in front of a pipe with a high K+-EGTA-Ringer solution containing 143 mm KCl, 0.85 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmEGTA, 11 mmd-(+)-glucose, 10 mmHEPES, titrated to pH 7.2 with NaOH at 22 °C. The PNU compounds and glibenclamide were dissolved in stock solutions as described under “Materials”; ATP was dissolved in buffer, and an appropriate amount of MgCl2 was added to keep free Mg2+ constant at 0.7 mm. Substances were applied to the patch via the pipe, and patches were clamped to −50 mV. For evaluation of the inhibition by PNU-96293, traces were individually corrected for run down. For experiments in the cell-attached configuration, bath and pipette were filled with the high K+-Ringer solution described above. After filling, the pipettes had a resistance of 1–1.5 megaohms. Patch experiments were performed at 37 °C, and patches were clamped at −50 mV. Experiments using the whole-cell configuration were performed as described by Russ et al. (28Russ U. Hambrock A. Artunc F. Löffler-Walz C. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 955-961Google Scholar). The bath solution was 142 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mmd-(+)-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH at 37 °C. Patch pipettes were filled with 132 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na2ATP, titrated to pH 7.2 with NaOH, and had a resistance of 3–5 megaohms. Isolated cells were chosen. After establishing the whole cell configuration, cells were clamped to −60 mV, and every 12.5 s, the following square pulse protocol was applied. After 1 s at −60 mV, cells were clamped to the test potential of −110 mV for 0.5 s and then, after 1 s at −60 mV, to the next test potential of −90 mV, etc. (seven steps increasing by 20 mV from −110 to 10 mV). At the end of the protocol, capacitance and series resistance were measured, and the latter was compensated by 70%. To show the time-dependent current at a specified voltage, data were averaged over the last 125 ms spent at that voltage during the cycle and spliced together to give a continuous curve. Data were recorded with an EPC 9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) using the “Pulse” software (HEKA). Signals were filtered at 200 Hz using the four-pole Bessel filter of the EPC9 amplifier and sampled with 1 kHz. For cells stably expressing SUR alone, the antibiotic was withdrawn from the culture medium 1 week prior to membrane preparation. Membranes were prepared as described (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. In equilibrium binding assays, membranes (final protein concentration 0.2–0.5 mg/ml) were added to the incubation buffer containing 139 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 2.2/1.2 mm MgCl2, 1/0.003 mmNa2ATP and supplemented with the radioligand ([3H]glibenclamide ∼2.5 nm or [3H]P1075 ∼2 nm) and the inhibitor of interest at 37 °C. In the Mg2+-free experiments, Mg2+ was omitted from the incubation solution, and EDTA (1 mm) was added. At equilibrium (15 min for [3H]glibenclamide and 30 min for [3H]P1075 binding), incubation was stopped by diluting 0.3-ml aliquots in triplicate into 8 ml of ice-cold quench solution (50 mmTris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, 154 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and rapid filtration under vacuum over Whatman GF/B filters (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). Filters were washed twice with 8 ml of ice-cold quench solution and counted for 3H in the presence of 6 ml of scintillant (Ultima Gold; Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). Nonspecific binding of [3H]P1075 was determined in the presence of 10 μm P1075, and that of [3H]glibenclamide was determined in the presence of 100 μm P1075 or 1 μm glibenclamide for SUR2B(Y1206S) and SUR1, respectively. For measurement of the dissociation kinetics, membranes were incubated with 2 nm [3H]P1075 in the presence of 2.2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmNa2ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. Dissociation was initiated by the addition of P1075 + PNU-96293 (10 μm each), and 300-μl aliquots were withdrawn at different times for filtration as described above. Experiments were conducted at 37 °C with an incubation time of 30 min as described previously (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar, 28Russ U. Hambrock A. Artunc F. Löffler-Walz C. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 955-961Google Scholar). Cells were suspended by rinsing with a HEPES-buffered physiological salt solution containing 139 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 11 mmd-(+)-glucose, 5 mm HEPES; gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2; and titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH at 37 °C. Binding experiments were started by the addition of cells (final concentration 1 × 106cells/ml, corresponding to 0.25 mg of protein/ml) to the buffer supplemented with ∼2 nm [3H]P1075 and the inhibitor of interest. After 30 min, incubation was stopped as described above, and aliquots were filtered over Whatman GF/C filters. Concentration dependencies were analyzed by fitting the logistic function y=100−A/(1+10n(px−pIC50))Equation 1 to the data. Here, A denotes the extent of the effect (amplitude); n (= nH) is the Hill coefficient, x is the concentration of the compound under study, and IC50 the midpoint of the curve withpx = −log x andpIC50 = −log IC50. In binding experiments, the dependence of the midpoint of an inhibition curve (IC50 value) on the concentration of the radioligand,L*, was calculated according to the equation by Cheng and Prusoff (30Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Google Scholar), IC50=Ki(1+L*/KL)Equation 2 where K i is the inhibition constant andK L is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand, L*. In general, this correction did not exceed a factor of 1.5. In cases when a homologous competition experiment (e.g. L* − L) was conducted in the presence of a fixed concentration of a further ligand,C, that also competed with the radioligand, Equation 2 was expanded to read as follows, IC50=KL(1+C/KC)+L*Equation 3 where K C is the equilibrium dissociation constant of competitor C. The homologous competition curves (in the absence and presence of competitor) may be transformed according to Scatchard (31Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar), B/F=IC50/(Bmax−B)Equation 4 where B and F represent the bound and free concentration of the unlabeled ligand, L. B (in percent) is calculated from the radioactive ligand specifically bound,B*, as B = 100 − B*. Fits of the equations to the data were performed according to the method of least squares using the program SigmaPlot 6.1 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Individual binding competition experiments were analyzed according to Equation 1. Errors in the parameters derived from the fit to a single curve were estimated using the univariate approximation (32Draper N.B. Smith H. Applied Regression Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 458-517Google Scholar). Amplitudes and pK values are normally distributed (33Christopoulos A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 351-357Google Scholar); here, K values with the 95% confidence interval in parentheses are given. Propagation of errors was taken into account according to Bevington (34Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1969: 56-64Google Scholar). PNU-96293 and PNU-96179 were synthesized according to Humphrey et al. (35Humphrey, S. J., Meisheri, K. D., Ludens, J. H., and Hester, J. B. (October 22, 1996) U.S. Patent US5567722.Google Scholar). [3H]P1075 (specific activity 4.5 TBq (118 Ci) mmol−1) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and [3H]glibenclamide (specific activity 1.85 TBq (50 Ci) mmol−1) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The reagents and media used for cell culture and transfection were from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). Na2ATP was from Roche Diagnostics, and glibenclamide was from Sigma. P1075 was a kind gift from Leo Pharmaceuticals (Ballerup, Denmark). KATP channel modulators were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/ethanol (1:1) and further diluted with the same solvent or with incubation buffer. In binding studies, the final solvent concentration in the assays was always below 0.3% (in electrophysiological experiments 0.1% or below). Khan and colleagues (25Khan S.A. Higdon N.R. Hester J.B. Meisheri K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1207-1213Google Scholar) have shown that PNU-96293, theR-enantiomer, reversed the vasorelaxation induced by other K+ channel openers. We therefore examined the effect of this compound on the recombinant KATP channel in (nonvascular) smooth muscle, Kir6.2/SUR2B. After application of PNU-96293 (10, 30, and 100 μm) to an inside-out patch in the presence of 1 mm MgATP, no current developed (data not shown). In agreement with Khan et al. (25Khan S.A. Higdon N.R. Hester J.B. Meisheri K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1207-1213Google Scholar), this indicated that the compound was devoid of opener activity. When the channel was opened by reducing the ATP concentration to 3 μm, the compound inhibited the channel concentration-dependently (Fig. 2 A). At 100 μm, the highest concentration tested, inhibition was ∼50%. In comparison, glibenclamide, at the saturating concentration of 1 μm, inhibited the current by 80%. The inhibition curve of the PNU enantiomer extrapolated to a maximum inhibition of 46% with an IC50 value of 16 μm (Fig.2 B, Table I). In the absence of ATP, the current was inhibited maximally by 30% with an IC50 value of 12 μm (Table I).Table IInhibition of recombinant KATP channels by PNU-96293ChannelConfigurationMgATPIC50ABlock by GBC (1 μm)mmμm%%Kir6.2/SUR2Bi/o012 (2, 83)30 ± 778 ± 5 (12)i/o0.00316 (7, 32)46 ± 677 ± 3 (15)Whole cell10.078 (0.037, 0.165)74 ± 696 ± 4 (5)Kir6.2/SUR2B(Y1206S)Whole cell10.045 (0.015, 0.140)86 ± 9100 ± 0 (3)aRef. 26.Kir6.2/SUR2Ai/o0.00321 (12, 37)54 ± 484 ± 5 (6)Whole cell10.014 (0.008, 0.023)bParameters for Kir6.2/SUR2A in the whole cell configuration refer to the group with high glibenclamide sensitivity (see “Results”).68 ± 4bParameters for Kir6.2/SUR2A in the whole cell configuration refer to the group with high glibenclamide sensitivity (see “Results”).79 ± 6 (3)bParameters for Kir6.2/SUR2A in the whole cell configuration refer to the group with high glibenclamide sensitivity (see “Results”).Kir6.2/SUR1i/o0At 100 μm40 ± 542 ± 6 (5)cInhibition by 100 μM tolbutamide.Experiments were performed as shown in Figs.

The effect of PNU-96293 was also studied in the whole-cell configuration at 37 °C (Fig. 3). Dialysis of the cell with 1 mm MgATP generated a current that was inhibited by the PNU enantiomer in the nanomolar concentration range (IC50 = 78 nm) with a maximum inhibition of 74%; glibenclamide (1 μm) induced almost total inhibition (Table I). Analogous experiments using the Kir6.2/SUR2B(Y1206S) channel gave very similar results (Table I), showing that the mutation did not alter the sensitivity of the channel to PNU-96293. Fig. 4 Apresents an original recording from an inside-out patch containing Kir6.2/SUR2B channels. The channel was kept closed by MgATP (1 mm); the addition of PNU-96179 (100 μm) generated a current that was completely inhibited by glibenclamide (3 μm) in a reversible manner. Further experiments showed that the current induced by PNU-96179 (100 μm) was about 10–20% of that produced by P1075 at the maximally effective concentration of 0.1 μm; lower concentrations of the PNU compound showed smaller and inconsistent effects. The ability of PNU-96179 to open the Kir6.2/SUR2B channel was also examined in the whole-cell configuration; however, it proved difficult to keep the channel closed during prolonged dialysis of the cell with 3–10 mm MgATP. Experiments were therefore performed in the cell-attached configuration. Fig. 4 B shows that PNU-96179 (100 μm) activated the channels to 13% (mean 15.6 ± 1.6; n = 6) of the level produced by P1075 (0.1 μm); at 10 μm, the PNU compound was ineffective. Collectively, the data show that PNU-96179 is an opener of the Kir6.2/SUR2B channel, albeit with low potency and efficacy. The opening properties were not investigated further, since channel opening is an effect expected for a cyanoguanidine. Fig. 5illustrates the inhibition of [3H]P1075 binding to SUR2B by the two enantiomers in membranes. In the presence of 1 mm MgATP, the compounds inhibited binding of the radioligand up to 100% with Hill coefficients of 1 andK i values of 2.3 and 0.66 μm for PNU-96179 and PNU-96293, respectively (TableII). Hence, stereoselectivity of binding, measured as the eudismic (= K i) ratio, was weak (3.5). Similar experiments were performed also at an ATP concentration of 3 μm (i.e. the lowest concentration at which high affinity binding of the radioligand (which requires MgATP) is detected) (14Hambrock A. Löffler-Walz C. Kurachi Y. Quast U. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 577-583Google Scholar, 15Schwanstecher M. Sieverding C. Dörschner H. Gross I. Aguilar-Bryan L. Schwanstecher C. Bryan J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5529-5535Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the inhibition curve for PNU-96179 was shifted to the right by a factor of 2.7 and that of PNU-96293 to the left by a factor of 10, giving now a eudismic ratio of 100. Hence, increasing ATP increased the potency of PNU-96179 and strongly decreased that of PNU-96293, indicating positive allosteric coupling between PNU-96179 and MgATP binding, whereas for PNU-96293, the coupling to MgATP was negative.Table IIBinding of PNU enantiomers to SUR subtypes and coupling to MgATP bindingPreparationRadioligandMgATPPNU-96179PNU-96293K iAaPercentage of binding specificity.K iAaPercentage of binding specificity.mMμm%μm%SUR2B[3H]P10751.02.3 (2.0, 2.7)1000.66 (0.58, 0.75)1000.0036.3 (4.0, 10)1000.065 (0.054, 0.078)100SUR2B/Kir6.2 (cells)[3H]P10753–5bAssumed intracellular MgATP concentration.3.6 (2.9, 4.6)1000.20 (0.16, 0.25)100SUR2B(Y1206S)[3H]GBC1.02.5 (1.0, 6.2)39 ± 21.7 (0.7, 4.3)−41 ± 3cThe negative sign indicates an increase in binding (to 141 and 121% of control, respectively (cf.

In their Perspective, [Fabian and Miller][1] show that iron lines in the emission spectrum of black holes can provide unprecedented insights into the innermost regions surrounding the black hole. The data provide support for spinning black holes and will help to test models of accretion and emission from black holes.
