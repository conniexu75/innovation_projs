https://openalex.org/W2009447433,"The crystal structure of two new cubic phases in the silicon-sodium system have been solved from their x-ray diffraction patterns. Both structures are of the clathrate type found for gas hydrates, consisting of tetrahedral networks which are combinations of pentagonal dodecahedra with 14-face polyhedra in one case and with 16-face polyhedra in the other case. There is strict correspondence between the silicon positions and the oxygen positions of the hydrate structures. For one compound, Na(8)Si(46), the centers of all polyhedra are occupied by sodium atoms. For the other compound, there occurs only partial occupancy of the polyhedral cages."

https://openalex.org/W2084972992,"Transcriptional readout downstream of canonical Wnt signaling is known to be mediated by beta-catenin activation of well-described targets, but potential transcriptional readout in response to noncanonical Wnt signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we define a transcriptional pathway important in noncanonical Wnt signaling. We have found that Wnt11 is a direct target of a canonical beta-catenin pathway in developing heart and that Wnt11 mutants show cardiac outflow tract defects. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence thatWnt11 signaling affects extracellular matrix composition, cytoskeletal rearrangements and polarized cell movement required for morphogenesis of the cardiac outflow tract. Notably, transforming growth factor beta2 (TGFbeta2), a key effector of organ morphogenesis, is regulated by Wnt11-mediated noncanonical signaling in developing heart and somites via one or more activating transcription factor (ATF)/cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) family members. Thus, we propose that transcriptional readout mediated at least in part by a Wnt11 --> ATF/CREB --> TGFbeta2 pathway is critical in regulating morphogenesis in response to noncanonical Wnt signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2115167712,"The eversible cervical gland (osmeterium) of the caterpillar of the swallowtail butterfly, Papilio machaon, produces a secretion containing isobutyric and 2-methylbutyric acid. The gland is effective in defense against ants. Even when caterpillars were fed on one of three unbelliferous plants (fennel, carrot, parsnip) the secretion contained the same two acids."

https://openalex.org/W1985910942,"The C(14)O(2) incorporated into organic acids by excised corn roots is released with an estimated halftime of 3 hours. Homogenates of root tissue can mediate these reactions by coupling, in series, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, diphosphopyridine nucleotide malic dehydrogenase, phosphopyridine nucleotide malic dehydrogenase. An important consequence is the transfer of hydrogen from reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide to triphosphopyridine nucleotide which is then reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1988968278,The theory of the rotation of the planet Mercury is developed in terms of the motion of a rigid system in an inverse-square field. It is possible for Mercury to rotate with a period exactly two-thirds of the period of revolution; there is a libration with a period of 25 years.
