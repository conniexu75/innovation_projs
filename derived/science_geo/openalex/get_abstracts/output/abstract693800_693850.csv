https://openalex.org/W4280636450,"Multispecies tree planting has long been applied in forestry and landscape restoration in the hope of providing better timber production and ecosystem services; however, a systematic assessment of its effectiveness is lacking. We compiled a global dataset of matched single-species and multispecies plantations to evaluate the impact of multispecies planting on stand growth. Average tree height, diameter at breast height, and aboveground biomass were 5.4, 6.8, and 25.5% higher, respectively, in multispecies stands compared with single-species stands. These positive effects were mainly the result of interspecific complementarity and were modulated by differences in leaf morphology and leaf life span, stand age, planting density, and temperature. Our results have implications for designing afforestation and reforestation strategies and bridging experimental studies of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships with real-world practices."

We report the implementation of a publicly accessible catalog of stable and fragile topology in all of the bands both at and away from EF in the 96,196 processable entries in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. Our calculations, which represent the completion of the symmetry-indicated band topology of known nonmagnetic materials, have enabled the discovery of repeat-topological and supertopological materials, including rhombohedral bismuth and Bi2Mg3. We find that 52.65% of all materials are topological at EF, roughly two-thirds of bands across all materials exhibit symmetry-indicated stable topology, and 87.99% of all materials contain at least one stable or fragile topological band."

https://openalex.org/W4280570348,"We report the reprogramming of nonheme iron enzymes to catalyze an abiological C(sp3)‒H azidation reaction through iron-catalyzed radical relay. This biocatalytic transformation uses amidyl radicals as hydrogen atom abstractors and Fe(III)‒N3 intermediates as radical trapping agents. We established a high-throughput screening platform based on click chemistry for rapid evolution of the catalytic performance of identified enzymes. The final optimized variants deliver a range of azidation products with up to 10,600 total turnovers and 93% enantiomeric excess. Given the prevalence of radical relay reactions in organic synthesis and the diversity of nonheme iron enzymes, we envision that this discovery will stimulate future development of metalloenzyme catalysts for synthetically useful transformations unexplored by natural evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4280570469,"Epistatic interactions can make the outcomes of evolution unpredictable, but no comprehensive data are available on the extent and temporal dynamics of changes in the effects of mutations as protein sequences evolve. Here, we use phylogenetic deep mutational scanning to measure the functional effect of every possible amino acid mutation in a series of ancestral and extant steroid receptor DNA binding domains. Across 700 million years of evolution, epistatic interactions caused the effects of most mutations to become decorrelated from their initial effects and their windows of evolutionary accessibility to open and close transiently. Most effects changed gradually and without bias at rates that were largely constant across time, indicating a neutral process caused by many weak epistatic interactions. Our findings show that protein sequences drift inexorably into contingency and unpredictability, but that the process is statistically predictable, given sufficient phylogenetic and experimental data."

https://openalex.org/W4280599422,"Optical fiber-based sensing technology can drastically improve Earth observations by enabling the use of existing submarine communication cables as seafloor sensors. Previous interferometric and polarization-based techniques demonstrated environmental sensing over cable lengths up to 10,500 kilometers. However, measurements were limited to the integrated changes over the entire length of the cable. We demonstrate the detection of earthquakes and ocean signals on individual spans between repeaters of a 5860-kilometer-long transatlantic cable rather than the whole cable. By applying this technique to the existing undersea communication cables, which have a repeater-to-repeater span length of 45 to 90 kilometers, the largely unmonitored ocean floor could be instrumented with thousands of permanent real-time environmental sensors without changes to the underwater infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W4280643668,"Progenitors of the developing human neocortex reside in the ventricular and outer subventricular zones (VZ and OSVZ, respectively). However, whether cells derived from these niches have similar developmental fates is unknown. By performing fate mapping in primary human tissue, we demonstrate that astrocytes derived from these niches populate anatomically distinct layers. Cortical plate astrocytes emerge from VZ progenitors and proliferate locally, while putative white matter astrocytes are morphologically heterogeneous and emerge from both VZ and OSVZ progenitors. Furthermore, via single-cell sequencing of morphologically defined astrocyte subtypes using Patch-seq, we identify molecular distinctions between VZ-derived cortical plate astrocytes and OSVZ-derived white matter astrocytes that persist into adulthood. Together, our study highlights a complex role for cell lineage in the diversification of human neocortical astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4280491348,"Predictions of how marine calcifying organisms will respond to climate change rely heavily on the fossil record of nannoplankton. Declines in calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) and nannofossil abundance through several past global warming events have been interpreted as biocalcification crises caused by ocean acidification and related factors. We present a global record of imprint—or “ghost”—nannofossils that contradicts this view, revealing exquisitely preserved nannoplankton throughout an inferred Jurassic biocalcification crisis. Imprints from two further Cretaceous warming events confirm that the fossil records of these intervals have been strongly distorted by CaCO 3 dissolution. Although the rapidity of present-day climate change exceeds the temporal resolution of most fossil records, complicating direct comparison with past warming events, our findings demonstrate that nannoplankton were more resilient to past events than traditional fossil evidence suggests."
https://openalex.org/W4280654322,"Systems immunology lacks a framework with which to derive theoretical understanding from high-dimensional datasets. We combined a robotic platform with machine learning to experimentally measure and theoretically model CD8+ T cell activation. High-dimensional cytokine dynamics could be compressed onto a low-dimensional latent space in an antigen-specific manner (so-called ""antigen encoding""). We used antigen encoding to model and reconstruct patterns of T cell immune activation. The model delineated six classes of antigens eliciting distinct T cell responses. We generalized antigen encoding to multiple immune settings, including drug perturbations and activation of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Such universal antigen encoding for T cell activation may enable further modeling of immune responses and their rational manipulation to optimize immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W4280584397,"The molecular basis of interindividual clinical variability upon infection with Staphylococcus aureus is unclear. We describe patients with haploinsufficiency for the linear deubiquitinase OTULIN, encoded by a gene on chromosome 5p. Patients suffer from episodes of life-threatening necrosis, typically triggered by S. aureus infection. The disorder is phenocopied in patients with the 5p− (Cri-du-Chat) chromosomal deletion syndrome. OTULIN haploinsufficiency causes an accumulation of linear ubiquitin in dermal fibroblasts, but tumor necrosis factor receptor–mediated nuclear factor κB signaling remains intact. Blood leukocyte subsets are unaffected. The OTULIN-dependent accumulation of caveolin-1 in dermal fibroblasts, but not leukocytes, facilitates the cytotoxic damage inflicted by the staphylococcal virulence factor α-toxin. Naturally elicited antibodies against α-toxin contribute to incomplete clinical penetrance. Human OTULIN haploinsufficiency underlies life-threatening staphylococcal disease by disrupting cell-intrinsic immunity to α-toxin in nonleukocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W4280495505,"In plants, many invading microbial pathogens are recognized by cell-surface pattern recognition receptors, which induce defense responses. Here, we show that the ceramide Phytophthora infestans-ceramide D (Pi-Cer D) from the plant pathogenic oomycete P. infestans triggers defense responses in Arabidopsis. Pi-Cer D is cleaved by an Arabidopsis apoplastic ceramidase, NEUTRAL CERAMIDASE 2 (NCER2), and the resulting 9-methyl-branched sphingoid base is recognized by a plasma membrane lectin receptor-like kinase, RESISTANT TO DFPM-INHIBITION OF ABSCISIC ACID SIGNALING 2 (RDA2). 9-Methyl-branched sphingoid base is specific to microbes and induces plant immune responses by physically interacting with RDA2. Loss of RDA2 or NCER2 function compromised Arabidopsis resistance against an oomycete pathogen. Thus, we elucidated the recognition mechanisms of pathogen-derived lipid molecules in plants."
https://openalex.org/W4280575543,"In many vertebrate and invertebrate organisms, gametes develop within groups of interconnected cells called germline cysts formed by several rounds of incomplete divisions. We found that loss of the deubiquitinase USP8 gene in Drosophila can transform incomplete divisions of germline cells into complete divisions. Conversely, overexpression of USP8 in germline stem cells is sufficient for the reverse transformation from complete to incomplete cytokinesis. The ESCRT-III proteins CHMP2B and Shrub/CHMP4 are targets of USP8 deubiquitinating activity. In Usp8 mutant sister cells, ectopic recruitment of ESCRT proteins at intercellular bridges causes cysts to break apart. A Shrub/CHMP4 variant that cannot be ubiquitinated does not localize at abscission bridges and cannot complete abscission. Our results uncover ubiquitination of ESCRT-III as a major switch between two types of cell division."
https://openalex.org/W4280619359,"Risk stratification is central to the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). For this purpose, multiparametric tools have been developed, including the ESC/ERS risk score and its simplified versions derived from large database analysis such as the COMPERA and the French Pulmonary Hypertension Network (FPHN) registries. However, the distinction between high and intermediate-risk profiles may be difficult as the latter lacks granularity. In addition, neither COMPERA or FPHN strategies included imaging-derived markers. We thus aimed at investigating whether surrogate echocardiographic markers of right ventricular (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) coupling could improve risk stratification in patients at intermediate-risk.A single-center retrospective analysis including 102 patients with a diagnosis of PAH was performed. COMPERA and FPHN strategies were applied to stratify clinical risk. The univariate linear regression was used to test the influence of the echo-derived parameters qualifying the right heart (right ventricle basal diameter, right atrial area, and pressure, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion -TAPSE-). Among these, the TAPSE and tricuspid regurgitation velocity ratio (TAPSE/TRV) as well as the TAPSE and systolic pulmonary artery pressure ratio (TAPSE/sPAP) were considered as surrogate of RV-PA coupling.TAPSE/TRV and TAPSE/sPAP resulted the more powerful markers of prognosis. Once added to COMPERA, TAPSE/TRV or TAPSE/sPAP significantly dichotomized intermediate-risk group in intermediate-to-low-risk (TAPSE/TRV≥3.74 mm∙nm/s)-1 or TAPSE/sPAP≥0.24 mm/mmHg) and in intermediate-to-high-risk subgroups (TAPSE/TRV<3.74 mm∙(m/s)-1 or TAPSE/sPAP<0.24 mm/mmHg). In the same way, TAPSE/TRV or TAPSE/sPAP was able to select patients at lower risk among those with 2, 1, and 0 low-risk criteria of both invasive and non-invasive FPHN registries.Our results suggest that adopting functional-hemodynamic echo-derived parameters may provide a more accurate risk stratification in patients with PAH. In particular, TAPSE/TRV or TAPSE/sPAP improved risk stratification in patients at intermediate-risk, that otherwise would have remained less characterized."
https://openalex.org/W4280517410,"In the forebrain, ventrally derived oligodendrocyte precursor cells (vOPCs) travel tangentially toward the cortex together with cortical interneurons. Here, we tested in the mouse whether these populations interact during embryogenesis while migrating. By coupling histological analysis of genetic models with live imaging, we show that although they are both attracted by the chemokine Cxcl12, vOPCs and cortical interneurons occupy mutually exclusive forebrain territories enriched in this chemokine. Moreover, first-wave vOPC depletion selectively disrupts the migration and distribution of cortical interneurons. At the cellular level, we found that by promoting unidirectional contact repulsion, first-wave vOPCs steered the migration of cortical interneurons away from the blood vessels to which they were both attracted, thereby allowing interneurons to reach their proper cortical territories."
https://openalex.org/W4280509030,"Superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) are competitive, yet coexisting, orders in cuprate superconductors. To understand their microscopic interdependence, a probe capable of discerning their interaction on its natural length and time scale is necessary. We use ultrafast resonant soft x-ray scattering to track the transient evolution of CDW correlations in YBa2Cu3O6+x after the quench of superconductivity by an infrared laser pulse. We observe a nonthermal response of the CDW order characterized by a near doubling of the correlation length within ≈1 picosecond of the superconducting quench. Our results are consistent with a model in which the interaction between superconductivity and CDWs manifests inhomogeneously through disruption of spatial coherence, with superconductivity playing the dominant role in stabilizing CDW topological defects, such as discommensurations."
https://openalex.org/W4280567649,"There is a critical need to identify the drivers of willingness to receive new vaccines against emerging and epidemic diseases. A discrete choice experiment is the ideal approach to evaluating how individuals weigh multiple attributes simultaneously. We assessed the degree to which six attributes were associated with willingness to be vaccinated among university students in Uganda.We conducted a single-profile discrete choice experiment at Makerere University in 2019. Participants were asked whether or not they would be vaccinated in 8 unique scenarios where attributes varied by disease risk, disease severity, advice for or against vaccination from trusted individuals, recommendations from influential figures, whether the vaccine induced indirect protection, and side effects. We calculated predicted probabilities of vaccination willingness using mixed logistic regression models, comparing health professional students with all other disciplines.Of the 1576 participants, 783 (49.8%) were health professional students and 685 (43.5%) were female. Vaccination willingness was high (78%), and higher among health students than other students. We observed the highest vaccination willingness for the most severe disease outcomes and the greatest exposure risks, along with the Minister of Health's recommendation or a vaccine that extended secondary protection to others. Mild side effects and recommendations against vaccination diminished vaccination willingness.Our results can be used to develop evidence-based messaging to encourage uptake for new vaccines. Future vaccination campaigns, such as for COVID-19 vaccines in development, should consider acknowledging individual risk of exposure and disease severity and incorporate recommendations from key health leaders."
https://openalex.org/W4280600446,"When listening to music, we often feel a strong desire to move our body in relation to the pulse of the rhythm. In music psychology, this desire to move is described by the term groove . Previous research suggests that the sensation of groove is strongest when a rhythm is moderately complex, i.e., when the rhythm hits the sweet spot between being too simple to be engaging and too complex to be interpretable. This means that the relationship between rhythmic complexity and the sensation of groove can be described by an inverted U-shape (Matthews 2019). Here, we recreate this inverted U-shape with a stimulus set that was reduced from 54 to only nine rhythms. Thereby, we provide an efficient toolkit for future studies to induce and measure different levels of groove sensations. Pleasure and movement induction in relation to rhythmic complexity are emerging topics in music cognition and neuroscience. Investigating the sensation of groove is important for understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motor timing and reward processes in the general population, and in patients with conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and motor impairment after stroke. The experimental manipulation of groove also provides new approaches for research on social bonding in interpersonal movement interactions that feature music. Our brief stimulus set facilitates future research on these topics by enabling the creation of efficient and concise paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W4280549804,"When bovine lactoferrin (bLF) contacts human vaginal fluid (VF) it is subjected to proteolytic degradation. This report describes fragmentation patterns of bLF dosed vaginally in clinical trials or incubated ex vivo with VF. A consensus pattern of fragments was observed in samples from different women. The 80 kDa bLF molecule is initially cleaved between its homologous 40 kDa domains, the N-lobe and C-lobe, and then degraded into sub-fragments and mixtures of small peptides. We characterized this fragmentation process by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blotting, chromatographic separation, and mass spectral sequence analysis. Common to most VF fragmentation patterns were large amounts of an N-lobe 37 kDa fragment and a C-lobe 43 kDa fragment resulting from a single cleavage following tyrosine 324. Both fragments possessed full sets of iron-ligand amino acids and retained iron-binding ability. In some VF samples, alternative forms of large fragments were found, which like the 37+43 kDa pair, totaled 80 kDa. These included 58+22 kDa, 18+62 kDa, and 16+64 kDa forms. In general, the smaller component was from the N-lobe and the larger from the C-lobe. The 18+62 kDa pair was absent in some VF samples but highly abundant in others. This variability suggests multiple endopeptidases are involved, with the 18 kDa fragment's presence dependent upon the balance of enzymes. Further action of VF endopeptidases produced smaller peptide fragments, and we found evidence that exopeptidases trimmed their N- and C-termini. The 3.1 kDa antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin B was not detected. These studies were facilitated by a novel technique we developed: tricolor western blots, which enabled simultaneous visualization of N- and C-terminal epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W4280598612,"Mathematics plays a leading part in day-to-day life and has enhanced a necessary component for human accomplishments. Students from many countries do not reach the expected level in mathematics. Therefore, it is essential to pay close consideration to the causes related to ability in mathematics. Mathematics attitude is considered as one of the critical variables in the process of mathematics learning. This study aimed to determine students’ attitudes and achievements through problem-based learning in mathematics. The selected study group contained 600 students and 35 teachers from rural public secondary schools in District Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The data collection was done using questionnaires from students and teachers and collected data analyzed by SPSS 23 and Amos 23. This study’s result was carried out using Partial Least square structural equation Model (PLS-SEM), descriptive analysis, and hypotheses testing. The outcomes in this study indicated that the mean fluctuated between 1 to 4.5, 3.71 to 4.20, and Std. Deviation fluctuated between 0.6 to 2.0 and 0.75 to 1.55 in the students and teacher models, respectively. The results of the PLS-SEM students’ model show a negative attitude towards mathematics. The teachers’ PLS-SEM model showed the Effects of using problem-based learning (PBL) on students’ achievements. According to the hypotheses testing, the acceptance of hypotheses by stating that the Confidence in Learning Mathematics Scale (C), Value of Mathematics Scale (V), and Student Mathematics Motivation Scale (M) are significant effects for the Students’ Attitude Toward Problem-Based Learning (ATPBL). But the Attitude Toward Enjoyment in Mathematics Scale (AE) was rejected, and it did not significantly affect the ATPBL. As well as, the Problem-solving learning and students’ achievement (PLA), Advantages of problem-solving learning (APL) and Difficulties in using problem-solving learning (DPL) have a significant positive effect on the ATPBL. Finally, this study suggested that teachers also adopt new teaching methods corresponding to mathematics, and there is a need to explore particular mathematics skills to enhance students’ learning abilities."

https://openalex.org/W4280625274,"Diabetes and hypertension have emerged as important clinical and public health problems in Ethiopia. The need to have long-term sustainable healthcare services for patients with diabetes and hypertension is essential to enhance good treatment control among those patients and subsequently delay or prevent complications. A collective shift towards acute care for COVID-19 patients combined with different measures to contain the pandemic had disrupted ambulatory care. Hence, it is expected to have a significant impact on treatment control of hypertensive and diabetic patients. However, there is limited evidence on the effect of the pandemic on treatment control and its determinants. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment control of ambulatory Hypertensive and Diabetic patients and identify the factors for poor treatment control in North West Ethiopia.A retrospective chart review and cross-sectional survey design were conducted between December 2020 and February 2021. Using a stratified systematic random sampling technique, 836 diabetic and/or hypertensive patients were included in the study. Web-based data collection was done using Kobo collect. The changes in the proportion of poor treatment control among ambulatory Hypertensive and/or Diabetic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic period were assessed. A multivariable binary logistic regression mixed model was fitted to identify the determinants of poor treatment control. The odds ratios were reported in both crude and adjusted form, together with their 95% confidence intervals and p-values.Poor treatment control increased significantly from 24.81% (21.95, 27.92) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to 30.33% (27.01, 33.88), 35.66% (32.26, 39.20), 36.69% (33.40, 40.12), and 34.18% (3102, 37.49) in the first, second, third, and fourth months following the date of the first COVID-19 case detection in Ethiopia, respectively. Marital status (AOR = 0.56, 95%CI; 0.41, 0.74), regimen of medication administration (AOR = 1.30, 95%CI; 1.02, 166), daily (AOR = 0.12, 95%CI; 0.08, 0.20), twice (AOR = 0.42, 95%CI; 0.30. 0.59), and three times (AOR = 0.31, 95%CI; 0.21, 0.47) frequency of medication, number medications taken per day (AOR = 0.79, 95%CI;0.73, 0.87), patients habits like hazardous alcohol use (AOR = 1.29, 95%CI; 1.02, 1.65) and sedentary lifestyle (AOR = 1.72,95%CI;1.46, 2.02), missed appointment during the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 2.09, 95%CI; 1.79, 2.45), and presence of disease related complication (AOR = 1.11, 95%CI; 0.93, 1.34) were significantly associated with poor treatment control among Diabetic and/or hypertensive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on ambulatory Diabetic and/or Hypertensive patients' treatment control. Being married, as well as the frequency and types of medicines taken per day were all found to be negatively associated with poor treatment control. During the COVID -19 pandemic, patients' habits such as hazardous alcohol use and sedentary lifestyle, longer follow-up time, having disease-related complication (s), patients taking injectable medication, number of medications per day, and missed appointments were positively associated with poor treatment control in ambulatory diabetic and hypertensive patients. Therefore, it is better to consider the risk factors of poor treatment control while designing and implementing policies and strategies for chronic disease control."
https://openalex.org/W4280488643,"Objective Although community practices towards disposal of expired and unused medications vary globally, the phenomenon is neglected specifically in developing countries. We, therefore, aimed to assess the disposal practices of unused and expired pharmaceuticals among the general public in Quetta city, Pakistan. Methods A questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among 830 respondents in Quetta city, Pakistan. A pre-validated, structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were coded and analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 26. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were sued and p&lt;0.05 was taken as significant. Results Almost 87% of the respondents had unused medicines at their homes and reusing the medications was the purpose of medicine storage (50%). Medicines were mostly kept in refrigerators (36.0%) followed by bedrooms (28.8%). Fifty percent of the respondents never checked the expiry date before using the medications. The procedure to dispose of nearly expired or expired medicines was unknown to 88% of the respondents and for those reasons, medicines were disposed either in household trash or flushed in the toilet or sink. Interestingly, medicines were kept at home even after being expired by 27% of the respondents. Income was associated with reason of storing medicines (p = 0.004; φc = 0.402) while educational status had significant associations with storage of medications (p = 0.002; φc = 0.399), reading about storage instructions (p = 0.008; φc = 0.452) and checking expiry date before purchasing and using the medicines (p = 0.007; φc = 0.114 and p = 0.001; φc = 0.100) respectively. Conclusion Improper storage and disposal of unused and expired medications is a common practice among study respondents and raised serious concerns. Findings of the current study call upon immediate development and implementation of the strategies to promote awareness and strengthen the pharmaceutical waste management program at the societal level."
https://openalex.org/W4280614951,"The fluid flow with chemical reaction is one of well-known research areas in the field of computational fluid dynamic. It is potentially useful in the modelling of flow on a nuclear reactor. Motivated by the implementation of the flow in the industrial application, the aim of this study is to explore the time-dependent squeeze flow of magnetohydrodynamic Jeffrey fluid over permeable medium in the influences of Soret and Dufour, heat source/sink and chemical reaction. The presence of joule heating, joule dissipation and radiative heat transfer are analyzed. The flow is induced due to compress of two surfaces. Conversion of partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is accomplished by imposing similarity variables. Then, the governing equations are resolved using Keller-box approach. The present outcomes are compared with previously outcomes in the literature to validate the precision of present outcomes. Both outcomes are shown in close agreement. The tabular and graphical results demonstrate that wall shear stress and velocity profile accelerate with the surfaces moving towards one another. Moreover, the concentration, temperature and velocity profiles decreasing for the increment of Hartmann numbers and Jeffrey fluid parameters. The impacts of heat generation/absorption, joule dissipation and Dufour numbers enhance the heat transfer rate and temperature profile. In contrast, the temperature profile drops and the heat transfer rate boosts when thermal radiation increases. The concentration profile decelerates, and the mass transfer rate elevates with raise in Soret number. Also, the mass transfer rate rises for destructive chemical reaction and contrary result is noted for convective chemical reaction."
https://openalex.org/W4280518877,"Background Despite reliable evidence-based research supporting the COVID-19 vaccines, population-wide confidence and trust remain limited. We sought to expand prior knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine perceptions, while determining which population groups are at greatest risk for not getting a vaccine. Methods Study participants in the U.S. (79% female, median age group 46–60 years) were recruited through an online Qualtrics survey distributed as a Facebook advertisement from 3/19/21–4/30/21. We assumed that every participant is at risk of COVID-19 infection and should be able to get the vaccine with proper access. Bivariate and multivariable models were performed. Collinearity between variables was assessed. Results A total of 2,626 responses were generated and 2,259 were included in data analysis. According to our multivariate model analysis, vaccines were perceived as safe by those who had or planned to obtain full vaccination (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) (95% confidence interval) = 40.0 (19.0, 84.2); p&lt; 0.0001) and those who indicated trust in science (aOR = 10.5 (5.1, 21.8); p&lt; 0.0001); vaccines were perceived as not safe by those who self-identified as Republicans vs. self-identified Democrats (aOR = 0.2 (0.1, 0.5); p = 0.0020) and those with high school or lower education (aOR = 0.2 (0.1, 0.4); p = 0.0007). Similarly, according to our multivariate model analysis, the following groups were most likely to reject vaccination based on belief in vaccinations: those with lower income (aOR = 0.8 (0.6, 0.9); p = 0.0106), those who do not know anyone who had been vaccinated (aOR = 0.1 (0.1, 0.4); p&lt; 0.0001), those who are unwilling to get vaccinated even if family and friends had done so (aOR = 0.1 (&lt;0.1, 0.2); p&lt; 0.0001), those who did not trust science (aOR &lt; 0.1 (&lt;0.1, 0.1); p&lt; 0.0001), those who believe that vaccination was unnecessary if others had already been vaccinated (aOR = 2.8 (1.5, 5.1); p = 0.0007), and those who indicate refusal to vaccinate to help others (aOR = 0.1 (0.1, 0.2); p&lt; 0.0001). An alpha of p&lt;0.05 was used for all tests. Conclusion Level of education and partisanship, but not race/ethnicity, were the most likely factors associated with vaccine hesitancy or likelihood to vaccinate. Also, low vaccination rates among underrepresented minorities may be due to distrust for healthcare industries. Population sub-groups less likely to be vaccinated and/or receptive to vaccines should be targeted for vaccine education and incentives."

The filter consisted of one layer of ZrO2 beads covered by aluminum mesh electrodes; this porous structure of DFD part generates filter-type surface discharge and reactive oxygen species. In a closed cylindrical chamber, DFD treated air flow containing SARS-CoV-2 aerosols, primarily composed of particle diameters of ≤ 1 μm. A polypropylene melt-blown filter collected the treated bioaerosols for inactivation analysis. Plaque and polymerase chain reaction assays showed that the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 that passed through the filter were more than 99.84% inactivated with degradation of SARS-CoV-2 genes (ORF1ab and E). However, ozone exposure without DFD passage was not found to be effective for bioaerosol inactivation in plaque assay."
https://openalex.org/W4280574876,"Background The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims at reducing neonatal and under-5 mortality to below 12 per 1000 and 25 per 1000 live births, respectively, globally by 2030. Studies have found that initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth and continuous breastfeeding for over 12 months can positively impact neonatal and infant health. However, there is evidence that the sex of a child may influence the breastfeeding practices of a mother. Thus, we examined sex inequality in early breastfeeding initiation in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods Data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 24 sub-Saharan African countries between January 2010 and December 2019 were pooled and analysed. A total of 137,677 women of reproductive age (15–49 years) were considered in this study. Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed, and the results were presented using crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with statistical significance at a p-value less than 0.05. Results The highest inequality in early initiation of breastfeeding was reported in Togo with a difference of 5.21% between the female and male children, while the lowest inequality was reported in Guinea with 0.48% difference between the female and male children. A higher odds of breastfeeding within 1 hour was observed among female children [cOR = 1.05; 95%(CI = 1.02–1.09)] compared to male children, and this persisted after controlling for the confounders included in this study [aOR = 1.05; 95%(CI = 1.02–1.08)]. Conclusion We found higher odds for early breastfeeding initiation of female children compared to male children in sub-Saharan Africa. To reduce breastfeeding initiation inequalities, programmes that educate and encourage early initiation of breastfeeding irrespective of the child sex should be promoted among mothers."

This study aims to examine the seroprevalence of tetanus in children 6 to 59 months to identify areas for intervention and improvement of vaccination coverage.In collaboration with the 2013-2014 Demographic and Health Survey, we assessed the seroprevalence of tetanus antibodies among children in the DRC. Dried blood spot samples collected from children 6-59 months of age were processed using a prototype DYNEX Multiplier® chemiluminescent automated immunoassay instrument with a multiplex measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and tetanus assay. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with tetanus vaccination and seroprotection.Overall, 36.1% of children 6-59 months of age reported receiving at least 1 dose of tetanus vaccine while 28.7% reported receiving 3 doses; tetanus seroprotection was 40%. Increasing age in children was associated with decreased tetanus seroprotection, but increased number tetanus vaccinations received. Factors related to increased tetanus seroprotection included number of children in the household, wealth index of the family, urban residence compared to rural, level of maternal education, and province and geography.Our findings in this nationally representative sample indicate that serology biomarkers may help identify children who are not fully immunized to tetanus more accurately than reported vaccination. While children may be captured for routine immunization activities, as children age, decreasing seroprevalence may indicate additional need to bolster routine vaccination activities and documentation of vaccination in school aged children. Additionally, the study highlights gaps in rural residential areas and vaccination coverage based on maternal education, indicating that policies targeting maternal education and awareness could improve the coverage and seroprevalence of tetanus antibodies in the DRC."

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the cancers preventive practice and associated factors in North West Ethiopia, 2019.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Bahir Dar city residents. A multistage sampling technique was used to select 845 study participants. Data were collected through a validated interviewer administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted from the American cancer association cancer prevention toolkit. Descriptive statistics were computed and presented in charts and texts. The model fitness was checked using Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit (P > 0.05). Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify factors associated with cancer preventive practice. A p-value < 0.2 at bivariate analysis was candidate variables for multivariable logistic regression analysis. Finally, p-value of < 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant predictor for cancer preventive practice at the 95% confidence interval.A total of 845 study participants took part in the study. Nearly 63% of the respondents were females. About 28% (95%CI: 24, 30) of the study participants had good preventive practice. Age ≥ 45 years (AOR = 0.31; 95%CI: 0.15, 0.62), female (AOR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.35, 0.71) family member with cancer (AOR = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.07, 2.62) and had good knowledge (AOR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.14, 2.42) were the identified determinants of cancer preventive practices.This study revealed that the level of cancer preventive practices was low. Family member with cancer, knowledge about cancer, older age, and being female were significantly associated with cancer preventive practices. This finding underscores the importance of interventions to enhance cancer preventive practices."
https://openalex.org/W4280498374,"Ticks are one of the most important vectors of several pathogens affecting humans and animals. In addition to pathogens, ticks carry diverse microbiota of symbiotic and commensal microorganisms. In this study, we have investigated the first Tunisian insight into the microbial composition of the most dominant Hyalomma species infesting Tunisian cattle and explored the relative contribution of tick sex, life stage, and species to the diversity, richness and bacterial species of tick microbiome. In this regard, next generation sequencing for the 16S rRNA (V3-V4 region) of tick bacterial microbiota and metagenomic analysis were established. The analysis of the bacterial diversity reveals that H. marginatum and H. excavatum have greater diversity than H. scupense. Furthermore, microbial diversity and composition vary according to the tick's life stage and sex in the specific case of H. scupense. The endosymbionts Francisella, Midichloria mitochondrii, and Rickettsia were shown to be the most prevalent in Hyalomma spp. Rickettsia, Francisella, Ehrlichia, and Erwinia are the most common zoonotic bacteria found in Hyalomma ticks. Accordingly, Hyalomma ticks could represent potential vectors for these zoonotic bacterial agents."
https://openalex.org/W4280555609,"Neuromeningeal cryptococcosis (NMC) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in advanced HIV disease patients (AHDP). It is caused by Cryptococcus spp. complexes and mainly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we performed molecular characterization and antifungal susceptibility profiling of Cryptococcus isolates from AHDP in Kinshasa (DRC). Additionally, we investigated a possible association between NMC severity factors and the Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) multilocus sequence typing (MLST) profiles. We characterized the isolates using PCR serotyping, MALDI-TOF MS, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, and MLST. Susceptibility testing for the major antifungal drugs was performed according to the EUCAST guidelines. Parameters associated with NMC severity, such as hypoglycorrhachia (< 50 mg/dL), increased cerebral spinal fluid opening pressure (> 30 cm H2O), and poor therapeutic outcome were compared with the Cn MLST sequences type (ST). Twenty-three out of 29 Cryptococcus isolates were identified as serotype A using PCR serotyping (79.3%; 95% IC: 65.5-93.1), while six (20.7%; 95% IC: 6.9-34.5) were not serotypable. The 29 isolates were identified by ITS sequencing as follows: Cryptococcus neoformans (23/29, 79.3%), Cutaneotrichosporon curvatus (previously called Cryptococcus curvatus) (5/29, 17.2%), and Papiliotrema laurentii (Cryptococcus laurentii) (1/29, 3.5%). Using the ISHAM MLST scheme, all Cn isolates were identified as molecular type VNI. These comprised seven different STs: ST93 (n = 15), ST5 (n = 2), ST53 (n = 1), ST31 (n = 1), ST4 (n = 1), ST69 (n = 1), and one novel ST that has not yet been reported from other parts of the world and was subsequently assigned as ST659 (n = 2). Of the included strains, only Papiliotrema laurentii was resistant to amphoterin B (1/29, 3.5%), 6.8% (2/29) were resistant to 5-flucytosine (the single Papiliotrema laurentii strain and one Cryptococcus neoformans isolate), and 13.8% (4/29) to fluconazole, including two of five (40%) Cutaneotrichosporon curvatus and two of 23 (8.7%) C. neoformans strains. We found a significative association between poor therapeutic outcome and a non-ST93 sequence type of causative strains (these concerned the less common sequence types: ST53, ST31, ST5, ST4, ST659, and ST69) (87.5% versus 40%, p = 0.02). Molecular analysis of Cryptococcus spp. isolates showed a wide species diversity and genetic heterogenicity of Cn within the VNI molecular type. Furthermore, it is worrying that among included strains we found resistances to several of the commonly used antifungals."
https://openalex.org/W4280559211,"The aim of this study was to determine reference intervals in an outpatient population from Vall d’Hebron laboratory using an indirect approach previously described in a Dutch population (NUMBER project). We used anonymized test results from individuals visiting general practitioners and analysed during 2018. Analytical quality was assured by EQA performance, daily average monitoring and by assessing longitudinal accuracy between 2018 and 2020 (using trueness verifiers from Dutch EQA). Per test, outliers by biochemically related tests were excluded, data were transformed to a normal distribution (if necessary) and means and standard deviations were calculated, stratified by age and sex. In addition, the reference limit estimator method was also used to calculate reference intervals using the same dataset. Finally, for standardized tests reference intervals obtained were compared with the published NUMBER results. Reference intervals were calculated using data from 509,408 clinical requests. For biochemical tests following a normal distribution, similar reference intervals were found between Vall d’Hebron and the Dutch study. For creatinine and urea, reference intervals increased with age in both populations. The upper limits of Gamma-glutamyl transferase were markedly higher in the Dutch study compared to Vall d’Hebron results. Creatine kinase and uric acid reference intervals were higher in both populations compared to conventional reference intervals. Medical test results following a normal distribution showed comparable and consistent reference intervals between studies. Therefore a simple indirect method is a feasible and cost-efficient approach for calculating reference intervals. Yet, for generating standardized calculated reference intervals that are traceable to higher order materials and methods, efforts should also focus on test standardization and bias assessment using commutable trueness verifiers."
https://openalex.org/W4280567514,"Emerging evidence implicates the eicosanoid molecule prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in conferring a regenerative phenotype to multiple organ systems following tissue injury. As aging is in part characterized by loss of tissue stem cells' regenerative capacity, we tested the hypothesis that the prostaglandin-degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) contributes to the diminished organ fitness of aged mice. Here we demonstrate that genetic loss of 15-PGDH (Hpgd) confers a protective effect on aging of murine hematopoietic and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues. Aged mice lacking 15-PGDH display increased hematopoietic output as assessed by peripheral blood cell counts, bone marrow and splenic stem cell compartments, and accelerated post-transplantation recovery compared to their WT counterparts. Loss of Hpgd expression also resulted in enhanced GI fitness and reduced local inflammation in response to colitis. Together these results suggest that 15-PGDH negatively regulates aged tissue regeneration, and that 15-PGDH inhibition may be a viable therapeutic strategy to ameliorate age-associated loss of organ fitness."
https://openalex.org/W4280653030,"SARS-CoV-2 has infected nearly 3.7 million and killed 61,722 Californians, as of May 22, 2021. Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been instrumental in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. However, as we ease restrictions, widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccines is essential to prevent its resurgence. In this work, we addressed the adequacy and deficiency of vaccine uptake within California and the possibility and severity of resurgence of COVID-19 as restrictions are lifted given the current vaccination rates. We implemented a real-time Bayesian data assimilation approach to provide projections of incident cases and deaths in California following the reopening of its economy on June 15, 2021. We implemented scenarios that vary vaccine uptake prior to reopening, and transmission rates and effective population sizes following the reopening. For comparison purposes, we adopted a baseline scenario using the current vaccination rates, which projects a total 11,429 cases and 429 deaths in a 15-day period after reopening. We used posterior estimates based on CA historical data to provide realistic model parameters after reopening. When the transmission rate is increased after reopening, we projected an increase in cases by 21.8% and deaths by 4.4% above the baseline after reopening. When the effective population is increased after reopening, we observed an increase in cases by 51.8% and deaths by 12.3% above baseline. A 30% reduction in vaccine uptake alone has the potential to increase cases and deaths by 35% and 21.6%, respectively. Conversely, increasing vaccine uptake by 30% could decrease cases and deaths by 26.1% and 17.9%, respectively. As California unfolds its plan to reopen its economy on June 15, 2021, it is critical that social distancing and public behavior changes continue to be promoted, particularly in communities with low vaccine uptake. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation to ease mask-wearing for fully vaccinated individuals despite major inequities in vaccine uptake in counties across the state highlights some of the logistical challenges that society faces as we enthusiastically phase out of this pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4280501218,"It is important to differentiate between benign and malignant myxoid tumors to establish the treatment plan, determine the optimal surgical extent, and plan postoperative surveillance, but differentiation may be complicated by imaging-feature overlap. Texture analysis is used for quantitative assessment of imaging characteristics based on mathematically calculated pixel heterogeneity and has been applied to the discrimination of benign from malignant soft tissue tumors (STTs). In this study, we aimed to assess the diagnostic value of the texture features of conventional magnetic resonance images for the differentiation of benign from malignant myxoid STTs. Magnetic resonance images of 39 patients with histologically confirmed myxoid STTs of the extremities were analyzed. Qualitative features were assessed and compared between the benign and malignant groups. Texture analysis was performed, and texture features were selected based on univariate analysis and Fisher’s coefficient. The diagnostic value of the texture features was assessed using receiver operating curve analysis. T1 heterogeneity showed a statistically significant difference between benign and malignant myxoid STTs, with substantial inter-reader reliability. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of T1 heterogeneity were 55.6%, 83.3%, 88.2%, 45.5%, and 64.1%, respectively. Among the texture features, T2w-WavEnLL_s-3 showed good diagnostic performance, and T2w-WavEnLL_s-4 and GeoW4 showed fair diagnostic performance. The logistic regression model including T1 heterogeneity and T2_WavEnLL_s-4 showed good diagnostic performance. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the overall qualitative assessment by a radiologist and the predictor model. Geometry-based and wavelet-derived texture features from T2-weighted images were significantly different between benign and malignant myxoid STTs. However, the texture features had a limited additive value in differentiating benign from malignant myxoid STTs."

Participants of both genders of age >17 years, currently residing in Pakistan, who had access to internet and understood English were included in the survey. The survey was designed on Google form and was distributed digitally across different areas of Pakistan via social media. Survey included questions regarding socio-demographics, facemask adherence and perceived barriers related to facemask adherence such as perceived risks, health concerns, comfort, social influences, religious/cultural norms and social protocols and health recommendations. SPSS version 23 was used to analyze data. Independent t-test/One-way ANOVA was applied to assess significant difference between perceived barriers to wear face mask and socio-demographic factors, p-value ≤0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Post-hoc LSD test was also applied where applicable.Only 20% of the participants reported non-adherence to facemask. Amongst these participants, majority agreed that comfort was the main barrier precluding them from wearing a mask, 89.4% subjects saying that it was too hot to wear it and 84.1% saying that a mask was too uncomfortable to wear. Whereas, 82.1% highly agreed that difficulty in breathing is perceived barrier related to facemask usage. Statistically significant difference was found between health concerns with gender (p = 0.031), locality (p = 0.001) and religion (p = 0.03); comfort with locality (p = 0.007); social influences with gender (p = 0.001), ethnicity (p = 0.001) and locality (p = 0.017); cultural/religious norms with religion (p = 0.001) and social protocols and health recommendations with age (p = 0.015).Despite of satisfactory facemask adherence, still there are perceived barriers to it. In order to increase utilization of face masks among the general population, strict health policies should be implemented and awareness regarding the importance of face masks should be enhanced by educational interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4280619772,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of vertical trunk supportability improvement on activities. The study participants were 36 people. Trunk function and physical performance were evaluated using the following tests: trunk righting test (TRT), maximal isometric knee extensor strength test, side hop test, triple hop distance test, stabilometry of one-leg standing, and one-leg rebound jump. The measurement was performed three times: pre-trunk training (pre), post-trunk training for 1 month (post), and 2 months after the second measurement (detraining). Details of trunk training: Two sets of 30-s maximal lateral reach exercises on each side, following the four sets of 15-s maximal raising trunk exercises on each side. The results with TRT in post-training were significantly larger than those in pre-and detraining. Similarly, the results with one-leg rebound jump efficiency in post-training were significantly larger than those in pre-and detraining. Our findings indicate that jump efficiency changes in proportion to the change in vertical trunk supportability."

Identifying risk factors for anal HPV 16 infection, the most significant risk factor for anal cancer, is essential for prevention and screening strategies.In the EVVA Cohort study, 151 WLHIV had cervical and anal HPV testing with genotyping every 6 months for 2 years, while demographic and clinical data were collected via questionnaires and chart reviews. Here, we present results of baseline data analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.Among 150 women with adequate HPV test results at baseline, HPV 16 DNA was detected anally in 23 (15.3%; 95%CI:10.4-22.1) and cervically in 5 (3.3%; 95%CI:1.4-7.8). In multivariable analysis, current smoking (OR = 6.0; 95%CI: 1.5-23.9), nadir CD4 count ≤ 200 cells/μL (OR = 8.4; 95%CI: 2.0-34.3), prevalent cervical HPV 16 (OR = 14.7; 95%CI: 1.0-222.5) and anogenital herpes in previous 6 months (OR = 9.8, 95%CI: 1.7-56.8) were associated with prevalent anal HPV 16.Knowledge of risk factors can help identify WLHIV at greatest risk of anal HPV 16 infection and, potentially, developing subsequent anal cancer.

https://openalex.org/W4280654358,"The identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among immigrants from high-incidence regions who move to low-incidence countries is generally considered an ineffective strategy because only ≈14% of them comply with the multiple steps of the 'cascade of care' and complete treatment. In the Estrie region of Canada, a refugee clinic was opened in 2009. One of its goals is LTBI management.Key components of this intervention included: close collaboration with community organizations, integration within a comprehensive package of medical care for the whole family, timely delivery following arrival, shorter treatment through preferential use of rifampin, and risk-based selection of patients to be treated. Between 2009-2020, 5131 refugees were evaluated. To determine the efficacy and benefit-cost ratio of this intervention, records of refugees seen in 2010-14 (n = 1906) and 2018-19 (n = 1638) were reviewed. Cases of tuberculosis (TB) among our foreign-born population occurring before (1997-2008) and after (2009-2020) setting up the clinic were identified. All costs associated with TB or LTBI were measured.Out of 441 patients offered LTBI treatment, 374 (85%) were compliant. Adding other losses, overall compliance was 69%. To prevent one case of TB, 95.1 individuals had to be screened and 11.9 treated, at a cost of $16,056. After discounting, each case of TB averted represented $32,631, for a benefit-cost ratio of 2.03. Among nationals of the 20 countries where refugees came from, incidence of TB decreased from 68.2 (1997-2008) to 26.3 per 100,000 person-years (2009-2020). Incidence among foreign-born persons from all other countries not targeted by the intervention did not change.Among refugees settling in our region, 69% completed the LTBI cascade of care, leading to a 61% reduction in TB incidence. This intervention was cost-beneficial. Current defeatism towards LTBI management among immigrants and refugees is misguided. Compliance can be enhanced through simple measures."

Incompletely understood pleiotropic statin effects include vasoprotection that might originate from mobilisation and differentiation of vascular progenitor cells. Data on the potentially differential impact of statin treatment intensity on circulating progenitor cells in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are scarce. This study examines the potential association of different permanent statin treatment regimens on circulating progenitor cells in patients with coronary syndrome.In a monocentric prospective all-comers study, 105 consecutive cases scheduled for coronary angiography due to either (A) non-invasive proof of ischemia and chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) or (B) troponin-positive acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were included. According to the 2018 American College of Cardiology Guidelines on Blood Cholesterol, patients were clustered depending on their respective permanent statin treatment regimen in either a high- to moderate-intensity statin treatment (HIST) or a low-intensity statin treatment (LIST) group. Baseline characteristics including LDL levels were comparable. From blood drawn at the time of PCI, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, cultivated and counted and, by density gradient centrifugation, levels of circulating progenitor cells were determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. In ACS patients both absolute and relative numbers of circulating early-outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) concurrently were significantly lower in the HIST group as compared to the LIST group. This effect was more pronounced in ACS patients than in CCS patients. Both in ACS and CCS patients, HIST caused a significant reduction of the number of circulating SMPCs.In patients undergoing PCI, a dose intensity-dependent and LDL level-independent pro-differentiating vasoprotective pleiotropic capacity of statins for EPC and SMPC is demonstrated."

The aim of this study was to determine the physical properties of S. madagascariensis fruit and seeds to aid in food processing equipment development. Fruit physical properties were determined at four progressive ripening stages, as well as the seed physical properties and mineral composition. The pulp contributed the most towards fruit composition across stages of ripeness (c 50%), followed by the rind (c 30%) and seeds (c 20%). Furthermore, significant variations in seed physical properties were observed at progressive maturity stages. The seeds showed significantly greater mineral compositions in unripe-green fruit in comparison to fruit at progressive ripening stages. The data provided may serve as a basis for the development of processing procedures and equipment and suggests that seeds of unripe-green fruit hold greater nutritional benefits."

At each time point dancers provided self-reported pain outcomes (Numerical Rating Scale as a measure of pain severity and Patient Specific Functional Scale as a measure of pain related disability) and wore a wearable sensor system. This system combined wearable sensors with previously developed machine learning models capable of capturing movement quantity and quality outcomes. A series of linear mixed models were applied to determine if there was an association between dancers' movement quantity and quality over the 4 time points with pain severity and pain related disability.Almost all dancers (n = 50) experienced pain, and half of the dancers experienced disabling pain (n = 26). Significant associations were evident for pain related disability and movement quantity and quality variables. Specifically, greater pain related disability was associated with more light activity, fewer leg lifts to the front, a shorter average duration of leg lifts to the front and fewer total leg lifts. Greater pain related disability was also associated with higher thigh elevation angles to the side. There was no evidence for associations between movement quantity and quality variables and pain severity.Despite a high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain, dancers' levels of pain severity and disability were generally low. Between-person level associations were identified between dancers' movement quantity and quality, and pain related disability. These findings may reflect dancers' adaptations to pain related disability, while they continue to dance. This proof-of-concept research provides a compelling model for future work exploring dancers' pain using field-based, serial data collection."

https://openalex.org/W4280605886,"We investigated the effect of the optical blurring of X-ray source on digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) image quality using well-designed DBT simulator and table-top experimental systems. To measure the in-plane modulation transfer function (MTF), we used simulated sphere phantom and Teflon sphere phantom and generated their projection data using two acquisition modes (i.e., step-and-shoot mode and continuous mode). After reconstruction, we measured the in-plane MTF using reconstructed sphere phantom images. In addition, we measured the anatomical noise power spectrum (aNPS) and signal detectability. We constructed simulated breast phantoms with a 50% volume glandular fraction (VGF) of breast anatomy using the power law spectrum and inserted spherical objects with 1 mm, 2 mm, and 5 mm diameters as breast masses. Projection data were acquired using two acquisition modes, and in-plane breast images were reconstructed using the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm. For the experimental study, we used BR3D breast phantom with 50% VGF and obtained projection data using a table-top experimental system. To compare the detection performance of the two acquisition modes, we calculated the signal detectability using the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) with Laguerre-Gauss (LG) channels. Our results show that spatial resolution of in-plane image in continuous mode was degraded due to the optical blurring of X-ray source. This blurring effect was reflected in aNPS, resulting in large β values. From a signal detectability perspective, the signal detectability in step-and-shoot mode is higher than that in continuous mode for small spherical signals but not large spherical signals. Although the step-and-shoot mode has disadvantage in terms of scan time compared to the continuous mode, scanning in step-and-shoot mode is better for detecting small signals, indicating that there is a tradeoff between scan time and image quality."
https://openalex.org/W4280619492,"Significant alterations in signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory programs together represent major hallmarks of many cancers. These, among all, include the reactivation of stemness, which is registered by the expression of pathways that are active in the embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we assembled gene sets that reflect the stemness and proliferation signatures and used them to analyze a large panel of RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Consortium in order to specifically assess the expression of stemness-related and proliferation-related genes across a collection of different tumor types. We introduced a metric that captures the collective similarity of the expression profile of a tumor to that of ESCs, which showed that stemness and proliferation signatures vary greatly between different tumor types. We also observed a high degree of intertumoral heterogeneity in the expression of stemness- and proliferation-related genes, which was associated with increased hazard ratios in a fraction of tumors and mirrored by high intratumoral heterogeneity and a remarkable stemness capacity in metastatic lesions across cancer cells in single cell RNA-seq datasets. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of stemness signatures is highly heterogeneous and cannot be used as a universal determinant of cancer. This calls into question the universal validity of diagnostic tests that are based on stem cell markers."
