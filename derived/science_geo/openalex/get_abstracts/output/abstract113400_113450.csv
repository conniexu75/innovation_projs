https://openalex.org/W2051473177,"Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is thought to serve as an elementary mechanism for the establishment of certain forms of explicit memory in the mammalian brain. As is the case with behavioral memory, LTP in the CA1 region has stages: a short-term early potentiation lasting 1 to 3 hours, which is independent of protein synthesis, precedes a later, longer lasting stage (L-LTP), which requires protein synthesis. Inhibitors of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) blocked L-LTP, and analogs of cAMP induced a potentiation that blocked naturally induced L-LTP. The action of the cAMP analog was blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Thus, activation of PKA may be a component of the mechanism that generates L-LTP."

https://openalex.org/W2166670696,"The ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor complex is shown here to include the CNTF binding protein (CNTFR alpha) as well as the components of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, LIFR beta (the LIF binding protein) and gp130 [the signal transducer of interleukin-6 (IL-6)]. Thus, the conversion of a bipartite LIF receptor into a tripartite CNTF receptor apparently occurs by the addition of the specificity-conferring element CNTFR alpha. Both CNTF and LIF trigger the association of initially separate receptor components, which in turn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor subunits. Unlike the IL-6 receptor complex in which homodimerization of gp130 appears to be critical for signal initiation, signaling by the CNTF and LIF receptor complexes depends on the heterodimerization of gp130 with LIFR beta. Ligand-induced dimerization of signal-transducing receptor components, also seen with receptor tyrosine kinases, may provide a general mechanism for the transmission of a signal across the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2057756085,"Phytochrome is a well-characterized plant photoreceptor, able to modulate many morphological, physiological, and biochemical events through as yet undefined mechanisms. By developing single-cell assays to visualize phytochrome responses, we have studied the effects of microinjecting putative signaling intermediates into phytochrome-deficient tomato cells. We demonstrate that phytochrome phototransduction initially involves the activation of one or more G proteins that are coupled to at least two different pathways; one pathway requires calcium and activated calmodulin and can stimulate expression of a photoregulated cab-GUS reporter gene together with the synthesis and assembly of some, but not all, of the photosynthetic complexes. The other pathway, controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis, does not require calcium. Furthermore, our results reveal that phytochrome signaling is cell autonomous and is not likely to require any light-activated steps downstream of the G protein."
https://openalex.org/W2040159897,"For papillomavirus DNA replication, the E2 enhancer protein cooperatively assists in binding of the E1 helicase to the origin. We report that, at limiting E1 and E2 levels, the enhancer proteins GAL4-VP16 and GAL4-p53(1-73) stimulate BPV in vitro DNA replication. This cell-free system was used to ascertain whether the acidic activation domains have a cellular target important for replication. Cellular extracts were depleted of replication activity by passage through a VP16 affinity column. The protein depleted was the cellular factor replication protein A. The direct interaction between replication protein A and VP16, as well as the activation of replication by VP16, is dependent upon the C-terminus of the VP16 activation domain. E2 and the activation domain of p53 also interact with replication protein A. We suggest that a link between transcription and replication involves factors that help convert a closed DNA complex to an open complex."
https://openalex.org/W2053597753,"The degradation of most cellular proteins starts with their covalent conjugation with ubiquitin. This labels the proteins for rapid hydrolysis to oligopeptides by a (26S) proteolytic complex containing a (20S) degradative particle called the proteasome. Some system in the cytosol also generates antigenic peptides from endogenously synthesized cellular and viral proteins. These peptides bind to newly synthesized class I major histocompatibility complex molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and peptide/class I complexes are then transported to the cell surface for presentation to cytotoxic T cells. How these peptides are produced is unknown, although a modification that promotes ubiquitin-dependent degradation of a viral protein enhances its presentation with class I13 and indirect evidence suggests a role for proteolytic particles closely resembling and perhaps identical to the proteasome. Using cells that exhibit a temperature-sensitive defect in ubiquitin conjugation, we report here that non-permissive temperature inhibited class I-restricted presentation of ovalbumin introduced into the cytosol, but did not affect presentation of an ovalbumin peptide synthesized from a minigene. These results implicate the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway in the production of antigenic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1508985019,"Erythrocytes have long been appreciated as transporters and exchangers of O2 and CO2 between the lungs and the tissues. Here we examine the role of erythrocytes as potential mediators of inflammatory processes by assessing their ability to bind to a number of inflammatory peptides of the chemokine (for chemoattractant cytokine) superfamily. Radiolabeled chemokines of either the C-X-C (IL-8, MGSA/gro, NAP-2) or C-C (RANTES, MCP-1) class bind reversibly to red cell surface receptors numbering 1000-9000 sites/cell with a Kd of approximately 5 nM. In contrast to what is seen for chemokine binding to target inflammatory cells, chemokines of either class displace heterologous chemokines, indicating that the proteins are competing for a promiscuous receptor. Chemical cross-linking with radiolabeled chemokines reveals a 30-38-kilodalton protein on the red cell surface, and cross-linking is inhibited in the presence of heterologous unlabeled chemokines. These data show that red blood cells possess a multispecific receptor for the newly identified chemokine superfamily of inflammatory cytokines, and thus the red cell may play a novel role as a regulator of inflammatory processes."

https://openalex.org/W2052875832,"Glutamate antagonists protect neurons from hypoxic injury both in vivo and in vitro, but in vitro studies have not been done under the acidic conditions typical of hypoxia-ischemia in vivo. Consistent with glutamate receptor antagonism, extracellular acidity reduced neuronal death in murine cortical cultures that were deprived of oxygen and glucose. Under these acid conditions, N-methyl-D-aspartate and Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate-kainate antagonists further reduced neuronal death, such that some neurons tolerated prolonged oxygen and glucose deprivation almost as well as did astrocytes. Neuroprotection induced by this combination exceeded that induced by glutamate antagonists alone, suggesting that extracellular acidity has beneficial effects beyond the attenuation of ionotropic glutamate receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1577713059,"Methyl-directed mismatch repair is initiated by the mismatch-provoked, MutHLS-dependent cleavage of the unmodified strand at a hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence. This reaction is independent of the polarity of the unmodified strand and can occur either 3' or 5' to the mismatch on the unmethylated strand (Au, K. G., Welsh, K., and Modrich, P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12142-12148). The overall repair reaction also occurs without regard to polarity of the unmethylated strand. Both hemimethylated configurations of a linear heteroduplex containing a single d(GATC) sequence are subject to methyl-directed correction in Escherichia coli extracts and in a purified repair system. Repair of both heteroduplex orientations requires MutH, MutL, MutS, DNA helicase II, SSB, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, but the two substrates differ with respect to exonuclease requirements for correction. When the unmethylated d(GATC) sequence that directs repair is located 5' to the mismatch on the unmodified strand, mismatch correction requires the 5'--> 3' hydrolytic activity of exonuclease VII or RecJ exonuclease. Repair directed by an unmodified d(GATC) sequence situated 3' to the mismatch depends on the 3'--> 5' activity of exonuclease I. Specific requirements for these activities are evident with circular heteroduplexes containing a single asymmetrically placed d(GATC) sequence, with the requirement for a 5'--> 3' or 3'--> 5' hydrolytic activity being determined by the orientation of the unmethylated strand along the shorter path joining the two sites in the DNA circle. This observation suggests that the methyl-directed repair system utilizes the proximal d(GATC) sequence to direct correction. To our knowledge, these experiments represent the first instance in which exonuclease I, exonuclease VII, and RecJ have been implicated in a particular DNA metabolic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1641644248,"To prove the postulated role of type beta transforming growth factors (TGF beta) in cardiac development and other events, specific inhibitors of TGF beta signal transduction are needed. We truncated the type II TGF beta receptor cDNA (delta kT beta RII), to delete the predicted serine/threonine kinase cytoplasmic domain. delta kT beta RII was co-transfected into neonatal cardiac myocytes, together with reporter constructs for two cardiac-restricted genes that are regulated antithetically by TGF beta. delta kT beta RII impaired activation of the skeletal alpha-actin promoter by TGF beta 1, -2, and -3 and, conversely, impaired TGF beta inhibition of alpha-myosin heavy chain transcription. Thus, a kinase-defective T beta RII blocks signaling by all three mammalian TGF beta isoforms, and can disrupt both positive and negative control of transcription by TGF beta."
https://openalex.org/W1549298104,"Cholera toxin (CT) consists of a pentameric B subunit which binds to ganglioside GM1 on the cell surface and an A subunit which activates adenylylcyclase. The latter process involves the reduction of A to the A1 peptide which ADP-ribosylates the stimulatory G protein, Gs of adenylylcyclase. There is a distinct lag phase between toxin binding and activation of adenylylcyclase. Little is known about the events during this lag including where A1 is generated and how it gains access to Gs on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. We explored the effects of several inhibitors of intracellular trafficking on the response of human SK-N-MC neurotumor and Caco-2 intestinal tumor cells to CT. Whereas chloroquine or monensin had little or no effect on CT stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation, brefeldin A (BFA) totally inhibited the response to CT in a time- and dose-dependent and reversible manner. BFA was effective when added at the same time as CT and had an IC50 of 30 ng/ml. BFA did not alter cell surface GM1 as cells treated with BFA for 30 min bound as much 125I-CT as control cells. Furthermore, BFA inhibited CT stimulation of GM1-treated rat glioma C6 cells. BFA treatment did not affect beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation of cyclic AMP. In addition, adenylylcyclase was activated by A1 peptide and NAD+ to the same extent in membranes from control and BFA-treated cells, or when BFA was added directly to the assay. Whereas control cells generated small amounts of A1 from bound CT with time, no A1 was detected in BFA-treated cells. BFA treatment did not prevent the internalization of CT but did inhibit its degradation. BFA is known to disrupt the organization of the Golgi complex, resulting in inhibition of protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and redistribution of Golgi enzymes to the endoplasmic reticulum. BFA also prevents the formation of non-clathrin-coated vesicles from Golgi membranes and thus vesicular transport between Golgi cisternae. We confirmed that BFA caused the morphological disruption of the Golgi apparatus in Caco-2 cells. The data support a role for a functional Golgi apparatus with its associated vesicular routing in CT action."
https://openalex.org/W1551287182,"Hepatic parenchymal cells play an essential role in the clearance of circulating tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in vivo as a major pathway in the regulation of plasma fibrinolytic activity. Previous studies have identified plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1)-dependent t-PA-binding sites in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. In this study, we demonstrate that receptor-mediated binding and endocytosis of the t-PA-PAI-1 complex are largely mediated by a recently identified low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). A 39-kDa LRP receptor-associated protein that modulates ligand binding to LRP was found to bind specifically to HepG2 cells and to inhibit approximately 70-80% of specific 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 binding. This inhibition by the 39-kDa protein was not due to inhibition of complex formation between 125I-t-PA and PAI-1; instead, the 39-kDa protein inhibited 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 binding to LRP. Polyclonal anti-LRP antibody raised against purified human LRP also inhibited 70-80% of specific 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 binding. A similar extent of inhibition by the 39-kDa protein was also observed for 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 endocytosis and degradation. Chemical cross-linking experiments demonstrated the direct interaction between 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 and LRP on HepG2 cells as anti-LRP antibody, in addition to anti-t-PA and anti-PAI-1 antibodies, was able to immunoprecipitate the 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 complex following binding of 125I-t-PA.PAI-1 to HepG2 cells and cross-linking. This interaction of the t-PA.PAI-1 complex with LRP on HepG2 cells was also observed when the unlabeled t-PA.PAI-1 complex was cross-linked to [35S]methionine-labeled HepG2 cells. In addition, the direct binding of the 39-kDa protein to LRP on HepG2 cells was demonstrated by similar cross-linking experiments. Thus, these data clearly show that LRP is the major cell-surface receptor responsible for t-PA.PAI-1 complex binding and endocytosis on human hepatoma HepG2 cells and extend the multifunctional nature of LRP as an endocytosis receptor for several structurally and functionally distinct ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1563422013,"Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify a 94-kDa protein that was greatly enriched in traids and junctional face membranes (9.3 +/- 0.2%) but not detected in the transverse tubular and nonjunctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The 94-kDa protein is a hydrophobic glycoprotein based on endoglycosidase H sensitivity, concanavalin A binding, and labelling with a hydrophobic probe. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of reducing agents suggests that this protein is present as a population of multimeric structures containing a variable number of the 94-kDa subunits. Immunofluorescent staining of serial transverse sections of skeletal muscle shows staining of all fiber types with preferential staining of type II fast fibers. Specific immunofluorescence staining in longitudinal sections of skeletal muscle is confined to the interface between the A- and I-bands where the triad structures are localized. Immunocolloidal gold labeling revealed the 94-kDa glycoprotein to be localized over a region of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum where the ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ release channel is localized. The distribution and high abundance of the 94-kDa glycoprotein in the junctional membrane suggest that it performs a structural or functional role in the storage or release of calcium from the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1548554375,"Inhibition of the various cloned Gs-sensitive adenylyl cyclases was studied. The effect of mutant-activated Gi2-alpha on types 2, 3, and 6 adenylyl cyclases was analyzed after co-transfection into COS-7 cells. These adenylyl cyclases were chosen as representative members of the distinct families of mammalian adenylyl cyclases. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding (a) the required type of adenylyl cyclase, (b) luteinizing hormone receptor, and (c) Q205LGi2-alpha or Q205LGo1-alpha. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated cAMP accumulation was then measured. Transfection with Q205LGi2-alpha but not Q205LGo1-alpha resulted in 50-60% inhibition of hCG-stimulated cAMP accumulation of the type 2 adenylyl cyclase. hCG stimulation of types 3 and 6 adenylyl cyclases was also extensively inhibited by co-transfection with the Q205LGi2-alpha cDNA. Treatment with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate of cells transfected with the type 2 enzyme cDNA resulted in a 2-fold increase of the hCG-stimulated cAMP accumulation and a complete suppression of the Q205LGi2-alpha inhibition of the type 2 adenylyl cyclase. However, similar treatment did not affect Q205LGi2-alpha inhibition of the type 3 and type 6 adenylyl cyclases. These data indicate that many if not all types of adenylyl cyclases may be susceptible to inhibition by Gi2-alpha, but this inhibition can be regulated by protein kinase C in a type-specific manner."

https://openalex.org/W1597228305,"Rapamycin (RAP) has recently been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation and activity of p70 S6 kinase (p70s6k). In interleukin (IL)-2-induced cell activation of the human IL-2-dependent T-cell line, Kit225, RAP inhibited p70s6k phosphorylation and activation, but not the activation of MAP kinase, p90 S6 kinase (p90rsk), early tyrosine kinases, or the transcription of the c-fos and c-myc genes. Cell cycle progression induced by IL-2 was arrested by RAP prior to p110Rb phosphorylation and the major increase in total RNA synthesis, both of which were initiated around 6 h after addition of IL-2 and 9 h before the beginning of DNA synthesis. Interestingly, RAP could not inhibit DNA synthesis if addition of the drug was delayed for 6 h after addition of IL-2, despite the fact that even at this time, RAP rapidly induced the accumulation of the dephosphorylated form of p70s6k and that p70s6k was inactivated within 1 h of RAP addition. Furthermore, when RAP was added to continuously growing Kit225 cells, cell proliferation was maintained for at least two additional cell cycles, in the absence of apparent p70s6k activity. These results indicate that 1) among the earliest detectable signals after IL-2 treatment, RAP selectively inhibits p70s6k activation, 2) RAP inactivates p70s6k regardless of the stage of the cell cycle in which the drug is added, 3) RAP blocks resting T-cells from entering the cell cycle, but does not directly arrest cell cycle progression once cells have entered the cycle, and 4) inactivation of p70s6k does not cause immediate arrest of cell cycle progression once cells have entered the cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1520646806,"To study the signal transduction mechanism of interleukin-4 (IL-4), we have examined the effects of IL-4 on protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a mouse IL-2-dependent T cell line, HT2. Mouse IL-4 induces HT2 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analyses using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of four proteins (140, 110, 100, and 92 kDa) in a dose-dependent manner. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected within 1 min and reached a plateau approximately at 10 min after IL-4 stimulation. Immunoprecipitation using anti-IL-4 receptor antibody revealed that the 140-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity in immunoprecipitates with anti-IL-4R antibody increases after IL-4 stimulation. These data indicate that IL-4 induces activation of tyrosine kinase and also induces association between IL-4R and PI 3-kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1585333435,"A peroxisome proliferator-responsive element is located in the 5'-flanking region of the gene encoding rat hydratase-dehydrogenase, the second enzyme of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway. DNase I footprint analysis with nuclear extracts from proliferator-responsive rat H4IIEC3 cells revealed two protected regions within the 196-base pair peroxisome proliferator-responsive element. Both regions contained multiple copies of a motif related to the consensus steroid hormone receptor binding half-site TGACCT, suggesting that peroxisome proliferator-dependent activation of this gene is mediated via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Region II contains three TGACCT-like motifs in a direct repeat array. An oligonucleotide corresponding to this region was sufficient to confer responsiveness to the peroxisome proliferator ciprofibrate onto a heterologous promoter, as determined by transient transfection assays. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that nuclear factors bound to the hydratase-dehydrogenase oligonucleotide. Mutation of a single G residue within the second repeat motif abolished factor binding and consequently the ability of the element to respond to ciprofibrate, directly demonstrating that factor binding is necessary for peroxisome proliferator responsiveness. These results are discussed in the context of our current understanding of the mechanism of the coordinated transcriptional induction of the genes encoding peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes by peroxisome proliferators."
https://openalex.org/W38907838,"Emptying the intracellular calcium stores of fura-2-loaded human neutrophils by treatment with the endomembrane ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin leads to a maintained increase of [Ca2+]i by Ca2+ entry through a store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway. Under these conditions, [Ca2+]i was reduced transiently by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and permanently by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB). Platelet-activating factor (PAF) had no effect. The fMLP- and PDB-induced [Ca2+]i decreases were not due to stimulated Ca2+ efflux but to inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway. PDB and fMLP, but not PAF, inhibited the entry of Ca2+, Mn2+, and Ba2+ in thapsigargin-treated cells. This inhibition was dependent on [Ca2+]i, barely detectable at [Ca2+]i of 50 nM and increasingly strong and fast to appear at 170 and 630 nM. Inhibition of entry by fMLP was complete within 5-10s, disappeared within 2-3 min, and was partially prevented by staurosporin (100 nM). Inhibition by PDB was equally fast, but no recovery was detected within 5 min, and it was fully prevented by staurosporin. The inhibitory effect of fMLP had similar characteristics when PAF was used instead of thapsigargin to induce the entry of Ca2+ or Mn2+. We conclude that fMLP, but not PAF, is able to produce a transient inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway, probably mediated by protein kinase C. This action could be part of a general homeostatic mechanism designed to moderate [Ca2+]i increases induced by some agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2144952776,"Yeast cells express an alternate enzyme encoded by the YAP3 gene which can process pro-alpha-mating factor when this pheromone is overexpressed in KEX2-deficient mutants. The YAP3 gene product is an aspartic protease (YAP3) that cleaves at paired basic residues (Egel-Mittani, M., Flygenring, H.P., and Hansen, M. T. (1990) Yeast 6, 127-137). In this study, the YAP3 gene was overexpressed in the BJ 3501 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. YAP3 was purified to apparent homogeneity using concanavalin A and pepstatin A affinity chromatography. The enzyme was characterized as an M(r) 68,000 glycoprotein with a pH optimum of 4.0-4.5. It was inhibited by pepstatin A and activated by 5 mM Ca2+. YAP3 cleaved at paired basic residues of mouse pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) to yield adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and beta-lipotropin (LPH); human beta-LPH to yield beta-endorphin-(1-31), beta-endorphin-(1-29), beta-endorphin-(1-28), gamma-LPH, and beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; and bovine N-POMC1-77 to yield gamma 3-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. It also cleaved the tetrabasic residues of ACTH1-39 to yield primarily ACTH1-15 and Lys-Arg-corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide. The physical properties, pH optimum, and specificity of YAP3 indicate that it is a homologue of the mammalian POMC-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.23.17), a paired basic residue-specific aspartic protease from bovine pituitary intermediate lobe secretory granules (Loh, Y. P., Parish, D.C., and Tuteja, R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7194-7205)."
https://openalex.org/W2054917360,"Lymphocytes recognize antigens with highly variable heterodimeric surface receptors. Although four distinct antigen receptors could in principle be produced by any lymphocyte, only one functional combination of receptor chains has thus far been found expressed on their surface. Examination of human gamma delta T cells revealed a population that violated this rule by expressing on their surface two distinct functional gamma delta T cell receptors (TCRs) that used different TCR gamma gene alleles. Thus, current models for T cell clonal selection may need modification, and a possible escape mechanism for autoreactive TCRs is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1490726047,"Human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and follitropin (FSH) belong to the glycoprotein hormone family. These hormones are heterodimers and composed of a common alpha subunit and a distinct beta subunit which confers receptor-binding specificities. In addition to this structural similarity, they share a similar signal pathway involving G protein, adenylyl-cyclase and induction of cAMP synthesis. Therefore, a presumptive relationship of these common structure and function has been the subject of extensive past investigations, but a definitive clue has been elusive. As a step to address this important issue, a series of recombinant mutants of hCG and human FSH were generated in which the COOH-terminal amino acids of the alpha subunit were successively removed or substituted. Furthermore, a set of peptides were synthesized with sequences corresponding to different regions of the alpha subunit. Deletion of the alpha COOH-terminal Ser92 had no effect on receptor-binding or cAMP induction by FSH and hCG. Truncation of alpha Lys91-Ser92 or alpha His90-Lys91-Ser92 abolished the ability of both hormones to induce cAMP synthesis. It significantly reduced receptor binding of FSH but not hCG. The different functions of the alpha COOH-terminal region are further noticed with a peptide corresponding to the last 10 amino acids of alpha. It failed to bind to the FSH receptor but was capable of binding to the LH/CG receptor and stimulating cAMP synthesis. These results are the first conclusive evidence that alpha His90-Lys91 play an essential role in cAMP induction of both hormones. In contrast to this common role, they are necessary for FSH binding to the FSH receptor but not for hCG binding to the LH/CG receptor. The hCG alpha COOH-terminal region makes direct contact with the LH/CG receptor, and this low affinity contact is necessary and sufficient to activate the receptor for signal generation. This conclusion is supported by the study using mutant hCGs in which either alpha His90 or Lys91 was substituted."

https://openalex.org/W1599290585,"Deletion of QCR9, the nuclear gene encoding the 7.3-kDa subunit 9 of the cytochrome bc1 complex, impairs respiration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, coincident with loss of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity. Optical spectra of mitochondrial membranes from yeast in which the gene for subunit 9 is deleted show a diminution of cytochrome b absorption similar to the spectra of membranes from yeast in which the gene for the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is deleted, suggesting an interaction between subunit 9, iron-sulfur protein, and cytochrome b. Synthesis of cytochrome b by mitochondria from the deletion strain is unimpaired, indicating that the diminished b absorption is due to a post-assembly effect on the heme environment resulting from the absence of subunit 9. Iron-sulfur protein is present in normal amounts and processed to its mature form in the absence of subunit 9, although the protein is more labile to endogenous proteases during the isolation of membranes. EPR spectroscopy of membranes from the subunit 9 deletion strain indicates that the g = 1.90 signal characteristic of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster is absent, even though mature sized apoprotein is present. Pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome c1 is markedly slowed, but not eliminated, in the subunit 9 deletion strain, which suggests that an EPR-silent, sluggishly reactive derivative of the iron-sulfur cluster is present. These results suggest that in the absence of subunit 9 the conformation of iron-sulfur protein is altered such that the protein is more labile, the iron-sulfur cluster is not properly inserted, and iron-sulfur protein interaction with cytochrome b is modified in a manner which distorts the heme environment. This is the first instance in which deletion of one of the supernumerary subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex results in the loss of function of a redox center within the complex, without a concomitant loss of other subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1606862563,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase activity is inhibited by growth factor-stimulated kinases involved in cellular signaling. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is activated in response to a wide variety of growth modulating agents including EGF. To determine whether MAP kinase can inactivate the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, we investigated the effect of pp42 MAP kinase on the EGF receptor. The results indicate that direct phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by MAP kinase does not alter receptor tyrosine kinase activity. However, MAP kinase can decrease EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation through a vanadate-sensitive pathway involving activation of a tyrosine phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1580046657,"In the present study, we examined the ability of the phosphatase inhibitors p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) to inhibit phospholipase D (PLD) activation in the rabbit peritoneal neutrophil. Also assessed were choline, a product of PLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, and its metabolite phosphocholine. PLD activity was determined by measuring the accumulation, in the presence of ethanol, of [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt) in neutrophils prelabeled with 1-O-[3H]octadecyl-2-lyso-snglycero-3-phosphocholine. Of the compounds tested, only DPG interfered with PLD activation by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, it augmented fMLP-stimulated levels of [3H]inositol phosphates in myo-[3H]inositol-labeled neutrophils. DPG also prevented PLD activation by the calcium ionophore ionomycin and by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The suppression of PLD activation by DPG appeared to arise from direct interaction with the enzyme, as evidenced by a DPG competitive pattern of inhibition (Ki = 9.0 +/- 1.5 mM) for PLD from Streptomyces chromofuscus. These results suggest that DPG may be a useful tool for investigating the role of PLD in physiological function in a wide variety of cell types. Interestingly, DPG inhibited fMLP-induced N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase release and O2- generation by the cytochalasin B-primed neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had minimal effect (at concentrations up to 5 mM) on O2- generation induced by fMLP in nonprimed cells. These results suggest that PLD plays an important role in fMLP stimulation of both N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase release and O2- generation in the primed neutrophils, but that a PLD-independent pathway plays the primary role in O2- generation by the nonprimed neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1482533850,"A potential dolichol recognition sequence (PDRS) with the 11-residue consensus F-I/V-X-F/Y-X-X-I-P-F-X-F/Y can be found in each of five microsomal enzymes that interact with dolichol or a dolichol derivative. However, no direct evidence demonstrating a role for the PDRSs has been reported. Hamster UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase (GPT) differs from the other enzymes by having two PDRSs. Stable CHO-K1 transfectants were created that expressed elevated amounts of normal GPT, GPT with a scramble mutation at the first PDRS (nearest the amino terminus), or GPT with a triple alanine-replacement mutation at the second PDRS. The mutant enzymes had no detectable catalytic activity in vivo, but were fully capable of conferring cellular resistance to the GPT inhibitor tunicamycin. In vitro studies with membrane preparations confirmed that the mutant enzymes were catalytically inactive and also showed that their recovery in microsomes was diminished compared with normal enzyme. These data demonstrate that each PDRS of hamster GPT is necessary for normal enzyme function. The implications of these data for possible roles of the PDRSs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1941689623,"Group II introns have a phylogenetically conserved 5'-terminal pentanucleotide, -G1U2G3C4G5-, that resembles the conserved 5' end sequence of nuclear pre-mRNA introns. No functional interaction or catalytic role for the conserved G1 position has been proposed, although a tertiary structure involving -G3C4- has been implicated in splicing in vitro. We have analyzed splicing phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo for all three point mutants affecting guanosine at position 1 (G1) of intron 5 gamma from the COXI gene of yeast mitochondrial DNA. While all of these G1N substitutions slow splicing in vitro, G1C is clearly the most defective. All three mutant transcripts splice as accurately as the wild-type transcript, although the yield of lariat intron is reduced. The branched trinucleotide core includes the mutated position 1 nucleotide linked to the canonical branchpoint adenosine. The mutant lariats vary significantly in their susceptibility to the debranching activity from human cells. After wild-type, G1A was most sensitive, G1U was somewhat resistant, while G1C was highly resistant to debranching. These mutant lariats had normal ribozyme activity for promoting spliced exon reopening. The three mutant introns were transformed into otherwise normal yeast mitochondrial DNA. These mutants grow on nonfermentable carbon sources and splce aI5 gamma to yield excised intron lariat and mRNA. Nonetheless, each mutant splices with reduced efficiency, roughly parallel to their in vitro activity. In vivo, all three mutants accumulate both the pre-mRNA retaining intron 5 gamma and the lariat splicing intermediate containing intron and 3' exon. Clearly, this primary sequence element, shared with nuclear pre-mRNA introns, has a very different functional significance in group II splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1608381266,"Phosphorylation of cell surface receptors regulates the physiological response to many hormones and neurotransmitters. We have demonstrated that the receptor for cholecystokinin (CCK), the major secretagogue for the exocrine pancreas, is phosphorylated on serines in response to CCK (Klueppelberg, U.G., Gates, L.K., Gorelick, F.S., and Miller, L.J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2403-2408). Receptor phosphorylation was transient, even in the continued presence of agonist, and suggested a role for pancreatic protein phosphatases (PP) in regulating receptor phosphorylation in the intact cell. Treatment of acinar cells with okadaic acid increased the extent and duration of receptor phosphorylation induced by CCK. Receptor phosphorylated in the intact cell in response to CCK was used as substrate to analyze protein phosphatases in pancreatic acinar cell extracts. The predominant CCK receptor phosphatase activity was found in the cytosol and was potently inhibited by okadaic acid (IC50 = 0.2 nM). This phosphatase activity was unaffected by inhibitor-2, Ca2+, or Mg2+, suggesting that the major receptor phosphatase was PP-2A. Stimulation of cells with CCK resulted in a 3-fold increase in protein phosphatase activity toward the CCK receptor, at the same time that phosphorylase a phosphatase activity was unchanged. This increase in receptor phosphatase activity was reflected only in the cytosol, with the particulate activity unchanged. Consistent with this subcellular localization, the hormone-regulated receptor phosphatase activity was PP-2A, with chromatographic separation demonstrating activity in both PP-2A1 and PP-2A2 forms. These data suggest that CCK coordinates the activity of both protein kinases and phosphatases acting on the CCK receptor to control the extent and duration of receptor phosphorylation in the pancreatic acinar cell."
https://openalex.org/W1483900752,"Inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) binding by Ca2+ and Mg2+ remains a controversial issue: the Ca2+ effect may also be explained by Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation due to a Ca(2+)-sensitive phospholipase C, and the Mg2+ effect by Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation. In this study, we have, therefore, investigated the effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to membranes of the myeloid cell line HL-60 and assayed in parallel phospholipase C activity and Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation. The assays for Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding, Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation were performed under identical experimental conditions. Ca2+ significantly and reversibly decreased Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding at submicromolar concentrations. Ca2+ stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation only at concentrations above 1 microM. At 1 microM [Ca2+], Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding was inhibited by 46 +/- 6%, but no Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation was observed. [Mg2+] between 0 and 1 mM slightly stimulated, while higher concentrations inhibited, Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding. Mg2+ did not activate phospholipase C. Neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ induced relevant Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation under the conditions of the binding assay. The effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding were conserved after solubilization of HL-60 membranes. However, only Mg2+, but not Ca2+, inhibited Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to the receptor that had been partially purified by heparin affinity chromatography. The Ca2+ sensitivity of Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to the partially purified receptor could be reconstituted by addition of the flow-through of the heparin column. No Ca(2+)-dependent Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation was observed in the reconstituted system. Thus, we conclude that both Ca2+ and Mg2+ can inhibit Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding independently of phospholipase C activation and Ins(1,4,5)P3 breakdown. The Ca2+ effect depends upon factors that can be separated biochemically from the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Mg2+ acts either directly on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor or on a closely associated target."
https://openalex.org/W1481016516,"Using the K+ congener Tl+ and rapid mixing combined with special quench techniques, we have investigated (at 20 degrees C) what is usually assumed to be the enzymatic correlate of active transport of K+ by Na,K-ATPase: the Tl(+)-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the K(+)-sensitive phosphointermediate(s), EP, and the resulting occlusion of Tl+ in the enzyme protein. We measured [EP] and [occluded Tl] as a function of time in phosphorylation, as well as dephosphorylation experiments with the following results. First, we found that with 150 mM Na+ and 600 mM Na(+)--NO3- was the anion--[Tl+] = 0.1-1 mM was without influence on the phosphorylation rate. Tl(+)-catalyzed dephosphorylation and Tl+ occlusion appeared to be simultaneous, and the stoichiometry was always 2 Tl+ occluded/EP dephosphorylated. Second, we tried computer simulations of the transient kinetic experiments, using an Albers-Post-type reaction scheme. This produced satisfactory curve-fits only in the case of 150 mM Na+, and although we could arrange that calculated [EP]steady-state was equal to that measured, the calculated steady-state Na,Tl-ATPase hydrolysis rates were always two to four times the rates measured directly. Third, we propose, as one (possibly of several) solution to these discrepancies between model and data, an expanded kinetic model consisting of an initiation reaction sequence followed by a propagation (or steady-state) reaction cycle. In this alternative model the first turnover of the enzyme is kinetically different from subsequent reaction cycles, and this allowed us to obtain both satisfactory curve-fits and accordance between calculated and measured values of hydrolysis-rate and [EP]steady-state."
https://openalex.org/W1672958538,"An isozyme of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) was purified to near homogeneity from bovine cerebellum by a combination of several column chromatography procedures. Approximately 80 micrograms of pure enzyme were obtained from 4 kg of bovine cerebellum, with a final specific activity of 7.5 mumol/min/mg protein in the presence of 0.1% deoxycholate. The enzyme is specific for phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate but does not hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine. The molecular weight of the enzyme determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is approximately 97,000. Polyclonal antibodies to previously characterized PLC isozymes, PLC-beta 1, -beta 2, -gamma 1, -gamma 2, and - delta 1, did not cross-react with the purified cerebellar enzyme. Moreover, polyclonal antibodies prepared against the cerebellar enzyme did not react with purified PLC-beta 1, -beta 2, -gamma 1, -gamma 2, or -delta 1. However, the cerebellar enzyme was recognized by two antibodies generated against peptide sequences common to mammalian PLC isozymes. Comparison of partial amino acid sequences of the purified cerebellar enzyme with the deduced amino acid sequence of each known PLC isozyme shows that the cerebellar enzyme is a novel PLC, which could be classified as a PLC-beta-type isozyme. Thus, we have designated this enzyme PLC-beta 4."

https://openalex.org/W1526524931,"Treatment of the canine renal Na,K-ATPase with N-(2-nitro-4-isothiocyanophenyl)-imidazole (NIPI) results in irreversible loss of enzymatic activity. The reactivity of the protein toward the probe is about 10-fold greater in the E1.Na or sodium-bound form than when it is in the E2.K or potassium-bound form. Fully inactivated enzyme does not bind ATP but binds sodium and potassium and undergoes the major enzyme conformational transitions (Ellis-Davies, G. C. R., and Kaplan, J. H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20570-20576). Labeling of the sodium pump protein with [3H]NIPI in either the E1.Na or E2.K conformations results in the covalent incorporation of one molecule of probe per alpha-subunit of ATPase. Trypsin treatment of purified alpha-subunit, and separation of the digest using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, yields five major radioactive fragments in each case. Amino acid sequencing indicates that only one residue, lysine 501, is labeled by NIPI. This suggests that the integrity of the domain containing Lys501 is essential for both high and low affinity binding of ATP by the Na,K-ATPase. Furthermore, the spatial organization of the protein close to lysine 501 is changed in the E1.Na and E2.K form of the enzyme. This change is reflected in the greater reactivity of lysine 501 in the E1.Na conformation and indicates that the binding of either sodium or potassium ions to their sites on the sodium pump has differential effects on the nucleotide binding domain containing lysine 501."
https://openalex.org/W1565674725,"A approximately 50-kDa protein binds specifically to the 3' terminus of 135-nucleotide Drosophila pre-5 S RNA. Unlabeled poly(U) competes out protein binding and stimulates the activity of a 3'-exonuclease, which eventually degrades the substrate to 120 nucleotides, the size of mature 5 S RNA. In its RNA binding and UV cross-linking properties, the endogenous poly(U)-binding protein resembles human La, an autoantigen that binds the U > 3 3' ends of vertebrate RNA polymerase III primary transcripts. This protein appears to inhibit a 3' exonuclease and could protect 5 S RNA for faithful processing and transport."
https://openalex.org/W1573017510,"Previous studies have demonstrated that human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells differentiate in response to phorbol esters. This event is associated with induction of the c-jun early response gene and appearance of a monocytic phenotype. The present studies have examined the effects of vincristine-selected, multidrug resistance on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. The results demonstrate that multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells, designated HL-60/vinc, fail to respond to TPA with an increase in c-jun transcripts or other phenotypic characteristics of monocytic differentiation. By contrast, treatment of HL-60/vinc cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, induces c-jun transcription, growth arrest, and expression of the c-fms gene. Studies were also performed with an HL-60/vinc revertant (HL-60/vinc/R) line that has regained partial sensitivity to vincristine. The finding that HL-60/vinc/R cells respond to TPA with induction of a monocytic phenotype, but not c-jun expression, suggests that c-jun induction is not obligatory for monocytic differentiation. Other studies further demonstrate that the jun-B and fra-1 genes are induced by TPA in both HL-60/vinc and HL-60/vinc/R cells, whereas c-fos expression is attenuated in the HL-60/vinc line. Since TPA activates protein kinase C (PKC), we examined translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. Although HL-60 and HL-60/vinc/R cells demonstrated translocation of PKC activity, this subcellular redistribution was undetectable in HL-60/vinc cells. Activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family with associated phosphorylation of c-Jun Y-peptide was markedly diminished in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells, but not in response to okadaic acid. Taken together, these findings suggest that vincristine resistance confers insensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation and can include defects in PKC-mediated signaling events and induction of jun/fos early response gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1562373855,"Chicken MyoD1 (CMD1), an equivalent to the mouse MyoD1, expressed in chicken skeletal muscle (Lin, Z.-Y., Dechesne, C. A., Eldridge, J., and Paterson, B. M. (1989) Genes & Dev. 3, 986-996), was produced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells by Baculovirus expression vector and purified to almost homogeneity. This CMD1 was directly demonstrated to be a phosphoprotein by a 32P-labeling experiment. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that only serine residue was phosphorylated. Phosphoamino acid of CMD1 from chick primary culture of 11-day embryonic breast muscle was also serine. Electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the phosphorylated CMD1 produced in Sf9 cells and that obtained from primary culture of muscle were indistinguishable. Gel retardation and methylation interference assays showed that purified CMD1 bound specifically to the mouse muscle creatine kinase enhancer in combination with the in vitro translated E12. CMD1 alone had almost no affinity to the target DNA. When purified CMD1 was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, its affinity to the target DNA in combination with E12 was reduced by approximately 5-fold. The affinity recovered at least partially by possible rephosphorylation of CMD1 by kinase(s) contained in wheat germ extract. These results suggested that phosphorylation of CMD1 could be involved in the regulation of muscle differentiation."
