https://openalex.org/W2917897282,"Several general principles of global 3D genome organization have recently been established, including non-random positioning of chromosomes and genes in the cell nucleus, distinct chromatin compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs). However, the extent and nature of cell-to-cell and cell-intrinsic variability in genome architecture are still poorly characterized. Here, we systematically probe heterogeneity in genome organization. High-throughput optical mapping of several hundred intra-chromosomal interactions in individual human fibroblasts demonstrates low association frequencies, which are determined by genomic distance, higher-order chromatin architecture, and chromatin environment. The structure of TADs is variable between individual cells, and inter-TAD associations are common. Furthermore, single-cell analysis reveals independent behavior of individual alleles in single nuclei. Our observations reveal extensive variability and heterogeneity in genome organization at the level of individual alleles and demonstrate the coexistence of a broad spectrum of genome configurations in a cell population."

The relevance and induction mechanisms of pathologic Th17 responses in humans are poorly understood. Here, we identify the mucocutaneous pathobiont Candida albicans as the major direct inducer of human anti-fungal Th17 cells. Th17 cells directed against other fungi are induced by cross-reactivity to C. albicans. Intestinal inflammation expands total C. albicans and cross-reactive Th17 cells. Strikingly, Th17 cells cross-reactive to the airborne fungus Aspergillus fumigatus are selectively activated and expanded in patients with airway inflammation, especially during acute allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. This indicates a direct link between protective intestinal Th17 responses against C. albicans and lung inflammation caused by airborne fungi. We identify heterologous immunity to a single, ubiquitous member of the microbiota as a central mechanism for systemic induction of human anti-fungal Th17 responses and as a potential risk factor for pulmonary inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2917788812,"Human brain organoid techniques have rapidly advanced to facilitate investigating human brain development and diseases. These efforts have largely focused on generating telencephalon due to its direct relevance in a variety of forebrain disorders. Despite its importance as a relay hub between cortex and peripheral tissues, the investigation of three-dimensional (3D) organoid models for the human thalamus has not been explored. Here, we describe a method to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to thalamic organoids (hThOs) that specifically recapitulate the development of thalamus. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a formation of distinct thalamic lineages, which diverge from telencephalic fate. Importantly, we developed a 3D system to create the reciprocal projections between thalamus and cortex by fusing the two distinct region-specific organoids representing the developing thalamus or cortex. Our study provides a platform for understanding human thalamic development and modeling circuit organizations and related disorders in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2917155356,"Increased levels of intestinal bile acids (BAs) are a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we show that the convergence of dietary factors (high-fat diet) and dysregulated WNT signaling (APC mutation) alters BA profiles to drive malignant transformations in Lgr5-expressing (Lgr5+) cancer stem cells and promote an adenoma-to-adenocarcinoma progression. Mechanistically, we show that BAs that antagonize intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) function, including tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-βMCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA), induce proliferation and DNA damage in Lgr5+ cells. Conversely, selective activation of intestinal FXR can restrict abnormal Lgr5+ cell growth and curtail CRC progression. This unexpected role for FXR in coordinating intestinal self-renewal with BA levels implicates FXR as a potential therapeutic target for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2917730612,"We tested a newly described molecular memory system, CCR5 signaling, for its role in recovery after stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). CCR5 is uniquely expressed in cortical neurons after stroke. Post-stroke neuronal knockdown of CCR5 in pre-motor cortex leads to early recovery of motor control. Recovery is associated with preservation of dendritic spines, new patterns of cortical projections to contralateral pre-motor cortex, and upregulation of CREB and DLK signaling. Administration of a clinically utilized FDA-approved CCR5 antagonist, devised for HIV treatment, produces similar effects on motor recovery post stroke and cognitive decline post TBI. Finally, in a large clinical cohort of stroke patients, carriers for a naturally occurring loss-of-function mutation in CCR5 (CCR5-Δ32) exhibited greater recovery of neurological impairments and cognitive function. In summary, CCR5 is a translational target for neural repair in stroke and TBI and the first reported gene associated with enhanced recovery in human stroke."

However, chronic activation of cGAS by self-DNA leads to severe autoimmune diseases for which no effective treatment is available yet. Here we report that acetylation inhibits cGAS activation and that the enforced acetylation of cGAS by aspirin robustly suppresses self-DNA-induced autoimmunity. We find that cGAS acetylation on either Lys384, Lys394, or Lys414 contributes to keeping cGAS inactive. cGAS is deacetylated in response to DNA challenges. Importantly, we show that aspirin can directly acetylate cGAS and efficiently inhibit cGAS-mediated immune responses. Finally, we demonstrate that aspirin can effectively suppress self-DNA-induced autoimmunity in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) patient cells and in an AGS mouse model. Thus, our study reveals that acetylation contributes to cGAS activity regulation and provides a potential therapy for treating DNA-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Thus, our study reveals that acetylation contributes to cGAS activity regulation and provides a potential therapy for treating DNA-mediated autoimmune diseases. Cytosolic DNA is a potent danger signal that triggers robust innate immune responses because the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm is normally a sign of microbial infection or tissue damage (Barbalat et al., 2011Barbalat R. Ewald S.E. Mouchess M.L. Barton G.M. Nucleic acid recognition by the innate immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29: 185-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Recognition of cytosolic DNA is an important mechanism for host defense. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) has been identified as a key sensor that mediates immune responses upon cytoplasmic DNA challenge. Upon DNA binding, the activated cGAS catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) from ATP and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (Gao et al., 2013Gao P. Ascano M. Wu Y. Barchet W. Gaffney B.L.

The STING in the tail for cytosolic DNA-dependent activation of IRF3.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: pe9Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Type I IFN plays critical roles in antiviral responses by inducing the expression of a number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Gao et al., 2015Gao D. Li T. Li X.D. Chen X. Li Q.Z.

In addition to microbial infection, cellular damage or reverse transcription of endogenous retroviruses can also generate self-DNA in the cytoplasm (Ahn and Barber, 2014Ahn J. Barber G.N.

Metazoans have evolved DNases that clear self-DNA to prevent inappropriate activation of cGAS-mediated immune responses. For example, DNA 3′ repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) degrades cytosolic DNA, and loss-of-function mutations of TREX1 have been identified in human patients with autoimmune disorders such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and lupus (Ahn and Barber, 2014Ahn J.

Deletion of Trex1 in mice results in severe cGAS-dependent autoimmunity because deletion of Cgas rescues the lethality and autoimmune conditions in Trex1–/– mice (Gao et al., 2015Gao D. Li T. Li X.D.

A limited understanding of how cGAS activation is regulated, however, has prevented the development of effective treatments. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation and phosphorylation are known to be critical for regulation of protein functions (Cohen, 2000Cohen P. The regulation of protein function by multisite phosphorylation--a 25 year update.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, Verdin and Ott, 2015Verdin E. Ott M. 50 years of protein acetylation: from gene regulation to epigenetics, metabolism and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Protein acetylation plays important roles in various biological processes, including immune responses (Shakespear et al., 2011Shakespear M.R. Halili M.A. Irvine K.M. Fairlie D.P. Sweet M.J. Histone deacetylases as regulators of inflammation and immunity.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32: 335-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that acetylation at one of three lysine residues, Lys384, Lys394, or Lys414, contributes to keeping cGAS inactive. cGAS is deacetylated in response to DNA challenge. Importantly, we show that aspirin, a drug that is well-tolerated in humans, can robustly enforce the acetylation of cGAS and led to cGAS inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that aspirin ameliorates DNA-mediated autoimmune responses in mice and in AGS patient cells. Because acetylation is a key PTM that plays important roles in many biological processes (Verdin and Ott, 2015Verdin E. Ott M. 50 years of protein acetylation: from gene regulation to epigenetics, metabolism and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and acetylation of cGAS in quiescent cells has been implied in proteomic studies (Choudhary et al., 2009Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Lysine acetylation targets protein complexes and co-regulates major cellular functions.Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3152) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2010Zhao S. Xu W. Jiang W. Yu W. Lin Y. Zhang T. Yao J. Zhou L. Zeng Y. Li H. et al.Regulation of cellular metabolism by protein lysine acetylation.Science. 2010; 327: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), we investigated whether acetylation is involved in the regulation of cGAS activity. To do so, we first created a FLAG-cGAS stable THP-1 (human monocytic cells) cell line and examined cGAS acetylation in quiescent cells by performing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with the immunoprecipitated FLAG-cGAS. We identified six lysine (K) acetylation sites of cGAS: K7, K50, K384, K392, K394, and K414 (Figure S1A). Interestingly, three of these six sites are conserved across species (Figure S1B). To study the function of acetylation of these sites, we mutated each site by replacing a lysine with a glutamine (Q), which mimics the acetylation state on lysine (Zhao et al., 2010Zhao S. Xu W. Jiang W. Yu W. Lin Y. Zhang T. Yao J. Zhou L. Zeng Y. Li H. et al.Regulation of cellular metabolism by protein lysine acetylation.Science. 2010; 327: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), and tested the effect of these mutations on cGAS activity in HEK293T cells that stably express STING (Sun et al., 2013Sun L. Wu J. Du F. Chen X. Chen Z.J. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the type I interferon pathway.Science. 2013; 339: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar). cGAS-STING pathway activation can be reflected by phosphorylation of the downstream transcription factor IRF3 (Sun et al., 2013Sun L. Wu J. Du F. Chen X. Chen Z.J. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the type I interferon pathway.Science. 2013; 339: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar). We found that K-to-Q mutation of each of the three conserved sites K384, K394 or K414 (cGASK384Q, cGASK394Q, or cGASK414Q)—led to a dramatic reduction in cGAS activity, whereas the mutations of the non-conserved sites—cGASK7Q, cGASK50Q, or cGASK392Q—had no effect (Figure 1A). By replacing a lysine with an arginine (R), we further found that K-to-R mutation of K384 or K394 did not affect cGAS activation, whereas substitution of K414 with R also inhibited cGAS activity (Figure 1B). These data suggest that, although K414 appeared to be a critical residue of cGAS, acetylation on these conserved lysine sites could possibly inhibit cGAS activation. Next we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete endogenous cGAS in THP-1 cells. As expected, these cells failed to induce IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN production upon stimulation by introducing herring testis DNA (HT-DNA) into the cells. This deficiency could be rescued by wild-type cGAS but not acetylation-mimicking cGAS (Figures 1C and 1D). Using simultaneous K-to-Q mutation of cGAS on K384, K394, and K414 (cGAS3KQ), we obtained similar results (Figures 1E and 1F). These data further suggest that acetylation may inhibit cGAS activation.Figure 1Acetylation Inhibits cGAS-Mediated Type I IFN ProductionShow full caption(A and B) Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) human cGAS and its acetylation-mimetic (K-to-Q) mutants (A) or K-to-R mutants (B) were transfected into HEK293T cells that stably expressed STING (HEK293T-STING).

Data represent at least three independent experiments. See also Figure S1. To study the activity of cGAS in the above cells, we used LC-MS/multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MS/MRM) to measure the production of cGAMP (Figure S1C). In contrast to wild-type cGAS, the acetylation-mimicking cGAS mutants cGASK384Q, cGASK394Q, cGASK414Q, and cGAS3KQ failed to synthesize cGAMP upon stimulation by the introduced HT-DNA (Figures 1G and 1H). To unambiguously determine the effect of acetylation on cGAS at these residues, we utilized a system to genetically incorporate acetyl-lysine into a recombinant cGAS protein (Neumann et al., 2008Neumann H. Peak-Chew S.Y. Chin J.W. Genetically encoding N(epsilon)-acetyllysine in recombinant proteins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) at each of the conserved sites to create cGASLys384Ac, cGASLys394Ac, and cGASLys414Ac (Figure 2A). We also created cGASLys392Ac as a control because the K392Q mutation did not inhibit cGAS activation (Figure 1A). Additionally, we generated site-specific anti-acetylation antibodies using the peptides FSHIEK(384)AcEILNNHGKSK(394)AcT and RKDCLKLMK(414)AcYLLEQ to detect the K384 and/or K394 and K414 acetylated human cGAS, respectively (Figure 2B). We performed an in vitro cGAMP synthesis assay by incubating the acetylated cGAS proteins cGASLys384Ac, cGASLys394Ac, or cGASLys414Ac with the substrates ATP and GTP in the presence of HT-DNA. Consistent with the K-to-Q mutation results, cGASLys384Ac, cGASLys394Ac, or cGASLys414Ac failed to synthesize cGAMP, whereas the unmodified cGAS (cGASNon-Ac) and cGASLys392Ac effectively produced cGAMP (Figures 2C, S2A, and S2B). Thus, these data suggest that acetylation may inhibit cGAS activity.Figure S2Acetylation Suppresses cGAS Activity, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Ion exchange chromatography analysis of cGAMP production in the in vitro cGAMP synthesis assay using cGASLys392Ac and the unmodified cGAS (cGASNon-Ac).(B) Immunoblot analysis of recombinant cGAS proteins from B with pan-acetyl-lysine antibody.

We then tested the above acetylated cGAS proteins for their DNA-binding ability using biolayer interferometry and found that single-site acetylation of cGAS slightly reduced cGAS-DNA binding affinity (Figures 2D and S2D). These data are consistent with a previous report showing that the mutations on some of these sites had only a limited effect on DNA binding of cGAS (Li et al., 2013Li X. Shu C. Yi G. Chaton C.T.

Next we detected whether cGAS mutations affect the dimerization of cGAS because cGAS is known to bind to DNA as a dimer (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang X. Wu J. Du F. Xu H. Sun L. Chen Z. Brautigam C.A.

The cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS forms an oligomeric complex with DNA and undergoes switch-like conformational changes in the activation loop.Cell Rep. 2014; 6: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To do so, FLAG-tagged wild-type cGAS was expressed in HEK293T cells. The cell lysates were then incubated with recombinant His-tagged cGAS proteins: cGASNon-Ac, cGASLys384Ac, cGASLys394Ac, or cGASLys414Ac. The cGAS-cGAS interaction were examined by pulling down His-tagged cGAS protein and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Our data showed that cGAS dimerization was not likely to be affected by cGAS acetylation (Figure 2E). Using the cGAS K-to-Q mutant-rescued cell lines, we found that these acetylation-mimicking mutants had similar protein stability and localization compared with that of wild-type cGAS (Figures 2F and 2G). It is possible that acetylation interferes with cGAS enzymatic activity. To explore how cGAS acetylation is regulated in response to DNA challenge, we treated FLAG-cGAS stable THP-1 cells with HT-DNA and checked the acetylation of cGAS with site-specific antibodies. We found that acetylation of cGAS on K384 and/or K394 and K414 was reduced after HT-DNA treatment (Figure 3A), suggesting that DNA treatment leads to deacetylation of cGAS. This was confirmed by examining the acetylation of the endogenous cGAS protein in response to HT-DNA treatment and infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, a DNA virus (Figures 3B and S3A). Using MS to analyze cGAS acetylation before and after DNA virus or HT-DNA treatment, our data further supported the above observations (Figures S3B and S3C; Table S2).Figure S3DNA Triggers cGAS Deacetylation, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with HT-DNA (2 μg/mL) for 3 h. cGAS was immunoprecipitated and the acetylation of cGAS was analyzed with the site-specific cGAS acetylation antibodies as indicated. ※ indicate non-specific bands.(B and C) FLAG-cGAS-expressing THP-1 cells were differentiated with PMA for 72 h, followed by HT-DNA (B) or HSV-1 (C) treatment for indicated time.

WCL, whole cell lysate. Data represent three independent experiments. It is known that deacetylation is mediated by deacetylases, sirtuins (SIRTs), and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Shakespear et al., 2011Shakespear M.R. Halili M.A. Irvine K.M. Fairlie D.P. Sweet M.J. Histone deacetylases as regulators of inflammation and immunity.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32: 335-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when we examined the cGAS-immunoprecipitated complex by LC-MS analysis, we found that HDAC3 protein was co-precipitated with cGAS (Table S1). This interaction of cGAS and HDAC3 was confirmed by western blotting (Figure S3D). As reported previously, the nuclear deacetylase HDAC3 can also localize in the cytoplasm (Yuan et al., 2005Yuan Z.L. Guan Y.J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Stat3 dimerization regulated by reversible acetylation of a single lysine residue.Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), and we found that the interaction of HDAC3 and cGAS is stabilized by DNA treatment (Figures 3C and 3D). Importantly, knockdown of HDAC3 prevented deacetylation of cGAS in response to HT-DNA stimuli and attenuated DNA-induced IRF3 phosphorylation (Figure 3E). Consistently, knockdown of HDAC3 also reduced HT-DNA-induced cGAMP production in cells (Figure S3E). These data suggest that acetylation contributes to cGAS activity inhibition and that deacetylation of cGAS upon DNA treatment is involved in cGAS activation. We next investigated whether enforced acetylation of cGAS could inhibit its activity. Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is known to be able to acetylate proteins such as cyclooxygenase (COX, also known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) (Roth and Majerus, 1975Roth G.J.

It is known that amido bonds are more stable than ester bonds; we therefore hypothesized that aspirin may acetylate the amino group of lysine to form an amido bond (N-link). We then tested whether aspirin could acetylate cGAS at the above lysine sites and inhibit its activation. Apparently, aspir"

We have generated knockout lines of Drosophila CCT genes for functional investigations and knockin lines containing Gal4 and other tools for examining gene expression and manipulating neuronal activities, with a versatile platform allowing genetic intersections and logic gates. CCT reveals the coexistence of specific transmitters but mutual exclusion of the major inhibitory and excitatory transmitters in the same neurons. One neuropeptide and five receptors were detected in glia, with octopamine β2 receptor functioning in glia. A pilot screen implicated 41 genes in sleep regulation, with the dopamine receptor Dop2R functioning in neurons expressing the peptides Dilp2 and SIFa. Thus, CCT is a novel concept, chemoconnectomics a new approach, and CCT tool lines a powerful resource for systematic investigations of chemical-transmission-mediated neural signaling circuits underlying behavior and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2917178915,"Light plays a pivotal role in the regulation of affective behaviors. However, the precise circuits that mediate the impact of light on depressive-like behaviors are not well understood. Here, we show that light influences depressive-like behaviors through a disynaptic circuit linking the retina and the lateral habenula (LHb). Specifically, M4-type melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervate GABA neurons in the thalamic ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and intergeniculate leaflet (vLGN/IGL), which in turn inhibit CaMKIIα neurons in the LHb. Specific activation of vLGN/IGL-projecting RGCs, activation of LHb-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons, or inhibition of postsynaptic LHb neurons is sufficient to decrease the depressive-like behaviors evoked by long-term exposure to aversive stimuli or chronic social defeat stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the antidepressive effects of light therapy require activation of the retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb pathway. These results reveal a dedicated retina-vLGN/IGL-LHb circuit that regulates depressive-like behaviors and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for light treatment of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2915268839,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in mammalian mRNAs. Despite its functional importance in various physiological events, the role of m6A in chemical carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we profiled the dynamic m6A mRNA modification during cellular transformation induced by chemical carcinogens and identified a subset of cell transformation-related, concordantly modulated m6A sites. Notably, the increased m6A in 3′-UTR mRNA of oncogene CDCP1 was found in malignant transformed cells. Mechanistically, the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 and demethylases ALKBH5 mediate the m6A modification in 3′-UTR of CDCP1 mRNA. METTL3 and m6A reader YTHDF1 preferentially recognize m6A residues on CPCP1 3′-UTR and promote CDCP1 translation. We further showed that METTL3 and CDCP1 are upregulated in the bladder cancer patient samples and the expression of METTL3 and CDCP1 is correlated with the progression status of the bladder cancers. Inhibition of the METTL3-m6A-CDCP1 axis resulted in decreased growth and progression of chemical-transformed cells and bladder cancer cells. Most importantly, METTL3-m6A-CDCP1 axis has synergistic effect with chemical carcinogens in promoting malignant transformation of uroepithelial cells and bladder cancer tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results identify dynamic m6A modification in chemical-induced malignant transformation and provide insight into critical roles of the METTL3-m6A-CDCP1 axis in chemical carcinogenesis."

Gain-of-function variants were also recently associated with more common acquired pain disorders such as small fiber neuropathy (Faber et al., 2012Faber C.G. Hoeijmakers J.G. Ahn H.S. Cheng X. Han C. Choi J.S. Estacion M. Lauria G. Vanhoutte E.K. Gerrits M.M. et al.Gain of function Naν1.7 mutations in idiopathic small fiber neuropathy.Ann.

Rare NaV1.7 variants associated with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.Pain. 2018; 159: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NaV1.7 is highly enriched in nociceptive and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system (Toledo-Aral et al., 1997Toledo-Aral J.J. Moss B.L. He Z.J. Koszowski A.G. Whisenand T. Levinson S.R. Wolf J.J. Silos-Santiago I. Halegoua S. Mandel G. Identification of PN1, a predominant voltage-dependent sodium channel expressed principally in peripheral neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). NaV1.7 is also expressed in the brain in subcortical structures, including the thalamus, medial amygdala, hypothalamus, and the axons of olfactory epithelium projecting to the olfactory bulb (Kanellopoulos et al., 2018Kanellopoulos A.H. Koenig J. Huang H. Pyrski M. Millet Q. Lolignier S. Morohashi T. Gossage S.J. Jay M.

Interestingly, the only other clinical feature of bi-allelic loss-of-function (LOF) NaV1.7 mutations is anosmia (Weiss et al., 2011Weiss J. Pyrski M. Jacobi E. Bufe B. Willnecker V. Schick B. Zizzari P. Gossage S.J. Greer C.A. Leinders-Zufall T. et al.Loss-of-function mutations in sodium channel Nav1.7 cause anosmia.Nature. 2011; 472: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These findings have led to extensive interest in selectively targeting NaV1.7 as a means to develop novel analgesics. Multiple drug development programs have been initiated, including small molecule blockers (Zakrzewska et al., 2017Zakrzewska J.M. Palmer J. Morisset V. Giblin G.M. Obermann M. Ettlin D.A. Cruccu G.

A monoclonal antibody that targets a NaV1.7 channel voltage sensor for pain and itch relief.Cell. 2014; 157: 1393-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Channel selectivity would be highly desirable but is challenging due to the homology of different VGSCs. Non-specific blockers of VGSCs, such as some antiepileptic drugs, are currently used as analgesics; however, the indiscriminate targeting of multiple VGSCs in the heart and/or CNS often lead to significant dose-limiting side effects. A critical barrier to drug development is our current lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying CIP. We do not yet appreciate the locus of action, and this has important implications for whether novel NaV1.7 blockers need to cross the blood-brain barrier. It is also unclear whether there are developmental effects on the structure or function of the sensory nervous system, which would make the CIP phenotype unlikely to be replicated, even by highly potent acute pharmacological blockade. In rodent, NaV1.7 is expressed in the peripheral terminals, axon, soma, and central terminals of sensory neurons (Kanellopoulos et al., 2018Kanellopoulos A.H. Koenig J. Huang H. Pyrski M. Millet Q. Lolignier S. Morohashi T. Gossage S.J. Jay M.

Mutant mouse models in which NaV1.7 is globally ablated or conditionally ablated in subsets of sensory neurons have been generated (Nassar et al., 2004Nassar M.A. Stirling L.C. Forlani G.

These show reduced (although in some cases not absent) reflex withdrawal responses to a broad range of acute noxious thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli on behavioral testing. Interestingly, not all the reduction in pain behavior (i.e., thermal hypoalgesia) appears to be autonomous to sensory neurons but may also involve interaction with the sympathetic nervous system (Minett et al., 2012Minett M.S. Nassar M.A. Clark A.K. Passmore G. Dickenson A.H. Wang F. Malcangio M. Wood J.N. Distinct Nav1.7-dependent pain sensations require different sets of sensory and sympathetic neurons.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 791Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mice lacking NaV1.7 in sensory neurons also show reduced hypersensitivity to select neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain models (Minett et al., 2014Minett M.S. Falk S. Santana-Varela S. Bogdanov Y.D. Nassar M.A. Heegaard A.M. Wood J.N. Pain without nociceptors? Nav1.7-independent pain mechanisms.Cell Rep. 2014; 6: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cutaneous innervation by nociceptors is normal in mice with global ablation of NaV1.7 (Gingras et al., 2014Gingras J. Smith S. Matson D.J. Johnson D. Nye K. Couture L. Feric E. Yin R. Moyer B.D. Peterson M.L. et al.Global Nav1.7 knockout mice recapitulate the phenotype of human congenital indifference to pain.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e105895Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A number of mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed for this behavioral phenotype. Channel kinetics could position NaV1.7 as a threshold channel amplifying sub-threshold depolarizations in nociceptor terminals and by virtue conferring a critical role for NaV1.7 in action potential electrogenesis. NaV1.7 may also be necessary for action potential propagation along axons and neurotransmitter release at central terminals in an analogous fashion to the olfactory system (Weiss et al., 2011Weiss J. Pyrski M. Jacobi E. Bufe B. Willnecker V. Schick B. Zizzari P. Gossage S.J. Greer C.A. Leinders-Zufall T. et al.Loss-of-function mutations in sodium channel Nav1.7 cause anosmia.Nature. 2011; 472: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Finally, NaV1.7 may intersect with other signaling systems, such as endogenous opioids, which are upregulated in the absence of NaV1.7 and thought to feedback onto dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and/or terminals to suppress excitability (Minett et al., 2015Minett M.S. Pereira V. Sikandar S. Matsuyama A. Lolignier S. Kanellopoulos A.H. Mancini F. Iannetti G.D. Bogdanov Y.D. Santana-Varela S. et al.Endogenous opioids contribute to insensitivity to pain in humans and mice lacking sodium channel Nav1.7.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8967Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There remains an important need to better characterize dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system in humans with CIP. In rodent DRG neurons, slow membrane depolarization can trigger excitatory ramp currents, driven by NaV1.7 activation, which occur as a result of the channel’s slow closed-state inactivation (Cummins et al., 1998Cummins T.R. Howe J.R. Waxman S.G. Slow closed-state inactivation: a novel mechanism underlying ramp currents in cells expressing the hNE/PN1 sodium channel.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9607-9619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These currents are considered important in amplifying small sub-threshold depolarizing stimuli and thereby increasing the likelihood of an action potential being generated (Dib-Hajj et al., 2013Dib-Hajj S.D. Yang Y. Black J.A. Waxman S.G. The Na(V)1.7 sodium channel: from molecule to man.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). One recent study using cadaveric human DRG cells from previously healthy donors found a lack of low-threshold excitatory ramp currents (Zhang et al., 2017Zhang X. Priest B.T. Belfer I. Gold M.S. Voltage-gated Na(+) currents in human dorsal root ganglion neurons.eLife. 2017; 6: e23235Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The authors concluded that there may be a relative dearth of NaV1.7 in human DRG neurons, and although NaV1.7 makes a significant contribution to the TTX-sensitive sodium current in rodents, this may not be the case in humans. However, this conclusion is in contrast to another study that found NaV1.7 mRNA to be the predominantly expressed VGSC in human DRG tissue (Chang et al., 2018Chang W. Berta T. Kim Y.H. Lee S. Lee S.Y. Ji R.R. Expression and role of voltage-gated sodium channels in human dorsal root ganglion neurons with special focus on Nav1.7, species differences, and regulation by Paclitaxel.Neurosci. Bull. 2018; 34: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Zhang et al., 2017Zhang X. Priest B.T. Belfer I. Gold M.S. Voltage-gated Na(+) currents in human dorsal root ganglion neurons.eLife. 2017; 6: e23235Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar also questioned the selectivity of pharmacological tools to study human NaV1.7, but they did not have access to neurons lacking NaV1.7 to conclusively determine this. The techniques available to study the detailed structure and function of the nociceptive system in humans have recently advanced. We have therefore adopted a multi-modal approach including sensory profiling, microneurography, functional brain imaging, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models combined with genome engineering to detail the functional role of NaV1.7 in the human nociceptive system. We recruited three CIP participants to assess sensory nerve function (Figure 1; Table 1). All study participants had confirmed compound heterozygous mutations in SCN9A that were predicted to cause loss of protein function (Table S1). A summary of their clinical assessment is found in Table 1. All three participants reported multiple painless injuries, including painless fractures, from childhood. On clinical examination, the participants were anosmic and did not feel pinprick as a painful sensation and thus conformed to the typical clinical presentation of SCN9A-related CIP (Cox et al., 2006Cox J.J. Reimann F. Nicholas A.K. Thornton G. Roberts E. Springell K. Karbani G. Jafri H. Mannan J.

Quantitative sensory testing (QST) confirmed the insensitivity to pain phenotype as neither noxious temperature nor noxious mechanical stimuli were felt as painful (Figure 1A). Cold and warm detection thresholds in both the hand and the foot were reduced when compared to the normative range of the German Neuropathic Pain Consortium, and thermal sensory limen were also impaired (Figure 1A), indicative of thermal hypoesthesia. Mechanical and vibration detection thresholds were normal (Figure 1A). Thus, the QST data showed impairment of small fiber function with preserved large fiber function.Table 1Summary of Clinical Findings and Special InvestigationsCIP1CIP2CIP3Age313444GenderMaleMaleFemaleHistoryPainless injuries (e.g., fractures, burns)YYYCongenital onsetYYYNormal cognitive developmentYYYSelf-mutilationYNNAbsent visceral painYYYJoint replacementYNYCharcot jointsYYYAffected siblingsYYNExaminationAnosmiaYYYNormal autonomic function (sweating, bowel function, blood pressure)YYYCorneal reflex intactYYYNormal motor examinationYYYNormal deep tendon reflexesYYYVibration, mechanical detection, proprioception normalYYYPin prick not felt as painful nor sharpYYYBedside temperature normalNYNInvestigationsHistamine flareYYYMustard oil flareYYYNerve conduction studies normalNaSural amplitudes are reducedYYThreshold tracking normalYYYfMRINYNMicroneurographyYYYIENFDProximal thigh (fibers/mm)0.20.000.00Distal leg (fibers/mm) (0.05 quantile; median)3.98 (5.3; 10.2)0.00 (5.3; 10.2)0.00 (5.7; 11.2)N, no; Y, yes; ND, not done; IENFD, intra-epidermal nerve fiber density.a Sural amplitudes are reduced Open table in a new tab N, no; Y, yes; ND, not done; IENFD, intra-epidermal nerve fiber density. Topical application of algogens or pruritogens to the skin activates cutaneous chemo-sensitive C-fibers and induces release of neuropeptides, causing a neurogenic flare response and resulting in the perception of pain or itch (Groetzner and Weidner, 2010Groetzner P. Weidner C. The human vasodilator axon reflex - an exclusively peripheral phenomenon?.Pain. 2010; 149: 71-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Histamine (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B) and mustard oil (Figures 1C, S1C, and S1D) application to the volar surface of the forearm elicited flare responses in all CIP participants. The participants did not report pain or pruritus. This is in contrast to a cohort of healthy controls (n = 10) who unanimously reported a painful “stinging” and “burning” sensation when mustard oil was applied, with a mean maximal visual analog scale (VAS) pain score (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 3.5 (1.8:5.2) (p = 0.03, CIP VAS versus healthy control, Student’s unpaired t test). The histamine flare was blocked when local anesthetic was infiltrated before iontophoresis of the histamine (Figure S1E), indicating that it was neurally mediated. The ability to generate a flare response in CIP participants suggests that at least some cutaneous nerve fibers responsive to noxious stimuli can generate short-range action potentials. Nerve conduction studies from motor and sensory nerves of the lower limbs, except for one participant, all fell within normative reference ranges (Tables 1 and S2). One participant had small-amplitude sural sensory nerve action potentials. The recordings were difficult due the multiple injuries that the participant had previously sustained to his lower limbs. The reduced amplitudes may therefore be due to past trauma. Sensory nerve excitability measurements recorded from the median nerve all fell within the 95% CIs for healthy study participant parameters (Figure S2). Therefore, functional neurophysiological assessment of large fiber function did not reveal any abnormalities. The intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) measurements from the lower leg of our study participants were below the 0.05 quantile for published age- and gender-matched normative data in all cases (Figures 1D–1F). We did, however, observe deeper dermal fibers in all participants (Figure 1E). Therefore, IENFD measurements showed evidence of small fiber pathology. In addition, we also found absent or markedly reduced intra-epidermal nerve fibers at the proximal thigh in all participants (Table 1; Figure S1F). Only one mutation (c.2691G > A p.Y897X) in our patient cohort has previously been described and functionally characterized (Cox et al., 2006Cox J.J. Reimann F. Nicholas A.K. Thornton G. Roberts E. Springell K. Karbani G. Jafri H. Mannan J. Raashid Y. et al.An SCN9A channelopathy causes congenital inability to experience pain.Nature. 2006; 444: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). We heterologously expressed the novel NaV1.7 variants (Figure 2A) in HEK293T cells and used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to evaluate their impact on channel biophysics. Representative whole-cell voltage-clamp currents from transfected cells are shown in Figure 2B. All the mutations drastically reduced NaV1.7 current. FS1773 mutation resulted in an 8-fold reduction in the current density of the channel (Figures 2B and 2C). The R896W, R830X, and G1725R showed a profound loss of function with negligible current densities (Figure 2C). All CIP mutations therefore caused a significant loss of conductance compared to control, consistent with almost complete loss of channel function. A total of 38 C-fibers were recorded and analyzed from three of the subjects (14 from 4 intraneural sites in patient CIP1, 7 from 3 intraneural sites in patient CIP2, and 17 from 6 intraneural sites in patient CIP3). None of these recordings identified fibers with properties consistent with C-nociceptors. The frequency of different profiles of activity-dependent slowing (ADS) of conduction velocity was: type 1 (C-nociceptors) 0 (0%), type 2 (thermoreceptors) 10/38 (26.3%), type 3 (low-threshold C-mechanoreceptors) 5/38 (13.2%), and type 4 (sympathetic efferent) 23/38 (60.5%) (Figure 3). All intraneural sites showed ADS profiles with “plateau” units during 2 Hz stimulation (see for comparison Figure 3 in Serra et al., 1999Serra J. Campero M. Ochoa J. Bostock H.

Partial reversal of conduction slowing during repetitive stimulation of single sympathetic efferents in human skin.Acta Physiol. Scand. 2004; 182: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This frequency of sensory afferent types was significantly different to normative data from healthy patients (Serra et al., 1999Serra J. Campero M. Ochoa J. Bostock H. Activity-dependent slowing of conduction differentiates functional subtypes of C fibres innervating human skin.J.

Partial reversal of conduction slowing during repetitive stimulation of single sympathetic efferents in human skin.Acta Physiol. Scand. 2004; 182: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), owing to the lack of type 1 fibers (p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Therefore, there was a striking lack of ADS of conduction velocity profiles compatible with peripheral C-nociceptors. There were no differences with historical ADS of conduction velocity data for these three C-fiber types (Table S3). Despite the stark clinical phenotype of CIP, a previous study failed to find differences in brain activity of CIP patients compared to healthy controls in response to acute noxious mechanical stimuli (Salomons et al., 2016Salomons T.V. Iannetti G.D. Liang M. Wood J.N. The “pain matrix” in pain-free individuals.JAMA Neurol. 2016; 73: 755-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the method used for comparison in this study has been criticized, making the conclusions from the original study less clear (Büchel et al., 2016Büchel C. Geuter S. Sprenger C. Comparing painful stimulation vs rest in studies of pain.JAMA Neurol. 2016; 73: 1258-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We sought to investigate tonic responses to an algogen (capsaicin) using arterial spin labeling in one CIP participant (CIP2) who was eligible for functional brain imaging. This approach removes the confound of mechanical stimulation and avoids the analysis and interpretative problems pointed out previously (Büchel et al., 2016Büchel C. Geuter S. Sprenger C. Comparing painful stimulation vs rest in studies of pain.JAMA Neurol. 2016; 73: 1258-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Treatment of the CIP participant’s skin with a 1% topical capsaicin cream failed to elicit similar responses to what is commonly reported in a healthy control (HC) population. The participant reported no pain and no unpleasantness associated with any of the experimental conditions tested (NRS = 0). This was in contrast to the HC group, which found the experience of capsaicin and thermal stimulation intensely painful (NRS = 49.997 ± 3.525) (Figure 4A; ∗p < 0.001 Mann-Whitney U test). In CIP, the brain response to “thermal + capsaicin” versus “rest” was the only contrast that showed significant changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF). Increased CBF was observed in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), the dorsal anterior cingulate, and the posterior cingulate (mixed effects; z > 3.1, p < 0.05) (Figure 4C). In healthy controls, significant increases in CBF were observed in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, insula (anterior, mid, and posterior), anterior cingulate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebellum (mixed effects; z > 3.1, p < 0.05) (Figure 4C). To confirm that the changes observed during the capsaicin-evoked thermal condition are related to distinct perceptual experiences in CIP versus HC, we applied the neurological pain signature (NPS) to these data. The NPS is a weighted multivariate brain activation map that is strongly correlated with experimental physical pain reports and can be applied to imaging data to predict the severity of pain that was likely experienced during a scan (Wager et al., 2013Wager T.D. Atlas L.Y. Lindquist M.A. Roy M. Woo C.W. Kross E. An fMRI-based neurologic signature of physical pain.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 368: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). For each subject, the NPS expression was calculated by taking the dot product of the NPS and the contrast image for “thermal + capsaicin > rest” condition. For CIP, the NPS expression was generated from the mean of six repeated trials of the “thermal + capsaicin > rest” conditions. For HC, the NPS was derived from the mean across 12 subjects scanned once. A comparison of the NPS response values observed was significantly greater in HC compared to CIP (∗p < 0.001 Mann-Whitney U test) (Figure 4D). In effect, there was no overlap with the NPS of brain activity from the CIP patient in response to capsaicin-induced tonic heat hyperalgesia, whereas there was overlap with the NPS of brain activity from HC. The directed differentiation of human iPSCs to nociceptors enables functional modeling of CIP pathogenesis in vitro and should provide significant insight into the role of NaV1.7 in nociceptor physiology.

However, the lack of response in many patients to checkpoint-inhibitor therapies emphasizes the need for combination immunotherapies to pursue maximal antitumor efficacy. We have previously demonstrated that antagonism of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) by plerixafor (AMD3100) can decrease regulatory T (Treg)-cell intratumoral infiltration. Therefore, a combination of these 2 therapies might increase antitumor effects. Here, we evaluated the antitumor efficacy of AMD3100 and anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) antibody alone or in combination in an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer. We found that AMD3100, a highly specific CXCR4 antagonist, directly down-regulated the expression of both C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and CXCR4 in vitro and in vivo in tumor cells. AMD3100 and αPD-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice when given as monotherapy. Combination of these 2 agents significantly enhanced antitumor effects compared with single-agent administration. Benefits of tumor control and animal survival were associated with immunomodulation mediated by these 2 agents, which were characterized by increased effector T-cell infiltration, increased effector T-cell function, and increased memory T cells in tumor microenvironment. Intratumoral Treg cells were decreased, and conversion of Treg cells into T helper cells was increased by AMD3100 treatment. Intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells were decreased by the combined treatment, which was associated with decreased IL-10 and IL-6 in the ascites. Also, the combination therapy decreased suppressive leukocytes and facilitated M2-to-M1 macrophage polarization in the tumor. These results suggest that AMD3100 could be used to target the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis to inhibit tumor growth and prevent multifaceted immunosuppression alone or in combination with αPD-1 in ovarian cancer, which could be clinically relevant to patients with this disease.-Zeng, Y., Li, B., Liang, Y., Reeves, P.

https://openalex.org/W2888393074,"Operons are a hallmark of bacterial genomes, where they allow concerted expression of functionally related genes as single polycistronic transcripts. They are rare in eukaryotes, where each gene usually drives expression of its own independent messenger RNAs. Here, we report the horizontal operon transfer of a siderophore biosynthesis pathway from relatives of Escherichia coli into a group of budding yeast taxa. We further show that the co-linearly arranged secondary metabolism genes are expressed, exhibit eukaryotic transcriptional features, and enable the sequestration and uptake of iron. After transfer, several genetic changes occurred during subsequent evolution, including the gain of new transcription start sites that were sometimes within protein-coding sequences, acquisition of polyadenylation sites, structural rearrangements, and integration of eukaryotic genes into the cluster. We conclude that the genes were likely acquired as a unit, modified for eukaryotic gene expression, and maintained by selection to adapt to the highly competitive, iron-limited environment."
https://openalex.org/W2916895013,"Breast cancer brain metastases (BM) affect younger women disproportionally, including those lacking estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and HER2 (known as triple-negative breast cancer; TNBC). Previous studies in preclinical models showed that pre-menopausal levels of estradiol (E2) promote TNBC-BM through incompletely understood mechanisms involving reactive astrocytes. Herein, a novel mechanism involving E2-dependent upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in astrocytes, and subsequent activation of tumor cell tropomyosin kinase receptor B (TrkB), is identified. E2 increased experimental BM of TNBC 4T1BR5 and E0771 cells by 21 and 3.6 fold, respectively, compared to E2-depleted mice. ERα+ reactive astrocytes were found at early and late stages of BM, and E2 upregulated BDNF in ER+ reactive astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. TrkB was expressed in TNBC brain-trophic cell lines, BM-patient-derived xenografts, and breast cancer BM. Conditioned media from E2-treated astrocytes (CM-E2) activated TrkB and downstream AKT, ERK, and PLC-γ signaling in TNBC cells, increasing their invasiveness and tumor-initiating capability in vitro. The promotion of BM by E2-activated astrocytes was found to be more complex, involving feedback loops and other receptor tyrosine kinases. In 4T1BR5 cells, there was a positive feedback loop whereby astrocytic BDNF induced cancer cell BDNF translation. Upregulation of cancer cell BDNF was required to promote full invasiveness of 4T1BR5 in response to CM-E2, and was observed in brain metastatic cells in E2-treated mice in vivo. Moreover, the non-competitive BDNF/TrkB inhibitor ANA-12 reduced E2-induced 4T1BR5 BM to levels similar to OVX mice. BDNF also activated EGFR in TrkB+EGFR+ TNBC cells, suggesting that E2 action through astrocytes activates redundant pathways promoting BM. These findings have important therapeutic implications, as they provide a rationale to use E2-depletion therapies or TrkB inhibitors to prevent or delay development of BM in younger women."

The bodies of most multicellular organisms provide a habitat for simpler microorganisms. The relationships of these resident microorganisms with the host animal range from parasitic to mutualistic (Blum, 2017Blum H.E. The human microbiome.Adv. Med.

Bioactive molecules can pass between the microbiota and the host with the potential to alter the fitness and health of both (Donia and Fischbach, 2015Donia M.S. Fischbach M.A. HUMAN MICROBIOTA.

Elucidating the precise consequences of the microbiota on host function remains challenging because of the extreme heterogeneity of microorganisms resident in an animal, as well as the diverse properties of microbiota-derived molecules. Nonetheless, cellular communication is subject to general principles and signaling modalities. We therefore considered the possibility that the microbiota employs general strategies to regulate host cellular function. The nematode C. elegans provides a tractable and elegant system for investigating the interplay between commensal bacteria and a host animal. In the laboratory, these nematodes are co-cultured on a consistent and pure diet of their food source, bacteria (and can also be made microbe-free) (Stiernagle, 2006Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). In spite of being bacterivores, C. elegans have been shown to harbor intact bacteria in the gut that persist throughout the life of the animal (Berg et al., 2016Berg M. Stenuit B. Ho J. Wang A.

Furthermore, it is clear from observations made in C. elegans isolated from both native and experimental habitats (including decaying fruits and vegetables, soil, and compost) that the composition of the nematode microbiota is relatively insulated from environmental variation (Dirksen et al., 2016Dirksen P. Marsh S.A. Braker I. Heitland N. Wagner S. Nakad R. Mader S. Petersen C. Kowallik V.

We theorized we could test the idea of a general mechanism of interspecies signaling by identifying proteome-wide changes in the host organism that are mediated by commensal bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues provides a unique opportunity to test these ideas. It is estimated that ∼70% of the universal proteome may be subject to post-translational regulation by S-nitrosylation (∼7,000 proteins reported to date), primarily at conserved sites (Abunimer et al., 2014Abunimer A.

Bacterial NO production is primarily dependent on the activity of two enzymes: NO synthase (NOS) and/or nitrate reductase (NarG) (Adak et al., 2002Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J.

Bacterial catalysis of nitrosation: involvement of the nar operon of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These enzymes are therefore prime candidates for mediating protein S-nitrosylation in C. elegans. Importantly, C. elegans are known to be reliant on commensal bacteria as a source for NO (Gusarov et al., 2013Gusarov I. Gautier L. Smolentseva O. Shamovsky I. Eremina S. Mironov A. Nudler E. Bacterial nitric oxide extends the lifespan of C. elegans.Cell. 2013; 152: 818-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We reasoned, therefore, that microbe-generated NO might potentially influence nematode physiology broadly via modification of C. elegans proteins. Here, by selectively eliminating NO generation in the microbiota and its S-nitrosylation of nematode proteins, we reveal a general mechanism by which the microbiota post-translationally shapes the proteome of its host to regulate cellular function and physiology. More specifically, our studies reveal thousands of proteins targeted by interspecies S-nitrosylation, exemplified by bacterial S-nitrosylation of C. elegans Argonaute proteins to regulate RISC assembly, microRNA (miRNA) activity, and developmental timing. To test the hypothesis that nematode S-nitrosylation is mediated by microbiota-derived NO, we plated microbe-free nematodes (C. elegans, N2 strain) on lawns of either wild-type (WT) B. subtilis, or a mutant strain containing a deletion of the bacterial NOS (Δnos). We then isolated total protein from worms at the L4/young adult stage and specifically pulled down S-nitrosylated proteins using resin-assisted capture (SNO-RAC) (Forrester et al., 2009Forrester M.T. Thompson J.W. Foster M.W. Nogueira L. Moseley M.A. Stamler J.S. Proteomic analysis of S-nitrosylation and denitrosylation by resin-assisted capture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We observed large-scale and robust S-nitrosylation of the C. elegans proteome that was dependent on bacterial NOS (Figures 1A and 1B). We obtained similar findings in experiments where the nematodes were plated on WT E. coli or mutant E. coli harboring a deletion of nitrate reductase (ΔnarG) (Figures 1C and 1D), which generates NO under anaerobic conditions (Seth et al., 2012Seth D. Hausladen A. Wang Y.J. Stamler J.S. Endogenous protein S-Nitrosylation in E. coli: regulation by OxyR.Science. 2012; 336: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) such as are known to be present in nematode gut (Minning et al., 1999Minning D.M. Gow A.J. Bonaventura J. Braun R. Dewhirst M. Goldberg D.E. Stamler J.S. Ascaris haemoglobin is a nitric oxide-activated ‘deoxygenase’.Nature. 1999; 401: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). S-nitrosylation of host proteins by dissimilar microbiota under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions suggests that S-nitrosylation may be observed in multiple habitats. Approximately 1,000 S-nitrosylated host proteins (SNO-proteins) were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) of worms cultured on WT B. subtilis (Table S1). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis demonstrated an enrichment of proteins involved, for example, in energy utilization and cellular metabolism, recapitulating findings in mammalian cells (Raju et al., 2015Raju K. Doulias P.T. Evans P. Krizman E.N. Jackson J.G. Horyn O. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Nissim I. et al.Regulation of brain glutamate metabolism by nitric oxide and S-nitrosylation.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8: ra68Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Table S2). The proteome of a metazoan, therefore, can be dramatically altered at the post-translational level by commensal bacteria, in particular via S-nitrosylation. The widespread modification of the host proteome by its microbiota begs the question of whether these modifications can impact host cellular function(s). The Argonaute-related protein ALG-1 is among the nematode proteins of well-defined function that we identified as being S-nitrosylated in nematodes co-cultured with B. subtilis (Table S1). The highly conserved ALG-1 protein mediates the post-transcriptional downregulation of mRNAs via the miRNA pathway (Grishok et al., 2001Grishok A. Pasquinelli A.E. Conte D. Li N. Parrish S. Ha I. Baillie D.L. Fire A. Ruvkun G. Mello C.C.

Developmental characterization of the microRNA-specific C. elegans Argonautes alg-1 and alg-2.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33750Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As C. elegans has been a classic model for the study of miRNA-dependent gene regulation, including numerous cellular functions, we investigated the possibility that protein modification by resident microbes could regulate host cellular processes via miRNAs. miRNA pathways in C. elegans classically regulate the timing of postembryonic cell fate progression and determination across several cell lineages; this regulation is essential to normal development of the animal and ultimately entry into adulthood. As ALG-1 has established functions in worm development (Vasquez-Rifo et al., 2012Vasquez-Rifo A. Jannot G. Armisen J. Labouesse M. Bukhari S.I.A. Rondeau E.L. Miska E.A. Simard M.J. Developmental characterization of the microRNA-specific C. elegans Argonautes alg-1 and alg-2.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e33750Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we asked whether microbiota-derived NO might play a role in miRNA-mediated temporal control of gene expression and development. We used an ALG-1-specific antibody to first verify directly that ALG-1 was S-nitrosylated by commensal bacteria. Using SNO-RAC, we demonstrated that ALG-1 was robustly S-nitrosylated in situ, and S-nitrosylation was markedly attenuated in nematodes grown on Δnos B. subtilis (Figures 1E and 1F). S-nitrosylation of ALG-1 was also seen in nematodes plated on E. coli, and host S-nitrosylation was eliminated with ΔnarG E. coli (Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, S-nitrosylation of C. elegans ALG-1 is mediated by NO derived from the microbiota. That ALG-1 is robustly S-nitrosylated by two different microbes with propensity to generate NO in different amounts and under different conditions, strongly suggests physiological relevance. To further strengthen the case for physiological relevance, we plated C. elegans on lawns of mixed WT and Δnos B. subtilis, with increasing amounts of WT B. subtilis to determine the minimal percentage of NO-producing bacteria required for detectable interspecies S-nitrosylation. Even a 10% WT B. subtilis mixture was sufficient to achieve protein S-nitrosylation (Figures 1I and 1J) and 25% WT B. subtilis achieved saturating levels of ALG-1 S-nitrosylation, making it highly likely that in native habitats, the C. elegans microbiota produce NO at levels sufficient to mediate interspecies S-nitrosylation (Figures 1K and 1L). In order to test for differences in bacterial abundance within worms plated on WT or Δnos B. subtilis, we quantified bacterial colony formation from homogenized single worms, using methods that allow gut bacteria to remain viable. Supernatant from unlysed worms was used as control (to correct for external contamination). Similar numbers of intact bacteria were found in worms cultured on WT versus Δnos B. subtilis (Figure 1M), consistent with a previous report (Gusarov et al., 2013Gusarov I. Gautier L. Smolentseva O. Shamovsky I. Eremina S. Mironov A. Nudler E. Bacterial nitric oxide extends the lifespan of C. elegans.Cell. 2013; 152: 818-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Collectively, our results raise the tantalizing idea that nematodes may regulate access to NO by varying food intake (amount of bacteria), food source (bacterial species), or oxygen tension in their environment (e.g., depth in soil). To determine the effect of S-nitrosylation on Argonaute function, we first sought to identify the Cys residue(s) undergoing modification. Because C. elegans can be recalcitrant to biochemical manipulation and because Argonaute proteins are highly conserved, we focused initially on human AGO2 (arguably the primary mammalian Argonaute activity) (Liu et al., 2004Liu J. Carmell M.A. Rivas F.V. Marsden C.G. Thomson J.M. Song J.J. Hammond S.M. Joshua-Tor L. Hannon G.J. Argonaute2 is the catalytic engine of mammalian RNAi.Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, Meister et al., 2004Meister G. Landthaler M. Patkaniowska A. Dorsett Y. Teng G. Tuschl T. Human Argonaute2 mediates RNA cleavage targeted by miRNAs and siRNAs.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 185-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Notably, we observed that AGO2 was endogenously S-nitrosylated in HEK293 cells (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1A), which express low basal levels of endothelial NOS (Ozawa et al., 2008Ozawa K. Whalen E.J. Nelson C.D. Mu Y. Hess D.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Stamler J.S. S-nitrosylation of beta-arrestin regulates beta-adrenergic receptor trafficking.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (Figure S1B), and exogenous NO increased AGO2 S-nitrosylation (Figures 2C, 2D, and S1A). Thus, the molecular machinery of mammalian translational repression is modified by NO (as it is in the nematode) and provides a tractable system for biochemical analysis.Figure S1S-Nitrosylation of AGO2 by Endogenous eNOS Is Enhanced by the NO Donor DETA-NO in HEK293 Cells, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Immunoblot with αAGO2 antibody following SNO-RAC (+Asc) on lysates prepared from either untreated or DETA-NO (500 μM) treated cells. –Asc (control for SNO-RAC) and total AGO2 controls are also shown.

(B) Immunoblot with αNOS3 (eNOS) antibody using increasing quantities of HEK293 cell lysates. Actin is shown as the loading control. AGO2 has 22 cysteine residues, many of which are predicted by GPS-SNO analysis (a computation algorithm for SNO-site identification) (Xue et al., 2010Xue Y. Liu Z. Gao X. Jin C. Wen L. Yao X. Ren J. GPS-SNO: computational prediction of protein S-nitrosylation sites with a modified GPS algorithm.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) to be putative S-nitrosylation sites. Hence, we undertook an MS-based approach to identify the specific sites of S-nitrosylation. We incubated purified, recombinant human AGO2 with the NO donor S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO; 100 μM), followed by pull-down using an AGO2 antibody. The samples were then subjected to a modified switch assay (Jaffrey and Snyder, 2001Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. The biotin switch method for the detection of S-nitrosylated proteins.Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: pl1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which NO groups are replaced by iodoacetamide (IAA), and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Notably, only one cysteine residue, Cys691, was consistently identified as being S-nitrosylated in AGO2 (Figure 2E). We then confirmed that Cys691 was a primary locus of NO modification by transfecting HEK293 cells with either WT AGO2 or a mutant AGO2 in which Cys691 was replaced by serine (C691S). Upon treatment with CysNO (100 μM), WT AGO2 was strongly S-nitrosylated while the signal was much weaker in the C691S mutant (Figures 2F and 2G). Interestingly, Cys691 is highly conserved across phylogeny, including human Argonaute isoforms (AGO1–AGO4) as well as nematode ALG-1 (Figure 3A). Given the conserved site for S-nitrosylation (Cys855 in ALG-1), we used genome editing to generate a nematode with the C855S point mutation. ALG-1 C855S animals showed markedly lower levels of ALG-1 S-nitrosylation in tissues as compared to their WT counterparts; S-nitrosylation was in fact virtually undetectable in mutant ALG-1 animals (Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, Cys855/Cys691 represents a phylogenetically conserved site of S-nitrosylation of Argonaute proteins, and the C855S nematode is essentially refractory to ALG-1 S-nitrosylation. We next questioned whether S-nitrosylation of AGO2 altered its gene silencing activity. AGO2 is part of a multi-protein assembly that includes GW182 family proteins. The interaction between AGO2 and GW182 is required for silencing of mRNA targets (Lian et al., 2009Lian S.L. Li S. Abadal G.X. Pauley B.A. Fritzler M.J. Chan E.K. The C-terminal half of human Ago2 binds to multiple GW-rich regions of GW182 and requires GW182 to mediate silencing.RNA. 2009; 15: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An inspection of a recent structure of human AGO1 with endogenous RNA and the hook motif of GW182 revealed that the conserved Cys resides within the PIWI domain, adjacent to the putative interaction site with GW182 (Figure 3D) (Elkayam et al., 2017Elkayam E. Faehnle C.R. Morales M. Sun J. Li H. Joshua-Tor L. Multivalent recruitment of human argonaute by GW182.Mol. Cell. 2017; 67: 646-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Pfaff et al., 2013Pfaff J. Hennig J. Herzog F. Aebersold R. Sattler M. Niessing D. Meister G. Structural features of Argonaute-GW182 protein interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E3770-E3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). By contrast, the conserved Cys was distant from the RNA binding pocket, which argues against a role in mediating RNA contacts (Figure 3D). We therefore hypothesized that S-nitrosylation may alter the binding of AGO2 to GW182. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, WT AGO2 was physically associated with GW182, and this association was strongly inhibited by addition of NO (DETA-NO; see STAR Methods) (Figures 4A–4D). Mutation of the S-nitrosylation site to a serine (C691S) markedly decreased the interaction between AGO2 and GW182 (Figures 4E–4H), but hardly altered the ability of AGO2 to interact with either miRNA or mRNA (Figure S2A). This is consistent with other AGO2 mutations that affect its binding to GW182 proteins but do not change miRNA binding (Jannot et al., 2016Jannot G. Mirchaud P. Huberdeau M.Q. Morel-Berryman L. Brachbill J.A. Piquet S. McJunkin K. Nakanishi K. Simard M.J.

Izaurralde E. miRISC and the CCR4-NOT complex silence mRNA targets independently of 43S ribosomal scanning.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 1186-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Further, exogenously transfected siRNA, whose activity is independent of GW182 proteins, demonstrated similar knockdown efficiency in HEK293 cells expressing either WT FLAG-AGO2 or C691S FLAG-AGO2 (Figure S3). An inhibitory effect of S-nitrosylation on the interaction between endogenous ALG-1 and AIN-1 (the C. elegans GW182 ortholog) was also demonstrated by immunoprecipitations from WT or C855S-ALG-1 worms cultured on either WT or Δnos B. subtilis (Figures 4I and 4J). In addition, NO inhibited the interaction between endogenous AGO2 and GW182 in cultured mammalian cells (Figure S2B). Thus, based on reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations of Argonautes and GW182 proteins in worms and mammals in the presence and absence of NO, all of which show reduced interaction following NO treatment but where this NO effect is also lost after mutation of AGO2-C691S, we conclude that S-nitrosylation of AGO2/ALG-1 inhibits their interaction with GW182 proteins. We also conclude from these data that S-nitrosylation mediated by microbiota may regulate Argonaute/GW182 protein interactions in situ, and mutation of the Cys site of NO modification (C691 or its C. elegans ortholog at 855) mimics the effect of S-nitrosylation, as it often does in other systems (Ozawa et al., 2008Ozawa K. Whalen E.J. Nelson C.D. Mu Y. Hess D.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Stamler J.S. S-nitrosylation of beta-arrestin regulates beta-adrenergic receptor trafficking.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 395-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, Cys691/C855 needs to be in its native (un-nitrosylated) state to interact efficiently with GW182 proteins. Altering this conserved residue by either S-nitrosylation or mutation leads to decreased interaction with GW182, perhaps by disrupting hydrogen bonding interactions or altering the charge distribution at the interface of the two proteins (Marino and Gladyshev, 2010Marino S.M.

Little is known about how representations of visual information change between retina and dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, the main relay between retina and cortex. Here, we functionally characterized responses of retrogradely labeled dLGN-projecting RGCs and dLGN neurons to the same set of visual stimuli. We found that many of the previously identified functional RGC types innervate dLGN, which maintained a high degree of functional diversity. Using a linear model to assess functional connectivity between RGC types and dLGN neurons, we found that responses of dLGN neurons could be predicted as linear combination of inputs from on average five RGC types, but only two of those had the strongest functional impact. Thus, mouse dLGN receives functional input from a diverse population of RGC types with limited convergence."

https://openalex.org/W2916619836,"Chemotherapy is one of the vital treatments for gastric cancer (GC) patients, especially those suffering advanced stages. Chemoresistance results in tumor relapse, leading to poor prognosis in GC patients; thus, identifying key regulators in this process might provide novel clues for GC therapy. Herein, we identify hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) as a key regulator of chemoresistance in GC. HMMR was found to be substantially up-regulated in 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu)-resistant GC biopsies and cell lines. High expression of HMMR significantly correlates with tumor relapse and predicts poorer prognosis in GC patients. Moreover, we observed that HMMR induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased the cancer stem cell properties of GC, thus rendering resistance to chemotherapy. Importantly, silencing of HMMR effectively increased the susceptibility to 5-Fu therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HMMR activates the TGF-β/Smad2 signaling pathway, which was required for the HMMR-mediated oncogenic effects and exhibited significant clinical relevance with HMMR expression. These findings reveal a critical role for HMMR in the chemoresistance of GC and suggest that HMMR might be a potential prognostic marker or therapeutic target against the disease.-Zhang, H., Ren, L., Ding, Y., Li, F., Chen, X., Ouyang, Y., Zhang, Y., Zhang, D.

https://openalex.org/W2917639768,"Cannabinoid receptor (CB)2 is an immune cell-localized GPCR that has been hypothesized to regulate the magnitude of inflammatory responses. However, there is currently no consensus as to the mechanism by which CB2 mediates its anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. To address this question, we employed a murine dorsal air pouch model with wild-type and CB2-/- 8-12-wk-old female and male C57BL/6 mice and found that acute neutrophil and lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus Chi monocyte recruitment in response to Zymosan was significantly enhanced in CB2-/- mice. Additionally, levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and the chemokines C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)2, CCL4, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 in CB2-/- pouch exudates were elevated at earlier time points. Importantly, using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we revealed that the proinflammatory phenotype in CB2-/- mice is neutrophil-intrinsic rather than stromal cell-dependent. Indeed, neutrophils isolated from CB2-/- mice exhibited an enhanced migration-related transcriptional profile and increased adhesive phenotype, and treatment of human neutrophils with a CB2 agonist blocked their endothelial transmigration. Overall, we have demonstrated that CB2 plays a nonredundant role during acute neutrophil mobilization to sites of inflammation and, as such, it could represent a therapeutic target for the development of novel anti-inflammatory compounds to treat inflammatory human diseases.-Kapellos, T.

https://openalex.org/W2915565711,"Both iron- and sulfur- reducing bacteria strongly impact the mineralogy of iron, but their activity has long been thought to be spatially and temporally segregated based on the higher thermodynamic yields of iron over sulfate reduction. However, recent evidence suggests that sulfur cycling can predominate even under ferruginous conditions. In this study, we investigated the potential for bacterial iron and sulfur metabolisms in the iron-rich (1.2 mM dissolved Fe2+), sulfate-poor (< 20 μM) Lake Pavin which is expected to host large populations of iron-reducing and iron-oxidizing microorganisms influencing the mineralogy of iron precipitates in its permanently anoxic bottom waters and sediments. 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries from at and below the oxycline revealed that highly diverse populations of sulfur/sulfate-reducing (SRB) and sulfur/sulfide-oxidizing bacteria represented up to 10% and 5% of the total recovered sequences in situ, respectively, which together was roughly equivalent to the fraction of putative iron cycling bacteria. In enrichment cultures amended with key iron phases identified in situ (ferric iron phosphate, ferrihydrite) or with soluble iron (Fe2+), SRB were the most competitive microorganisms, both in the presence and absence of added sulfate. The large fraction of Sulfurospirillum, which are known to reduce thiosulfate and sulfur but not sulfate, present in all cultures was likely supported by Fe(III)-driven sulfide oxidation. These results support the hypothesis that an active cryptic sulfur cycle interacts with iron cycling in the lake. Analyses of mineral phases showed that ferric phosphate in cultures dominated by SRB was transformed to vivianite with concomitant precipitation of iron sulfides. As colloidal FeS and vivianite have been reported in the monimolimnion, we suggest that SRB along with iron-reducing bacteria strongly influence iron mineralogy in the water column and sediments of Lake Pavin."
https://openalex.org/W2951662991,"The temporal dynamics of rhizosphere and root microbiota composition was compared between healthy and infected Chinese cabbage plants by the pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae. When inoculated with P. brassicae, disease was measured at five sampling dates from early root hair infection to late gall development. The first symptoms of clubroot disease appeared 14 days after inoculation (DAI) and increased drastically between 14 and 35 DAI. The structure of microbial communities associated to rhizosphere soil and root from healthy and inoculated plants was characterized through high-throughput DNA sequencing of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) molecular markers and compared at each sampling date. In healthy plants, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes bacterial phyla dominated the rhizosphere and root microbiota of Chinese cabbage. Rhizosphere bacterial communities contained higher abundances of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes compared to the roots. Moreover, a drastic shift of fungal communities of healthy plants occurred between the two last sampling dates, especially in plant roots, where most of Ascomycota fungi dominated until they were replaced by a fungus assigned to the Chytridiomycota phylum. Parasitic invasion by P. brassicae disrupted the rhizosphere and root-associated community assembly at a late step during the root secondary cortical infection stage of clubroot disease. At this stage, Flavisolibacter and Streptomyces in the rhizosphere, and Bacillus in the roots, were drastically less abundant upon parasite invasion. Rhizosphere of plants colonized by P. brassicae was significantly more invaded by the Chytridiomycota fungus, which could reflect a mutualistic relationship in this compartment between these two microorganisms."

In vitro germination experiments indicated that C6-HSL seed priming had a small but significant positive impact on germination levels (1.2x increase, p < 0.0001), coleoptile and radicle development (1.4x increase, p < 0.0001). Field trials over two growing seasons (2015-16 and 2016-17) also demonstrated significant improvements in biomass at the tillering stage (1.4x increase, p < 0.0001), and crop structure and productivity at maturity including grain yield (1.4-1.5x increase, p < 0.0007) and quality (1.3x increase in good grain, p < 0.0001). In some cases variety effects were observed (p ≤ 0.05) suggesting that the effect of C6-HSL seed priming might depend on plant genetics, and some benefits of priming were also evident in F1 plants grown from seeds collected the previous season (p ≤ 0.05). These field-scale findings suggest that bacterial acyl-homoserine lactones such as C6-HSL could be used to improve cereal crop growth and yield and reduce reliance on fungicides and fertilisers to combat pathogens and stress."
https://openalex.org/W2916474382,"In Mexico, the increase in childhood obesity is alarming. Thus, improving the precision of its diagnosis is expected to impact on disease prevention. We estimated obesity prevalence by bioimpedance–based percent body fat (%BF) and body mass index (BMI) in 1061 girls and 1121 boys, from 3 to 17 years old. Multiple regressions and area under receiver operating curves (AUC) were used to determine the predictive value of BMI on %BF and percentile curves were constructed. Overall obesity prevalence estimated by %BF was 43.7%, and by BMI it was 20.1%; it means that the diagnosis by BMI underestimated around 50% of children diagnosed with obesity by %BF (≥30% for girls, ≥25% for boys). The fat mass excess is further underestimated in boys than in girls when using the standard BMI classification. The relationship between %BF and BMI was strong in school children and adolescents (all cases R2>0.70), but not in preschool children (girls R2 = 0.57, boys R2 = 0.23). AUCs showed greater discriminative power of BMI to detect %BF obesity in school children and adolescents (all cases AUC≥0.90) than in preschool children (girls AUC = 0.86; boys AUC = 0.70). Growth percentile charts showed that girls aged 9–17 years and boys aged 8–17 years presented fat excess from the 50th percentile and above. We suggested to change the BMI cut-off for them, considering values at the 75th percentile as overweight, and values at the 85th percentile as obesity, as previously recommended for Mexican children.

Some patients suffer histological transformation to a more aggressive subtype with poorer prognosis. This study aimed to improve our understanding of the genetics underlying FL histological transformation, and to identify genetic drivers or promoters of the transformation by elucidating the differences between FL samples from patients who did and did not transform. We conducted targeted massive parallel sequencing of 22 pre-transformed FL/transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma pairs and 20 diagnostic samples from non-transformed FL patients. Additionally, 22 matched samples from 11 transformed FL patients (pre-transformed FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and 9 non-transformed FLs were studied for copy number variation using SNP arrays. We identified recurrently mutated genes that were enriched at transformation, most notably LRP1B, GNA13 and POU2AF1, which have roles in B-cell differentiation, GC architecture and migration. Mutations in POU2AF1 might be associated with lower levels of expression, were more frequent in transformed FLs, and seemed to be specific to transformed- compared with de novo-diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Pre-transformed FLs carried more mutations per sample and had greater subclonal heterogeneity than non-transformed FLs. Finally, we identified four mutated genes in FL samples that differed between patients who did and did not transform: NOTCH2, DTX1, UBE2A and HIST1H1E. The presence of mutations in these genes was associated with shorter time to transformation when mutated in the FL biopsies. This information might be useful for identifying patients at higher risk of transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2917361850,"Agricultural development must integrate multiple objectives at the same time, including food security, income, and environmental sustainability. To help achieve these objectives, development practitioners need to prioritize concrete livelihood practices to promote to rural households. But trade-offs between objectives can lead to dilemmas in selecting practices. In addition, heterogeneity among farming households requires targeting different strategies to different types of households. Existing diversity of household resources and activities, however, may also bear solutions. We explored a new, empirical research method that identifies promising options for multi-objective development by focusing on existing cases of strong multi-dimensional household performance. The ""Positive Deviance"" approach signifies identifying locally viable livelihood practices from diverse households that achieve stronger performance than comparable households in the same area. These practices are promising for other local households in comparable resource contexts. The approach has been used in other domains, such as child nutrition, but has not yet been fully implemented for agricultural development with a focus on the simultaneous achievement of multiple objectives. To test our adapted version of the Positive Deviance approach, we used a quantitative survey of over 500 rural households in South-Eastern Tanzania. We identified 54 households with outstanding relative performance regarding five key development dimensions (food security, income, nutrition, environmental sustainability, and social equity). We found that, compared to other households with similar resource levels, these ""positive deviants"" performed strongest for food security, but only slightly better for social equity. We then re-visited a diverse sub-sample for qualitative interviews, and identified 14 uncommon, ""deviant"" practices that plausibly contributed to the households' superior outcomes. We illustrate how these practices can inform specific recommendations of practices for other local households in comparable resource contexts. The study demonstrates how, with the Positive Deviance approach, empirical observations of individual, outstanding households can inform discussions about locally viable agricultural development solutions in diverse household context."

Moreover, we show that residue Arg-1441 is critical for regulating the conformational dynamics of ROC.

It remains unclear as to how perturbations of LRRK2 activities result in disease. However, the most common mutation in LRRK2-associated PD, G2019S in the kinase domain, shows higher kinase activity than that of the wildtype (WT); therefore, its over-activation might be associated with disease pathogenesis (7Greggio E.

Moreover, PD-associated mutations in the ROC domain (R1441C) have been shown to have higher kinase activity (11West A.B. Moore D.J. Choi C. Andrabi S.A. Li X. Dikeman D. Biskup S. Zhang Z. Lim K.L.

Here, we show that all the disease-associated mutations at Arg-1441 we examined (R1441H/R1441G/R1441C) showed decreased GTPase activity and a complete loss of monomer–dimer conformational dynamics. These data, taken together with prior reports, suggest that the mutations at Arg-1441 impair monomer–dimer dynamics leading to trapping the GTPase domain of LRRK2 in a more persistently “on” state. A detailed understanding of LRRK2 has been hampered by a lack of protein samples amenable for quantitative biochemical and biophysical studies. As such, most of the detailed insights into the structure and function of LRRK2 have been gleaned from the observations of the homologous proteins. We have recently created a stably-folded G-domain construct of LRRK2 consisting of residues 1329–1520 (Fig. 1) that we called ROCext, which enabled us to study quantitatively the GTPase activity of WT ROCext and the R1441H mutant (12Liao J.

We first measured the GTP hydrolysis activities of the R1441H, R1441G, and R1441C constructs and observed that the specific GTPase activity (pmol mg−1 min−1) was 9.0 ± 0.8, 12.6 ± 0.8, and 12.9 ± 0.8, respectively, which are ∼4-fold lower than that of the WT (48.6 ± 0.8) (Fig. 2a). We found it notable that despite having very different side chain properties, all the mutants showed a similar reduction in activity, which suggests that the arginine residue at position 1441 might be specifically essential for the activity of ROCext. To test this, we made an artificial mutant substituting arginine 1441 for lysine and measured its GTPase activity. Similarly, we observed that the GTPase activity of the R1441K mutant (SA = 10.5 ± 2.5) to be about 4-fold lower than that of the WT (Fig. 2a). These data further supports the notion that arginine at position 1441 is uniquely important for ROCext activity; thus, understanding its role would provide insights into the mechanism of this atypical G-domain and its role in disease pathogenesis. We reported previously that the R1441H mutant has a higher affinity for GTP compared with that of WT, which we suggested might be responsible, in part, for the aberrant activity of LRRK2 (12Liao J.

To determine whether or not this is a general property of mutations at Arg-1441, we measured the affinity of the other mutants, R1441G and R1441C, for GDP and GTP using a fluorescence polarization assay we previously described (12Liao J.

We reconfirmed that the R1441H mutant has higher affinity for GTP (Kd = 3.0 ± 0.4 μm) than that of WT (Kd = 4.1 ± 0.3 μm); however, they are not replicated in the R1441G and R1441C mutants, which have similar GTP affinities (Kd = 4.5 ± 0.7 and 4.9 ± 0.8 μm, respectively) to the WT. Similarly, there are no consistent trends for GDP affinity, where the R1441C mutant has lower affinity for GDP (Kd = 2.5 ± 0.4 μm) compared with that of WT (Kd = 1.2 ± 0.1 μm); whereas the R1441G (Kd = 1.8 ± 0.3 μm) and R1441H (Kd = 1.9 ± 0.3 μm) mutants bind GDP with affinities comparable with the WT (Fig. 2b). These data indicate that the higher affinity for GTP observed in the R1441H mutant is not a commonly shared property among the disease-associated mutations at position 1441; thus, it is probably not a key feature responsible for the reduction in GTPase activity observed in the mutants. Continuing our search for the fundamental properties that rendered the Arg-1441 mutants less active, we measured the thermal stability of each construct using a thermofluor-based protein denaturation assay (17Pantoliano M.W. Petrella E.C. Kwasnoski J.D. Lobanov V.S. Myslik J. Graf E. Carver T. Asel E. Springer B.A. Lane P. Salemme F.R. High-density miniaturized thermal shift assays as a general strategy for drug discovery.J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6 (11788061): 429-44010.1177/108705710100600609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the R1441H ROCext mutant is as thermally stable as the WT with a melting temperatures (Tm) of 54.3 ± 0.1 and 54.3 ± 0.1 °C, respectively (Fig. 2c); whereas the Tm for the R1441G (Tm = 50.5 ± 0.1 °C) and R1441C (Tm = 51.5 ± 0.1 °C) mutants are about 3 °C lower than that of the WT (Fig. 2d). However, the GTPase activity of the R1441H mutant (despite having a higher Tm) is similar to that of R1441C and R1441G, thus it is unlikely that the lowered thermal stability of the mutants is responsible for the reduction in GTPase activity mentioned above. We next examined whether the mutations at position 1441 cause structural perturbation by using CD spectroscopy. We found no significant differences in the CD spectra of the mutants compared with that of the WT, indicating that the mutations have no significant impact to the secondary structure of ROCext (Fig. 3a). Previously we reported that WT ROCext existed in solution in a monomer–dimer equilibrium (12Liao J. Wu C.X. Burlak C. Zhang S. Sahm H. Wang M. Zhang Z.Y. Vogel K.W. Federici M. Riddle S.M.

Wauters L. Guaitoli G. Konijnenberg A. Leemans M. Terheyden S. Petrovic A. Gallardo R. Nederveen-Schippers L.M. Athanasopoulos P.S. Pots H. Van Haastert P.J.M. Sobott F. Gloeckner C.J. Efremov R.

To investigate the effects of PD-associated mutations on the dimerization of ROC, we used multiangle light scattering coupled to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS). We found that all the mutants (R1441G/R1441C/R1441H) occurred as only monomers (Fig. 3b). This result might suggest that the monomeric form of ROC might be catalytically inactive. However, in a previous study, we showed that the monomeric form of ROC is catalytically active. Moreover, we showed that the addition of GTP to the GTPase reaction renders ROC conversion from dimer to monomer. Therefore, it is more likely that the dimer–monomer inter-conversion or cycling is essential for GTP hydrolysis as recently suggested for CtRoco (13Deyaert E. Wauters L. Guaitoli G. Konijnenberg A. Leemans M. Terheyden S. Petrovic A. Gallardo R. Nederveen-Schippers L.M. Athanasopoulos P.S. Pots H. Van Haastert P.J.M. Sobott F. Gloeckner C.J. Efremov R. Kortholt A. Versées W.

Because all the disease-associated mutations at residue Arg-1441 abolished ROCext dimerization, we investigated whether or not position 1441 is critical for regulating the dimer–monomer dynamics. Through systematic substitution mutations at position 1441, we found that a ROCext containing a tyrosine residue at 1441 forms a constitutive dimer with no observable monomers (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, we found that the R1441Y dimer is catalytically inactive (Fig. 4b). A similar observation was recently made in a ROC homolog CtRoco (13Deyaert E. Wauters L. Guaitoli G. Konijnenberg A. Leemans M. Terheyden S. Petrovic A. Gallardo R. Nederveen-Schippers L.M. Athanasopoulos P.S. Pots H. Van Haastert P.J.M. Sobott F. Gloeckner C.J. Efremov R. Kortholt A. Versées W.

Taken together, our data suggest that the conformational dynamics that occur in the monomer–dimer transition is essential for the GTPase activity of LRRK2 and that the disease-associated mutations at Arg-1441 disrupt this activity through interfering with the dimer-monomer dynamics. The remarkable similarities between LRRK2 ROCext and CtRoco in their dimer–monomer dynamics suggests that their mechanism of actions might be conserved. However, a critical difference between CtRoco and our LRRK ROCext is that CtRoco dimerization is driven by interactions in its COR domain (13Deyaert E. Wauters L. Guaitoli G. Konijnenberg A.

This result suggests that the dimerization mechanism of LRRK2 ROC might be different from that of CtRoco. Indeed, as mentioned above, the R1441Y mutation in ROCext locks it in a constitutive homodimeric state; however, the equivalent WT position in CtRoco, residue 558, is natively tyrosine. Moreover, mutations in CtRoco at Tyr-558 mimicking the LRRK2 R1441G/R1441C/R1441H did not affect its dimerization, whereas these mutations in LRRK2 ROCext abolished dimer formation as shown above. These similarities and differences between CtRoco and LRRK2 suggest that the subtle variability in the mechanisms of action observed in the typical Ras and Rab families of GTPases might also occur in the Roco family of GTPases (19Liao J.

However, in our previous investigation, we observed that both GTP and GDP were equally effective for converting dimeric ROC to its monomeric conformation (12Liao J. Wu C.X. Burlak C. Zhang S. Sahm H. Wang M. Zhang Z.Y. Vogel K.W. Federici M. Riddle S.M. Nichols R.J. Liu D. Cookson M.R. Stone T.A. Hoang Q.Q.

Through further investigations, we observed that the EDTA used in the nucleotide exchange itself was sufficient to convert all the dimers into monomers. Based on this, we hypothesized that the monomerization effects of EDTA might have masked the potentially differential effects of GTP and GDP. To investigate this, we incubated ROCext (93% dimers) with varying concentrations of GDP or GTP without EDTA and analyzed their proportions of dimers and monomers using size-exclusion chromatography. As expected, we observed a GTP concentration-dependent conversion of dimeric ROCext to monomers with an equilibrium proportion of dimers and monomers at 5 mm GTP to be 15 and 85%, respectively (Fig. 5a). In contrast, GDP caused a significantly smaller shift in the dimer–monomer equilibrium with a ratio of dimer:monomer at 71:29% in 5 mm GDP (Fig. 5b). These results indicate that GTP drives ROC dimers toward monomers and, reciprocally, GDP shifts the equilibrium toward the dimeric conformation. To investigate this, we developed a method to detect a dynamic conversion from dimer to monomer and then back to dimer in the same protein sample. We did so by first starting with a protein sample consisting of mostly the dimeric form of ROCext (∼85%), then we incubated it with GTP, which converts all the dimers to monomers, and then followed by exchanging it with GDP. We analyzed the dimeric state of the protein sample at each step and found that dimeric ROCext dissociated into monomers upon GTP binding and then about 18% reassembled into dimers upon exchanging for GDP, but none converted to dimers when GTP was added instead at this stage (Fig. 5c). In contrast, the PD-associated mutation R1441G entirely abolished the dimer–monomer dynamics, where it was trapped in a monomeric conformation similar to the GTP-bound samples (Fig. 5d). These results unambiguously demonstrate a reversible dynamic interconversion between dimers and monomers that is mediated by GDP and GTP binding, respectively, and that the PD-associated mutation abolishes this dynamic process. To investigate the potential significance of the observed dimer–monomer dynamics of ROC in the context of the full-length LRRK2 in live cells, we examined the subcellular localization of LRRK2 carrying the mutations that gave rise to monomeric and dimeric ROCext. We used our previously described method to characterize interactions of LRRK2 with a binding partner RAB29 (21Beilina A. Rudenko I.N. Kaganovich A. Civiero L. Chau H. Kalia S.K. Kalia L.V.

Under normal conditions LRRK2 is localized to the cytosol, but when co-transfected with RAB29 it re-localizes in clusters that overlap with the trans-Golgi network. Upon over-expression of the mutants with RAB29 in HEK293FT cells, we observed a significant increase in LRRK2 re-localization to the trans-Golgi network with all the Arg-1441 mutations compared with WT (Fig. 6). Although the biological function of LRRK2 and its normal subcellular localization are still unclear, our results clearly demonstrate differential effects in subcellular localization between the different mutations that are shown dimeric and monomeric in our in vitro assays. Taken together, the results suggest that Arg-1441 is critical for the conformational dynamics of ROC, which modulates the activity and potentially the subcellular localization of LRRK2. Detailed investigations of LRRK2 has been stymied by a lack of protein samples in the quality and quantity required for quantitative studies. Recently, we reported the construction of a ROC domain and a method to obtain it in a form amenable for quantitative studies, which showed that disease-associated mutation R1441H rendered it catalytically less active and thereby, trapping it more persistently on conformation, although we were unable to precisely define the “on conformation” at the time (12Liao J.

We hypothesised that the above phenomena might impair ovarian reserve.A total of 50 SCD patients were case-matched by age, ethnicity, and presence of regular cycles (28±5 days) with 73 patients without a known haemoglobinopathy who required anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) assessment in a gynaecology clinic. SCD patients had AMH levels taken as part of routine care. The patients were case-controlled and matched with patients who had no haemoglobinopathy in a tertiary centre over a period of one year.The mean AMH in the SCD case group was 7.6 pmol/l compared with 13.4 pmol/l in the control group (p<0.001). The AMH distributions were subsequently categorised. This showed that SCD patients had a significantly higher chance of having lower AMH in comparison with the control group (OR 2.6 (CI 1.1-6.5, P = 0.02). The proportion of women with AMH > 20 pmol/l was significantly lower in the SCD group (6%) in comparison with the control group (19%) (P = 0.04).This is the first study showing that women of reproductive age with SCD are more likely to have a low ovarian reserve at a younger age in comparison with patients with no haemoglobinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2915418487,"Background The majority of U.S hospitals have implemented electronic health records (EHRs). While the benefits of EHRs have been widely touted, little is known about their effects on inpatient care, including how well they meet workflow needs and support care. Objective Assess the extent to which EHRs support care team workflow during hospital morning rounds. Design We applied a mixed-method approach including observations of care teams during morning rounds, semi-structured interviews and an electronic survey of hospital inpatient clinicians. Structured field notes taken during observations were used to identify workflow patterns for analysis. We applied a grounded theory approach to extract emerging themes from interview transcripts and used SPSS Statistics 24 to analyze survey responses. Setting Medical units at a major teaching hospital in New England. Results Data triangulation across the three analyses yielded four main findings: (1) a high degree of variance in the ways care teams use EHRs during morning rounds. (2) Pervasive use of workarounds at critical points of care (3) EHRs are not used for information sharing and frequently impede intra-care team communication. (4) System design and hospital room settings do not adequately support care team workflow. Conclusions Gaps between EHR design and the functionality needed in the complex inpatient environment result in lack of standardized workflows, extensive use of workarounds and team communication issues. These issues pose a threat to patient safety and quality of care. Possible solutions need to include improvements in EHR design, care team training and changes to the hospital room setting."

However, memory performance over time may be quite heterogeneous within diagnostic groups. Method To identify latent trajectories in memory performance and their associated risk factors, we analyzed data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants who were classified either as cognitively normal or as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at baseline and were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test (RAVLT) for up to 9 years. Group-based trajectory modeling on the 30-minute RAVLT delayed recall score was applied separately to the two baseline diagnostic groups. Results There were 219 normal subjects with mean age 75.9 (range from 59.9 to 89.6) and 52.5% male participants, and 372 MCI subjects with mean age 74.8 (range from 55.1 to 89.3) and 63.7% male participants included in the analysis. For normal subjects, six trajectories were identified. Trajectories were classified into three types, determined by the shape, each of which may comprise more than one trajectory: stable (~30% of subjects), curvilinear decline (~ 28%), and linear decline (~ 42%). Notably, none of the normal subjects assigned to the stable stratum progressed to dementia during the study period. In contrast, all trajectories identified for the MCI group tended to decline, although some participants were later re-diagnosed with normal cognition. Age, sex, and education were significantly associated with trajectory membership for both diagnostic groups, while APOE ɛ4 was only significantly associated with trajectories among MCI participants. Conclusion Memory trajectory is a strong indicator of dementia risk. If likely trajectory of memory performance can be identified early, such work may allow clinicians to monitor or predict progression of individual patient cognition. This work also shows the importance of longitudinal cognitive testing and monitoring."

Tumors were disassociated from both genotypes and their growth characteristics evaluated. A52 cells from APN KO mice had the most robust growth in vitro and in vivo, and presented with pathology similar to the parental tumor. All primary tumors and cell lines exhibited activity of the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and Src pathways. Subsequent combinatorial treatment, with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin and the Src inhibitor Dasatinib reduced A52 HCC growth 29-fold in vivo. Through protein and histological analyzes we observed activation of these pathways in human HCC, suggesting that targeting both mTOR and Src may be a novel approach for the treatment of HCC."

Given the limitations of conventional diagnostic techniques (i.e., microscopy and culture), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay was developed to detect Nocardia spp. on clinical samples. While this test is increasingly being used by transplant physicians, its performance characteristics are not well documented. We evaluated the performance characteristics of this test on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from lung transplant recipients (LTRs).We prospectively included all BAL samples from LTRs undergoing bronchoscopy at our institution between December 2016 and June 2017 (either surveillance or clinically-indicated bronchoscopies). Presence of microbial pathogens was assessed using techniques available locally (including microscopy and 10-day culture for Nocardia). BAL samples were also sent to the French Nocardiosis Observatory (Lyon, France) for the Nocardia PCR-based assay. Transplant physicians and patients were blinded to the Nocardia PCR results.We included 29 BAL samples from 21 patients (18 surveillance and 11 clinically-indicated bronchoscopies). Nocardiosis was not diagnosed in any of these patients by conventional techniques. However, Nocardia PCR was positive in five BAL samples from five of the patients (24%, 95% confidence interval: 11-45%); four were asymptomatic and undergoing surveillance bronchoscopy, and one was symptomatic and was later diagnosed with influenza virus infection. None of the five PCR-positive patients died or were diagnosed with nocardiosis during the median follow-up of 21 months after the index bronchoscopy (range: 20-23 months).In this prospective study, Nocardia PCR was positive on BAL fluid from one fourth of the LTRs. Nocardia PCR-based assays should be used with caution on respiratory samples from LTRs because of the possible detection of airway colonization using this technique. Larger studies are required to determine the usefulness of the Nocardia PCR-based assay in transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2917220015,"The optimum temperature is commonly determined in enzyme characterization. A search in the PubMed database for ""optimum temperature"" and ""enzymes"" yielded more than 1,700 manuscripts reporting this parameter over the last five years. Here, we show that the optimum temperature is not a constant. The catalytic activity of the mesophylic β-glucosidase Sfβgly was determined at different temperatures using different assay times and enzyme concentrations. We observed that the optimum temperature for Sfβgly changed by 5°C simply by modifying the assay length, and it was inversely correlated with enzyme concentration. These observations rely on the fact that close to the melting temperature, thermal denaturation continuously decreases the active enzyme concentration as the assay progresses. Thus, as the denaturation rate increases with increasing temperature, the bell-shaped curves observed in ""activity versus temperature plots"" occur only if the enzyme is denatured at and above the optimum temperature, which was confirmed using the thermostable β-glucosidase bglTm. Thus, the optimum temperature hardly reflects an intrinsic enzyme property and is actually a mere consequence of the assay condition. Thus, adoption of the ""optimum temperature"" determined under bench conditions for large-scale uses, which differ in assay length and enzyme concentration, may result in lower yields and financial losses."

The human ANO1 promoter contains binding sites for the glioma-associated oncogene (Gli) proteins. We investigated regulation of ANO1 transcription by Gli. ANO1 promoter activity was determined using a luciferase reporter system. Binding and functional effects of Glis on ANO1 transcription and expression were demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation, small interfering RNA knockdown, PCR, immunolabeling, and recordings of Ca2+-activated Cl- currents in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Results from previous genome-wide association studies were used to test ANO1 promoter polymorphisms for association with disease. Gli1 and Gli2 bound to the promoter and repressed ANO1 transcription. Repression depended on Gli binding to a site close to the ANO1 transcriptional start site. Mutation of this site prevented Gli binding and transcriptional repression. Knockdown of Gli expression and inhibition of Gli activity increased expression of ANO1 RNA and Ca2+-activated Cl- currents in HEK293 cells. A single-nucleotide polymorphism prevented Gli binding and showed association with irritable bowel syndrome. We conclude that Gli1 and Gli2 repress ANO1 by a novel mechanism that is independent of Gli cleavage and that has a role in gastrointestinal function.-Mazzone, A., Gibbons, S. J., Eisenman, S.

Complexities in the seismic velocity structure, particularly changes in velocity caused by the progression of mining excavations, can cause systematic event mislocations. To address this problem, we present a novel construction method for an arbitrary 3D velocity model and a targeted hypocenter determination method based on this velocity model in underground mining. The method constructs a velocity model from 3D geological objects that can accurately express the interfaces of geologic units. Based on this model, the block corresponding to the minimum difference between the observed arrival times and the theoretical arrival times computed by the Fast Marching Method is located. Finally, a relocation procedure is carried out within the targeted block by heuristic algorithms to improve the performance. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by the source localization results of both synthetic data and on-site data from Dongguashan Copper Mine.

https://openalex.org/W2917289038,"G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2) is a specific inhibitor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Recent studies show that G0S2 plays a critical role in promoting triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation in the liver, and its encoding gene is a direct target of a major lipogenic transcription factor liver X receptor (LXR)α. Here we sought to investigate a lipolysis-independent role of G0S2 in hepatic triglyceride synthesis. Knockdown of G0S2 decreased hepatic TG content in mice with ATGL ablation. Conversely, overexpression of G0S2 promoted fatty acid incorporation into TGs and diacylglycerols in both wild-type and ATGL-deficient hepatocytes. Biochemical characterization showed that G0S2 mediates phosphatidic acid synthesis from lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and acyl-coenzyme A. In response to a high-sucrose lipogenic diet, G0S2 is up-regulated via LXRα and required for the increased TG accumulation in liver. Furthermore, deletion of a distinct 4-aa motif necessary for the LPA-specific acyltransferase (LPAAT) activity impaired G0S2's ability to mediate TG synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. These studies identify G0S2 as a dual-function regulator of lipid metabolism as well as a novel mechanism whereby hepatic TG storage is promoted in response to lipogenic stimulation. In addition to its role as a lipolytic inhibitor, G0S2 is capable of directly promoting TG synthesis by acting as a lipid-synthesizing enzyme.-Zhang, X., Xie, X., Heckmann, B. L., Saarinen, A.

We investigated how these proteins change with aging, and whether this change is related to a decline in kidney function, or to a change in hemoglobin levels. Material and methods In the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study, including 1,016 participants from the general population aged 70 at baseline, 84 proteins were measured at ages 70, 75, 80. At these occasions, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated and the hemoglobin levels were measured. Results Sixty-one of the 84 evaluated proteins changed significantly during the 10-year follow-up (multiple testing-adjusted alpha = 0.00059), most showing an increase. The change in eGFR was inversely related to changes of protein levels for the vast majority of proteins (74%). The change in hemoglobin was significantly related to the change in 40% of the evaluated proteins, with no obvious preference of the direction of these relationships. Conclusion The majority of evaluated proteins increased with aging in adults. Therefore, normal ranges for proteins might be given in age-strata. The increase in protein levels was associated with the degree of reduction in eGFR for the majority of proteins, while no clear pattern was seen for the relationships between the proteins and the change in hemoglobin levels. Studies on changes in urinary proteins are warranted to understand the association between the reduction in eGFR and increase in plasma protein levels."

Participants rated their health at each data collection; every other collection included a BMI assessment by a nurse. Case status was defined as a first report of poor health during follow-up. Three age- and sex-matched controls were identified per case using density sampling. BMI trajectories were fitted to time backwards prior to first report of poor health using mixed-effects models. Age and sex were potential modifiers. We conducted subgroup analyses of those not reporting certain chronic diseases or smoking.We identified 732 cases and 2195 controls. Age, but not sex, modified the association between BMI and self-rated health. Participants reporting poor health at age 60 had a 1.5 kg/m2 (95%CI: 0.8 to 2.1) higher BMI at the time of reporting than controls, and their BMI had previously increased markedly (1.3 kg/m2 95%CI: 0.9 to 1.8 over ten years). After age 75, cases no longer had higher BMI than controls, and their BMI had decreased sharply prior to reporting poor health (e.g. -2.0 kg/m2 95%CI: -2.6 to -1.5 per decade on average for those reporting poor health at age 90). Age was also an effect modifier among those without diabetes, however BMI trajectories were more similar among the middle-aged. The subgroup analysis of those without cardiovascular disease, cancer and chronic lung disease showed similar results to the main findings.Development of BMI was associated with poor self-rated health; however, the nature of the association depended markedly on age."
https://openalex.org/W2915224080,"Surface incoming shortwave (solar) radiation data are an important component of many scientific analyses, but direct measurements are not commonly available. Estimates can be obtained from gridded meteorological analysis or reanalysis systems, such as the Global Data Assimilation Systems (GDAS) and Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis System (MERRA-2), or calculated using empirical models dependent on meteorological variables such as air temperature. The purpose of this analysis was to compare multiple methods for estimating daily shortwave radiation in a tropical highland environment in Ethiopia. Direct solar radiation outputs of GDAS and MERRA-2, topographically corrected outputs of the two analysis systems, and empirically estimated solar radiation values calculated with the systems’ air temperature data were compared to see which produced the most reliable radiation values. GDAS appeared to underestimate the seasonal variability, resulting in low correlation (R2) with in situ data and large mean bias error (MBE). In comparison, MERRA-2 did not underestimate variability, but produced larger bias than the empirical model estimates. There was an improvement in correlation and reduction in MBE when using the GDAS air temperature predictions in the empirical model, but the opposite was true for MERRA-2. The empirical model using station air temperature data (stationT) produced the highest correlation across all four stations, with best performance at the lower elevation sites. The direct shortwave radiation outputs of MERRA-2 produced comparable correlation values, with larger R2 at stations at higher elevation. Topography possibly influenced these results, as MERRA-2 performed comparably to stationT at the stations in moderate terrain, but not in steeper terrain. This work can serve as a starting point for analyses in other tropical highland regions, where continuous in situ solar radiation data are rarely available."
https://openalex.org/W2916921526,"Background The effect of cadence and work rate on the joint specific power production in cycling has previously been studied, but research has primarily focused on cadences above 60 rpm, without examining the effect of low cadence on joint contribution to power. Purpose Our purpose was to investigate joint specific power production in recreational and elite cyclists during low- and moderate cycling at a range of different cadences. Methods 18 male cyclists (30.9 ± 2.7 years with a work rate in watt at lactate threshold of 282.3 ± 9.3 W) performed cycling bouts at seven different pedalling rates and three intensities. Joint specific power was calculated from kinematic measurements and pedal forces using inverse dynamics at a total of 21 different stages. Results A main effect of cadence on the relative to the total joint power for hip-, knee- and ankle joint power was found (all p < 0.05). Increasing cadence led to increasing knee joint power and decreasing hip joint power (all p < 0.05), with the exception at low cadence (<60 rpm), where there was no effect of cadence. The elite cyclists had higher relative hip joint power compared to the recreational group (p < 0.05). The hip joint power at moderate intensity with a freely chosen cadence (FCC) was lower than the hip joint power at low intensity with a low cadence (<60 rpm) (p < 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that there is an effect of cadence on the hip- and knee joint contribution in cycling, however, the effect only occurs from 60 rpm and upward. It also demonstrates that there is a difference in joint contribution between elite- and recreational cyclists, and provide evidence for the possibility of achieving higher relative hip joint power at low intensity than moderate intensity by altering the cadence."

To improve the accuracy and precision of regional corn yield predictions, a simple approach for assimilating Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products into a crop growth model was developed, and regional yield prediction performance was evaluated in a major corn-producing state, Illinois, USA. Corn growth and yield were simulated for each grid using the Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Maize model with minimum inputs comprising planting date, fertilizer amount, genetic coefficients, soil, and weather data. Planting date was estimated using a phenology model with a leaf area duration (LAD)-logistic function that describes the seasonal evolution of MODIS-derived leaf area index (LAI). Genetic coefficients of the corn cultivar were determined to be the genetic coefficients of the maturity group [included in Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) 4.6], which shows the minimum difference between the maximum LAI derived from the LAD-logistic function and that simulated by the CERES-Maize model. In addition, the daily water stress factors were estimated from the ratio between daily leaf area/weight growth rates estimated from the LAD-logistic function and that simulated by the CERES-Maize model under the rain-fed and auto-irrigation conditions. The additional assimilation of MODIS data-derived water stress factors and LAI under the auto-irrigation condition showed the highest prediction accuracy and precision for the yearly corn yield prediction (R2 is 0.78 and the root mean square error is 0.75 t ha-1).

PP2A comprises three distinct subunits and forms through a highly regulated biogenesis process, with the scaffolding A subunit existing as two highly related isoforms, Aα and Aβ. PP2A's tumor-suppressive functions have been intensely studied, and PP2A inactivation has been shown to be a prerequisite for tumor formation. Interestingly, although partial loss of the Aα isoform is growth promoting, complete Aα loss has no transformative properties.

Using both cellular and in vivo systems, colorectal and endometrial cancer cell lines, and biochemical and cellular assays, here we examined why the complete loss of Aα does not promote tumorigenesis. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homozygous Aα deletion resulted in decreased colony formation and tumor growth across multiple cell lines. Protein expression analysis of PP2A family members revealed that the Aα deletion markedly up-regulates Aβ protein expression by increasing Aβ protein stability.

It is a heterotrimeric enzyme comprised of a scaffolding A subunit, catalytic C subunit, and one of several regulatory B subunits.

Interestingly, whereas complete loss of Aβ results in transformation, Aα functions as a tumor suppressor in a haploinsufficient manner. These data are reflective of what has been seen in large sequencing cohorts, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). These studies have revealed that although the Aα isoform is altered in 35% of human cancers, homozygous deletions of Aα are exceedingly rare, occurring in only 0.3% of patient tumors (Fig. S2, A and B). In contrast, deletions of Aβ are more common, as the Aβ gene PPP2R1B is located within the chromosomal region 11q23, a region commonly deleted in cancer (9Döhner H. Stilgenbauer S. James M.R.

To define the molecular basis for why homozygous Aα deletion appears to be unfavorable for cancer cell growth, we used a combination of biochemical and cellular assays to examine the functional ramifications of complete loss of the Aα subunit. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated homozygous deletion of the Aα subunit was growth suppressive across multiple cellular contexts. We examined the expression levels of various PP2A subunits in control and Aα-deficient cells and found that Aα loss lead to a robust increase in expression of the Aβ scaffold subunit as a result of increased Aβ protein stability. Knockdown of Aβ in the Aα knockout cells was lethal, suggesting that a minimum amount of PP2A activity is necessary for cell survival. Co-immunoprecipitation of Aβ protein in the presence and absence of Aα revealed that there was an increase in specific Aβ holoenzymes, including B56γ and PR130, upon Aα deletion. Modulating specific Aβ holoenzymes by knockdown of B56γ restored colony growth, indicating that B56γ-Aβ holoenzymes are at least partially responsible for the growth-suppressive effects of Aβ upon homozygous Aα loss. Together, these findings highlight why complete Aα loss is rarely seen in patients and reveals a unique mechanism through which Aα regulates Aβ protein levels and subsequent phosphatase activity. To eliminate PP2A Aα protein, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to create insertion and deletion mutations in exon 5, corresponding to HEAT 5 of the Aα protein (Fig. 1A; Fig. S3). The double nicking strategy using mutant Cas9n was utilized to limit off-target effects, and two separate knockout clones for each cell line (designated as KO.1 and KO.2) were used to verify the on-target specificity of our findings (14Ran F.A.

Colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer cell lines were chosen for these analyses because both heterozygous mutations as well as heterozygous loss of the Aα subunit are recurrent in these contexts, indicating that haploinsufficiency of Aα in these cancers may be a mechanism of PP2A inactivation (The Cancer Genome Atlas) (16Haesen D.

Specifically, two colorectal cancer cell lines, SW620 and HCT-116, and two patient-derived endometrial cell lines, UT89 and UT150, were selected for the generation of Aα knockouts. Knockout clones were first screened by DNA sequencing and subsequent Western blot analysis confirmed the knockout of Aα protein. Because of the high sequence homology between Aα and Aβ, an antibody targeting both isoforms was used for the detection of Aα. Knockout of Aα resulted in an almost complete loss of total A subunit protein expression across all cell lines analyzed, consistent with reports that the Aα isoform is the predominantly expressed isoform in most tissues (Fig. 1, B–E) (4Zhou J. Pham H.T. Ruediger R. Walter G. Characterization of the Aα and Aβ subunit isoforms of protein phosphatase 2A: Differences in expression, subunit interaction, and evolution.Biochem.

Consistent with previous literature, depletion of the Aα subunit also resulted in decreased levels of the PP2A C subunit expression (Fig. 1, B–E) (18Xiao G. Chan L.N. Klemm L. Braas D. Chen Z.

To determine the effects of Aα subunit knockout on cell growth, clonogenic colony formation assays were performed. Interestingly, in these assays the loss of Aα subunit resulted in an approximate 20–30% decrease in colony formation across all cell lines and knockout clones analyzed (Fig. 1, F and G). Taken together, these findings suggest that although heterozygous Aα loss is tumor promoting, the complete loss of Aα is not growth promoting, but instead growth suppressive. To understand why knockout of the Aα subunit was growth suppressive, we investigated how the loss of Aα protein impacted other PP2A subunit family members. To do so, we performed Western blot analysis of regulatory subunits, including striatin, striatin 3, PR130, PR70, B55α, B56γ, and B56δ, as well as Aα's closely related isoform Aβ (Fig. 2, A–D; Fig. S4). To analyze Aβ protein levels, an antibody directed toward the unique N-terminal region was used. Interestingly, the protein expression levels of only select regulatory subunit isoforms were affected by Aα knockout. Specifically, the expression of B55α and B56δ dramatically decreased upon Aα knockout, whereas other isoforms, including B56γ, PR130, and the striatin proteins were unaffected. Remarkably, although Aα and Aβ have been proposed to have distinct functions, the protein levels of Aβ increased ∼5-fold across all Aα KO cell lines (Fig. 2, A–D). The increase in Aβ protein expression was not associated with changes in Aβ mRNA levels, as measured in SW620 and UT150 (Fig. S5), suggesting that the increase in Aβ expression occurred posttranscriptionally. Taken together, these results indicate that loss of the more abundantly expressed scaffold isoform, Aα, has widespread effects on PP2A subunit protein levels across all subunit families (scaffolding A, regulatory B, and catalytic C) and suggests that distinct PP2A subunits, in particular Aβ, may be directly dependent on the Aα scaffold for their stability. To determine the effects of Aα depletion on tumor growth in vivo, we performed an SW620 xenograft model using control and Aα KO.1 cells (Fig. 3). SW620 was selected for downstream analyses as it grows efficiently in vivo and is a well-characterized cell line, part of the NCI-60 panel. In this model, consistent with growth in vitro, the SW620 Aα KO.1 tumors grew significantly slower than the control tumors (Fig. 3A; Table S1). Subsequent analysis of PP2A subunit expression by Western blotting showed a trend consistent with what was observed in cell culture (Fig. 3B). Importantly, there was significantly less A subunit and C subunit protein in these tumors, confirming that the Aα subunit knockout was maintained (Fig. 3, B and C). Additionally, there was significant up-regulation of the Aβ subunit, consistent with data observed in cell culture models (Fig. 3, B). Finally, quantification of the regulatory subunits showed no significant changes in the striatin, PR70 family, or B56γ regulatory subunits consistent with in vitro analyses (Fig. 3, B and D). There was a trend of decreased B55α levels in the Aα knockout tumors, but this change did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3, B and D). B56δ levels could not be measured in vivo as the antibody did not detect adequate bands in any group (data not shown). In summary, these results showed that Aα knockout caused a reduction in tumor growth. Additionally, Aα knockout resulted in the up-regulation of Aβ and decrease of C subunit expression in vivo. Based on the altered PP2A subunit expression upon Aα depletion, we characterized the effects of Aα expression on the stability of select PP2A subunits. To determine whether Aβ protein stability was altered in the absence of Aα protein, we treated control and knockout SW620 cells with cycloheximide and monitored Aβ protein expression by Western blotting over time (Fig. 4A). From these Western blot analyses, we graphed and calculated the Aβ protein half-life (Fig. 4, B and C). In control cells, the calculated half-life of Aβ was ∼6 h. Conversely, in Aα knockout cells, the half-life of Aβ increased to ∼23 h, suggesting that the increase in Aβ protein seen in Aα KO cells was a result of increased protein stability (Fig. 4, A–C). We also examined whether C subunit stability was altered, based upon our observation of decreased C subunit protein expression in Aα knockout cells. Similarly, we treated control and knockout SW620 cells with cycloheximide and monitored C subunit protein levels by Western blotting over time (Fig. 4D). In control cells, the C subunit expression was only decreased 40% within 24 h, so a half-life could not be calculated (Fig. 4, E and F). Conversely, the calculated half-life of the C subunit in Aα knockout cells was ∼2 h, suggesting that the stability of the C subunit may be partially dependent on the presence of the Aα subunit (Fig. 4, E and F). Additionally, B55α was also found to be less stable in the absence of Aα (Fig. S6). Re-expression of exogenous Aα protein restored Aβ and C subunit protein expression levels (Fig. 4, G–I). Finally, cotreatment of control SW620 cells with cycloheximide and MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, rescued Aβ protein degradation, indicating that Aα regulation of Aβ protein stability is mediated through the proteasome (Fig. 4, J and K). Additionally, cotreatment of SW620 Aα knockout cells with cycloheximide and MG-132 rescued C subunit protein degradation, indicating that the Aα regulation of C subunit stability is also mediated through the proteasome (Fig. 4, L and M). Taken together, these data indicate that knockout of Aα alters the protein stability of both the Aβ and C subunit, suggesting that Aα may play a role in their regulation. The Aβ subunit of PP2A is an established tumor suppressor and complete knockdown of Aβ leads to cellular transformation (6Sablina A.A. Chen W. Arroyo J.D. Corral L. Hector M. Bulmer S.E. DeCaprio J.A. Hahn W.C. The tumor suppressor PP2A Aβ regulates the RalA GTPase.Cell. 2007; 129 (17540176): 969-98210.1016/j.cell.2007.03.047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To determine whether the baseline differences in growth observed in control and Aα knockout cells resulted from the up-regulation of Aβ and subsequent Aβ holoenzymes, we generated stable knockdown cell lines with two different shRNAs targeting Aβ in the SW620 control and KO.1 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Stable cell lines were generated using lentiviral transduction followed by selection in puromycin. Surprisingly, after selection, although all cell lines were resistant to puromycin, only the control cells had significant knockdown of Aβ, indicating that complete removal of all PP2A scaffolding subunit may not be tolerated in cells (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine whether the reduction of Aβ in Aα knockout cells impacted cell viability, we performed acute knockdown of Aβ using two distinct sequence-specific siRNAs targeting Aβ in SW620 control and KO.1 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). Acute depletion of Aβ resulted in a significant decrease in Aβ protein expression in both the control and KO.1 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). However, there was a significant decrease in viability in only the Aα knockout cells upon knockdown of Aβ by siRNA as measured by MTT and Western blotting for cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 5, E and F). Together, these data indicate that there is a minimum amount of scaffold required for cell survival and are suggestive that the up-regulation of Aβ, and the Aβ holoenzymes formed, allows for cell survival in the absence of the Aα subunit expression. Homozygous deletion of Aα reduced tumor growth and was associated with up-regulation of Aβ, suggesting that increased activity of Aβ containing holoenzymes may be tumor suppressing in this context. To determine the tumor-suppressive Aβ containing holoenzymes, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to identify which B subunits were interacting with Aβ. Using an Aβ-specific antibody, we immunoprecipitated Aβ and its binding partners in the presence and absence of Aα using control and Aα KO SW620 cells and measured the interactions of select PP2A subunits by immunoblotting (Fig. 6, A and B). To quantify interactions, the amount of each protein was first normalized to the amount of Aβ to control for the expression differences in Aβ between the two cell lines. After normalization, the resulting values were graphed relative to the SW620 controls to determine whether binding ratios were altered upon knockout of Aα (Fig. 6B). Through this analysis, it was determined that specific regulatory subunits, including PR130, B56δ, and B56γ, were more highly bound to Aβ in the absence of Aα, although the increase in PR130 binding did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, the loss of regulatory subunits PR130 and B56γ have previously been implicated in cellular transformation (8Sablina A.A. Hector M. Colpaert N. Hahn W.C. Identification of PP2A complexes and pathways involved in cell transformation.Cancer Res. 2010; 70 (21159657): 10474-1048410.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Chen W.

Conversely, knockdown of B56δ has been shown to be unfavorable to transformation and resulted in a further reduction of colony growth (8Sablina A.A. Hector M. Colpaert N. Hahn W.C. Identification of PP2A complexes and pathways involved in cell transformation.Cancer Res. 2010; 70 (21159657): 10474-1048410.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine whether the colony growth phenotype depends on specific regulatory subunits, we generated stable knockdown lines using specific shRNAs, focusing on the regulatory subunits previously implicated in cellular transformation, PR130 and B56γ, which also displayed increased binding to Aβ in the absence of Aα, and one regulatory subunit B55α, which displayed unaltered binding to Aβ upon Aα loss. A nontargeting shRNA construct was used as a control (Fig. 6, C and D). Stable knockdown of B55α and B56γ was efficiently achieved in both control and Aα KO SW620 cells. However, stable knockdown of PR130 was only obtained in the control SW620 cells, paralleling the results seen with stable knockdown of Aβ, raising the possibility that PR130/Aβ holoenzymes are essential for cell viability in the absence of Aα. To determine the effects of the regulatory subunit knockdown on cell growth, clonogenic colony formation assays were performed (Fig. 6, E and F). Interestingly, the loss of each regulatory subunit resulted in similar growth changes in both the control and Aα KO cells; regulatory subunit knockdown resulted in either decreased (shB55α) or increased (shB56γ) colony growth. However, only the knockdown of B56γ in the Aα KO cells restored colony growth to baseline, suggesting that the B56γ/Aβ holoenzymes are critical for the growth-suppressive effects seen upon Aα loss (Fig. 6F). Taken together, these data show that there is an increase in the formation of specific Aβ-containing holoenzymes in the absence of Aα, and the increase in Aβ-B56γ holoenzymes is at least partially responsible for the decreased colony growth seen upon loss of Aα. The goal of this study was to elucidate the functional ramifications and potential clinical relevance of the complete loss of the PP2A Aα subunit. Here, we demonstrate that complete loss of Aα suppressed cell and tumor growth and describe a compensatory mechanism by which PP2A Aα regulates Aβ protein stability and activity, which may suggest why homozygous loss of Aα is rarely seen in patients. Previous literature suggests that the Aα and Aβ scaffolding subunits have distinct functions within a cell (4Zhou J. Pham H.T. Ruediger R. Walter G.

Specifically, in cell-based transformation assays, the exogenous overexpression of the Aα isoform was unable to compensate for the loss of Aβ on transformation (6Sablina A.A. Chen W. Arroyo J.D. Corral L. Hector M. Bulmer S.E. DeCaprio J.A. Hahn W.C. The tumor suppressor PP2A Aβ regulates the RalA GTPase.Cell. 2007; 129 (17540176): 969-98210.1016/j.cell.2007.03.047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that there are some overlapping functions between the two scaffold subunits. In a transformed, tumorigenic cell, loss of Aα is tolerated because of a compensatory increase in Aβ protein. Subsequent removal of the Aβ caused a decrease in cell viability, indicating that the complete loss of PP2A scaffolding subunits is not tolerated. Thus, the overlapping functions of Aα and Aβ are likely essential functions of PP2A necessary for cellular survival, whereas the distinct actions of the two scaffolds may represent more specialized activities. The interplay between the two subunits is more complicated on a physiological level, as evidenced by Aα knockout mouse models. In mice, complete loss of Aα is embryonically lethal and total body inducible knockout of Aα in adult mice is also lethal, suggesting that Aβ is not able to completely compensate for Aα during development or in normal physiology (21Ruediger R.

https://openalex.org/W2917764500,"Ferulic acid (FA), a low-molecular weight aromatic compound derived from lignin, represents a high-value molecule, used for applications in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. FA can be further enzymatically converted in other commercially interesting molecules, such as vanillin and bioplastics. In several organisms, these transformations often start with a common step of FA activation via CoA-thioesterification, catalyzed by feruloyl-CoA synthetases (Fcs). In this context, these enzymes are of biotechnological interest for conversion of lignin-derived FA into high value chemicals. In this study, we describe the first structural characterization of a prokaryotic Fcs, named FCS1, isolated from a lignin-degrading microbial consortium. The FCS1 optimum pH and temperature were 9 and 37°C, respectively, with Km of 0.12 mM and Vmax of 36.82 U/mg. The circular dichroism spectra indicated a notable secondary structure stability at alkaline pH values and high temperatures. This secondary structure stability corroborates the activity data, which remains high until pH 9. The Small Angle X-Ray Scattering analyses resulted on the tertiary/quaternary structure and the low-resolution envelope in solution of FCS1, which was modeled as a homodimer using the hyperthermophilic nucleoside diphosphate-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from Candidatus Korachaeum cryptofilum. This study contributes to the field of research by establishing the first biophysical and structural characterization for Fcs, and our data may be used for comparison against novel enzymes of this class that to be studied in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2917742510,"Introduction Prenatal androgen exposure has important organizing effects on brain development and therefore on future behavior. Previous research has shown, that the ratio between index finger (2D) and ring finger (4D) (2D:4D) could function as a marker of prenatal androgen effects, with a relatively shorter 2D indicating a higher prenatal androgen exposure. 2D:4D is associated with status-seeking and competitive behavior but also with altruism. Therefore, 2D:4D should be related to academic success. Methods We examined the 2D:4D of both hands, as well as the difference between both variables (Dr-l), of 209 university graduates (74 women) employed at the Medical Faculty of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany, and we assessed the relationship of these variables with academic career performance. Career performance was measured by the number of publications as first or last author, and by achievement of an academic degree used in many European countries, the so-called “Habilitation”. Results In a within-sex analysis we found a non-monotonic association between the right hand digit ratio and the probability of having a “Habilitation” in females. Academic success, measured by the number of publications as first or last author and the probability of a ""Habilitation"", increases with age. In agreement with the literature, we found higher academic success in men. Conclusion We found a non-monotonic relationship between right hand 2D:4D and academic success in females. However, the significance of this relationship was weak."
https://openalex.org/W2916163511,"Open biomedical repositories, such as PubMed Central (PMC), are a means to make research discoverable and permanently accessible. Assessing the potential interest of key stakeholders in an Australasia PubMed Central was the objective of this research. The investigation is novel, assisting in the development of open science infrastructure through its systematic analysis of the potential interest in, and viability of a biomedical repository for managing openly accessible research outputs for the Australasia region. The research adopted a qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews and a focus group. Forty-four stakeholders located throughout Australia and New Zealand participated in the research. Participants expanded upon their experience of PubMed, MEDLINE, PMC and their use of information resources for research and clinical practice. The Evidence Based Healthcare (EBHC) pyramid was the theoretical model adopted to explain open biomedical repository processes. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis identified support for exploring membership of an international PMC system, in particular Europe PMC. Lessons learnt from PMC US, Europe PMC and PMC Canada (collectively known as PubMed Central International) informed the investigation. A major strength identified was that PubMed Central International has been able to achieve high levels of compliance way beyond that of most institutional repositories. A great threat faced is overcoming the difficulties of working together with other major world bodies and financially sustaining an Australasia PMC. Improving Australasian biomedical knowledge management processes may be possible from adopting a PMC for retrieving and transferring research, linked to the data underlying the research. This in turn could help put regional research under a brighter spotlight, potentially leading to improvements in research quality. There is an opportunity for a potential Australasia PMC to harvest biomedical research from the National Library of Australia’s aggregator database, Trove and work closely with Europe PMC to avoid duplication of effort. Overall, establishment of an Australasia permanent biomedical digital open repository is perceived as important, with significant potential flow-on benefits to healthcare, industry and society."
https://openalex.org/W2918026029,"Background Papua Province, Indonesia is experiencing an on-going epidemic of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, with an estimated 9-fold greater prevalence than the overall national rate. This study reviewed the treatment outcomes of an HIV-infected cohort on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and the predictors in terms of immunological recovery and virological response. Methods ART-naïve individuals in a workplace HIV program in southern Papua were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were assessed at 6, 12 and 36 months after ART initiation for treatment outcomes, and risk factors for virological suppression (viral load (VL) <1,000 copies/ml), poor immune response (CD4 <200 cells/mm3) and immunological failure (CD4 <100 cells/ mm3) after at least 6 months on ART, using a longitudinal Generalized Estimating Equations multivariate model. Results Assessment of 105 patients were included in the final analysis with a median age of 34 years, 88% male, median baseline CD4 236 cells/ mm3, and VL 179,000 copies/ml. There were 74, 73, and 39 patients at 6, 12, and 36 months follow-up, respectively, with 5 deaths over the entire period. For the three observation periods, 68, 80, and 75% of patents achieved virological suppression, poor immune responders decreased from 15, 16 to 10%, whilst 15, 16, 10% met the immunological failure criteria, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, the independent predictor for viral suppression at 12 and 36 months was ≥1 log decrease in VL at 6 months (OR 19.25, p<0.001). Higher baseline CD4 was significantly correlated with better immunological outcomes, and lower likelihood of experiencing immunological failure (p <0.001). Conclusion Virological response at six months after beginning ART is the strongest predictor of viral suppression at 12 and 36 months, and may help in identifying patients needing additional adherence therapy support. Higher baseline CD4 positively affects the immunological outcomes of patients. The findings indicate HIV control programs should prioritize the availability of VL testing and begin ART regardless of CD4 counts in infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2918119983,"Antidepressant medication is commonly used for the prevention of depression recurrence in the perinatal period, yet it is unknown what vulnerability markers may play a role in recurrence. The objective of the current study was to provide a descriptive overview of the associated characteristics of women who experienced a perinatal recurrence of depression despite ongoing antidepressant use, and further, to identify clinically measurable vulnerability markers associated with recurrence.Eighty-five pregnant women with a history of depression who used antidepressants (e.g. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors or Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors) at the start of the study were included. Clinical features, including information on psychiatric history and antidepressant use, were collected throughout the perinatal period (in this study defined as the period between 12 weeks of pregnancy untill three months postpartum). The clinical features of women experiencing recurrence of depression were described in detail. To identify vulnerability markers associated with recurrence of depression, we performed exploratory univariable logistic regression analyses.Eight women (9.4%) experienced a recurrence of depression; two during pregnancy and six in the first 12 weeks postpartum. All women with recurrence of depression had first onset of depression during childhood or adolescence and had at least 2 psychiatric co-morbidities. Identification of vulnerability markers associated with recurrence of depression yielded associations with depressive symptoms around 16 weeks of pregnancy (OR 1.28, 95%CI 1.08-1.52), number of psychiatric co-morbidities (OR 1.89, 95%CI 1.16-3.09) and duration of antidepressant use (OR 1.01, 95%CI 1.00-1.02).Implementing adequate risk assessment in pregnant women who use antidepressants can help identify predictors for recurrence of depression in future studies and thus ultimately lead to improved care."
https://openalex.org/W2916409696,"We evaluated the impact of bacterial rhabduscin synthesis on bacterial virulence and phenoloxidase inhibition in a Spodoptera model. We first showed that the rhabduscin cluster of the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila was not necessary for virulence in the larvae of Spodoptera littoralis and Spodoptera frugiperda. Bacteria with mutations affecting the rhabduscin synthesis cluster (ΔisnAB and ΔGT mutants) were as virulent as the wild-type strain. We then developed an assay for measuring phenoloxidase activity in S. frugiperda and assessed the ability of bacterial culture supernatants to inhibit the insect phenoloxidase. Our findings confirm that the X. nematophila rhabduscin cluster is required for the inhibition of S. frugiperda phenoloxidase activity. The X. nematophila ΔisnAB mutant was unable to inhibit phenoloxidase, whereas ΔGT mutants displayed intermediate levels of phenoloxidase inhibition relative to the wild-type strain. The culture supernatants of Escherichia coli and of two entomopathogenic bacteria, Serratia entomophila and Xenorhabdus poinarii, were unable to inhibit S. frugiperda phenoloxidase activity. Heterologous expression of the X. nematophila rhabduscin cluster in these three strains was sufficient to restore inhibition. Interestingly, we observed pseudogenization of the X. poinarii rhabduscin gene cluster via the insertion of a 120 bp element into the isnA promoter. The inhibition of phenoloxidase activity by X. poinarii culture supernatants was restored by expression of the X. poinarii rhabduscin cluster under the control of an inducible Ptet promoter, consistent with recent pseudogenization. This study paves the way for advances in our understanding of the virulence of several entomopathogenic bacteria in non-model insects, such as the new invasive S. frugiperda species in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2916488160,"Protein SUMOylation regulates multiple processes involved in the differentiation and maturation of cells and tissues during development. Despite this, relatively little is known about the spatial and temporal regulation of proteins that mediate SUMOylation and deSUMOylation in the CNS. Here we monitor the expression of key SUMO pathway proteins and levels of substrate protein SUMOylation in the forebrain and cerebellum of Wistar rats during development. Overall, the SUMOylation machinery is more highly-expressed at E18 and decreases thereafter, as previously described. All of the proteins investigated are less abundant in adult than in embryonic brain. Furthermore, we show for first time that the profiles differ between cerebellum and cerebrum, indicating differential regional regulation of some of the proteins analysed. These data provide further basic observation that may open a new perspective of research about the role of SUMOylation in the development of different brain regions."
