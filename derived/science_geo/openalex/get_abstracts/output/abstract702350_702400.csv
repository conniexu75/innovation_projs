https://openalex.org/W4305041693,"Lipoedema is a chronic adipose tissue disorder mainly affecting women, causing excess subcutaneous fat deposition on the lower limbs with pain and tenderness. There is often a family history of lipoedema, suggesting a genetic origin, but the contribution of genetics is currently unclear. A tightly phenotyped cohort of 200 lipoedema patients was recruited from two UK specialist clinics. Objective clinical characteristics and measures of quality of life data were obtained. In an attempt to understand the genetic architecture of the disease better, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were obtained, and a genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed on 130 of the recruits. The analysis revealed genetic loci suggestively associated with the lipoedema phenotype, with further support provided by an independent cohort taken from the 100,000 Genomes Project. The top SNP rs1409440 (OR meta ≈ 2.01, P meta ≈ 4 x 10–6) is located upstream of LHFPL6, which is thought to be involved with lipoma formation. Exactly how this relates to lipoedema is not yet understood. This first GWAS of a UK lipoedema cohort has identified genetic regions of suggestive association with the disease. Further replication of these findings in different populations is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4306154777,"Onions are a significant source of revenue and food security for households. Despite their importance in human nutrition, economic benefit, and area coverage, in Ethiopia, onion productivity is significantly lower than it should be. The purpose of this study is to address this gap by examining efficiency variations and determining the variables that affect onion farmers' levels of efficiency in the North Gondar Zone of Ethiopia. The sources of data were both primary and secondary. 205 onion farmers from the Gondar Zuria, Takusa, and Dembia districts were chosen using simple random sampling proportional to sample size. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather primary data from these participants. A Cobb-Douglass production function, a single-stage stochastic frontier model, and descriptive statistics were used to investigate the technical efficiency of onion production at the farm level. The mean technical efficiency of an irrigated onion was 53%, according to the maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic frontier analysis. By enhancing agricultural methods using current technology, it is possible to raise the average production efficiency of irrigated onions. The stochastic frontier model's maximum likelihood estimates revealed that plot size, Di Ammonium Phosphate, and oxen have a significant effect on onion output; education, livestock holding, experience, and frequency of watering have a positive and significant effect on technical efficiency, whereas family size and marketing training have a negative and significant effect on technical efficiency. Therefore, the government or any relevant bodies should deliver continual scheduled training and an integrated adult education at the existing farmers' training center; modern livestock production techniques; further groundwater resources and proper watering technologies should be used since currently farmers use an inefficient irrigation system, specifically furrow irrigation."
https://openalex.org/W4305041548,"Background Low back pain (LBP) is a multifactorial and the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, whose economic burden is of global concern. Evidence suggests that the burden of LBP in increasing and will continue rising with the greatest burden occurring in low-and-middle-income-countries (LMICs). This study sought to determine the economic burden of LBP in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa from the providers perspective. Methods We used a retrospective prevalence-based cost-of-illness methodology to estimate the direct medical cost of LBP. Direct medical costs constituted costs associated with healthcare utilisation in inpatient care, outpatient care, investigations, consultations, and cost of auxiliary devices. We used diagnostic-specific data obtained from hospital clinical reports. All identifiable direct medical costs were estimated using a top-down approach for costs associated with healthcare and a bottom-up approach for costs associated with inpatient and outpatient care. Results The prevalence of chronic low back pain CLBP was 24.3% (95% CI: 23.5–25.1). The total annual average direct medical costs associated with LBP was US$5.4 million. Acute low back pain (ALBP) and CLBP contributed 17% (US$0.92 million) and 83% (US$4.48 million) of the total cost, respectively. The per patient total annual average direct medical cost for ALBP and CLBP were US$99.43 and US$1,516.67, respectively. The outpatient care costs contributed the largest share (38.9%, US$2.10 million) of the total annual average direct medical cost, 54.9% (US$1.15 million) of which was attributed to nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The total average cost of diagnostic investigations was estimated at US$831,595.40, which formed 15.4% of the average total cost. Conclusion The economic burden of LBP is high in South Africa. Majority of costs were attributed to CLBP. The outpatient care costs contributed the largest share percent of the total cost. Pain medication was the main intervention strategy, contributing more than half of the total outpatient costs. Measures should be taken to ensure guideline adherence. Focus should also be placed towards development of prevention measures to minimise the cost."
https://openalex.org/W4305056992,"Although numerous studies have described the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening among diabetic populations, studies among populations in rural areas are rare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the application value of an AI-based diagnostic system for DR screening in rural areas of midwest China.In this diagnostic accuracy study, diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in the National Basic Public Health Information Systems of Licheng County and Lucheng County of Changzhi city from July to December 2020 were selected as the target population. A total of 7824 eyes of 3933 DM patients were enrolled in this screening; the patients included 1395 males and 2401 females, with an average age of 19-87 years (63±8.735 years). All fundus photographs were collected by a professional ophthalmologist under natural pupil conditions in a darkroom using the Zhiyuan Huitu fundus image AI analysis software EyeWisdom. The AI-based diagnostic system and ophthalmologists were tasked with diagnosing the photos independently, and the consistency rate, sensitivity and specificity of the two methods in diagnosing DR were calculated and compared.The prevalence rates of DR according to the ophthalmologist and AI diagnoses were 22.7% and 22.5%, respectively; the consistency rate was 81.6%. The sensitivity and specificity of the AI system relative to the ophthalmologists' grades were 81.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80.3% 82.1%) and 94.3% (95% CI: 93.7% 94.8%), respectively. There was no significant difference in diagnostic outcomes between the methods (χ2 = 0.329, P = 0.566, P>0.05), and the AI-based diagnostic system had high consistency with the ophthalmologists' diagnostic results (κ = 0.752).Our research demonstrated that DR patients in rural area hospitals can be screened feasibly. Compared with that of the ophthalmologists, however, the accuracy of the AI system must be improved. The results of this study might lend support to the large-scale application of AI in DR screening among different populations."
https://openalex.org/W4305041226,"This study described the physical and physiological demands, activity profile and fun levels of recreational team handball (TH) game formats in over 60-year-old men with no previous experience with this sport (n = 17, 67.4±3.3 years). The participants performed 5v5, 6v6 and 7v7 matches (3x15-min periods) with fixed pitch size (40x20 m). In all testing sessions, heart rate (HR), differential ratings of perceived exertion and blood lactate were evaluated to measure internal load. Locomotor profile, game actions and accelerometer data were used to access external load. Also, fun levels were registered at the end of all testing sessions. Mean (76–77%HR max ) and peak HR (84–86%HR max ) decreased from the first to the third match period, in 6v6 and 7v7 ( p≤ 0.034, d = 0.730). Blood lactate increased from baseline to the first period and decreased from the first to the third period in all game formats ( p&lt; 0.001, d = 1.646). The participants covered longer total distances in 6v6 vs 5v5 ( p≤ 0.005, d = 0.927) and spent more time in fast running in 6v6 vs 5v5 and 7v7 ( p&lt; 0.001, d = 1.725) and in 5v5 vs 7v7 ( p = 0.007, d = 0.912). A higher number of throws was performed in 5v5 vs 6v6 and 7v7 ( p&lt; 0.001, d = 1.547), and in 6v6 vs 7v7 ( p = 0.031, d = 0.779). The number of stops and total actions in 7v7 was significantly lower vs 5v5 and 6v6 ( p≤ 0.003, d = 1.025). Recreational TH is a high-intensity and motivating exercise mode for middle-aged and older men, regardless the game format. However, higher high-intensity demands were observed during 5v5 and 6v6 game formats. Therefore, it is suggested a multiple game format (5v5, 6v6 and 7v7) training plan, with more use of 5v5 and 6v6 game formats, with training sessions lasting up to 15-min of warm-up and 3x15-min periods of match-play, when prescribing recreational TH to improve cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4305042057,"Mass test, treat and track (MTTT) of malaria is ongoing in the Pakro sub district of Ghana. In the delivery of MTTT of malaria, community health volunteers are trained to routinely provide this service through a door-to-door strategy. Following the report of the first cases of COVID-19 in Ghana, we conducted this study to explore the effects of the pandemic on the implementation of the MTTT of malaria intervention.Using qualitative methodology, we conducted ten focus groups discussions (FGDs) in eight communities: eight with community members (N = 49); one with health workers (N = 6), and one with MTTT of malaria volunteers. In addition, two in-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted, one with health worker and another with a health manager. All interviews were recorded, translated into English during transcription and analysed using QSR NVivo 12. Thematic content analysis was used in this study.The findings of the study showed an increase in the number of people reporting with complications of malaria in health facilities in the study communities during the COVID-19 period. Some participants were of the view that COVID-19 rumours and misinformation could largely be responsible for the low coverage and uptake of the MTTT of malaria intervention. To sustain the uptake of the MTTT intervention, community engagement strategies were employed to identify and respond to these rumours. Also, incentive schemes were introduced to encourage parents and children to participate in the MTTT intervention during this period of COVID-19.Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the provision and uptake of malaria prevention and treatment services, especially the MTTT of malaria being implemented at the community level. These observations underscore the need to find innovative ways to address the challenges encountered in providing essential services during public health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4305042203,"The mitochondrial genome plays a crucial role in the balance of energy and heat production in organisms and, thus, may be under natural selection due to its potential role in adaptive divergence and speciation. Here, we studied natural selection on the mitogenome of Acrossocheilus (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae), a genus of fish that inhabits a broad latitudinal distribution ranging from the tropics and subtropics through temperate regions. Specifically, we used 25 published mitogenome sequences of Acrossocheilus species to investigate phylogenetic relationships in this genus and detected signals of positive selection on 13 protein-coding, mitochondrial genes. We found that relaxed purifying selection and genetic drift were the predominant evolutionary forces acting on the analyzed mitogenomes. However, we also found evidence of diversifying selection on some codons, indicating episodes of positive selection. Additionally, we analyzed the mitogenomic data within an environmental modeling framework and found that the Ka/Ks ratio of ATP6 may correlated with a mean diurnal temperature range (p = 0.0449), while the Ka/Ks ratio of COX2 may correlated with precipitation during the driest month (p = 0.00761). These results suggest that the mitogenomes of Acrossocheilus species may be involved in evolutionary adaptations to different habitats. Based on this, we believe that our study provides a new insight into the role of the mitochondrial genome of Acrossocheilus species in adaptation to different environments. During our study, we also discovered several cases of paraphyly and polyphyly among accessions of species and their putative synonyms. Thus, our study suggests that a careful reassessment of the taxonomy of Acrossocheilus is using high-quality molecular data merited."
https://openalex.org/W4306154816,"Recent archaeological investigations in Sri Lanka have reported evidence for the exploitation and settlement of tropical rainforests by Homo sapiens since c. 48,000 BP. Information on technological approaches used by human populations in rainforest habitats is restricted to two cave sites, Batadomba-lena and Fa-Hien Lena. Here, we provide detailed study of the lithic assemblages of Kitulgala Beli-lena, a recently excavated rockshelter preserving a sedimentary sequence from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. Our analysis indicates in situ lithic production and the recurrent use of the bipolar method for the production of microliths. Stone tool analyses demonstrate long-term technological stability from c. 45,000 to 8,000 years BP, a pattern documented in other rainforest locations. Foraging behaviour is characterised by the use of lithic bipolar by-products together with osseous projectile points for the consistent targeting of semi-arboreal/arboreal species, allowing for the widespread and recurrent settlement of the wet zone of Sri Lanka."
https://openalex.org/W4306154889,"This study aimed to evaluate the existence of socioeconomic inequalities related to the prevalence of multimorbidity in the Brazilian population aged 60 and older.This was a cross-sectional study with data from the last Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS) collected in 2019. Multimorbidity was the dependent variable and was defined as the presence of two or more chronic diseases. All the diseases were assessed based on a self-reported previous medical diagnosis. Education and per capita family income were the measures of socioeconomic position. Socioeconomic inequalities related to multimorbidity were assessed using two complex measures of inequality; the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and the Concentration Index (CI).The prevalence of multimorbidity in Brazil was 56.5% 95% CI (55.4; 57.6) and varied from 46.9% (44.3; 49.6) in the North region to 59.3% (57.0; 61.5) in the South region. In general, individuals with higher socioeconomic positions had a lower prevalence of multimorbidity. Significant absolute and relative income inequalities were observed in the South region [SII -9.0; CI -0.054], Southeast [SII -9.8; CI -0.06], and Middle-east [SII -10.4; CI -0.063]. Absolute and relative education inequalities were significant for the country and two of its regions (Southeast [SII -12.7; CI -0.079] and South [SII -19.0; CI -0.109]).The prevalence of multimorbidity is high in Brazil and all of its macro-regions. The significant findings concerning the inequalities suggest that the distribution of this condition is more concentrated among those with lower education and income."
https://openalex.org/W4305041301,"Background Antenatal depression is a serious health problem and has negative consequences for the mother, fetus, and the entire family. However, it is a neglected component of care especially bay health care providers for women in pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depression and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in public health institutions, in the Awabale Woreda. Method An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 and a stratified sampling technique was used to select the study health institutions. All seven public health institutions in Awabale District were included to select 393 mothers and the sample size was proportionally allocated based on the number of target mothers. We used EpiData version 3.1software for data entry and SPSS version 20 software for cleaning and analysis. A Bivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between each outcome variable and the factor. Again, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with each outcome variable, and variables with a p-value less than 0.05 were taken as significant variables. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to declare the presence of antenatal depression with a cut point score of 13 and above. Result This study showed that 63(17.8%) pregnant mothers had antenatal depressive symptoms. Women who were employed 85% reduced to develop antenatal depression than housewives [AOR = 0.15(0.001–0.25)]. Pregnant women who attended high school and above educational level were 18 times more likely to develop antenatal depression than women who had no formal education [AOR18.15 (2.73–120.76)]. Women who had poor husband feeling on the current pregnancy were 4.94 more likely to develop antenatal depression than women who had good partner feeling on the current pregnancy [AOR = 4.94(95%CI: 1.78–13.72)]. Women who had a history of depression were 8.2 times to develop antenatal depression than women who had no history of depression [AOR = 8.22 (95%CI: 2.87–23.57)]. Conclusion This study revealed that approximately one-fifth of pregnant women developed antenatal depression. Women’s occupational status, educational status, previous history of depression, and poor husband feeling on the current pregnancy were the significant factors of antenatal depression."
https://openalex.org/W4305041690,"Self-care behavior plays a pivotal role in the management of chronic kidney disease. Improved self-care behavior in patients with chronic kidney disease is a key factor in health management and treatment adherence. This study aimed to evaluate the participants' general and medical condition-related characteristics, physiological indices and the level of health literacy affecting self-care behavior in patients with chronic kidney disease in South Korea. The data of 278 participants were analyzed using t-test, analysis of variance, correlation coefficient, and linear multiple regression analysis. There were significant differences in self-care behavior scores depending on participants' age and cohabitation status, employment, and smoking status as well as having dialysis due to end-stage kidney disease; number of comorbidities; levels of serum hemoglobin, calcium, and creatinine; and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The results of regression analysis revealed that not currently working, non-smoker, end-stage kidney disease, and positive response to the ""actively managing my health"" scale of the Health Literacy Questionnaire significantly affected self-care behavior in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the explanatory power of the model was 32.7%. Therefore, it is necessary to identify each patient's barriers or needs according to individual characteristics, such as age, cohabitation and employment status, and daily life circumstances, including smoking habits, comorbidities, social support, and level of health literacy to develop efficient support strategies for promoting adequate self-care behavior with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4305041702,"The capability of male mice to exercise in hot environments without succumbing to exertional heat stroke (EHS) is markedly blunted compared to females. Epidemiological evidence in humans and other mammals also suggests some degree of greater vulnerability to heat stroke in males compared to females. The origins of these differences are unknown, but testosterone has previously been shown to induce faster elevations in core temperature during acute, passive heat exposure. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of testosterone and related sex hormones through castration would improve the performance and heat tolerance of male mice during EHS exposure.Twenty-four male mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, untreated EHS mice (SHAM-EHS), castrated EHS mice (CAS+EHS) and naïve exercise controls (NAIVE). Exercise performance and physiological responses in the heat were monitored during EHS and early recovery. Two weeks later, blood and tissues were collected and analyzed for biomarkers of cardiac damage and testosterone.Core temperature in CAS+EHS rose faster to 39.5°C in the early stages of the EHS trial (P<0.0001). However, both EHS groups ran similar distances, exhibited similar peak core temperatures and achieved similar exercise times in the heat, prior to symptom limitation (unconsciousness). CAS+EHS mice had ~10.5% lower body mass at the time of EHS, but this provided no apparent advantage in performance. There was no evidence of myocardial damage in any group, and testosterone levels were undetectable in CAS+EHS after gonadectomy.The results of these experiments exclude the hypothesis that reduced performance of male mice during EHS trials is due to the effects of male sex hormones or intact gonads. However, the results are consistent with a role of male sex hormones or intact gonads in suppressing the early and rapid rise in core temperature during the early stages of exercise in the heat."
https://openalex.org/W4305042045,"Over the last decade, we’ve observed an enormous social media development, which have recently become commercial services. Hence, we aimed to verify if Facebook might be considered as a source of access to medicines. We also intended to identify prescription (Rx) and over the counter (OTC) medicines if available on that platform. The study was conducted from January 2019 to July 2020. We investigated offers of pharmaceuticals posted on Facebook (individual posts and communities) between 2016 and 2019. Medicines were divided into Rx and OTC brands and in accordance with their possible therapeutic use. We verified whether the medicines were for sale, to exchange, or available for free. Posts and groups were investigated for example, by entering the phrase “for free,” followed by a city in Poland. Out of 409 offers, 380 (92.91%) concerned Rx brands and 29 (7.09%) OTC brands. 315 (77.02%) medications were available “for free”. In 47 (11.49%) cases, an “exchange” was expected, and 47 (11.49%) announcements were marked as “for sale”. Cardiovascular medicines (n = 125; 30.56%) were the most popular. There were also antidiabetics (n = 38; 9.29%) and antipsychotics (n = 28; 6.84%). We also found clear candidates for misuse. These were opioids (n = 7; 1.71%), benzodiazepines (n = 2; 0.48%), clomifene (n = 1; 0.24%), and letrozole (n = 1; 0.24%). Facebook provides the possibility of uncontrolled access to medicines. The majority of offers concerned Rx brands, including opioids and benzodiazepines. Medicines offered on Facebook were mainly accessible for free. The scope and the number of medications offered on Facebook should make this issue a hazardous phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W4305042049,"Broiler production in semi-arid tropics must contend with high levels of heat stress, which have implications on stocking density, bird welfare, and profitability. Under these conditions, optimal stocking densities are likely to be lower than expected, thus must be experimentally determined. Therefore, this study investigated growth performance, haematology, serum biochemistry, carcass and meat quality, sizes of internal organs, and stress biomarkers in response to different stocking densities in broilers reared under semi-arid subtropical conditions. Five hundred, day-old Ross 308 broilers (44.0 ± 5.24 g live-weights) were randomly distributed to 25 replicate pens (1.32 m 2 floor space each) to create five stocking densities: 1) 10 birds/pen (SD10); 2) 15 birds/pen (SD15); 3) 20 birds/pen (SD20); 4) 25 birds/pen (SD25); and 5) 30 birds/pen (SD30). There was a linear decrease ( P &lt; 0.05) in overall feed intake and weight gain in weeks 2 and 3 as stocking density increased. However, weight gain showed positive and negative quadratic responses ( P &lt; 0.05) in weeks 5 and 6, respectively, as stocking density increased. No linear or quadratic effects ( P ˃ 0.05) were observed for overall feed conversion ratio, haematological parameters, and meat quality traits in response to stocking density. Symmetric dimethylarginine, alanine transaminase, and albumin levels quadratically increased ( P &lt; 0.05) in response to increasing stocking densities. Serum glucose and thigh weight were not affected ( P &lt; 0.05) while final body, drumstick, breast, and wing weights linearly declined with stocking density. Increasing stocking density linearly reduced ( P &lt; 0.05) the weights of gizzard, proventriculus, caecum, and colon. Stocking density had no effect ( P ˃ 0.05) on latency-to-lie. It was concluded that higher stocking densities compromised feed intake, resulting in poor weight gains. Based on weight gain trends observed in week 5, it was determined that Ross 308 broilers should be reared at no more than 20 birds/pen (~15 birds/m 2 or 27.27 kg/m 2 ) under the experimental ambient conditions compared to the much higher globally accepted industry standard of 20 birds/m 2 ."
https://openalex.org/W4305042063,"Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a powerful tool to study genome-scale models of the cellular metabolism, based on finding the optimal flux distributions over the network. While the objective function is crucial for the outcome, its choice, even though motivated by evolutionary arguments, has not been directly connected to related measures. Here, we used an available multi-scale mathematical model of yeast replicative ageing, integrating cellular metabolism, nutrient sensing and damage accumulation, to systematically test the effect of commonly used objective functions on features of replicative ageing in budding yeast, such as the number of cell divisions and the corresponding time between divisions. The simulations confirmed that assuming maximal growth is essential for reaching realistic lifespans. The usage of the parsimonious solution or the additional maximisation of a growth-independent energy cost can improve lifespan predictions, explained by either increased respiratory activity using resources otherwise allocated to cellular growth or by enhancing antioxidative activity, specifically in early life. Our work provides a new perspective on choosing the objective function in FBA by connecting it to replicative ageing."

Based on a deep learning bidirectional recurrent long and short memory network, an infiltration line prediction model with univariate input and an infiltration line prediction model with multivariate input are proposed. The data adopted are those from four monitoring points of the same cross-section at different positions and data from one adjacent internal lateral displacement and internal vertical displacement monitoring point. Using the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimization algorithm and the root mean square error (RMSE) model evaluation metric, the multilayer perceptron model, univariate input model, and multivariate input model are compared. This work shows that their RMSEs are 0.10611, 0.09966, and 0.11955, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4305057145,"Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as unhealthy diets, low physical activity levels, smoking, and harmful alcohol consumption are common in student populations, which constitute a large group of young adults. As unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are associated with future disease and premature mortality, most commonly from cardiovascular disease and cancers, it is from a public health perspective important to understand such behaviors in young adult populations. The objective of this study was to investigate university students' experiences of health, health-related behaviors, and the barriers and facilitators for behavior change in terms of health promotion in everyday life.This qualitative study was conducted at a middle-sized university in Sweden. Students represented different faculties and were recruited via non-probability convenience sampling using means such as the snowball technique and social media. The 21 interviews with 24 students, individually or in groups, were transcribed verbatim prior to a qualitative analysis inspired by phenomenological hermeneutics.Our interviews showed that university student life is associated with new health-related challenges, for example study-related stress and procrastination implies a lack of energy to engage in healthy routines such as physical activity, and a limited budget affects food choices. While adapting to a new context, students explore personal strategies such as taking on changes in manageable steps, seeking social support, and avoiding disturbances to maintaining health and quality of life.Experiences of health while becoming and being a university student can be described as a transition-a balancing act of walking a slack line-during which students seek to manage a healthy balance. In the past, interventions have to some extent been designed to address university students' behaviors; however, our study aids an understanding of their needs. Future interventions should highlight the transitions they are experiencing and the challenges of student life."

However, the nutritional and anthropometric consequences are not well recognized. Therefore, this study aimed to assess magnitude and effects of food cravings on nutritional status of pregnant women in Southern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study conducted among 586 randomly selected pregnant mothers at Sidama Regional State from June 1-20, 2019. Pre-tested and semistructured face-to-face interview questionnaires used to collect the data. The data were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analysed using SPSS IBM version 20. The bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression used to identify the possible factors of food cravings. Principal component analysis used to determine the wealth status of the study participants. Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) together with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) used to declare statistical significance.The study found that nearly three in five, 309 (58.3%) [95%, CI: 54.2%-62.8%] of the study participants reported food cravings. Meat (71.5%) and Fruits (41.7%) were the most frequently craved. About one-third, 194 (36.6%) of the study participants were undernourished (MUAC < 23 cm). Age of women (20-34 years), government employed, Antenatal Care (ANC), Pica practice, lowest wealth quintile, and skipping meals were statistically associated with food cravings. Whereas, wealth quintile and ability to consume craved food were factors associated with the nutritional status of pregnant women. Moreover, our study result found that maternal undernutrition and food cravings were statistically associated (p<0.001).The prevalence of food cravings in this study is comparable to the global level. However, the magnitude of undernutrition found to be higher. Thus, health care providers need to take every opportunity to encourage women to adopt healthful dietary practices during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4305041296,"Introduction In early breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is increasingly used. The proof of efficacy is pathologically complete response (pCR), i.e. the absence of invasive tumour in breast and lymph nodes at surgery. Today, pCR is a common endpoint in pharmaceutical trials since it is significantly associated with survival especially in triple-negative and HER2-positive subtypes. Apart from the mitigation of treatment-related toxicity and symptoms, physical exercise mediates anti-tumoral systemic effects associated with tumour regression in preclinical and clinical models. The aim of Neo-ACT is to test the hypothesis that physical exercise can improve pCR rates in breast cancer patients receiving NACT. Method The Neo-ACT trial is a prospective clinical trial, randomising T1-3N0-2 breast cancer patients planned for NACT to either a home-based physical exercise intervention supported by a mobile application or routine care. The primary endpoint is pCR; secondary endpoints are patient-reported quality of life, toxicity-related outcomes, and oncological outcomes such as Residual Cancer Burden, objective radiological tumour response, as well as overall, breast cancer-specific and disease-free survival at 2, 5 and 10 years. The intervention consists of a combination of high-intensity interval and resistance training of progressing intensity, and includes at least 150 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, inclusive of two weekly 60-min exercise sessions. In order to show an improvement in pCR of 10%, a total of 712 participants need to be included in the analysis. The Neo-ACT has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov on January 11, 2022 (NCT05184582). Expected results If Neo-ACT can prove the oncological efficacy of physical exercise, implementation of training programmes into NACT schedules will be pursued.

Standard procedures were used for the determination of these parameters. Over 80% of the formulations had a viscosity above the recommended consistency of 1000–3000 cP for feeding young children. The consistency of OFSP-legume porridge was significantly (2392.5 cP; p &lt; 0.001) lower, about 1.7 and 3.4 times than cereal-only and cereal-legume blends, respectively. All the complementary flours, except the cereal-only, met the proposed protein requirement of 6 to 11 g per 100 g for feeding children aged 6 to 23 months on an as-is basis. However, the protein content in the porridges on an as-would-be-eaten basis was about 6% lower than the as-is basis value. About 38% of the complementary foods had total aflatoxin level above the acceptable limit of 10 ppb, mainly in blends containing peanuts, maize, or both. Adding more water to meet the required thickness of cereal-only and cereal-legume porridges diluted the protein content. More efforts are needed from regulatory bodies and all stakeholders to ensure complementary foods are safe in terms of mycotoxin levels, particularly those containing maize, peanut, or both as ingredients."
https://openalex.org/W4305056578,"Competitive fitness assays in liquid culture have been a mainstay for characterizing experimental evolution of microbial populations. Growth of microbial strains has also been extensively characterized by colony size and could serve as a useful alternative if translated to per generation measurements of relative fitness. To examine fitness based on colony size, we established a relationship between cell number and colony size for strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae robotically pinned onto solid agar plates in a high-density format. This was used to measure growth rates and estimate relative fitness differences between evolved strains and their ancestors. After controlling for edge effects through both normalization and agar-trimming, we found that colony size is a sensitive measure of fitness, capable of detecting 1% differences. While fitnesses determined from liquid and solid mediums were not equivalent, our results demonstrate that colony size provides a sensitive means of measuring fitness that is particularly well suited to measurements across many environments."
https://openalex.org/W4305057155,"The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) is recommended for UK older adults, but how age moderates effectiveness is unclear.Three annual cohorts of primary-care patients aged≥65y from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink selected from 2003-5 created a natural experiment (n = 324,804), reflecting the staged introduction of the vaccine. The outcome was symptoms consistent with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia (CAP) requiring antibiotics or hospitalisation. We used the prior event rate ratio (PERR) approach to address bias from unmeasured confounders.Vaccinated patients had higher rates of CAP in the year before vaccination than their controls, indicating the potential for confounding bias. After adjustment for confounding using the prior event rate ratio (PERR) method, PPV23 was estimated to be effective against CAP for two years after vaccination in all age sub-groups with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 0.86 (0.80 to 0.93), 0.74 (0.65 to 0.85) and 0.65 (0.57 to 0.74) in patients aged 65-74, 75-79 and 80+ respectively in the 2005 cohort. Age moderated the effect of vaccination with predicted risk reductions of 8% at 65y and 29% at 80y.PPV23 is moderately effective at reducing CAP among UK patients aged≥65y, in the two years after vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness is maintained, and may increase, in the oldest age groups in step with increasing susceptibility to CAP."
https://openalex.org/W4305057252,"Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is one of the most abundant outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria and is known to have patterns of sequence variations at certain amino acids-allelic variation-in Escherichia coli. Here we subjected seven exemplar OmpA alleles expressed in a K-12 (MG1655) ΔompA background to further characterization. These alleles were observed to significantly impact cell surface charge (zeta potential), cell surface hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, sensitivity to killing by neutrophil elastase, and specific growth rate at 42°C and in the presence of acetate, demonstrating that OmpA is an attractive target for engineering cell surface properties and industrial phenotypes. It was also observed that cell surface charge and biofilm formation both significantly correlate with cell surface hydrophobicity, a cell property that is increasingly intriguing for bioproduction. While there was poor alignment between the observed experimental values relative to the known sequence variation, differences in hydrophobicity and biofilm formation did correspond to the identity of residue 203 (N vs T), located within the proposed dimerization domain. The relative abundance of the (I, δ) allele was increased in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates relative to environmental isolates, with a corresponding decrease in (I, α) alleles in ExPEC relative to environmental isolates. The (I, α) and (I, δ) alleles differ at positions 203 and 251. Variations in distribution were also observed among ExPEC types and phylotypes. Thus, OmpA allelic variation and its influence on OmpA function warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4305057313,"Background The distribution of under-five mortality (U5M) worldwide is uneven and the burden is higher in Sub-Saharan African countries, which account for more than 53% of the global under-five mortality. In Ethiopia, though U5M decreased substantially between 1990 and 2019, it remains excessively high and unevenly distributed. Therefore, this study aimed to assess geographic variation and factors associated with under-five mortality (U5M) in Ethiopia. Methods We sourced data from the most recent nationally representative 2019 Ethiopian Mini-Demographic and Health Survey for this study. A sample size of 5,695 total births was considered. Descriptive, analytical analysis and spatial analysis were conducted using STATA version 16. Both multilevel and spatial analyses were employed to ascertain the factors associated with U5M in Ethiopia. Results The U5M was 5.9% with a 95% CI 5.4% to 6.6%. Based on the multivariable multilevel logistic regression model results, the following characteristics were associated with under-five mortality: family size (AOR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.84,0.99), number of under-five children in the family (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.21), multiple birth (AOR = 14.4, 95% CI: 8.5, 24.3), children who were breastfed for less than 6 months (AOR = 5.04, 95% CI: 3.81, 6.67), people whose main roof is palm (AOR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.96), under-five children who are the sixth or more child to be born (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.49, 4.06), institutional delivery (AOR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.81), resident of Somali and Afar region (AOR = 3.46, 95% CI: 1.58, 7.55) and (AOR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.10, 5.85), respectively. Spatial analysis revealed that hot spot areas of under-five mortality were located in the Dire Dawa and Somali regions. Conclusion Under-five mortality in Ethiopia is high and unacceptable when compared to the 2030 sustainable development target, which aims for 25 per 1000 live births. Breastfeeding for less than 6 months, twin births, institutional delivery and high-risk areas of under-five mortality (Somali and Dire Dawa) are modifiable risk factors. Therefore, maternal and community education on the advantages of breastfeeding and institutional delivery is highly recommended. Women who deliver twins should be given special attention. An effective strategy should be designed for intervention in under-five mortality hot spot areas such as Somali and Dire Dawa."
https://openalex.org/W4305057318,"Kidney stone is one of the most frequent urinary tract diseases, affecting 10% of the population and displaying a high recurrence rate. Kidney stones are the result of salt supersaturation, including calcium and oxalate. We have previously identified Esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (Ecrg4) as being modulated by hypercalciuria. Ecrg4 was initially described as a tumor suppressor gene in the esophagus. Lately, it was shown to be involved as well in apoptosis, cell senescence, cell migration, inflammation and cell responsiveness to chemotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, nothing is known about ECRG4's function in the renal tissue and its relationship with calciuria. We hypothesized that the increased expression of Ecrg4 mRNA is triggered by hypercalciuria and might modulate intratubular calcium-oxalate precipitation. In this study, we have first (i) validated the increased Ecrg4 mRNA in several types of hypercalciuric mouse models, then (ii) described the Ecrg4 mRNA expression along the nephron and (iii) assessed ECRG4's putative role in calcium oxalate nephropathy. For this, Ecrg4 KO mice were challenged with a kidney stone-inducing diet, rich in calcium and oxalate precursor. Taken together, our study demonstrates that Ecrg4's expression is restricted mainly to the distal part of the nephron and that the Ecrg4 KO mice develop less signs of tubular obstruction and less calcium-oxalate deposits. This promotes Ecrg4 as a modulator of renal crystallization and may open the way to new therapeutic possibilities against calcium oxalate nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W4306154475,"Background The increased prevalence of visual impairment among diabetic patients has become a major public health problem. However, there was limited information on the extent of visual impairment among diabetic patients in our country, and there was no study in the study area. Providing updated data regarding this area is critical for the prevention of visual impairment among diabetic patients. Purpose The study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of visual impairment among adult diabetic patients visiting Adare General Hospital, Hawassa, South Ethiopia, 2022. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on adult diabetic patients from May 30 to July 15, 2022, at Adare General Hospital, Hawassa, South Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling method was used to select 398 study participants. Data was collected through a face-to-face interview, a medical chart review, and an ocular examination. A binary logistic regression was performed to identify potential risk factors for visual impairment and their strength of association was expressed using an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Variables with a P-value of &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Result In this study, a total of 391 participants were involved, with a response rate of 98.2%. The prevalence of visual impairment was 28.6% (95% CI: 24.6–33.0). Age ≥ 60 years (AOR = 4.03, 95% CI: 1.72, 10.71), poor physical exercise (AOR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.62, 6.53), poor glycemic control (AOR = 4.34, 95% CI: 2.26, 8.34), history of eye examination (AOR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.50, 5.76), duration of diabetes ≥ 9 years (AOR = 4.78, 95% CI: 2.11, 10.83) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.21, 7.50) were positively associated with visual impairment. Conclusion The study found a high prevalence of visual impairment among adult diabetic patients. Older age, longer duration of diabetes, poor physical exercise, poor glycemic control, history of eye examination, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy were significantly associated with visual impairment. Thus, regular physical activity, good control of glucose levels, and regular eye exams were recommended for all diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W4306154481,"Under favourable conditions, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) engineered to accumulated high lipid (HL) carbon sink in their leaves was previously shown to also enhance photosynthesis and growth. The greater aboveground biomass was found to be diminished in a dense canopy compared to spaced pots. Besides, the underlying genetic regulatory network linking between leaf lipid sinks and these physiological changes remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the growth advantage was not displayed in HL Lolium grown in spaced pots under low lights. Under standard lights, analysis of differentiating transcripts in HL Lolium reveals that the plants had elevated transcripts involved in lipid metabolism, light capturing, photosynthesis, and sugar signalling while reduced expression of genes participating in sugar biosynthesis and transportation. The plants also had altered several transcripts involved in mitochondrial oxidative respiration and redox potential. Many of the above upregulated or downregulated transcript levels were found to be complemented by growing the plants under low light. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of carbon and energy homeostatic regulatory mechanisms to overall productivity of the HL Lolium through photosynthesis, most of which are significantly impacted by low irradiances."
https://openalex.org/W4306154491,"Many studies have shown that Histone deacetylases (HDAC) is involved in the occurrence of malignant tumors and regulates the occurrence, proliferation, invasion, and migration of malignant tumors through a variety of signaling pathways. In the present, we explored the role of Histone deacetylases genes in prognosis and immune response in low-grade glioma. Using consensus clustering, we built the new molecular clusters. Using HDAC genes, we constructed and validated the prognostic model in two independent cohort datasets. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups. Then, we explored the molecular characteristics, clinical characteristics, tumor microenvironment and immune infiltration levels of two clusters and risk groups. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were built for model assessment. We finally detected the expression levels of signature genes between tumor and normal tissues. Low-grade can be separated into two molecular clusters using 11 HDACs genes. Two clusters had different clinical characteristics and prognosis. Nex, we constructed a prognosis model using six HDAC genes (HDAC1, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10), which was also validated in an independent cohort dataset. Furthermore, multivariate cox regression indicated that the calculated risk score was independently associated with prognosis in low-grade glioma, and risk score can predict the five-year survival probability of low-grade glioma well. High-risk patients can be attributed to multiple complex function and molecular signaling pathways, and the genes alterations of high- and low-risk patients were significantly different. We also found that different survival outcomes of high- and low- risk patients could be involved in the differences of immune filtration level and tumor microenvironment. Subsequently, using signature genes, we identified several small molecular compounds that could be useful for low-grade glioma patients' treatment. Finally, we detected the expression levels of signature genes in tumor tissues. our study uncovers the biology function role of HDAC genes in low-grade glioma. We identified new molecular subtypes and established a prognostic model based on six HDAC genes, which was well applied in two independent cohort data. The regulation of HDAC genes in low-grade glioma involved in multiple molecular function and signaling pathways and immune infiltration levels. Further experiments in vivo and vitro were required to confirm the present findings."

https://openalex.org/W4305041084,"Introduction The purpose of the current study is to compare definitive chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with cT1-3/N0-3 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in survival. Methods Records from 2008 to 2014 of 4931 patients with clinical T1-3/N0-3 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy or esophagectomy with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy were obtained from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed and propensity score matching was used to minimize the bias. Overall survival was compared between definitive chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and also in the three different clinical stages. Results Definitive chemoradiotherapy was performed on 4381 patients, and 550 patients received esophagectomy adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Each group produced 456 patients for comparison after propensity score matching. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival rates for matched patients in with definitive chemoradiotherapy group were 57.18%, 31.92%, and 23.8%. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival rates for matched patients treated in the esophagectomy with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy group were 72.35%, 45.74%, and 34.04%(p&lt;0.0001). In multivariable analysis, treatment modality was an independent prognostic factor. Esophagectomy with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy provided better survival outcome than definitive chemoradiotherapy for patients with clinical stage II/III disease. As for patients with clinical stage I disease, there was no significant survival difference between definitive chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Conclusions Esophagectomy with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy provided better survival than definitive chemoradiotherapy in clinical II/III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, more data are needed to conduct a convincing conclusion in clinical stage I patients."
https://openalex.org/W4305041209,"Introduction Racial disparities are known in the occurrence of kidney disease with excess risks found among people of African descent. Apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene variants G1 and G2 are associated with kidney disease among HIV infected individuals of African descent in the USA as well as among black population in South Africa. We set out to investigate the prevalence of these high-risk variants and their effects on kidney disease among HIV infected patients in Northern Nigeria with hitherto limited information despite earlier reports of high population frequencies of these alleles from the Southern part of the country. Methods DNA samples obtained from the whole blood of 142 participants were genotyped for APOL1 G1 and G2 variants after initial baseline investigations including assessment of kidney function. Participants comprised 50 HIV positive patients with no evidence of kidney disease, 52 HIV negative individuals with no kidney disease and 40 HIV positive patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) evidenced by persistent proteinuria and/or reduced eGFR, who also had a kidney biopsy. All the HIV positive patients were newly diagnosed and treatment naïve. Results The distribution of the APOL1 genotypes among the study participants revealed that 24.6% had a G1 risk allele and 19.0% a G2. The frequency of the High Risk Genotype (HRG) was 12.5% among those with CKD compared to 5.8% in the HIV negative group and zero in the HIV positive no CKD group. Having the HRG was associated with a higher odds for developing HIV Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN) (2 vs 0 risk alleles: OR 10.83, 95% CI 1.38–84.52; P = 0.023; 2 vs 0 or 1 risk alleles: OR 5.5, 95% CI 0.83–36.29; P = 0.07). The HRG was also associated with higher odds for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (2 vs 0 risk alleles: OR 13.0, 95% CI 2.06–81.91; P = 0.006 and 2 vs 0 or 1 risk alleles: OR 9.0, 95%CI 1.62–50.12; P = 0.01) when compared to the control group. Conclusion This study showed a high population frequency of the individual risk alleles of the APOL1 gene with higher frequencies noted among HIV positive patients with kidney disease. There is high association with the presence of kidney disease and especially FSGS and HIVAN among treatment naive HIV patients carrying two copies of the HRG."
https://openalex.org/W4305041216,"Exploring vaccination behavior is fundamental to understand the role of vaccine in suppressing the epidemic. Motivated by the efficient role of the risk perception and the subsidy policy in promoting vaccination, we propose the Risk Perception and the Risk Perception with Subsidy Policy voluntary vaccination strategies with imperfect vaccine. The risk perception is driven by multiple information sources based on global information (released by Public Health Bureau) and local information (from first-order neighbors). In time-varying networks, we use the mean-field approach and the Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the epidemic dynamics under vaccination behavior with imperfect vaccine. We find that vaccination with the incorporation of risk perception and subsidy policy can effectively control the epidemic. Moreover, information from different sources plays different roles. Global information is more helpful in promoting vaccination than local information. In addition, to further understand the influence of vaccination strategies, we calculate the social cost as the cost for the vaccine and treatment, and find that excess vaccination cost results in a higher social cost after the herd immunity. Thus, for balancing the epidemic control and social cost, providing individuals with more global information as well as local information would be helpful in vaccination. These results are expected to provide insightful guidance for designing the policy to promote vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4305042047,"Recently, there has been considerable research on combining multi-agent simulation and particle swarm optimization in practice. However, most existing studies are limited to specific engineering fields or problems without summarizing a general and universal combination framework. Moreover, particle swarm optimization can be less effective in complex problems due to its weakness in balancing exploration and exploitation. Yet, it is not common to combine multi-agent simulation with improved versions of the algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, introducing a multi-level structure and a competition mechanism to enhance exploration while balancing exploitation. The performance of the algorithm is tested by a set of comparison experiments. The results have verified its capability of converging to high-quality solutions at a fast rate while holding the swarm diversity. Further, a problem-independent simulation-optimization approach is proposed, which integrates the improved algorithm into multi-agent systems, aiming to simulate realistic scenarios dynamically and solve related optimization problems simultaneously. The approach is implemented in a response planning system to find optimal arrangements for response operations after the Sanchi oil spill accident. Results of the case study suggest that compared with the commonly-used shortest distance selection method, the proposed approach significantly shortens the overall response time, improves response efficiency, and mitigates environmental pollution."

These effects tend to be more devastating among urban poor young children, especially in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. There is an immediate need to introduce interventions to reduce childhood undernutrition. This paper described the study protocol of a nutrition programme that was developed based on the positive deviance approach and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the programme among urban poor children aged 3 to 5 years old.This mixed-method study will be conducted in two phases at low-cost flats in Kuala Lumpur. Phase one will involve a focus group discussion with semi-structured interviews to explore maternal feeding practices and the types of food fed to the children. Phase two will involve a two-armed cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a programme developed based on the positive deviance approach. The programme will consist of educational lessons with peer-led cooking demonstrations, rehabilitation, and growth monitoring sessions. Intervention group will participate in the programme conducted by the researcher for three months whereas the comparison group will only receive all the education materials and menus used in the programme after data collection has been completed. For both groups, data including height, weight, and dietary intake of children as well as the nutritional knowledge and food security status of mothers will be collected at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 3-month post-intervention.The positive deviance approach helps to recognise the common feeding practices and the local wisdom unique to the urban poor population. Through this programme, mothers may learn from and be empowered by their peers to adopt new feeding behaviours so that their children can achieve healthy weight gain.This study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04688515 on 29 December 2020, https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04688515."
https://openalex.org/W4305042180,"Among the various types of data augmentation strategies, the mixup-based approach has been particularly studied. However, in existing mixup-based approaches, object loss and label mismatching can occur if random patches are utilized when constructing augmented images, and additionally, patches that do not contain objects might be included, which degrades performance. In this paper, we propose a novel augmentation method that mixes patches in a non-overlapping manner after they are extracted from the salient regions in an image. The suggested method can make effective use of object characteristics, because the constructed image consists only of visually important regions and is robust to noise. Since the patches do not occlude each other, the semantically meaningful information in the salient regions can be fully utilized. Additionally, our method is more robust to adversarial attack than the conventional augmentation method. In the experimental results, when Wide ResNet was trained on the public datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10, the top-1 accuracy was 97.26%, 83.99% and 82.40% respectively, which surpasses other augmentation methods."

The aim of our study was to show the possibility of a non-invasive CT evaluation of the volume and the LAP composition of the intra- and juxta-stent plaque.In our prospective longitudinal study, we recruited 27 consecutive patients (35 BRS stents total; mean age 60 +/- 9 years) with bioresorbable stents for a 256-slice ECG-synchronized CT evaluation at 1- and 12-months post stent implantation. Total plaque volume (mm3), absolute and relative (%) LAP volume per block in the pre- intra- and post-stent zones were analyzed; comparison 1- and 12-months post-implantation of BRS. Changes in the previously mentioned variables were assessed by the mixed effects models with and without spline, which also accounted for the correlation between repeated measurements.Our block or spline model analysis has shown no significant difference in plaque or absolute LAP volumes in pre- intra- and post-stent zones between 1 and 12 months. Interestingly, % LAP volume increases near-significantly in the distal block of the intrastent at 12-mo follow-up (from 23.38 ± 1.80% to 26.90 ± 2.22% (increase of 15%), p = 0.052).Our study demonstrates the feasibility of the repeated non-invasive quantitative analysis of the intrastent coronary plaque and of the in-stent lumen by CT scan."

Under- or un-insured women, low-income women, and minoritized groups face barriers to screening. Intention to screen is an indicator of future screening behavior, yet is understudied among low-income, under-screened women. Participants were 710 low-income, uninsured or publicly insured women ages 25-64 years in North Carolina who were not up to date on cervical cancer screening according to national guidelines. Participants were asked about barriers to screening and intention to screen. We estimated reported barriers to cervical cancer screening stratified by race and ethnicity (categorized as White, Black, and Hispanic) and assessed predictors of intention to screen. Sixty-one percent of all participants reported 5 or more barriers to screening. The most commonly reported reasons for not getting screened were lack of insurance (White: 71%, Black: 62%, Hispanic/Latina: 63%) and cost (White: 55%, Black: 44%, Hispanic/Latina: 61%). Women were more likely to have an intention to screen if they reported ""it was not hard to get screening"" (OR: 1.47 (1.00, 2.15)). Older women reported being less likely to intend to screen. Black women reported being more likely to intend to screen than White women. Lack of health insurance and cost were frequently reported barriers to cervical cancer screening. Increasing knowledge of affordable clinics and expanding access to Medicaid may reduce barriers and increase cervical cancer screening uptake."

This study assessed the association of TB mortality with hyponatremia and SIADH in a large cohort of a university hospital in Austria.This retrospective study enrolled patients with hyponatremia and patients diagnosed with TB from 01/2001-11/2019 to assess the prevalence of TB in hyponatremia and TB morbidity and mortality in patients with and without hyponatremia. Sex, age, microbiological results, laboratory tests and comorbidities were analysed and used to calculate survival rates.Of 107.532 patients with hyponatremia (0.07%) and 186 patients with TB (43%), 80 patients were diagnosed with both-hyponatremia and TB. Only three TB patients had SIADH, precluding further SIADH analysis. In hyponatremia, young age and high CRP levels showed significant associations with TB diagnosis (p<0.0001). Survival rates of patients diagnosed with TB with moderate to profound hyponatremia were significantly lower than those without hyponatremia (p = 0.002).In this study of a large cohort from a tertiary care hospital in a non-endemic area of TB, 0.07% of patients presenting with hyponatremia, but especially younger patients and patients with high CRP values, were diagnosed with TB. Crucially, patients with moderate to profound hyponatremia had a significantly higher mortality rate and thus required increased medical care."
https://openalex.org/W4305042399,"Whole animal perfusion is a well-established method that has been used for the past decades in multiple research fields. Particularly, it has been very important for the study of the brain. The rapid and uniform fixation of tissue is essential for the preservation of its integrity and the study of complex structures. For small tissue pieces submerging in formaldehyde solution oftentimes is sufficient to get a good fixation, larger tissues or organs with a more complicated structure present a greater difficulty. Here, we report the precise parameters to successfully perform trans-cardiac perfusion of neonatal mouse pups that allows a uniform fixation of the whole body for subsequent structural analysis and immunohistochemistry. In comparison to standard perfusion procedures of adult mice, changes in the pump velocity, the buffer volume and in the needle size lead to high quality fixation of neonatal mice pups. Further, we present a whole-body section staining, which results in a highly specific immunofluorescence signal suited for detailed analysis of multiple tissues or systems at the same time. Thus, our protocol provides a reproducible and reliable method for neonatal perfusion and staining that can rapidly be applied in any laboratory. It allows a high quality analysis of cellular structures and expression profiles at early developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W4305056696,"It is not known why only some hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients develop glomerulonephritis (GN). Therefore, we investigated the role of soluble complement regulators in the development of HCV associated GN.Patients with HCV associated GN who were admitted to our nephrology unit between July 2016 and July 2018 were recruited to the study (group 1). Two other age and sex matched groups were studied as control groups: patients with HCV without GN (group 2) and healthy HCV negative volunteers (group 3). There were 26 participants in each of the three groups at the end of the recruitment period. An assay of serum fluid-phase complement regulators was performed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique. Three complement single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction (Taqman; thermo fisher scientific): rs2230199 and rs1047286 for complement 3 (C3) and rs800292 for complement factor H (CFH).Serum levels of complement 4 binding protein (C4BP) were significantly lower in group 1 (median 70 ng/ml) than in groups 2 (median 88.8 ng/ml) and 3 (median 82.8 ng/ml) with p value of 0.007. The minor allele (allele A) of rs800292 for CFH was significantly higher in group 2 and group 3 (G 54% and A 46%) than in group 1 (G 73% and A 27%), p = 0.04.Low C4BP levels are associated with GN in HCV infected patients. In addition, rs800292 SNP in CFH protects against GN in patients with HCV."
https://openalex.org/W4305056991,"Low use of contraceptives has many consequences. Despite this effect, less emphasis is given to women's decision-making on family planning use in Ethiopia. Although there are studies conducted in different parts of the country on women's decision-making regarding family planning use, there are inconsistent findings and a lack of national representative data. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of women's decision-making regarding family planning use and its determinants in Ethiopia.Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines will be followed to develop the review protocol. All observational studies will be retrieved using Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms or keywords from the online databases PubMed, CINAHL, Google Scholar, African Journal online, and gray literature. The quality of the studies will be critically assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Heterogeneity among studies will be examined using I-squared statistics. Funnel plots and Egger's test will be used to examine publication bias. The meta-analysis will be performed using STATA version 14 software. Statistical significance will be determined at 95% CI.Improving women's autonomy in decision-making on reproductive health services, including contraceptive use, has a substantial advantage. There are studies on women's decision-making in family planning use; however, there are inconsistent findings. Therefore, this review protocol aims to determine the pooled prevalence of women's decision-making regarding family planning use and its determinants in Ethiopia. The findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis will help inform policy makers to develop appropriate interventions to improve women's decision making regarding family planning use."
https://openalex.org/W4305057003,"Thrombosis is one of the main complications leading to the failure of autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for patients with renal failure. Thrombectomy is one of the major therapies to remove thrombi to salvage the AVF and prolong its patency.Fifty-six patients with AVF thrombosis at the anastomosis were recruited for this study and underwent thrombectomy procedures. Their clinical variables were collected. The vasculature was accessed at the site of the aneurysmal dilatation. Under ultrasound guidance, a scoop thrombectomy procedure was performed by anterograde and retrograde scooping to remove the thrombus using forceps. Then, a sheath was placed in the direct vertical direction. Angioplasty was performed with a balloon to treat the underlying primary arteriovenous stenosis. Patients were followed up for 12 months after surgery. The procedural success, primary and secondary patency rates, and incidence of procedure-related complications were analyzed.There were 2 minor (3.6%) and no major complications. Clinical success was achieved in 55 of the 56 procedures (98.2%). No symptomatic pulmonary embolism or arterial embolization was noted. The primary patency rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 92.9, 83.8, and 73.3%%, respectively, according to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Scoop thrombectomy is a safe procedure with high technical success and a low complication rate, and it is an effective method for patients to receive hemodialysis immediately."
https://openalex.org/W4305057271,"Dual specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7) is a protein belonging to a broad group of phosphatases that can dephosphorylate phosphoserine/phosphothreonine as well as phosphotyrosine residues within the same substrate. DUSP7 has been linked to the negative regulation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), and in particular to the regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). MAPKs play an important role in embryonic development, where their duration, magnitude, and spatiotemporal activity must be strictly controlled by other proteins, among others by DUSPs. In this study, we focused on the effect of DUSP7 depletion on the in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We showed that even though DUSP7 knock-out ES cells do retain some of their basic characteristics, when it comes to differentiation, they preferentially differentiate towards neural cells, while the formation of early cardiac mesoderm is repressed. Therefore, our data indicate that DUSP7 is necessary for the correct formation of neuroectoderm and cardiac mesoderm during the in vitro differentiation of ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W4305057310,"Cocoa cultivation is of considerable economic and social importance to the Amazonas region and is commonly associated with forest species in the region. However, the diversification level and composition of cacao agroforestry systems in Peru are poorly understood. The objective of this study is, therefore, to describe the diversity of tree species in cocoa AFS by plantation age. Accordingly, the number of species of 15 plots covering a total of 1.5 hectares was recorded. Moderately low levels of tree species diversity were reported (H´ ranged 0.89-1.45). In total 17 species were reported throughout the study area. The most abundant botanical family was represented by a single Musa sp. species. The dissimilarity indices show a moderate similarity between the age ranges evaluated (over 62%). Additionally, the IVI indicates that the most important species are used for food and timber apart from providing shade, additionally major of this species are introduced intentionally for the farmers. Based on the observations, it may be concluded that the farmer's interest in obtaining further benefits from the plot, mostly economic benefits affect the diversification of cocoa agroforestry systems."
https://openalex.org/W4306154484,"The COVID-19 pandemic made explicit the issues of communicating science in an information ecosystem dominated by social media platforms. One of the fundamental communication challenges of our time is to provide the public with reliable content and contrast misinformation. This paper investigates how social media can become an effective channel to promote engagement and (re)build trust. To measure the social response to quality communication, we conducted an experimental study to test a set of science communication recommendations on Facebook and Twitter. The experiment involved communication practitioners and social media managers from select countries in Europe, applying and testing such recommendations for five months. Here we analyse their feedback in terms of adoption and show that some differences emerge across platforms, topics, and recommendation categories. To evaluate these recommendations’ effect on users, we measure their response to quality content, finding that the median engagement is generally higher, especially on Twitter. The results indicate that quality communication strategies may elicit positive feedback on social media. A data-driven and co-designed approach in developing counter-strategies is thus promising in tackling misinformation."
https://openalex.org/W4306154551,"Investigation on college students' consumption ability help classify them as from rich or relative poor family, thus to distinguish the students who are in urgent need for government's economic support. As canteen consumption is the main part of the expenses of the college students, we proposed the adjusted K-means clustering methods for discrimination of the college students at different economic levels. To improve the discrimination accuracy, a broad learning network architecture was built up for extracting informative features from the students' canteen consumption records. A fuzzy transformed technique was combined in the network architecture to extend the candidate range for identifying implicit informative variables from the single type of consumption data. Then, the broad learning network model is fully trained. We specially designed to train the network parameters in an iterative tuning mode, in order to find the precise properties that reflect the consumption characteristics. The selected feature variables are further delivered to establish the adjusted K-means clustering model. For the case study, the framework of combining the broad learning network with the adjusted K-means method was applied for the discrimination of the canteen consumption data of the college students in Guangdong province, China. Results show that the most optimal broad learning architecture is structured with 14 hidden nodes, the model training and testing results are appreciating. The results indicated that the framework was feasible to classify the students into different economic levels by analyzing their canteen consumption data, so that we are able to distinguish the students who are in need for financial aid."
https://openalex.org/W4306154814,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by an infection of the parasitic flatworms schistosomes. Schistosoma mekongi is a restricted Schistosoma species found near the Mekong River, mainly in southern Laos and northern Cambodia. Because there is no vaccine or effective early diagnosis available for S . mekongi , additional biomarkers are required. In this study, serum biomarkers associated with S . mekongi- infected mice were identified at 14-, 28-, 42-, and 56-days post-infection. Circulating proteins and antigens of S . mekongi in mouse sera were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Serine protease inhibitors and macrophage erythroblast attacher were down-regulated in mouse sera at all infection timepoints. In addition, 54 circulating proteins and 55 antigens of S . mekongi were identified. Notable circulating proteins included kyphoscoliosis peptidase and putative tuberin, and antigens were detected at all four infection timepoints, particularly in the early stages (12 days). The putative tuberin sequence of S . mekongi was highly similar to homologs found in other members of the genus Schistosoma and less similar to human and murine sequences. Our study provided the identity of promising diagnostic biomarkers that could be applicable in early schistosomiasis diagnosis and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W4306154849,"APRIL (A proliferation inducing ligand) and BLyS (B Lymphocyte Stimulator) are two critical survival factors for B lymphocytes and plasma cells, the main source of alloantibody. We sought to characterize the specific effects of these cytokines in a kidney transplant model of antibody mediated rejection (AMR). We engineered APRIL -/- and BLyS -/- Lewis rats using CRISPR/Cas9. APRIL -/- and BLyS -/- rats were sensitized with Brown Norway (BN) blood (complete MHC mismatch). Twenty-one days following sensitization, animals were harvested and collected tissues were analyzed using flow cytometry, ELISPOT, and immunohistochemistry. Flow cross match and a 3 day mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was performed to assess donor specific antibody (DSA) production and T-cell proliferation, respectively. Sensitized dual knock out Lewis rats (APRIL -/- /BLyS -/- ) underwent kidney transplantation and were sacrificed on day 7 post-transplant. Sensitized BLyS -/- had significant decreases in DSA and cell proliferation compared to WT and APRIL -/- (p&lt;0.02). Additionally, BLyS -/- rats had a significant reduction in IgG secreting cells in splenic marginal zone B lymphocytes, and in cell proliferation when challenged with alloantigen compared to WT and APRIL -/- . Transplanted APRIL -/- /BLyS -/- rodents had significantly less DSA and antibody secreting cells compared to WT (p&lt;0.05); however, this did not translate into a significant difference in AMR seen between groups. In summary, our studies suggest that APRIL and BLyS play a greater role in DSA generation rather than AMR, highlighting the role of cellular pathways that regulate AMR."
https://openalex.org/W4306154857,"Switching inhalation devices is a reasonable option if problems with control, adherence, or inhalation technique occur in patients with asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting β2 agonist (LABA). However, evidence to determine the extent to which the carefully monitored period persists after switching is insufficient. In this study, we aimed to investigate the duration of the carefully monitored period after switching to another ICS/LABA. This retrospective study used claims data from Japanese health insurance associations from May 2014 to April 2019. A total of 1,951 patients who switched to another ICS/LABA during the study period were selected for analysis. The relative risk of the first exacerbation after switching was calculated for each four-week interval after the switch compared with that before the switch in a self-controlled case series design. We further assessed patient background associated with exacerbations during the follow-up period. In the primary analysis, the risk of asthma exacerbation compared to the control period was derived from a conditional logistic regression model, which showed a significant decrease immediately after the switch (1 to 4 weeks, Odds ratio [OR] 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26–0.54). Subsequently, the risk increased again and was not significantly different from the control period until week 32 (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29–1.04). In a sensitivity analysis among patients with a history of exacerbations, up to week 20 was the period of no continuous risk reduction (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.41–1.70). In the secondary analysis, chronic rhinosinusitis, sleep disorders, and a history of asthma exacerbation were significantly associated with asthma exacerbation. The incidence of exacerbation remained high for approximately 4 to 7 months after patients with asthma switched to another ICS/LABA. Therefore, these patients should be carefully monitored for at least 4 to 7 months and should be re-assessed at an earlier point in time, if necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4306154902,"Upright postural control is regulated by afferent and efferent/reafferent visual mechanisms. There are two types of efferent and conjugate eye movements: saccades and smooth pursuits. Although postural control is improved by saccades, the effects of smooth pursuits on postural control are still debated, because the difficulties of postural and visual tasks differ in the previous research. Additionally, the mechanisms that interfere with postural control and smooth pursuit are not fully understood. To address these issues, we examined the effects of different patterns of smooth-pursuit eye movement on the path length of the center of pressure (COP) displacement under bipedal and unipedal standing conditions. The relative frequency and amplitude of the COP displacement were remarkably increased when uniform linear visual targets were presented during unipedal standing. In addition, dynamic time warping analysis demonstrated that the similarity between the displacement of the COP and eye movements was increased by the presentation of uniform linear visual targets with orientation selectivity during unipedal standing but not during bipedal standing. In contrast, the attenuation of similarity between the displacement of the COP and eye movements significantly decreased the path length, relative frequency, and amplitude of the COP displacement. Our results indicate that postural stability is deteriorated by the increase of similarity between the displacement of the COP and smooth-pursuit eye movements under unstable conditions."
