https://openalex.org/W1999259647,"Colonies of cliff swallows (Aves: Hirundo pyrrhonota) appear to be information centers in which colony residents acquire information on the location of food sources. Individuals that have been unsuccessful on a foraging trip return to the colony, locate a successful forager, and follow that individual to a food source. Individuals often follow, and are followed by, their neighbors within the colony, possibly because neighbors can observe foraging success through food brought back to nestlings. All individuals are equally likely to follow others or be followed, and thus all individuals benefit from opportunities to receive information."

This thickening led to reduced contrast between the elevation of continental and oceanic regions and to greater average flooding of the continents. The resultant distribution of elevation may have resembled modern Venus more than modern Earth."

https://openalex.org/W4232953732,"In a recent note, ""A possible explanation of ;freezing' behavior in rats"" (Bernard F. Riess. Science, 1945, 102, 570), the author was guilty of a serious omission which completely vitiated the meaning of the article. A comparison was made between two groups of animals, one living in multiple-animal cages, the other in isolation. In giving a description of the groups, the population of the multiple-housed animals was given as 124 and that of the second group was inadvertently omitted. There were 84 animals in this second group. This makes it possible to evaluate the difference between the two groups. The author apologizes for the omission."
