https://openalex.org/W2059901912,"We find a dramatic difference in the efficiency of removal of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers from the transcribed and nontranscribed strands of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in cultured hamster and human cells. In hamster cells, 80% of the dimers are removed from the transcribed strand in 4 hr, but little repair occurs in the nontranscribed strand even after 24 hr. In human cells, repair is significantly faster in the transcribed strand than in the other strand. Furthermore, in the 5' flanking region of the human DHFR gene, selective rapid repair occurs in the opposite DNA strand relative to the transcribed strand of the DHFR gene. This strand is thought to serve as a template for transcription of a divergent transcript. These results have important implications for excision repair pathways and mutagenesis in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136193641,"We report the construction of a linkage map of the human genome, based on the pattern of inheritance of 403 polymorphic loci, including 393 RFLPs, in a panel of DNAs from 21 three-generation families. By a combination of mathematical linkage analysis and physical localization of selected clones, it was possible to arrange these loci into linkage groups representing 23 human chromosomes. We estimate that the linkage map is detectably linked to at least 95% of the DNA in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1966933803,"The primary structure of human apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 has been deduced and shown by a combination of DNA excess hybridization, sequencing of tryptic peptides, cloned complementary DNAs, and intestinal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to be the product of an intestinal mRNA with an in-frame UAA stop codon resulting from a C to U change in the codon CAA encoding Gln2153 in apoB-100 mRNA. The carboxyl-terminal Ile2152 of apoB-48 purified from chylous ascites fluid has apparently been cleaved from the initial translation product, leaving Met2151 as the new carboxyl-terminus. These data indicate that ∼85% of the intestinal mRNAs terminate within ∼0.1 to 1.0 kilobase downstream from the stop codon. The other ∼15% have lengths similar to hepatic apoB-100 mRNA even though they have the same in-frame stop codon. The organ-specific introduction of a stop codon to a mRNA appears unprecedented and might have implications for cryptic polyadenylation signal recognition and RNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W2037749822,"The somatic loss of heterozygosity for normal alleles occurring in human tumors has suggested the presence of recessive oncogenes. The results presented here demonstrate a loss of heterozygosity of several genes on chromosome 11 in primary breast tumors. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of these DNAs further suggests that the most frequent loss of sequences in breast tumors occurs between the β-globin and parathyroid hormone loci on the short arm of chromosome 11. The loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 11 loci has a significant association with tumors that lack estrogen and progesterone receptors, grade III tumors, and distal metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1597138031,"A quantitative assay based on gel electrophoresis is described to measure nucleotide insertion kinetics at an arbitrary DNA template site. The assay is used to investigate kinetic mechanisms governing the fidelity of DNA synthesis using highly purified Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha holoenzyme complex and M13 primer-template DNA. Km and Vmax values are reported for correct insertion of A and misinsertion of G, C, and T opposite a single template T site. The misinsertion frequencies are 2 X 10(-4) for G-T and 5 X 10(-5) for both C-T and T-T relative to normal A-T base pairs. The dissociation constant of the polymerase-DNA-dNTP complex, as measured by Km, plays a dominant role in determining the rates of forming right and wrong base pairs. Compared with Km for insertion of A opposite T (3.7 +/- 0.7 microM), the Km value is 1100-fold greater for misinsertion of G opposite T (4.2 +/- 0.4 mM), and 2600-fold greater for misinsertion of either C or T opposite T (9.8 +/- 4.2 mM). These Km differences indicate that in the enzyme binding site the stability of A-T base pairs is 4.3 kcal/mol greater than G-T pairs and 4.9 kcal/mol greater than C-T or T-T pairs. In contrast to the large differences in Km, differences in Vmax are relatively small. There is only a 4-fold reduction in Vmax for insertion of G opposite T and an 8-fold reduction for C or T opposite T, compared with the correct insertion of A. For the specific template T site investigated, the nucleotide insertion fidelity for Drosophila polymerase alpha seems to be governed primarily by a Km discrimination mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2063649295,"We have used inactivation of transcription by UV irradiation to map transcription units in trypanosomes. The relative inactivation rate of the transcription of mini-exon, 5S, and rRNA genes was inversely proportional to the previously estimated lengths of these transcription units. The telomeric transcription unit containing the gene for variant-specific surface glycoprotein (VSG) 221 was inactivated as a single unit of 60 kb. This long transcription unit comprises at least one other protein-coding gene and yields seven other stable mRNAs. These data thus provide evidence for a multicistronic transcription unit for cellular genes in a eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W1543959669,"High performance liquid chromatography studies documented the presence of an enzyme activity, N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALA dipeptidase), in rat brain membranes that cleaves the endogenous brain dipeptide, N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate to N-acetyl-aspartate and glutamate. With ion exchange chromatography, which quantitatively separated [3,4-3H]glutamate from N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-[3,4-3H]glutamate, we found that NAALA dipeptidase activity was essentially restricted to nervous tissue and kidney. We characterized NAALA dipeptidase activity in lysed synaptosomal membranes obtained from rat forebrain. Membrane-bound NAALA dipeptidase activity was optimal between pH 6.0 and 7.4 at 37 degrees C. Eadie-Hofstee analysis of kinetic data revealed a rather high apparent affinity for N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate with a Km = 540 nM and a Vmax = 180 nM/mg of protein/min. While NAALA dipeptidase showed a requirement for monovalent anions such as Cl-, the polyvalent anions phosphate and sulfate inhibited enzyme activity 50% at 100 microM and 1 mM, respectively. The divalent metal ion chelators EGTA, EDTA, and o-phenanthroline completely abolished activity, which was partially restored by manganese. Treatment of membranes with 1 mM dithiothreitol abolished NAALA dipeptidase activity. NAALA dipeptidase activity was also sensitive to the aminopeptidase inhibitors bestatin and puromycin, although not to the selective aminopeptidase A inhibitor amastatin. Structure-activity relationships inferred from inhibitor studies suggest that this enzyme shows specificity for N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptides. NAALA dipeptidase was also potently inhibited by the excitatory amino acid agonist L-quisqualate. Comparison of the properties of NAALA dipeptidase to those of previously characterized enzymes suggests that this is a novel peptidase which may be involved in the synaptic degradation of N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate."

https://openalex.org/W1535827761,"Phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) is a major mechanism regulating protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocytes. To determine whether phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha is a likely regulatory mechanism in the Ehrlich cell, we have measured the percent of cellular eIF-2 alpha which is phosphorylated in cells exposed to heat shock, 2-deoxyglucose, or amino acid deprivation, conditions which rapidly decrease the concentration of 40 S initiation complexes and inhibit protein synthesis. eIF-2 alpha and eIf-2 alpha (P) were separated by isoelectric focusing and were detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody we developed for this purpose. Under the above three inhibitory conditions, phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha increased rapidly, and this increase correlated in time with the rapid inhibition of protein synthesis. In heat-shocked cells which were returned to 37 degrees C, both phosphorylation and protein synthesis remained unchanged for 10 min and then returned toward control values slowly and in parallel. The close temporal correspondence between changes in protein synthesis and phosphorylation supports an important regulatory role for phosphorylation in protein synthesis. An increase of 25-35 percentage points, to 50-60% phosphorylation from control levels of 20-30% phosphorylation, correlated with an 80-100% inhibition of protein synthesis. This steep curve of inhibition is consistent with a mechanism in which eIF-2 alpha (P) saturates and inhibits the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor."
https://openalex.org/W1818823647,"Addition of choline, ethanolamine, or hemicholinium-3 (a choline kinase inhibitor) to the perfusate of human breast cancer cells monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy resulted in significant changes to phosphomonoester (PME) and phosphodiester (PDE) signals. These results enable us to assign the PMEs to phosphcholine (PC) and phosphoethanolamine (PE), the PDEs to glycerophosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylethanolamine, and to define the pathways producing them. The PMEs are products of choline and ethanolamine kinases, the first steps in phospholipid synthesis; and the PDEs are substrates of glycerophosphorylcholine phosphodiesterase, the last step in phospholipid catabolism. Furthermore, PC and PE peaks are twice as intense in cells at log phase versus confluency. We also observed these signals in vivo in human colon and breast tumors grown in mice. Since PMEs are low in most nonproliferating tissues, they could form a basis for noninvasive diagnosis. Also, PE and PC are situated between the control enzymes of two major synthetic pathways and will allow noninvasive 31P NMR studies of these pathways in intact cells and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1585805915,"We have analyzed the pattern of protein synthesis in solar near ultraviolet (334 nm, 365 nm) and near visible (405 nm) irradiated normal human skin fibroblasts. Two hours after irradiation we find that one major stress protein of approximately 32 kDa is induced in irradiated cells. This protein is not induced by ultraviolet radiation at wavelengths shorter than 334 nm and is not inducible by heat shock treatment of these cells. Although sodium arsenite, diamide, and menadione all induced a 32-kDa protein, they also induced the major heat shock proteins. In contrast, the oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide, induced the low molecular weight stress protein without causing induction of the major heat shock proteins. A comparison of the 32-kDa proteins induced by sodium arsenite, H2O2, and solar near ultraviolet radiation using chemical peptide mapping shows that they are closely related. These results imply that the pathways for induction of the heat shock response and the 32-kDa protein are not identical and suggest that, at least in the case of radiation and treatment with H2O2, the 32-kDa protein might be induced in response to cellular oxidative stress. This conclusion is supported by the observation that depletion of endogenous cellular glutathione prior to solar near ultraviolet irradiation lowers the fluence threshold for induction of the 32-kDa stress protein."
https://openalex.org/W2084318337,"A D-alanine-containing peptide termed dermorphin, with potent opiate-like activity, has been isolated from skin of the frog Phyllomedusa sauvagei. Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed from frog skin messenger RNA and screened with a mixture of oligonucleotides that contained the codons complementary to five amino acids of dermorphin. Clones were detected with inserts coding for different dermorphin precursors. The predicted amino acid sequences of these precursors contained homologous repeats of 35 amino acids that included one copy of the heptapeptide dermorphin. In these cloned cDNAs, the alanine codon GCG occurred at the position where D-alanine is present in the end product. This suggests the existence of a novel post-translational reaction for the conversion of an L-amino acid to its D-isomer."
https://openalex.org/W2030171801,"A symptom-modulating RNA associated with tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) was investigated with respect to physical and biological properties. Linear RNA of approximately 396 nucleotides was packaged in viral coat protein and was dependent on TBSV for replication. Coinoculation of the small RNA with TBSV resulted in the attenuation of TBSV-induced symptoms and depression of virus synthesis in whole plants. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the symptom-modulating RNA was derived from 5', 3', and internal segments of the TBSV genome. The identification of this symptom-modulating RNA as a co-linear deletion mutant of the helper virus genome establishes it as the first definitive defective interfering RNA (DI RNA) to be identified in association with a plant virus."
https://openalex.org/W2055088010,"Oncogenes encoding serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases were introduced into the established rodent fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 and tested for tumorigenic and metastatic behavior in T cell-deficient nude mice. Transforming oncogenes of the ras family were capable of converting fibroblast cell lines to fully metastatic tumors. Cell lines transformed by the kinase oncogenes mos, raf, src, fes, and fms formed experimental metastases and (in some cases) these genes were more efficient at metastatic conversion than a mutant ras gene. In contrast, cells transformed by either of two nuclear oncogenes, myc or p53, were tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously but were virtually nonmetastatic after intravenous injection. These data demonstrate that, in addition to ras, a structurally divergent group of kinase oncogenes can induce the metastatic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2066289982,"Inhomogeneous broadening of the 760-nanometer photoproduct band of carboxymyoglobin at cryogenic temperatures has been demonstrated with a dynamic hole burning technique. Line-shape changes and frequency shifts in this spectral band are generated by ligand recombination and are shown not to be the result of structural relaxation below 60 K. The observation of dynamic hole burning exposes the relation between the structural disorder responsible for the inhomogeneous broadening and the well-known distributed ligand rebinding kinetics. The findings provide direct evidence for the functional relevance of conformational substrates in myoglobin rebinding. In addition, a general protocol for evaluating the relative contributions of structural relaxation and hole burning to the spectral changes accompanying rebinding in hemeproteins is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1971539206,"Applied electric fields were used to promote axonal regeneration in spinal cords of adult guinea pigs. A propriospinal intersegmental reflex (the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex) was used to test lateral tract function after hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord. An electrical field (200 microvolts per millimeter, cathode rostral) applied across the lesion led to functional recovery of the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex in 25 percent of experimental animals, whereas the functional deficit remained in control animals, which were implanted with inactive stimulators."
https://openalex.org/W1978407125,"X-ray holography offers the possibility of three-dimensional microscopy with resolution higher than that of the light microscope and with contrast based on x-ray edges. In principle, the method is especially advantageous for biological samples if x-rays in the wavelength region between the carbon and oxygen K edges are used. However, until now the achieved resolution has not exceeded that of the light microscope because of the poor coherence properties of the x-ray sources and the low resolution of the detectors that were available. With a recently developed x-ray source based on an undulator on an electron storage ring, and high resolution x-ray resist, a hologram has been recorded at about 400-angstrom resolution. The experiment utilized x-rays with wavelengths of 24.7 angstroms and required a 1-hour exposure of the pancreatic zymogen granules under study."
https://openalex.org/W1979158332,"The fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene in labeled platelet membranes, an index of membrane fluidity, identifies a prominent subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who manifest distinct clinical features. In a family study, the prevalence of this platelet membrane abnormality was 3.2 to 11.5 times higher in asymptomatic, first-degree relatives of probands with Alzheimer's disease than in neurologically healthy control subjects chosen without regard to family history of dementia. The pattern of the platelet membrane abnormality within families was consistent with that of a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait. Thus, this abnormality of platelet membranes may be an inherited factor that is related to the development of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1510433132,"Abstract In this paper, we report the polypeptide sequence, the mRNA sequence, and gene organization of a new category of mammalian myosin heavy chain, termed myosin I heavy chain-like protein (MIHC), on the basis of sequence analyses of cDNA clones isolated from a bovine intestinal cDNA library and a genomic DNA clone containing the MIHC gene. The MIHC mRNA shares its 3' sequence with the 5' sequence of the preprotachykinin B mRNA encoding the precursor for the neuromedin K neuropeptide. An overlap of these functionally unrelated mRNAs results from overlapping transcription of the same strand of the genomic DNA sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence comprising the amino-terminal two-thirds of the 119-kDa MIHC polypeptide is highly homologous to that portion of conventional myosin heavy chains which forms the globular head domain. The homology is particularly strong in the regions of sequence thought to be involved in forming the nucleotide- and actin-binding sites. By contrast, the deduced sequence comprising the carboxyl-terminal one-third of MIHC shows no significant homology to that portion of conventional myosin heavy chains which forms the alpha-helical coiled-coil rod-like tail. In this regard, MIHC more closely resembles the monomolecular, non-filamentous, low molecular weight myosin I heavy chain from Acanthamoeba castellanii. Furthermore, the size of the MIHC polypeptide, together with its preferential expression in intestinal tissue, leads us to speculate that MIHC and the 110-kDa intestinal brush-border protein (Collins, J. H., and Borysenko, C. W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14128-14135), which binds actin and has myosin-like ATPase activity, are the same or closely related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1574724167,"The carbohydrate structure of the major oligosaccharide of human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) synthesized by a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line has been determined. Analysis of the glycopeptidase F-released carbohydrates by sequential exoglycosidase treatment, methylation analysis, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry revealed that 95% of the IFN-beta oligosaccharides had the following structure: (Formula: see text). The remaining 5% of the carbohydrates are probably tri- or higher antennary oligosaccharide chains. The major oligosaccharide of the recombinant IFN-beta is remarkably homogeneous with respect to terminal galactose sialylation. NeuAc, which is alpha 2-3-linked to galactose in the human IFN-beta secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells, can be re-incorporated with an alpha 2-6 linkage in vitro, into enzymatically desialylated IFN-beta using rat liver Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc alpha 2-6 sialyltransferase. The sugar chain is important for maintaining protein solubility as shown by the fact that IFN-beta protein precipitates after deglycosylation with glycopeptidase F."
https://openalex.org/W2044020314,"The pair-rule segmentation gene hairy (h) is expressed and required in alternate metameres in the early Drosophila embryo. We show that h expression outside these domains, driven by an hsp70 promoter, suppresses the expression of fushi tarazu (ftz). The kinetics of action favor h acting directly as a transcriptional repressor. The resulting pattern defects, and the patterns of en and Ubx activity, can be explained if h acts via ftz and other pair-rule genes in the establishment of stable en domains. We present evidence that ftz is required for the initiation of Ubx transcription, but not for its maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1724717646,"Synthesis of type I procollagen was examined in fibroblasts from a proband with a lethal perinatal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta. After trypsin digestion of the type I procollagen, a portion of the alpha 1 (I) chains was recovered as disulfide-linked dimers. Digestion of the protein with vertebrate collagenase and mapping of cyanogen bromide peptides suggested that a new cysteine residue was present between residues 551 and 775 of the alpha 1 (I) chain. Sequencing of cloned cDNAs prepared using mRNA from the proband's fibroblasts demonstrated that some of the clones contained a single base mutation that converted the glycine codon in amino acid position 748 of the alpha 1 (I) chain to a cysteine codon. About 80% of the type I procollagen synthesized by the proband's fibroblasts had a decreased thermal stability. The results, therefore, were consistent with the conclusion that normal pro-alpha 1 (I) chains and pro-alpha 1 (I) chains containing a cysteine residue in the alpha chain domain were synthesized in about equal amounts and incorporated randomly into type I procollagen. However, only about 10% of the alpha 1 (I) chains generated by trypsin digestion were disulfide-linked. Further studies demonstrated a decreased rate of secretion of type I procollagen containing the new cysteine residue and decreased processing of the protein by procollagen N-proteinase in cultures of postconfluent fibroblasts. Both parents were phenotypically normal and their fibroblasts synthesized only normal type I procollagen. Therefore, the mutation in the proband was a sporadic one and is very likely to have caused the connective tissue fragility that produced the lethal phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1985776689,"The visual system is able to accurately represent the spatiotemporal relations among the elements of a changing visual scene as the image moves across the retinal surface. This precise spatiotemporal mapping occurs despite great variability in retinal position and conduction velocity even among retinal ganglion cells of the same physiological class-a variability that would seem to reduce the precision with which spatiotemporal information can be transmitted to central visual areas. There was a strong negative relation between the intraretinal and extraretinal conduction time for axons of individual ganglion cells of the X-cell class. The effect of this relation was to produce a nearly constant total transmission time between the soma of a retinal X cell and its central target site. Thus, the variation in the conduction velocities of retinal ganglion cell axons may ensure that, regardless of the constraints imposed by retinal topography, a precise spatiotemporal central representation of the retinal image is maintained."
https://openalex.org/W1964502048,"Morphologic revertants of FBJ murine sarcoma virus (v-fos)-transformed rat-1 fibroblasts were isolated using a novel selection procedure based on prolonged retention of rhodamine 123 within mitochondria of v-fos-transformed versus normal fibroblasts. Two classes of revertants were isolated: class I revertants have sustained mutations in cellular genes, and a class II revertant has a nonfunctional v-fos provirus. Somatic-cell hybridization studies suggested that the revertant phenotype was recessive to the transformed phenotype. Class I revertants were also resistant to retransformation by v-gag-fos-fox, v-Ha-ras, v-abl, and v-mos, but could be retransformed by the trk oncogene and polyoma virus middle T antigen. These results suggest that the class I revertants sustained mutations in one or more cellular genes essential for transformation by some, but not all, oncogenes. Our data suggest the existence of common biochemical pathways for transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2004092607,"The concentration of the trans-acting factor, TFIIIA, required for the activation of 5S RNA genes in Xenopus can be elevated in developing embryos by injecting a synthetic full-length mRNA into fertilized eggs. 5S RNA genes are activated by the increased factor concentration at the mid-blastula transition through mid-gastrulation. The activated oocyte 5S RNA genes are then inactivated, leaving the TFIIIA-enhanced embryos with the same profile of differential 5S RNA gene activity as control embryos, i.e., synthesizing mainly somatic 5S RNA. Inactivation of the oocyte 5S RNA genes is complete by neurulation and can occur in the absence of DNA replication. We propose that this loss of gene activity is due at least in part to destabilization of transcription complexes that are associated with oocyte 5S RNA genes."
https://openalex.org/W1605124705,"The influence of additional operator or pseudooperator sequences on the lactose repressor-operator interaction has been investigated. Results of kinetic and equilibrium binding measurements suggest an important in vivo role for the Z-gene pseudooperator in repressor-operator binding; the formation of a ternary, looped complex is indicated by the influence of secondary operator sites on binding parameters. Although the binding affinity of the Z-gene pseudooperator [Oz] is only approximately 1/30 that observed for the primary operator [O], the binding affinity to DNA containing both Oz and O is significantly higher than either sequence alone or the sum of the two. This synergistic effect is enhanced further by replacing the pseudooperator sequence [Oz] with the primary operator sequence and results in an even stronger ternary complex in plasmids with duplicate primary sites. The distance between the center of the two primary operators affects the formation of a ternary complex in the linear DNA molecules. Decreased dissociation rate constants were observed with spacing of operator-like sequences between 300 and 500 base pairs (bp). Minimal influence of the second operator on repressor binding is observed when the operators are separated by approximately 4000 or approximately 100 bp. The significant influence of distance on kinetic and equilibrium parameters was demonstrated by measurements on plasmid pRW1511 [Oi-O-PL-Oz] cleaved with restriction enzymes either in the polylinker region to place Oi-O and Oz on opposite ends of the linear plasmid or outside this region to maintain the sites within 500 bp. These results are consistent with the formation of operator-repressor-pseudooperator ternary complex to generate a looped DNA structure."
https://openalex.org/W1530697726,"Various branched DNA structures were created from synthetic, partly complementary oligonucleotides combined under annealing conditions. Appropriate mixtures of oligonucleotides generated three specific branched duplex DNA molecules: (i) a Holliday junction analog having a fixed (immobile) crossover bounded by four duplex DNA branches, (ii) a similar Holliday junction analog which is capable of limited branch migration and, (iii) a Y-junction, with three duplex branches and fixed branch point. Each of these novel structures was specifically cleaved by bacteriophage T7 gene 3 product, endonuclease I. The cleavage reaction resolved the two Holliday structure analogs into pairs of duplex DNA products half the size of the original molecules. The point of cleavage in the fixed-junction molecules was predominantly one nucleotide removed to the 5' side of the expected crossover position. Multiple cleavage positions were mapped on the Holliday junction with the mobile, or variable, branch point, to sites consistent with the unrestricted movement of the phosphodiester crossover within the region of limited dyad symmetry which characterizes this molecule. Based on the cleavage pattern observed with this latter substrate, the enzyme displayed a modest degree of sequence specificity, preferring a pyrimidine on the 3' side of the cleavage site. Branched molecules that were partial duplexes (lower order complexes which possessed single-stranded as well as duplex DNA branches) were also substrates for the enzyme. In these molecules, the cleaved phosphodiester bonds were in duplex regions only and predominantly one nucleotide to the 5' side of the branch point. The phosphodiester positions 5' of the branch point in single-stranded arms were not cleaved. Under identical reaction conditions, individually treated oligonucleotides were completely refractory. Thus, cleavage by T7 endonuclease I displays great structural specificity with an efficiency that can vary slightly according to the DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1602435810,"RNA polymerases A, B, and C from yeast were modified by reaction with 4-formylphenyl-gamma-ester of ATP as priming nucleotide followed by reduction with NaBH4. Upon phosphodiester bond formation with [alpha-32P]UTP, only the second largest subunit, A135, B150, or C128, was labeled in a template-dependent reaction. This indicates that these polypeptide chains are functionally homologous. The product covalently bound to B150 subunit was found to consist of a mixture of ApU and a trinucleotide. Enzyme labeling exhibited the characteristic alpha-amanitin sensitivity reported for A and B RNA polymerases. Labeling of both large subunits of enzyme A and B but not of any of the smaller subunits was observed when the reduction step stabilizing the binding of the priming nucleotide was carried out after limited chain elongation. These results illustrate the conservative evolution of the active site of eukaryotic RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1544483469,"Ascorbic acid retards ferritin degradation in K562 erythroleukemia cells leading to an increase in the availability of cellular iron (Bridges, K. R., and Hoffman, K. E. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14273-14277). To explore the mechanism of this effect, the influence of ascorbate on subcellular ferritin distribution was examined. Cellular ferritin was pulse-labeled with 59Fe for 2 h, after which the cells were hypotonically lysed and fractionated on an 8% Percoll density gradient. Immediately after the labeling, all of the ferritin was in the cytoplasmic fractions at the top of the gradient. When the labeling was followed by a 24-h period of growth, a portion of the ferritin shifted to the lysosome-associated fractions at the bottom of the gradient, consistent with lysosomal autophagy of cytoplasmic ferritin. When ascorbate was added to the culture medium during the 24-h incubation, the magnitude of the shift was reduced. This process was also examined by size-fractionation of the contents of labeled cells using a Sepharose CL-6B column. Immediately after labeling, ferritin emerged from the column in two peaks, indicating the existence of both ferritin monomer and aggregates within the cytoplasm. After a 24-h period of growth, the monomer peak disappeared, while a new ferritin peak coincident with lysosomes emerged again, indicative of lysosomal autophagy of ferritin. In cells cultured with ascorbate for 24-h, there was a marked attenuation of the shift of ferritin to the lysosomal fractions. The monomer peak disappeared, as in the controls, but there was instead, an accumulation of ferritin as cytoplasmic aggregates. The total ferritin content of the ascorbate-treated cells was increased by 4-fold over that of the control. These experiments indicate that ascorbate blocks the degradation of cytoplasmic ferritin by reducing lysosomal autophagy of the protein. The access to the cell of the potentially toxic iron stored within the ferritin molecule is thereby increased."
https://openalex.org/W1585490615,"In primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes maintained in a salts/glucose medium, a more than 100-fold increase in ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) activity was caused by asparagine and glucagon in a synergistic manner. The synthesis rate of ornithine decarboxylase was determined by [35S]methionine incorporation into the enzyme protein, and the amount of ornithine decarboxylase-mRNA was measured by hybridization with a cloned rat liver ornithine decarboxylase-cDNA. The synthesis rate of ornithine decarboxylase was stimulated more than 20-fold by asparagine and glucagon together, but the amount of ornithine decarboxylase-mRNA was increased only 3-4-fold, indicating that translational stimulation was involved in the induction process. Asparagine alone stimulated the synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase without substantial effect on the amount of ornithine decarboxylase-mRNA, whereas glucagon alone increased the amount of ornithine decarboxylase-mRNA about 3-fold without a detectable change in either enzyme activity or enzyme synthesis. Asparagine, at least in part, also suppressed degradation of ornithine decarboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W2094424604,"Abstract The metabolism of nuclear polymers of ADP-ribose has been implicated in several chromatin-associated processes. However, the distribution of endogenous ADP-ribose polymers in the nucleus or within different fractions of chromatin has not been studied. Using a procedure which allowed the radiolabeling and detection of endogenous polymers of ADP-ribose, we have analyzed the nuclear distribution of these polymers in untreated cells and in cells subjected to hyperthermia, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, or both. When isolated nuclei from cells subjected to any of these conditions were digested with micrococcal nuclease such that 80% of the DNA was released, 90% of the total poly(ADP-ribose) remained with the micrococcal nuclease resistant chromatin fraction. When nuclear matrix fractions were prepared by exhaustive DNase I digestion in combination with three different salt extraction procedures (2 M NaCl, 300 mM (NH4)2SO4 or 25 mM lithium diiodosalicylate), the matrices contained less than 1% of the total nuclear DNA but 50 to 70% of the total poly(ADP-ribose). These data suggest that the nuclear matrix may be a major site of poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1617454400,"The dissociation of the repressor-operator complex from a series of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs was examined as a function of the sequence context, orientation, and spacing. The plasmids were grouped into four classes, each with common sequence context. The highest dissociation rate constants were observed for the plasmids containing only a single operator (or pseudooperator) sequence, while approximately 10-fold lower rate constants were measured for plasmids with the I gene pseudooperator in conjunction with either the Z gene pseudooperator or the primary operator. Comparison of the behavior of these two classes of plasmids demonstrated the importance of two operator sequences and supported a model of DNA loop formation to stabilize the repressor-operator complex (Whitson, P. A., and Matthews, K. S. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3845-3852; Whitson, P. A., Olson, J. S., and Matthews, K. S. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3852-3858; Whitson, P. A., Hsieh, W. T., Wells, R. D., and Matthews, K. S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4943-4946; Kramer, H., Niemoller, M., Amouyal, M., Revet, B., von Wilcken-Bergmann, B., and Muller-Hill, B. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 1481-1491). The third class, with intermediate dissociation rate constants, was comprised of plasmids which contained the primary operator and the higher affinity pseudooperator normally located in the Z gene. Neither the additional presence of the I gene pseudooperator nor the orientation of the primary operator relative to the Z gene pseudooperator significantly affected the dissociation rate constants. The binding characteristics of this group of plasmids demonstrated the essential role of the Z gene pseudooperator in the formation of intramolecular ternary complex and suggested an in vivo function for this pseudooperator. Plasmids containing two primary operator sequences were the class with lowest dissociation rate constants from lac repressor, and minimal effects of salt or spacing on dissociation of this class were observed. These data are consistent with formation of an intramolecular complex with a looped DNA segment stabilized by the combination of increased local concentration of binding sites and torsional stresses on the DNA which favor binding in supercoiled DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1577622304,"The biosynthesis of type VI collagen was studied in matrix-free chick embryo smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Omission of ascorbate from the culture affected to a great extent the secretion in fibroblasts but had a very minor effect on smooth muscle cells. Quantitative analysis of the secretion process in continuous time course and in pulse-chase experiments confirmed that fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells secreted type VI collagen with the same chain composition but with different kinetics: after 4 h of chase more than 60% of the labeled type VI collagen was present in the culture medium of fibroblasts, whereas at the same time interval less than 25% was secreted by smooth muscle cells. The different kinetics depends on intrinsic properties of the cells, since it was detected also in adherent cells. However, even in fibroblasts, secretion of type VI collagen was much slower than secretion of fibronectin, of which more than 50% was already in the cell medium after 1 h of chase. Treatment of the cells with inhibitors of hydroxylation and glycosylation caused a shift in mobility that revealed a size heterogeneity in the Mr = 260,000 subunit. No evidence of processing was observed in chick cells for any of the subunits that were synthesized and secreted uncleaved. In addition, after several days of chase the Mr of the subunits of type VI collagen isolated from the matrix remained unchanged, thus excluding that in the chick even a partial or incomplete processing takes place."
https://openalex.org/W1521813923,"The assembly of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), an oligomeric cell surface protein, was studied in cultured muscle cells. To measure this process, the incorporation of metabolically labeled alpha-subunit into oligomeric AChR was monitored in pulse-chase experiments, either by the shift of this subunit from the unassembled (5 S) to the assembled (9 S) position in sucrose density gradients, or by its coprecipitation with antisera specific for the delta-subunit. We have found that AChR assembly is initiated 15-30 min after subunit biosynthesis and is completed within the next 60 min. The alpha-subunit is not overproduced, as all detectable pulse-labeled alpha-subunit can be chased into the oligomeric complex, suggesting that AChR assembly in this system is an efficient process. The rate of AChR assembly is decreased by metabolic inhibitors and by monensin, an ionophore that impairs the Golgi apparatus. We have observed that the gamma- and delta-subunits of AChR are phosphorylated in vivo. The delta-subunit is more highly phosphorylated in the unassembled than in the assembled state, indicating that its phosphorylation precedes assembly and that its dephosphorylation is concomitant with AChR assembly. These findings suggest that subunit assembly occurs in the Golgi apparatus and that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms play a role in the control of AChR subunit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1569694302,"Treatment of rat intestinal epithelial cells in culture (IEC-6) with progesterone (10 micrograms/ml) caused a strong inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis as indicated by a decreased incorporation of radiolabel from [3H]acetate. This inhibition was accompanied by an accumulation of radioactivity in an intermediate which coeluted with authentic desmosterol upon high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition, treatment of cells with progesterone caused lesser accumulation of radiolabel in products with retention times (RT) of 7.9 and 13.5 min on reverse-phase HPLC. The RT-13.5 compound was tentatively identified as cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3 beta-ol based on its relative retention and on its conversion to cholesterol upon incubation with untreated cells. The RT-7.9 compound was identified as 24 (S),25-epoxycholesterol (S-EC) based on its coelution with authentic S-EC and by its conversion to 25-hydroxycholesterol upon reduction with LiAlH4. Incubation of IEC-6 cells with chemically prepared S-EC resulted in dose-dependent suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity within 6 h (I50 = 0.3 microM). Pretreatment of cells with progesterone prevented this suppressive effect. No suppression of reductase activity was observed in progesterone-treated cells in spite of obvious accumulation of S-EC in amounts sufficient to effect regulation; instead, a 2-3-fold increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity occurred within a 24-h period. Following the removal of progesterone from the culture medium, reductase activity declined rapidly over the next 6 h. However, IEC-6 cells could not metabolize S-EC, derived either endogenously or exogenously, during a similar time frame; nor did progesterone affect the uptake of exogenous S-EC by IEC-6 cells. These results show that although progesterone treatment of cultured cells promotes the synthesis of a natural oxysterol suppressor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the continued presence of progesterone prevents the regulatory action of S-EC. The unique nature of this interference is high-lighted by the observation that progesterone could not prevent the suppression of reductase activity by either 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonolactone."
https://openalex.org/W1580007630,"The intron within the Tetrahymena thermophila nuclear large rRNA precursor is the best studied example of group I self-splicing introns. In this paper, we examine the structural and functional roles of four internal sequence elements which are characteristic of group I introns in the RNA-catalyzed processing reactions. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutations in sequence elements 9R', 9L, 9R and 2 of the Tetrahymena intervening sequence. Self-splicing activities of variant precursor RNAs were characterized by in vitro splicing following transcription with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. First, we confirm the proposed base pairing of sequence elements 9R and 9R' by construction and analysis of compensatory mutations. Mutations in elements 9R (G272A C274G) and 9R' (G100C C102U) each disrupt the pairing and eliminate self-splicing activity. A compensatory 9R/9R' mutation (G100C C102U G272A C274G) restores pairing and normal splicing activity. We conclude that 9R X 9R' pairing is a requirement for self-splicing. Second, we show that self-splicing activity is very sensitive to both nucleotide sequence and RNA secondary structure in the pairing segments of elements 9L and 2. Mutations within these regions at positions 266, 268, 307, and 309 can increase as well as decrease activity relative to wild type. Third, a mutation in the highly conserved nonpairing segment of element 9L (U259A A261C) increases KM for GTP from 29 to 120 microM, but does not otherwise affect splicing activity. The primary consequence of this mutation is a decrease in GTP binding energy of approximately 0.9 kcal/mol. Last, we show that a mutation in the highly conserved nonpairing segment of element 2 (A301C A302G G303C) eliminates transesterification activity, but does not affect 3' splice site hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1551971861,"We have investigated the effects of ligand concentration on the intracellular behavior of the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin in Xenopus oocytes. After internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis, vitellogenin is delivered to a final storage compartment in mature, high density (1.23 g/ml sucrose) yolk platelets by a biphasic transport pathway. The first phase consists of a relatively rapid increase in the density of ligand-containing organelles to 1.21 g/ml, a region of the sucrose gradient containing a subpopulation of light yolk platelets and lysosomal enzyme activity. The second and rate-limiting phase in vitellogenin transport is the appearance of ligand in mature yolk platelets. The first phase of transport is accompanied by cleavage of vitellogenin into the mature yolk proteins. The majority of the light yolk platelets are not converted into heavy platelets when vitellogenin is absent from the medium for 24 h, indicating that they are a relatively stable organelle which does not mature into heavy platelets during this time period. The progress of vitellogenin through both phases of transport exhibits a concentration dependence, with much slower rates of density increase and lack of appearance in heavy yolk platelets at subsaturating ligand levels. The majority of vitellogenin entering oocytes at low ligand concentrations remains for at least 60 min in a low density endocytic compartment which is accessible to a second pulse of ligand. Vitellogenin-colloidal gold tracer studies indicate that this low density compartment is composed primarily of multivesicular bodies. Low concentrations of vitellogenin residing in this compartment for 4 h are no longer accessible to newly internalized ligand, suggesting that movement into an organelle incapable of fusing with endosomes has occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1543135768,"On the fifth day following inoculation into an unstirred liquid surface culture, Penicillium atrovenetum abruptly, and reproducibly, secretes large quantities (2 g/liter) of the toxic antibiotic 3-nitropropionate into the medium. Concomitantly and with the same time course, crude extracts of the fungus acquire the ability to catalyze the oxidation of 3-nitropropionate by O2. We purified this activity some 300-fold to homogeneity and find it to be a soluble, dimeric (Mr = 73,000) flavoprotein oxidase having FMN as prosthetic group with lambda max = 363 and 433 nm. The preferred substrates are propionate-3-nitronate (3-NP-2) and O2 while the reaction products are malonate semialdehyde, NO2-, NO3-, O2-., and H2O2. Of 13 nitronates tested only butyrate-4-nitronate is more than 2% as reactive as 3-NP-2. 3-NP-2 (0.1 mM) rapidly reduces E-FMN anaerobically to E-FMNH., the flavin semiquinone (t1/2 less than 5 s), but reduces E-FMNH. to the fully reduced enzyme (E-FMNH2) very slowly (t1/2 approximately 900 s). The steady state turnover number with 0.1 mM 3-NP-2 and infinite O2 is 350 s-1. Therefore, the enzyme must oscillate almost exclusively between E-FMN and E-FMNH. during aerobic turnover. (Formula: see text). The complicated and non-integral reaction stoichiometry provides further support for this free radical mechanism. Each mole of 3-NP-. generated enzymatically initiates the nonenzymatic autoxidation of at least 2.2 mol of 3-NP-2 through a free radical chain reaction. An appropriate name for the newly characterized enzyme is propionate-3-nitronate oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1587480288,"The ability of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and T7 DNA polymerase to bypass bulky C-8 guanyl-2-aminofluorene adducts in DNA was studied by in vitro DNA synthesis reactions on a site-specific aminofluorene-modified M13mp9 template. This site-specifically modified DNA was prepared by ligating an oligonucleotide containing a single aminofluorene adduct into a gapped heteroduplex of M13mp9 DNA (Johnson, D. L., Reid, T. M., Lee, M.-S., King, C. M., and Romano, L. J. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 449-456). The resulting covalently closed duplex DNA molecule was then cleaved with a restriction endonuclease, denatured, and annealed to a primer on the 3' side of the adduct to form a template specifically designed to study bypass. In this system, any synthesis that was not blocked by the bulky aminofluorene adduct would proceed to the 5' terminus of the single-stranded template, while synthesis interrupted by the adduct would terminate at or near the adduct location. We have measured DNA synthesis on this template and find that the amount of radiolabeled nucleotide incorporated by either E. coli DNA polymerase I (large fragment) or T7 DNA polymerase was much greater than would be predicted if the aminofluorene adduct were an absolute block to DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the products of similar reactions electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels showed conclusively that the majority of the DNA synthesized by either the T7 DNA polymerase or E. coli DNA polymerase I bypassed the aminofluorene lesion. Substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ as the divalent cation resulted in even higher levels of translesion synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2158242892,"Binding of [4-3H]cytochalasin B and [12-3H]forskolin to human erythrocyte membranes was measured by a centrifugation method. Glucose-displaceable binding of cytochalasin B was saturable, with KD = 0.11 microM, and maximum binding approximately 550 pmol/mg of protein. Forskolin inhibited the glucose-displaceable binding of cytochalasin B in an apparently competitive manner, with K1 = 3 microM. Glucose-displaceable binding of [12-3H]forskolin was also saturable, with KD = 2.6 microM and maximum binding approximately equal to 400 pmol/mg of protein. The following compounds inhibited binding of [12-3H]forskolin and [4-3H]cytochalasin B equivalently, with relative potencies parallel to their reported affinities for the glucose transport system: cytochalasins A and D, dihydrocytochalasin B, L-rhamnose, L-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, D-glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, phloretin, and phlorizin. A water-soluble derivative of forskolin, 7-hemisuccinyl-7-desacetylforskolin, displaced equivalent amounts of [4-3H]cytochalasin B or [12-3H]forskolin. Rabbit erythrocyte membranes, which are deficient in glucose transporter, did not bind either [4-3H]cytochalasin B or [12-3H]forskolin in a glucose-displaceable manner. These results indicate that forskolin, in concentrations routinely employed for stimulation of adenylate cyclase, binds to the glucose transporter. Endogenous ligands with similar specificities could be important modulators of cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1528449587,"Antithrombin III (ATIII) has been expressed in transiently transfected COS-1 monkey cells and in stably transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the resultant protein has been characterized for biological activity. Both cell types efficiently secrete high levels of heterogeneous molecular weight forms of ATIII antigen. The heterogeneity results from differences in post-translational modifications. However, only a small percentage (5-10%) of the total antigen expressed is biologically active. The fraction of biologically active ATIII has been purified from total ATIII by affinity fractionation on heparin-Sepharose. This fractionation indicates that the differences in the active and inactive forms of expressed ATIII result from differences in their ability to bind heparin. Purified ATIII has a specific activity very similar to that of plasma-derived ATIII and exhibits typical heparin-accelerated ATIII activity. The biologically active fraction of ATIII appears to represent the higher molecular weight forms of the ATIII expressed and is likely not a result of altered asparagine-linked glycosylation; however, the nature of the post-translational modification required for ATIII activity remains unclear. The ability to express biologically active ATIII at such high levels should allow further investigations of the structural requirements for ATIII activity."
https://openalex.org/W1501936721,"We have isolated cDNA clones of the mRNA for chick embryonic myosin light chain (MLC), L23, by cross-hybridization with chicken skeletal muscle MLC1 cDNA. The identification of the isolated cDNAs was carried out by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNAs revealed that the cDNA insert contained 832 nucleotides and predicted a polypeptide of 185 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 20,687. The deduced amino acid sequence for L23 showed high sequence similarities to those of adult alkali type MLCs from various tissues, indicating that L23 belongs to the alkali MLC group. Using the cloned cDNA as a hybridization probe, we have revealed by RNA blot analysis that the expression of L23 mRNA was regulated in temporal and tissue-specific manners. The L23 mRNA of 1.1 kilobases is transiently expressed in embryonic skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles of chickens. It is also found in the brain of chickens during all stages of development so far investigated. Only a single gene for L23 was detected by Southern blot of chick genomic DNA. We therefore suggest that L23 is expressed from a single gene in both embryonic muscles and brain."
https://openalex.org/W1599108654,"Potassium depletion decreases blood pressure in vivo and blunts the pressor response to angiotensin II (ang II) without down-regulating the receptor. In cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells, the ang II-induced signaling sequence is biphasic with rapid hydrolysis of the polyphosphoinositides producing an early (15 s) diacylglycerol (DG) peak and a transient rise in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and more delayed phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis resulting in sustained DG formation (peak at 5 min). Exposure of intact vascular smooth muscle cells to low potassium growth medium for 24 h or acutely potassium-depleting cells with nigericin causes selective, marked inhibition of late DG formation (5-min peak inhibited by 60 +/- 8% and 84 +/- 7%, respectively). The early cell response, namely polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, inositol bis- and trisphosphate production and the 15-s DG peak, is not affected. Analysis of 125I-ang II-binding data reveals no significant differences in either receptor number or binding affinity (Kd) in potassium-depleted cells. Together with its marked inhibitory effect on sustained ang II-induced DG formation, acute potassium depletion effectively blocks internalization of 125I-ang II: there is no significant internalization of the ligand after 5 min at 37 degrees C versus 64 +/- 7% internalization in control cells. Thus, potassium depletion does not alter ang II binding or initial membrane signaling in rat aortic smooth muscle but blocks ligand internalization and selectively and markedly inhibits the development of direct PI hydrolysis and sustained diacylglycerol formation. These findings suggest a role for ligand-receptor processing in generating the sustained cell response and potentially explain the lower blood pressure and decreased pressor response to ang II seen in hypokalemic states in vivo. Furthermore, the ability of K+ depletion to alter secondary signal generation may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the K+ dependence of a variety of cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W1507264875,"The reaction of 3'-O-methylpyridoxal 5'-phosphate bound into the active site of aspartate aminotransferase with the substrate L-aspartate has been investigated. This methylated coenzyme is a very poor catalyst but it does function slowly to produce normal products of a transamination half-reaction. At pH 8.5 and above the characteristic absorption band of a quinonoid intermediate appears rapidly and becomes very intense when the aspartate concentration is raised to 2 M. At pH 6 the quinonoid band is not seen, but the conversion of the methylated coenzyme into 3'-O-methylpyridoxamine 5'-phosphate is about 7 times faster than at high pH with the pH dependence being determined by an apparent pKa of 8.1 at 30 degrees C. We suggest that the active site containing the methylated coenzyme carries a net charge 1 unit more positive than that of native enzyme. This causes a loss of some other proton from the active site and could leave the catalytic lysine-258 deprotonated in the quinonoid species. This may explain its inability to react rapidly. We have measured the spectral band shapes of the quinonoid species studied here and have compared it with that seen with native enzyme. Because of the close similarity we conclude that during normal transamination the proton bound to the imine nitrogen probably shifts onto the phenolic oxygen prior to or synchronously with the formation of the observed quinonoid species."
https://openalex.org/W2093792265,"Prices for some lines of liability insurance have increased sharply in recent years, even while the real amount of coverage provided has declined. What accounts for these changes? The large financial inertia inherent in the insurance business, forecasting errors repeated across the industry, and herd-like reactions among many insurers have made the market adjustments exceptionally abrupt. But the most likely underlying cause for the current crisis in liability insurance is the inexorable expansion in liability law."
https://openalex.org/W2108440992,"The decay of the intrinsic fluorescence of the apoferritin polymer and its subunits has been studied by pulse and phase shift techniques. Both techniques show that the fluorescence decay of all the samples tested cannot be described by a single exponential function. The fluorescence decay data of the apoferritin subunits obtained with either technique can be fitted satisfactorily with a function resulting from the sum of two exponential components. However, the polymer data obtained with the high resolution phase shift technique operated either by synchrotron radiation or by a mode-locked argon ion laser can be fitted better using a bimodal gaussian continuous distribution of lifetime components. The molecular basis for this distribution of lifetime values may lie in the heterogeneity of the tryptophan environment generated by the assembly of the subunits into the polymer. The binding of the first 100 irons to apoferritin quenches the intrinsic fluorescence without affecting the lifetimes in a proportional way. This finding may be taken as an indication that the quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence induced by the binding of iron has both static and dynamic components."
https://openalex.org/W1520826996,"Abstract Yeast phosphoglycerate kinase is irreversibly inactivated upon incubation with 5'-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)-benzoyl]-1-N6-ethenoadenosine (5'-FSB epsilon A), an analogue to the nucleotide substrate. Marked protection against inactivation occurs with MgATP, ATP, MgADP, ADP, and 3-phosphoglycerate, suggesting that a part of the catalytic center is modified. The time dependence of the inactivation is characterized by a nonlinear kinetic profile. Curve fitting of various models for ligand binding to the enzyme suggested a two-site model. Modification of one of the sites appears to protect the catalytically essential site from modification. Stoichiometric studies show that the relationship between moles of 5'-FSB epsilon A incorporated per mole of enzyme and the residual enzymatic activity also shows nonlinear behavior. An extrapolated value of 1.5 mol of bound label/mol of enzyme corresponds to complete inactivation. The apparent overall pseudo first-order rate constant for the reaction between phosphoglycerate kinase and 5'-FSB epsilon A, as well as the separate rate constants for the modification, exhibit saturation behavior with respect to the concentration of 5'-FSB epsilon A, indicative of a rapid reversible binding of the reagent to the enzyme prior to modification."
https://openalex.org/W1532768999,"Abstract Antiserum was raised in rabbits against a bile canalicular glycoprotein of Mr = 110,000 purified to homogeneity from of rat liver. The antisera specifically immunoprecipitated a Mr = 110,000 polypeptide from hepatocytes metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. When hepatocytes in primary culture were incubated with tunicamycin before labeling with [35S]methionine in the presence of tunicamycin, the major polypeptide immunoprecipitated by the specific antiserum from Triton X-100 extracts of cells had a molecular weight of 59,000. Enzymatic removal of N-linked carbohydrates from the Mr = 110,000 glycoprotein by N-glycanase digestion also yielded a polypeptide with minimum Mr = 59,000. In pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine, the Mr = 110,000 protein detected by the specific antisera first appears as Mr = 85,000 and 75,000 intermediate species which are endoglycosidase H sensitive. The Mr = 85,000 intermediate form is lost first with time followed by the Mr = 75,000 form giving rise to the Mr = 110,000 form that is endoglycosidase H resistant. Neuraminidase digestion of the Mr = 110,000 form generated an Mr 85,000 form but with a different carbohydrate structure than the intermediate Mr 85,000 form detected in the pulse-chase experiments. The time required to accomplish the processing of the Mr = 85,000 and 75,000 forms is relatively slow. Finally, the terminal sugars are added and the mature Mr = 110,000 glycoprotein is rapidly transported to the cell surface. A minimum time of 90 min is required for the Mr = 110,000 bile canalicular glycoprotein to be synthesized, processed, and reach the cell surface which is long relative to the time required (10 min) for another domain-specific protein, the receptor for asialoglycoproteins, to reach the sinusoidal surface. The Mr = 110,000 bile canalicular glycoprotein turns over in the bile canalicular domain with a half-life of 43 h while the asialoglycoprotein receptor turns over in the sinusoidal domain with a half-life of 23 h."
https://openalex.org/W1512433106,"Challenge of human A375 melanoma cells with sodium arsenite induced the synthesis of stress proteins and stimulated [3H]mannose incorporation into a novel component migrating on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa (designated M14). Enhanced M14 expression was elicited by heavy metals (zinc, copper, cadmium, and nickel), thiol-reactive agents (iodoacetamide and auranofin), and hyperthermia. The kinetics of M14 induction and recovery from stress were similar to those of the stress proteins, but M14 half-life was only 15 min. Incorporation of [3H]mannose into M14 was inhibited by tunicamycin but not by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. M14 was metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate but not by [35S] methionine or [3H]asparagine. Further studies revealed that M14 was selectively soluble in chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) and sensitive to both endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and mild acid hydrolysis. The latter released a water-soluble mannose-labeled moiety which eluted from Bio-Gel P-6 in a manner similar to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. Together, these data suggest that M14 is a lipid-oligosaccharide intermediate of N-linked protein glycosylation and that enhanced expression of this class of molecule in response to chemical insults and hyperthermia is a newly described cellular reaction to stress."
