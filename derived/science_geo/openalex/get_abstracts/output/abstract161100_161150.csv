https://openalex.org/W2052120254,"Amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is the major constituent of extracellular plaques and perivascular amyloid deposits, the pathognomonic neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease. Cu2+ and Zn2+ bind Aβ, inducing aggregation and giving rise to reactive oxygen species. These reactions may play a deleterious role in the disease state, because high concentrations of iron, copper, and zinc have been located in amyloid in diseased brains. Here we show that coordination of metal ions to Aβ is the same in both aqueous solution and lipid environments, with His6, His13, and His14 all involved. At Cu2+/peptide molar ratios >0.3, Aβ coordinated a second Cu2+ atom in a highly cooperative manner. This effect was abolished if the histidine residues were methylated at Nε2, indicating the presence of bridging histidine residues, as found in the active site of superoxide dismutase. Addition of Cu2+ or Zn2+ to Aβ in a negatively charged lipid environment caused a conformational change from β-sheet to α-helix, accompanied by peptide oligomerization and membrane penetration. These results suggest that metal binding to Aβ generated an allosterically ordered membrane-penetrating oligomer linked by superoxide dismutase-like bridging histidine residues.

Genetic evidence from early onset cases of AD indicates that Aβ metabolism is linked to the disease (2Hardy J.

There is mounting evidence that oxidative stress causing cellular damage is central to the neurodegeneration of AD (5Martins R.N. Harper C.G. Stokes G.B. Masters C.L. J.

Aβ in vitro binds metal ions, including Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+, inducing peptide aggregation that may be reversed by treatment with chelators such as EDTA (13Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D.

Furthermore, extensive redox chemical reactions take place when Aβ binds Cu2+and Fe3+, reducing the oxidation state of both metals and producing H2O2 from O2 in a catalytic manner (12Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Because elevated levels of copper (400 μm), zinc (1 mm), and iron (1 mm) are found in amyloid deposits in AD-affected brains (15Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R.

A. 1997; 94: 9866-9868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), the oxidative stress observed in AD may be related to the production of reactive oxygen species by metal-bound forms of Aβ. This hypothesis is supported by the recent observation that senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles isolated from AD brains were capable of generating reactive oxygen species and that copper and iron were essential (17Sayre L.M. Perry G. Harris P.L. Liu Y. Schubert K.A. Smith M.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Moreover, our studies (18Cherny R.A. Legg J.T. McLean C.A. Fairlie D.P. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23223-23228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) have shown that the solubilization of Aβ from post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients was increased in the presence of metal chelators such asN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridyl-methyl) ethylene diamine and bathocuproine. Recently, the dramatic inhibition of amyloid deposition in transgenic mice treated orally with a Cu2+/Zn2+-selective chelator has been reported (19Cherny R.C. Atwood C.S. Xilinas M.E. Gray D. Jones W.D. McLean C. Barnham K.J. Volitakis I. Fraser F.W. Kim Y.-S. Huang X. Goldstein L.E. Moir R.D. Lim J.T. Zheng H. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neuron. in Press, 2001Google Scholar). The discovery that metal binding to Aβ may be responsible for some of the pathological effects of AD makes characterization of the metal-binding site of interest as a potential therapeutic target. The aim of the present study was to characterize the structural consequences of Aβ binding to Cu2+ and Zn2+in solution and to identify amino acid residues involved in metal binding. Peptides were synthesized as described previously (20He W. Barrow C.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or obtained from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia) and from the W. M. Keck Laboratory (Yale University, CT). 2H2O, TFE-2H3, NaO2H, SDS-2H25, and 2HCl were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). The spin-labeled zwitterionic phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidyl choline was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Pelham, AL). The acidic phospholipid spin label 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidyl serine was synthesized according to Hubbell and McConnell (21Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Both spin probes were checked for purity and to ensure that the number of spins/mol were >90% of theory (22Gordon L.M. Curtain C.C. Aloia R.C. Curtain C.C. Gordon L.M. Advances in Membrane Fluidity. 1. Alan R. Liss, New York1988: 25-89Google Scholar). Synthetic palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidyl choline (POPC) was purchased from Sigma, and palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidyl serine (POPS) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. LUV were prepared by the method described by Mayer et al. (23Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Peptides were added to the desired concentration to a suspension of LUV in PBS, and the mixture was vortexed under N2 for 10 min at 305 K. Negatively charged LUV were made with 50% POPS and 50% POPC. Zwitterionic LUV were made with 100% POPC. Because the longer Aβ peptides are prone to aggregation in solution, all experiments were carried out with freshly prepared samples. The samples for NMR varied depending on the solution conditions used; in aqueous PBS with 10% 2H2O added, samples containing Aβ28 had a peptide concentration of 1 mm, whereas those containing Aβ40 were run at 0.3 mm. When the peptide is made up fresh in metal-free conditions and the undissolved aggregates are spun out before use, the peptide aggregates only very slowly (days). Some studies were performed in SDS solution (50 mm phosphate, 200 mmSDS-2H25, pH 5.3, 10%2H2O) where all peptide concentrations were 1.5 mm. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX-600 and AMX-500 spectrometers as described previously (24Barnham K.J. Catalfamo F. Pallaghy P.K. Howlett G.J. Norton R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ultracentrifugation measurements were carried out on Aβ28 and Aβ40 in PBS at 1 and 0.3 mm, respectively, as described previously (24Barnham K.J. Catalfamo F. Pallaghy P.K. Howlett G.J. Norton R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). X-band continuous wave EPR spectra of the Cu2+-peptide complexes were obtained using a Bruker EC106 spectrometer. Samples were loaded into hematocrit capillary tubes and inserted reproducibly into the cavity using a Kornberg holder (22Gordon L.M. Curtain C.C. Aloia R.C. Curtain C.C. Gordon L.M. Advances in Membrane Fluidity. 1. Alan R. Liss, New York1988: 25-89Google Scholar). The sample temperature was maintained at 110 K using a flow-through cryostat. The microwave frequency was measured using a Bruker EIP 548B frequency counter, and the magnetic field was calibrated with an α,α′-diphenyl-betapicryl hydrazyl sample. The exact peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis of total copper by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. EPR of peptide/spin-labeled LUV was carried out as above, except that the temperature was kept at 305 K, above the liquid crystal/gel transition temperature of the lipids. Analysis of EPR spectra of peptide/lipid mixtures was carried out using the spectral subtraction and addition methods described by Marsh (25Marsh D. Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance:. 8. Plenum Press, New York1989: 255-303Google Scholar). To check the validity of these procedures, the lipid spin label spectra were simulated using modified Bloch equations, as described in model I of Davoust and Devaux (26Davoust J. Devaux P. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 475-486Google Scholar). The CD spectra of peptides in the LUV were obtained using a CD spectropolarimeter model 62DS (AVIV, Lakewood, NJ). The peptide concentrations were determined using the molar extinction of the UV absorption from the tyrosine residue. CD was obtained for each solution both neat and after a 1:4 dilution with MilliQ® water. CD spectra were obtained using a 1-mm-pathlength quartz cell, acquired at 297 K in 0.5-nm steps over a 185–250-nm-wavelength range. The base line acquired in the absence of peptide was subtracted, and the resulting spectra were smoothed and analyzed for the percentages of α-helix, β-strand, and disordered structures using the K2d Kohonen neural network program (27Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 28Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Moran F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 1-12Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium measurements in aqueous solution at pH 6.9 (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm phosphate, PBS) indicated that under the conditions used for our NMR experiments, all peptides were monomeric (TableI). Tseng et al. (29Tseng B.P. Esler W.P. Clish C.B. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Vinters H.V. Mantyh P.W. Lee J.P. Maggio J.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10424-10431Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) also report that synthetic Aβ40 freshly dissolved in aqueous solution is monomeric. In aqueous solution, there was little chemical shift difference between the backbone amide and CαH resonances of Aβ28 (Aβ1–28) and those of the corresponding residues of Aβ40 (Aβ1–40), suggesting that both peptides were in a similar conformation. Indeed, Aβ28 and Aβ40 backbone chemical shifts deviated little from random coil values. This, coupled with the lack of both inter- and intra-residue nuclear Overhauser enhancement connectivities in the nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy spectra, indicated that both peptides were undergoing significant conformational exchange in aqueous solution. NMR spectra were also recorded for Aβ28 where the Nε2 nitrogens of the imidazole ring of the His residues 6, 13, and 14 were methylated, hereafter referred to as Me-Aβ28. This peptide (purchased from Auspep) was prepared by incorporating histidine residues that were already methylated at the Nε2 nitrogens of the imidazole ring into the synthesis of Aβ28, and its identity was verified by mass spectrometry and NMR. The spectra of Me-Aβ28 were virtually identical to Aβ28, the only significant differences being three strong singlets in the 1H spectrum at 3.80, 3.82, and 3.83 ppm from the methyl groups attached to the His imidazole rings.Table IUltracentrifugation and NMR diffusion results of Aβ peptides in aqueous PBS solution, pH 6.9 at 293 KMolecular weightDiffusion coefficientCalculatedUltracentrifugationUltracentrifugationNMRAβ28326331401.5 × 10−10 m2/s1.7 × 10−10 m2/sAβ40433041108.1 × 10−11 m2/s Open table in a new tab When Zn2+ was added to the solutions of Aβ28 or Aβ40 in PBS, a precipitate formed. NMR spectra of the supernatant of Aβ28 treated with Zn2+ showed that peaks assigned to C2H and C4H of His6, His13, and His14 of Aβ28 had broadened significantly. However, there was little or no change in the rest of the spectrum compared with Aβ28 prior to the addition of Zn2+ (Fig.1). This broadening of the NMR peaks caused by histidine residues is the result of the interaction of these residues with Zn2+. The histidyl side chain is a well established ligand of zinc in proteins and peptides (30Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and this result suggested that three of the ligands bound to Zn2+were most likely the imidazole rings of the histidine residues. The broadening of these peaks is the result of chemical exchange between free and metal-bound states or among different metal-bound states. The broadening of peaks is indicative of intermediate exchange that on the NMR time scale suggests that the metal binding affinity is in the micromolar range, in agreement with the low affinity site described by Bush et al. (31Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M.D. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). The absence of any change in the rest of the spectrum suggests that the metal-bound form of the peptide is monomeric and that there is little or no significant amount of soluble oligomer in solution, because higher order aggregates would result in significantly broadened resonances. When Cu2+ or Fe3+ was titrated into an aqueous solution of Aβ28, similar changes were observed in the 1H spectrum, with the peaks assigned to the C2H and C4H of His6, His13, and His14 disappearing from the spectrum. A slight broadening of all peaks in the spectrum (associated with the paramagnetism of Cu2+ and Fe3+) was also observed, but there were no other major changes following the addition of Cu2+ or Fe3+. The metal-induced precipitation prevented the addition of enough metal to saturate the metal-binding site. Addition of Zn2+ or Cu2+ to an aqueous solution of Aβ40 (0.3 mm) at pH 6.9 caused the formation of large amounts of precipitate, as previously observed (13Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D.

The precipitate made the observation of NMR spectra problematic, and few conclusions could be drawn from spectra of the peptide that remained in solution. When Cu2+ was added to an aqueous solution of Me-Aβ28, the changes observed in the spectrum were identical to those observed for Cu2+ added to Aβ28, but there was no visible precipitate. Copper ions also induced aggregation in the rat Aβ28 peptide in aqueous solution. Rat Aβ28 differs from human Aβ by three substitutions, with Arg5, Tyr10, and His13 of human Aβ becoming Gly5, Phe10, and Arg13 (32Shivers B.D. Hilbich C. Multhaup G. Salbaum M. Beyreuther K. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In vitro it has been shown that, compared with human Aβ, rat Aβ binds Zn2+ and Cu2+ less avidly (14Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9373-9378Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), that the coordination of Cu2+ or Fe3+ does not induce redox chemical reactions, and that limited reactive oxygen species are generated (11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J.D. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectra of the supernatant showed that peaks from His6 and His14 had broadened beyond detection, indicating that these residues were involved in copper binding. Apart from some general broadening associated with paramagnetic Cu2+, no other significant changes were observed in the spectra. We next studied metal binding to Aβ28 and Aβ40 in SDS-micelle solution to investigate the metal binding properties of Aβ in membrane-mimicking environments. Chemical shift differences between Aβ28 and Aβ40 were very small, again suggesting that both peptides adopt similar conformations in solution. In SDS-micelle solution we determined that Aβ adopted a well defined α-helical structure from residue 15 to the C terminus. For Aβ40 the helix was kinked near residue 31. These results are similar to those recently described (34Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 35Marcinowski K.J. Shao H. Clancy E.L. Zagorski M.G. J. Am. Chem.

At pH <6.5 no interaction was observed between Zn2+ and Aβ in SDS-micelles. The addition of Zn2+ to Aβ40 in SDS-micelles at pH 6.5 broadened resonances caused by C2H and C4H of all three histidine residues such that they were not observed, indicating that the zinc was in exchange with these residues, but precipitation was not observed. Addition of more Zn2+(∼10-fold) in an attempt to saturate binding did not make the resonances observable. Raising the pH to 7 sharpened the resonances slightly, although they were still broad, suggesting that Zn2+ binding was slightly stronger at this pH. Raising the pH further did not measurably increase the affinity for Zn2+ by the peptide. Further addition of large quantities of Zn2+ (up to 200 equivalents) failed to produce sharper resonances attributable to the histidine residues, suggesting that binding was not saturated and is weak under these conditions. When Cu2+ was added to Aβ40 in SDS-micelles at pH 5.5, resonances caused by residues in the 6–14 region were broadened as a result of their proximity to bound paramagnetic copper. This region of the peptide contains the three histidine residues previously implicated in copper binding, and peaks attributable to the side chains of these residues disappear completely from the spectrum. This region also contains residues Asp7, Tyr10, and Glu11 that could act as ligands for Cu2+, and peaks caused by the side chains of these residues were also broadened beyond detection. The rest of the spectrum was largely unaffected, suggesting that there is no major conformational change by the peptide in SDS-micelles upon copper binding and that the helical C terminus is unaffected. Precipitation was not observed when Cu2+ bound to Aβ40 in SDS-micelle solution. The EPR spectra of Cu2+ complexed with Aβ28 peptide in PBS over a metal/peptide molar fraction range of 0.2–1.0 are shown in Fig.2. By the criteria of Peisach and Blumberg (37Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 691-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), the A∥ (15.9 millikaisers) and g∥ (2.295) values for spectrum 2A suggest a square planar configuration for Cu2+ with, most probably, a 3N1O coordination sphere about the metal. Spectra of Cu2+ complexed at a 0.2 molar fraction with Aβ42 peptide in 35 mm SDS in PBS were identical for those of Aβ28 in PBS at the same Cu2+ molar fraction. On the other hand, theA∥ (15.8 millikaisers) andg∥ (2.341) for the rat Aβ28 peptide in PBS, which has one histidine less, fell clearly within the criteria for a 2N2O coordination sphere. The concentration of Cu2+ in each sample was determined by double integration of the spectra of the complexes and of a pure standard solution of CuCl2. The concentration of Cu2+ determined in this way in each sample was within 95% of the total copper determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, suggesting that, within the limits of experimental error, reduction of Cu2+ to the EPR-silent Cu+ had not occurred in the presence of Aβ28 or rat Aβ28, in agreement with the findings of Huang et al. (11Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J.D. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), nor did reduction occur for Aβ42 bound to Cu2+ in SDS-micelles. When the Cu2+/peptide molar fraction was increased above 0.2, line broadening was observed with Aβ28 that was attributed to Heisenberg exchange effects brought about by the metal beginning to occupy sites adjacent to those initially occupied at lower molar ratios. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the broadening was more pronounced with the increasing molar fraction until the spectrum was apparently completely broadened at 1.0 mole equivalent of Cu2+, giving a line identical to that found by Ohtsu et al. (38Ohtsu H. Shimazaki Y. Odani A. Yamauchi O. Mori W. Itoh S. Fukuzumi S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5733-5741Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar) for the exchange broadened spectrum in Cu2+-bridged imidazolate complexes. The amount of broadened line in each spectrum was determined by subtracting from it the spectrum obtained at the 0.1 molar fraction until the remaining line was identical to that of spectrum Iin Fig. 2. The integral of each broadened Cu2+ line was plotted against added Cu2+ (Fig.3, curve A) to give a nonlinear curve, suggesting that metal binding to the exchange-broadened sites was cooperative in nature. A Hill coefficient of 5.9 suggested that copper binding to Aβ exhibits strong positive cooperativity. When the same experiment was repeated in the presence of excess Zn2+ (molar fraction 4.0), the exchange-broadened curve shifted to the right (Fig. 3, curve B) and concomitantly decreased the amount of maximal exchanged Cu2+ by 50%. This indicates that the Zn2+selectively competed for the Cu2+-binding sites but that the Cu2+ binding remained cooperative. When Cu2+ was added to Me-Aβ28 peptide, no Heisenberg exchange broadening was observed in the EPR spectra up to a 0.9 molar fraction, indicating that the peptide was not forming multimers. It appears that metal ions have to coordinate both nitrogens on the imidazole ring of the His residues before aggregation can occur. Fig. 4 shows spectra of 1-palmitoyl-2-(16-doxyl stearoyl) phosphatidyl serine in the negatively charged LUV in the absence (spectrum A) and the presence (spectrum B) of a 0.05 mole fraction of Aβ42, coordinated by 0.3 mole equivalents of Cu2+. Spectrum C was obtained by subtracting the broad Cu2+ line fromspectrum B and shows that there is a relatively immobilized component in the spectra. Increasing amounts of spectrum A of the control LUV preparation were subtracted from spectrum Cuntil a spectrum with a clear end point was obtained (Fig. 4,spectrum D). Attempts were made to determine whether the presence of the peptide extensively perturbed the bulk lipid, as suggested by McIntyre et al. (39McIntyre J.O. Samson P. Brenner S.C. Dalton L. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), by subtracting the spectrum of the control LUV recorded at 300 K. This assumes that the lower temperature spectrum would simulate that of bulk lipid, the motion of which had been restricted by long range effects arising from the presence of the peptide. Using the lower temperature spectrum did not lead to a clear end point, and it was impossible to obtain a well behaved first integral with no negative excursions below the base line (40Jost P.C. Griffith O.H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 369-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was concluded, therefore, that long range effects of the type described by McIntyre et al. (39McIntyre J.O. Samson P. Brenner S.C. Dalton L. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were absent in our system. It was also possible to simulate the spectrum as described by Davoust and Devaux (26Davoust J. Devaux P. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 475-486Google Scholar). The proportion of the slow motion component inspectrum C was therefore calculated by double integration ofspectrum D. Spectra were then run over a range of Cu2+Aβ/lipid ratios, from 0.025 to 0.15 mole fraction, and the proportion of slow motion component at each mole fraction is plotted in Fig. 4 (bottom panel). The relationship between the mole fraction and proportion of slow component was linear, suggesting that even at a fraction of 15%, all of the peptide was associated with the lipid and that the aggregation of the peptide did not increase with the increasing mole fraction. The fact that this ratio did not change when peptide:lipid ratios or peptide:metal ratios changed suggested that the structure that penetrated the lipid membrane was well defined. The lipid:peptide ratio of ∼4:1 is much lower than the value of 10:1 usually associated with a single α-helix penetrating the hydrophobic region of the membrane yet higher than the expected ratio for β-sheet conformation, which is 1–2 lipids/strand, depending on the tilt of the structure in the bilayer (41Marsh D.

Recently, a 353-amino acid splice variant form of the human orphan receptor SLC-1 (1Lakaye B. Minet A. Zorzi W. Grisar T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (hereafter referred to as MCH1) was identified as an MCH receptor. This report describes the cloning and functional characterization of a novel second human MCH receptor, which we designate MCH2, initially identified in a genomic survey sequence as being homologous to MCH1 receptors. Using this sequence, a full-length cDNA was generated with an open reading frame of 1023 base pairs, encoding a polypeptide of 340 amino acids, with 38% identity to MCH1 and with many of the structural features conserved in G protein-coupled receptors. This newly discovered receptor belongs to class 1 (rhodopsin-like) of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. HEK293 cells transfected with MCH2 receptors responded to nanomolar concentrations of MCH with an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and increased cellular extrusion of protons. In addition, fluorescently labeled MCH bound with nanomolar affinity to these cells. The tissue localization of MCH2 receptor mRNA, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was similar to that of MCH1 in that both receptors are expressed predominantly in the brain.

Kawazoe I. Tsubokawa M. Kishida M. Baker B.I. Nature. 1983; 305: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In rodents its tissue distribution in the perikarya of the lateral hypothalamus and the zona incerta suggests that MCH may be involved in a variety of behavioral responses (3Saito Y. Nothacker H.-P. Civelli O. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similar tissue distributions have been reported in both bird (4Cardot J. Griffond B. Risold P.Y. Blahser S. Fellman D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 411: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and monkey (5Bittencourt J.C. Frigo L. Rissman R.A. Casatti C.A. Nahon J.L. Bauer J.A. Brain Res. 1998; 804: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reports implicating MCH in the regulation of feeding behavior show that increased food intake occurs after direct administration of MCH into the brain (6Rossi M. Choi S.J. O'Shea D. Miyoshi T. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and that MCH is up-regulated after fasting and in obese leptin-deficient mice (7Qu D. Ludwig D.S.

There are also reports that suggest MCH may be involved in aggressive behavior, anxiety, and reproductive function (8Murray J.F. Adan R.A.H. Walker R. Baker B.I. Thody A.J. Nijenhuis W.A.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In view of the findings of the current study, we propose that this form of SLC-1 be hereafter referred to as MCH1. Southern blot and related studies have indicated the absence of additional MCH receptor subtypes that closely resemble MCH1 at the DNA level (3Saito Y. Nothacker H.-P. Civelli O. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J.

However, because degeneracy in receptor-ligand pairings throughout the GPCR superfamily is common, we reasoned that other MCH receptors with low homology to the MCH1 receptor may exist. This suggestion is supported by reports of pharmacological differences between the MCH1 receptor and MCH binding sites in various cell lines and tissues (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the human genome resulted in the deposition of a vast amount of unannotated sequence in public data bases in recent years. In the present study, we first describe how we identified a sequence with low but significant homology to the MCH1 receptor from one of these data bases and cloned a full-length cDNA from this. We then demonstrate that the predicted 340-amino acid polypeptide product of this sequence, which we term MCH2, exhibits many of the structural features of the GPCR superfamily, is a member of the class 1 (rhodopsin-like) subfamily, and after heterologous expression in HEK293 cells is selectively activated by nanomolar concentrations of MCH. Last, to investigate the biological significance of this finding we compare the tissue distribution of MCH1 and MCH2 receptors by RT-PCR analysis. A 195-base pair genomic survey sequence (GenBankTM accession number AQ311725) was identified that when translated exhibited 42% identity at the amino acid level to the transmembrane-4 region of MCH1. The primers were designed to perform 5′ (5′-CAGAGTACATCGTCAGGGGATGTCAAATCAAAA-3′) and 3′ (5′-TACTTTGCCCTCGTCCAACCATTT-3′) rapid amplification of cDNA ends on a Marathon human fetal brain cDNA template (CLONTECH). Extension of the known sequence at both the 5′ and 3′ ends revealed a coding sequence of 1023 base pairs with an in-frame upstream stop codon at position −24 (Fig. 1). The full-length gene was amplified from the fetal brain cDNA template using forward (5′-ACAATGAATCCATTTCATGCATCTTGT-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCTGCTAAGAGTCACAAGTACACAAGAAG-3′) primers. The cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO (Invitrogen), and both strands were sequenced on an ABI sequencer. HEK293 cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cell lines were generated by selection in geneticin (16Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Chambers J. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Muccitelli R.M. Jenkins O. Murdock P.R. Herrity N.C. Halsey W. Sathe G. Muir A.I. Nuthulaganti P. Dytko G.M. Buckley P.T. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Hay D.W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and clones were screened by MCH-induced calcium mobilization on a fluorometric imaging plate reader (as described below). Intracellular calcium assays were carried out essentially as described previously (17Szekeres P.G. Muir A.I. Spinage L.D. Miller J.E. Butler S.I. Smith A. Rennie G.I. Murdock P.R. Fitzgerald L.R. Wu H. McMillan L.J. Guerrera S. Vawter L. Elshourbagy N.A. Mooney J.L. Bergsma D.J. Wilson S. Chambers J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20247-20250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The maximum change in fluorescence above baseline, measured on a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices), was used to determine the agonist response. For cross-screening studies, HEK293 cells were screened against a large library of over 1500 known and putative GPCR agonists including all known mammalian neuropeptides as described previously (17Szekeres P.G. Muir A.I. Spinage L.D. Miller J.E. Butler S.I. Smith A. Rennie G.I. Murdock P.R. Fitzgerald L.R. Wu H. McMillan L.J. Guerrera S. Vawter L. Elshourbagy N.A. Mooney J.L. Bergsma D.J. Wilson S. Chambers J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20247-20250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Peptides in this library were tested at a final concentration of >100 nm, and other potential agonists were tested at a final concentration of >1 μm. For antagonist studies, test substances were added 30 min before the addition of an EC50 concentration of agonist. The data were analyzed using GraFit (Erithacus Software). Peptides were purchased and synthesized as described previously (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Changes in the extracellular pH of HEK293 cells stably transfected with MCH2 receptors were monitored using the Cytosensor microphysiometer (Molecular Devices) (18McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into poly-l-lysine-coated Cytosensor capsules (0.2 million cells/capsule) and cultured overnight. The capsules were placed on the Cytosensor and equilibrated for 2 h with modified RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.4. MCH was applied to the cells for 20 s prior to the “get rate,” and the cells were then washed with running medium to remove ligand. Extracellular acidification rates were determined as the rate of change of sensor output during the periodic interruption of media flow. The medium was allowed to flow for 80 s and stopped for 38 s. Rates were measured over 30 s, starting 8 s after the flow was stopped. HEK293 cells transiently expressing MCH2 receptors were seeded into 16-well chambers (Lab-Tek, Nalge Nunc International). The cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (includingl-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 400 μg/l G418) for 24 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with indodicarbocyanine-labeled MCH (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 40 nm in HEPES-buffered saline (including 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). The cells were then washed in HEPES-buffered saline minus the bovine serum albumin and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Analysis was performed using a laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte). Excitation of the indodicarbocyanine label by a 5-milliwatt helium/neon laser resulted in the emission of fluorescence that was collected through a 650-nm long path filter and measured by monitoring the red fluorescence maximal pixel intensity. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 40 μm unlabeled MCH, and specific binding-derived fluorescence was determined by subtraction of this from total binding. The data were analyzed by using Sigma Plot (SPSS, Inc.). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers to MCH2 and MCH1 receptors on mRNA from 20 body tissues and 19 brain regions as described previously (19Chapman C.G. Meadows H.J. Godden R.J. Campbell D.A. Duckworth M. Kelsell R.E. Murdock P.R. Randall A.D. Rennie G.I. Gloger I.S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 82: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The mRNA from each tissue and brain region analyzed by TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR was derived from four individuals, two male and two female (except prostate tissue). The MCH2 receptor primers were forward (5′-TTGCCTGTAGTGCCATCATGA-3′), TaqMan probe (5′-ACGAGGGCAAAGTACCTGTCCACACTCATT-3′), and reverse (5′-AACGTGTCAGTCGAAATGGTTG-3′). The MCH1 receptor primers were forward (5′-GCCACCATGGACCTGGAAG-3′), TaqMan probe (5′-CAATGCCAGCAACACCTCTGAT GGC-3′), and reverse (5′-GGTGATCCTGCCGAAGTGA-3′). Forward (5′-CAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTG-3′), TaqMan probe (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACTGCCA-3′), and reverse (5′-GGCCATCCACAGTCTTCTGG-3′) primers designed to the housekeeping geneGAPDH were used to produce reference mRNA profiles. The MCH2 receptor was cloned from human fetal brain tissue cDNA. The 1023-base pair open reading frame encodes a 340-amino acid protein that structurally resembles members of the GPCR superfamily (Fig. 1). The receptor contains a short N terminus, seven distinct hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, and the highly conserved DRY motif located at the interface between the third transmembrane helix and the cytoplasm (20Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24590-24594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The receptor has only one initiator methionine in the open reading frame, which contrasts with three such putative initiator methionines in MCH1. There are two putativeN-linked glycosylation sites, and there is no characteristic signal peptide. BLAST analysis of public data bases revealed MCH1 to be its most homologous relative. The two GPCRs are 57% identical at the nucleotide level and 59% similar and 38% identical at the amino acid level (Fig.2). Somatostatin receptors were the most similar receptors to these two putative paralogs, with ∼26% identity at the amino acid level. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with MCH2 receptor cDNA and tested these cells for responsiveness to MCH. MCH (100 nm) induced a clear, robust, and transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ in MCH2 receptor-transfected cells but not in control cells transfected with the same vector containing a μ opiate receptor (Fig.3 A). The dose dependence of this response was investigated, and an EC50 value (± S.E.,n = 3) of 8.57 ± 0.62 nm was determined. To confirm the specificity of MCH2 receptor activation by MCH, we also screened these cells against a large library of known and putative GPCR ligands including all known mammalian neuropeptides at final concentrations greater than 100 nm. MCH was the only substance in this library observed to elicit MCH2 receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses in these cells. A HEK293 cell line stably expressing the MCH2receptor was established and used in all further functional studies. The concentration dependence of MCH2 receptor activation by MCH and related peptides was investigated in the intracellular Ca2+ assay (Fig. 3 B). MCH, salmon MCH, and [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH all behaved as agonists with similar potencies (EC50 values (± S.E.,n = 3) of 5.65 ± 1.78, 7.14 ± 3.13, and 4.29 ± 0.48 nm, respectively). Variant MCH, the putative product of a second, variant form of the MCHgene (21Breton C. Schorpp M. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was a weak agonist (EC50 > 3000 nm). To determine the type of G protein mediating this response, we pretreated cells with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 16 h). The toxin treatment had no effect on calcium mobilization by MCH in these cells (data not shown), suggesting that the MCH2 receptor is coupled to G proteins of the Gq/11 subfamily. In a variety of native receptor studies, a number of peptides have been reported to either exhibit functional antagonism of MCH responses or inhibit binding to MCH binding sites (22Drozdz R. Siegrist W. Baker B.I. Chlubadetapia J. Eberle A.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Burgaud J.L. Poosti R. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. Nahon J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Sone M. Takahashi K. Murakami O. Totsune K. Arihara Z. Satoh F. Sasano H. Ito H. Mouri T. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 2000; 21: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate whether these effects are mediated via MCH2 receptors, we tested the following peptides in agonist and antagonist modes over a range of concentrations up to 10 μm in an intracellular Ca2+ assay: rat atrial natriuretic peptide (1–28), rat atrial natriuretic peptide (3–28), human C-type natriuretic peptide-22, human brain natriuretic peptide-32, γ-endorphin, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. We also tested somatostatin-14, somatostatin-28, and cortistatin-14 because of the similarity of MCH1 and MCH2 receptors to somatostatin receptors. We also tested a number of putative products of the authentic MCH precursor and of a second, variant form of theMCH gene: neuropeptide EI, neuropeptide GE, MCH gene-overprinted peptide-14, and variant neuropeptide EI. None of these peptides were active as agonists or antagonists at concentrations up to 10 μm. To confirm further that the MCH2 receptor responded specifically to MCH, we monitored extracellular acidification rates in cells stably expressing the receptor using the technique of microphysiometry. 1 and 10 nm MCH caused robust increases in the rate of proton extrusion in transfected cells but not in nontransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4). Control studies demonstrated that 100 μm muscarine elicited similarly robust acidification responses in both MCH2 receptor-transfected and nontransfected cells (data not shown), indicating that both cell lines are capable of responding in this assay and thus confirming the specificity of the response to MCH. The dose dependence of the acidification response was also investigated, and an EC50 value (± S.E., n= 4) of 1.43 ± 0.44 nm was determined. We used laser scanning cytometry to measure the binding parameters of fluorescently labeled MCH to MCH2 receptors. Saturation analysis of indodicarbocyanine-labeled MCH binding to HEK293 cells transiently transfected with MCH2 receptors showed specific high affinity binding with a Kd (± S.E.,n = 3) of 6.02 ± 0.46 nm (Fig.5), although expression levels were apparently low with the fluorescence signal (specific binding) arising from ∼5% of the population. This value was comparable with the potencies observed for nonlabeled forms of MCH obtained in the two functional assays. We compared the tissue distributions of MCH1 and MCH2 receptors using quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR. The mRNA profiles of the two receptors were similar, showing predominant expression in the brain (Fig.6). However, a major difference was the much higher relative levels of MCH1 compared with the MCH2 mRNA in pituitary. The distribution of the two receptors within individual regions of the brain is similar, but there are subtle differences. For example, the hypothalamus, locus coeruleus, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum seem to express higher relative levels of MCH1 compared with MCH2 mRNA. This report describes the cloning and functional characterization of a second, novel MCH receptor. Several lines of evidence suggest that MCH is involved in the regulation of food intake and energy balance. Mice have been generated that carry a targeted deletion of theMCH gene (25Shimada M. Tritos N.A. Lowell B.B. Flier J.S. Maratos-Flier E. Nature. 1998; 396: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). These knockout mice show reduced food intake, have reduced body weight, and are leaner. The localization of MCH in the lateral hypothalamus and the zona incerta, areas that are involved in the regulation of ingestive behavior, is consistent with this role in feeding. However, perikarya from these areas project widely throughout the central nervous system, suggesting an involvement of MCH in a wide range of behaviors. Thus MCH has also been shown to interact within the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis or stress axis (26Baker B.I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 126: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Jezova D. Bartanutsz V. Westergren I. Johansson B. Rivier J. Vale W. Rivier C. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1021-1029Google Scholar) and to be anxiogenic (28Gonzalez M.I. Kalia V. Hole D.R. Wilson C.A. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1997; 18: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hyperactivity of the stress axis is known to occur in individuals suffering from depression. Thus MCH may also have a significant role to play in psychiatric disorders. Despite the large amount of data concerning the physiological actions of MCH, a receptor had not been identified until recently. Within a short period of time several groups (10Chambers J. Ames R.S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) discovered that a 353-amino acid splice variant form of SLC-1 (MCH1) is an MCH receptor. Within the GPCR superfamily, there are numerous examples of natural ligands that can activate more than one molecular species of GPCR. We therefore reasoned that additional MCH receptors may exist. However, low stringency Southern blot studies (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggest that additional receptors with high sequence identity to MCH1 are unlikely to exist. We therefore interrogated public data bases to identify sequences with low but significant levels of homology to MCH1. A short sequence was identified in a genomic survey sequence with homology to MCH1. Extension of this sequence revealed a full-length cDNA with many of the motifs characteristic of a GPCR, which we designated MCH2 in view of its sequence similarity to MCH1 and its subsequent characterization. MCH2, similar to MCH1, shares low but significant homology to somatostatin receptors. We tested three naturally occurring ligands for somatostatin receptors against MCH2 receptors and did not observe any agonism or antagonism of MCH responses. Similar studies have demonstrated that somatostatin does not interact with MCH1 receptors (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 11Lembo P.M.C. Grazzini E. Cao J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recent studies have investigated the molecular mechanism by which MCH interacts with MCH1 (29Macdonald D. Murgolo N. Zhang R.M. Durkin J.P. Yao X.R. Strader C.D. Graziano M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that Asp123 in transmembrane-3 plays a key role in the formation of a complex between receptor and MCH, possibly by direct interaction with the Arg11 of MCH. Interestingly, this transmembrane-3 aspartate is conserved within MCH2 (Asp113) and may therefore play a similar role in both paralogs. An equivalent aspartate residue with functional significance for receptor activation has also been identified in the related families of opiate (30Befort K. Zilliox C. Filliol D. Yue S.Y. Kieffer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18574-18581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and somatostatin (31Strnad J. Hadcock J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) receptors, and the same residue has been recognized for many years to be conserved in all biogenic amine GPCRs, in which it acts as a counter-ion for the protonated amine moiety of the ligand (32Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Register R.B. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Dixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Both functional and binding assays were used to confirm MCH as the cognate ligand for this receptor. Further characterization using an intracellular Ca2+ assay demonstrated that salmon MCH and the synthetic analogue [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH were equipotent with MCH and were full agonists at MCH2. However, variant MCH, the putative product of a second, variant form of the MCH gene (21Breton C. Schorpp M. Nahon J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was ∼500-fold less potent than MCH. This profile of agonist activity is essentially similar to that observed at MCH1 (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These data also demonstrate that variant MCH is unlikely to act as a natural ligand for either MCH1 or MCH2 receptors. To further characterize the MCH2 receptor we tested, as both agonists and antagonists, a number of peptides that have been reported to bind with low affinity to MCH binding sites in various cell lines and tissues. Thus, MCH binding sites in mouse melanoma cells (22Drozdz R. Siegrist W. Baker B.I. Chlubadetapia J. Eberle A.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), human keratinocytes (23Burgaud J.L. Poosti R. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. Nahon J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and human brain (24Sone M. Takahashi K. Murakami O. Totsune K. Arihara Z. Satoh F. Sasano H. Ito H. Mouri T. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 2000; 21: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) are weakly displaced by a number of natriuretic peptides. Because these peptides do not bind to MCH1 receptors, it has been proposed that they may bind to novel MCH receptors (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate that the MCH2 receptor is not activated or antagonized by these peptides. This may therefore imply the existence of still further subtypes of the MCH receptor. However, recent studies (33Kokkotou E. Mastaitis J.W. Qu D. Hoersch D. Slieker L. Bonter K. Tritos N.A. Maratos-Flier E. Neuropeptides. 2000; 34: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the specific binding to some of these cell lines is unlikely to be caused by the presence of a receptor involved in signal transduction, because binding is largely localized to microsomal and not plasma membranes, and the internalization kinetics are not typical of a receptor-mediated event. We also tested a number of peptides that have been reported either to functionally antagonize MCH responses or are putative products of either the authentic or variant MCH gene. Thus the α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and MCH have mutually antagonistic effects on a number of different physiological functions including feeding behavior (34Sanchez M. Baker B.I. Celis M. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1997; 18: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 35Miller C.L. Burmeister M. Thompson R.C. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1993; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The lack of activity of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone at MCH2 receptors parallels similar findings with the MCH1 receptor (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M.

Nishimura O. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and confirms that both peptides exert their effects via separate receptor families. Likewise, we observed that none of the additional putative products of the authentic and variant MCH precursor (neuropeptide GE, neuropeptide EI, variant neuropeptide EI, MCH gene-overprinted peptide-14) seem to interact with MCH2receptors. Previous studies have also demonstrated that these peptides do not interact with MCH1 receptors (10Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 11Lembo P.M.C. Grazzini E. Cao J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that any biological effects of these peptides are most likely to be mediated by receptors other than the two known MCH receptors. Both MCH1 and MCH2 receptors are expressed predominantly in the brain. Within the brain, the pattern of expression of the two paralogs is similar. Both paralogs are widely distributed, but the mRNA profiles show noticeably higher contributions from limbic areas such as amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus and in a number of cortical regions (cingulate-, medial frontal-, and superior frontal-gyri). The widespread distribution of MCH1is in agreement with that observed previously in the rat brain (11Lembo P.M.C. Grazzini E. Cao J. Hubatsch D.A. Pelletier M. Hoffert C. St. Onge S. Pou C. Labrecque J. Groblewski T. O'Donnell D. Payza K. Ahmad S. Walker P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,36Hervieu G.J. Cluderay J.E. Harrison D. Meakin J. Maycox P. Nasir S. Leslie R.A. Eur. J. Neurol. 2000; 12: 1194-1216Google Scholar). Because the patterns of expression of these paralogs are so similar, these data suggest that neither paralog can yet be selectively implicated in mediating any specific effect of MCH. The lower relative levels of MCH2 mRNA in pituitary and hypothalamus compared with MCH1 suggests that this newly discovered MCH receptor may be involved in physiological processes other than feeding or neuroendocrine modulation. The identification of a second MCH receptor will help to further elucidate the role of MCH in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior as well as in disorders such as obesity and social anxiety disorder.

Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, this subcompartment is referred to as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). There are three known mammalian RyR isoforms: RyR1, which is the dominant isoform in skeletal muscle; RyR2, which is found in cardiac muscle; and RyR3, which is expressed in many tissues at low levels but is mostly associated with diaphragm and brain. In both skeletal and cardiac muscle, Ca2+ release through the RyR in response to a signal received from the T-tubule membrane via the dihydropyridine receptor is a crucial step in excitation-contraction coupling (2Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This event is highly regulated by small molecules such as Ca2+, Mg2+ and adenine nucleotides (3Meissner G. Annu. Rev.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). CaM is a small (16.7 kDa) cytosolic protein, the structure of which has been determined by both x-ray crystallography and NMR (9Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 10Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The protein resembles a dumbbell, with two globular heads linked by a solvent-exposed α-helical stalk. Each of the N- and C-terminal domains contains two EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs. Ca2+ binding domains I and II in the N domain have a lower Ca2+ affinity (10−5m) and are less Ca2+-selective than the corresponding domains III and IV (10−6m) in the C domain. CaM binds to and regulates a myriad of target proteins involved in almost every biological function in three distinct manners: 1) as CaCaM 2) as apoCaM (without Ca2+ bound), and 3) Ca2+ independent or constituently bound (11Celio M.R. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 34-40Google Scholar, 12Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Each of these binding events occurs through one of several poorly defined CaM binding motifs, the most common of which are composed of an amphipathic helix of ∼20 amino acid residues that bind CaCaM or an IQ sequence motif that preferentially binds apoCaM. CaM shows a biphasic regulation of RyR1, activating the channel at submicromolar cytosolic Ca2+ while inhibiting the channel at higher Ca2+ concentrations (7Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). RyR2, on the other hand, does not show activation by apoCaM but is inhibited by CaCaM in a manner similar to RyR1 (13Meissner G. Henderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M. Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C724-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have reported the stoichiometry of CaM binding to the RyR1. Early studies using125I-CaM (7Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) or fluorescently labeled (15Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) CaM indicated a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of CaCaM and 4–6 molecules of apoCaM bound per subunit. Binding site localization studies with fusion proteins and synthetic peptides indicated three to six potential binding sites per subunit with a variable Ca2+ dependence (16Chen S.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22698-22704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Menegazzi P. Larini F. Treves S. Guerrini R. Quadroni M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9078-9084Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recent studies using metabolically 35S-labeled CaM indicate a stoichiometry of one binding site per RyR1 subunit for both apo- and CaCaM (8Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that cardiac SR vesicles bind five CaCaM molecules but only 1 apoCaM molecule per RyR2 tetramer (14Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M. Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C724-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study presents a systematic analysis of the CaM binding properties of RyR2 and compares them to RyR1 assayed under identical conditions. Our data indicate that the purified RyR2 binds approximately one [35S]CaM molecule per subunit in both 100 μm Ca2+ and 5 mm EGTA. In native cardiac SR vesicles, [35S]CaM binds approximately two sites per RyR2 subunit in the presence of Ca2+ and a single site per subunit in the absence of Ca2+. Two possible explanations for this discrepancy are that a second CaCaM-binding protein in SR vesicles is lost on purification or that purification induces a conformational change masking the second site. We have also analyzed the effects of redox state on CaM binding to both RyR1 and RyR2. RyR1 and RyR2 are sensitive to redox regulation, showing a 2–3-fold reduction in CaCaM affinity in the presence of GSSG, which is accentuated in the absence of Ca2+ to a 4–9-fold reduction in affinity. CaCaM inhibition of native RyR2, unlike that of RyR1, is greatly diminished by the presence of two allosteric regulators of the ryanodine receptor, caffeine and AMPPCP. Unlike RyR1, apoCaM inhibited RyR2, as determined in [3H]ryanodine binding and single-channel measurements. Heavy SR vesicles were isolated from rabbit hind limb and back muscle and canine cardiac muscle as previously described (18Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32680-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In selected experiments, endogenous CaM was removed by incubating SR vesicles for 30 min at 24 °C with 1 μm myosin light chain kinase-derived calmodulin binding peptide (CaMBP) in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+ followed by centrifugation through a layer of 15% sucrose to remove complexed CaM and CaMBP. Where indicated, the centrifugation step was omitted. For purification, SR vesicles were solubilized in CHAPS, purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes (19Lee H.B. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13305-13312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous SR-associated concentration of CaM was determined by the ability of CaM to stimulate phosphodiesterase hydrolysis of cAMP as described previously (20Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Calmodulin was metabolically labeled with35S according to a protocol generously provided by Drs. Gerald Carlson and Kenneth Traxler (University of Missouri at Kansas City). The cDNA encoding CaM was the generous gift of Dr. Claude Klee (National Institutes of Health). Escherichia colitransformed with the plasmid DNA were grown in M63 minimal media, and expression was induced by heat shock at 42 °C followed by the addition of 1 mCi/100 ml Tran35S-label (ICN Radiochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA). Expression was allowed to continue for 3 h before the bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml lysozyme) and allowed to lyse overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, CaM was purified from the cleared lysate on phenyl-Sepharose in the presence of 4 mmCa2+ and eluted with 1 mm EDTA. Peak elution fractions were dialyzed versus two changes of 0.15m KCl, 20 mm K+-Pipes, 100 μm CaCl2, pH 7.0. CaM protein concentration was determined by absorption spectroscopy by the equation [CaM] = (A277 − A320)/ε. For expressed CaM, ε was assumed to be 0.20 ml/(mg cm) (21Richman P.G. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5372-5376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, SR vesicles or purified RyR preparations were incubated with 1–300 nm [35S]CaM in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A-0281), 0.2 mm Pefabloc, 20 μmleupeptin with either 5 mm GSH or GSSG and 100 μm (200 μm CaCl2, 100 μm EGTA) or <10 nm (5 mm EGTA, no added CaCl2) free Ca2+. Equilibrium [35S]CaM binding was assayed after incubation at room temperature for 2 h by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge for 30 min at 90,000 × g (SR vesicles) or for 180 min at 225,000 × g in a Beckman Type 75 Ti rotor (soluble and reconstituted, purified RyR preparations). Centrifugation-based binding assays are ideal in situations of rapid ligand dissociation and low affinity since the receptor and ligand remain in equilibrium throughout the separation period. Nonspecific binding, including the trapped volume of [35S]CaM, was determined using a 100–1000-fold excess of unlabeled calmodulin (SR vesicles) or by determining [35S]CaM binding to CHAPS-solubilized phospholipid or liposomes that lacked RyR2. Bound [35S]CaM was determined by scintillation counting after solubilization of pellets in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 2% sodium dodecylsulfate. The time course of [35S]CaM dissociation was determined at 23 °C with the use of a filter assay. To minimize nonspecific binding of [35S]CaM, Whatman GF/B filters were blocked for 1 h in 0.15 m KCl, 10 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.0, buffer containing 10 mg/ml BSA. Vesicles on the filters were washed with 3 × 5 ml of 0.15 KCl, 10 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.0, buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Specific [3H]ryanodine binding was determined in the buffer system used for [35S]CaM binding after incubation with 1–2 nm [3H]ryanodine for 20 h at 23 °C as previously described (18Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32680-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined by Scatchard analysis or with 50 nm [3H]ryanodine in 0.6m KCl buffer. Fusion proteins spanning the full-length coding sequences of rabbit RyR1 (fused to TrpE or glutathione S-transferase) and RyR2 (fused to glutathioneS-transferase) were generated by using polymerase chain reaction to add unique restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the region of interest (RyR2) or using existing restriction sites (RyR1) followed by cloning in-frame into pATH or pGEX-5X (RyR1) or pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RyR2). The sequences expressed for each fusion protein are as follows: for RyR2, FP1 (1), FP2 (263), FP3 (561), FP4 (872–1207), FP5 (1157–1509), FP6 (1487–1817), FP7 (1791–2112), FP8 (2084–2401), FP9 (2385–2754), FP10 (2724–3016), FP11 (3003–3182), FP12 (3160–3352), FP13 (3298–3595), FP13short (3298–3577), FP14 (3543–3961), FP15 (3931–4229), FP16 (4205–4478), FP17 (4404–4563), FP18 (4548–4748), FP19 (4726–4968); for RyR1, FPA (1), FPB (282), FPC (799–1209), FPD (1209–1632), FPE (1632–2157), FPF (2156–2592), FPG (2502–2874), FPH (2804–3224), FPI (3225–3662), FPJ (3622–3880), FPK (3879–4222), FPL (4223–4302), FPM (4302–4430), FPN (4431–4771), FPO (4771–5037). Fusion proteins were expressed in the BL21 Gold strain of E. coli (Stratagene) by induction (with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for GST and 10 μg/ml indoacrylic acid for TrpE fusion proteins) and a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Whole cell pellets were collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min followed by resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and lysis by sonication. Equivalent amounts of each fusion protein (as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain and Western analysis) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45-μm pore, Schleicher & Schuell) by semidry techniques. The membranes were blocked (2 × 30 min) in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.0, 1 mg/ml BSA with either 100 μm CaCl2 or 5 mmEGTA. The membranes were then exposed to 100 nm[35S]CaM in 150 mm KCl, 20 mmK-Pipes, pH 7.0, 0.04% Tween 20 with the appropriate Ca2+concentration for 1 h at room temperature followed by four 10-min washes in blocking buffer at 4 °C. The membranes were dried overnight then exposed to Biomax MR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–10 days. Single-channel measurements using purified RyR2 were carried out as previously described (18Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32680-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in planar lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine in the ratio of 5:3:2 (25 mg of total phospholipid/ml of n-decane). The side of the bilayer to which the proteoliposomes containing the purified RyR2 were added was defined as the cis (cytoplasmic) side. The trans (SR lumenal) side of the bilayer was defined as ground. Measurements were made with symmetrical 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.0, with 50 μm free Ca2+ in the trans (lumenal) chamber. The cis (cytosolic) solution was varied according to experimental conditions. Data were acquired using test potentials of ±35 mV and were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Channel open probabilities (Po) were determined from at least 2 min of recordings for each condition. Free Ca2+ concentrations were determined as previously described (18Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32680-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All data analyses were done using SigmaPlot version 5. Fig.1 A shows the results of Scatchard analysis of CaM binding to cardiac SR vesicles in reducing (5 mm reduced glutathione, GSH, circles) and oxidizing (5 mm oxidized glutathione, GSSG,triangles) conditions with 100 μm(filled symbols) and <10 nm free (open symbols) Ca2+, respectively. The data are also summarized in Table I. In the presence of 100 μm Ca2+, cardiac SR vesicles bound 7.5 mol of [35S]CaM/mol of bound [3H]ryanodine. Since there is only one high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding site per tetramer (3Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 4Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), this suggests that in the presence of Ca2+, RyR2 binds 2 CaM molecules per subunit or that other CaM-binding proteins are present in cardiac SR vesicles. One of the binding sites appeared to be CaCaM-specific since, in the absence of free Ca2+, the stoichiometry approximates one CaM molecule per RyR2 subunit. Skeletal SR vesicles bound ∼1 molecule of [35S]CaM per RyR1 subunit both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, as has been previously reported (8Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The results from these experiments have been corrected for the presence of endogenous CaM in the vesicle preparations (1.0 ± 0.6 (n = 4) and 0.13 ± 0.05 (n = 5) CaM per subunit for cardiac and skeletal SR vesicles, respectively), as determined by phosphodiesterase activation assay.Table I[35S]Calmodulin binding to cardiac and skeletal SR vesicles and purified RyR2 and RyR1with 100 μmCa2+with <10 nm Ca2+[35S]CaM/[3H]RyanodineKD[35S]CaM/[3H]RyanodineKDnmnmCardiac SR+GSH7.4 ± 1.5 (12)3.5 ± 2.0 (12)3.8 ± 0.8 (5)72 ± 30 (5)+GSSG7.6 ± 1.3 (5)6.8 ± 2.3 (5) 1-aP < 0.01 when compared to KD in presence of GSH by unpaired Student'st test.2.6 ± 0.8 (5)261 ± 103 (5) 1-aP < 0.01 when compared to KD in presence of GSH by unpaired Student'st test.Purified RyR2+GSH3.9 ± 1.0 (5)5.0 ± 2.2 (5)3.8 ± 1.5 (6)54 ± 34 (6)Skeletal SR+GSH4.9 ± 0.7 (16)4.7 ± 1.6 (16)4.2 ± 0.8 (8)12.9 ± 3.4 (8)+GSSG5.3 ± 0.9 (5)12.1 ± 1.8 (5) 1-aP < 0.01 when compared to KD in presence of GSH by unpaired Student'st test.4.4 ± 0.7 (5)108 ± 41 (5) 1-aP < 0.01 when compared to KD in presence of GSH by unpaired Student'st test.Purified RyR1+GSH4.6 ± 0.9 (6)5.5 ± 2.6 (6)3.3 ± 1.3 (6)5.4 ± 2.5 (6)Values are the mean ± S.D. with the number of experiments in parenthesis.

[35S]CaM/[3H]ryanodine is the ratio ofBmax values in pmol/mg for [35S]CaM and [3H]ryanodine as determined by either Scatchard analysis or using saturating concentrations. After purification of RyR2 from cardiac SR vesicles (shown in Fig.1 B) in the presence of 5 mm GSH and after reconstitution into proteoliposomes, the CaCaM:[3H]ryanodine binding stoichiometry dropped from ∼2 to 1 molecule per subunit in the presence of 100 μmCa2+, suggesting that other CaM-binding proteins have been removed. Alternatively, one of the two CaCaM binding sites in RyR2 may have been conformationally destroyed or buried during purification. We also considered the possibility that endogenous CaM remains associated with the purified RyR. However, if there is such a population of CaM, it would have to be very tightly bound to the receptor and, therefore, without effect on CaCaM binding measured in this study, which has a high rate of dissociation (see Fig. 2). Purification did not significantly alter the CaM:[3H]ryanodine binding stoichiometry for RyR2 in the absence of Ca2+ or for RyR1 both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Table I). Decrease in free Ca2+ concentration from 100 μm to <10 nm lowered the affinity for CaM in cardiac SR vesicles 20-fold in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH) (Fig. 1, A and B, circles) and ∼40-fold in the presence of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (triangles). In either the presence or absence of Ca2+, oxidized glutathione decreased the affinity for CaM relative to reduced glutathione without changingBmax. Likewise, the CaM binding affinity of RyR1 was reduced 2.5-fold by GSSG in the presence of Ca2+ and 9-fold in the absence, again without changes inBmax (Table I). The Ca2+-dependent changes in CaM binding to cardiac SR vesicles are shown in Fig. 1 C. Increase in free Ca2+ from <10 to 100 nm was without significant effect on CaM binding affinity or CaM:[3H]ryanodine binding stoichiometry, implying that there is apoCaM binding at resting cytosolic Ca2+ levels. The binding stoichiometry nearly doubled as Ca2+concentration was raised to 600 nm, to a value close to the one at 100 μm Ca2+. Conversely, the increase in CaM binding affinity occurred over a broad Ca2+concentration range, requiring Ca2+ concentrations between 1 and 10 μm for maximal affinity. Dissociation experiments were performed to determine the effects of redox state on the stability of the apoCaM and CaCaM RyR complexes. As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of dissociation from RyR2 is largely independent of whether CaM is bound in the presence of 5 mmGSH or 5 mm GSSG. The rate of dissociation in EGTA containing media occurred with a τ1/2 of ∼40 s. The rate of dissociation was decreased by more than 10-fold in the presence of Ca2+, occurring with τ1/2 of ∼9 min. The results suggest that the rate of dissociation of CaM from RyR2 is largely independent of redox state but rather on whether Ca2+ is present in the dissociation buffer, with apoCaM dissociating at a significantly greater rate than CaCaM. Similar results were obtained for RyR1 (see the legend of Fig. 2), with less pronounced differences between the rates of dissociation of CaCaM and apoCaM. To identify potential calmodulin binding sites within the linear sequence of RyR1 and RyR2, we have generated fusion proteins spanning the full coding sequence of the subunit. The design for the fusion proteins is indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” RyR1 sequences were fused to TrpE (with the exception of RyR1 FP E, L, M, and N, which are fused to GST to improve expression), whereas the RyR2 fusion proteins were fused to GST. Since the vast majority of the fusion proteins were insoluble, [35S]CaM overlays were performed with whole cell fractions. Fig. 3 A shows that, in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2 and 100 nm [35S]CaM, five of the RyR2 fusion proteins showed pronounced [35S]CaM binding. CaM binding was detected for RyR2 fusion proteins 2 (aa 263–615), 10 (2724–3016), 13 (3298–3595), 14 (3543–3961), and 18 (4548–4748), whereas inconsistent binding was observed for fusion proteins 1 (1), 3 (561), 6 (1487–1817), and 16 (4205–4478). Fig. 3 Bshows that in 5 mm EGTA, the binding to FP10 is only slightly decreased, whereas the binding to the remaining fusion proteins is greatly reduced, indicative of a Ca2+dependence of binding to FPs 2, 13, 14, and 18. The CaM binding to FP13 is localized to the C-terminal portion of the fusion protein since a truncated form, FP13short (3298–3577), does not bind either CaCaM or apoCaM in overlay experiments (not shown). Hence, it is likely that FPs 13 and 14 contain the same CaM binding domain. RyR1 fusion proteins I (aa 3225–3662) and M (4302–4430) bound CaCaM; in the presence of 5 mm EGTA, binding to FPM was not significantly altered, and binding to FPI was abolished (not shown). These results suggest that there are multiple potential CaM binding sites within the linear RyR sequences, particularly RyR2. Most appear to be buried in the large intact RyR2 channel protein because their number exceeds the number of CaM binding sites in the intact receptor (Table I). It has been previously reported that CaCaM inhibits Ca2+ efflux from both skeletal and cardiac SR vesicles (13Meissner G. Henderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, CaCaM inhibits [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR1 in skeletal SR vesicles (7Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 14Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M. Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with little effect on [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 in cardiac SR vesicles (14Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M. Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C724-C733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used a CaM binding peptide derived from the myosin light chain kinase (CaMBP) to determine and correct for the presence of endogenous calmodulin (see above) in studies of [3H]ryanodine binding, which has not been done in previous studies. Relatively low CaMBP concentrations (0.1 μm) were sufficient to reduce [35S]CaM binding in the presence of 100 μmfree Ca2+ to skeletal SR vesicles to 4% of the control value (Fig. 4 A). For cardiac SR vesicles, a higher CaMBP concentration (1 μm) was required to reduce [35S]CaM binding to comparable, low levels. It is crucial that relatively low concentrations of CaMBP be used if the experiments are done in the presence of the peptide since, as shown in Fig. 4 B, vesicles assayed in the presence of high concentrations of CaMBP show a marked stimulation of [3H]ryanodine binding to skeletal SR in either GSH or GSSG by CaMBP at concentrations greater than 1 μm. A lower degree of stimulation was observed with cardiac SR. CaMBP was less effective in reducing [35S]CaM binding to SR vesicles at [Ca2+] < 1 μm. Where indicated, experiments were therefore done with SR vesicles pretreated with CaMBP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To correlate the binding of CaCaM to the inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding, we measured [3H]ryanodine binding at increasing concentrations of CaM both in the presence of GSH and GSSG for cardiac (Fig.5) and skeletal (not shown) SR vesicles. For cardiac SR, a higher extent of inhibition was observed in GSH than GSSG. The KHi for inhibition of ryanodine binding (0.6 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.7 nm for RyR2 in GSH and GSSG, respectively) was considerably lower than theKD for [35S]CaM binding (see Table I). The Hill coefficients for CaM inhibition of ryanodine binding to RyR2 were 1.0 ± 0.3 both in GSH and GSSG. Skeletal SR also hadKHi values (legend of Fig. 5) that were lower than the KD values and had Hill coefficients near unity. The results suggest that inhibition of ryanodine binding perhaps requires only a single CaCaM bound/tetramer. CaM inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding is also modulated by various regulators of the RyRs as indicated in Fig.6 and TableII. At [Ca2+] > 1 μm, CaM (1 μm) inhibition of both cardiac and skeletal RyR is observed in both oxidizing and reducing conditions in the absence of MgAMPPCP (AMPPCP is a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue). CaM inhibits [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 by both rendering the receptor less sensitive to activation by Ca2+ and more sensitive to inhibition at high Ca2+ as well as by lowering the maximal level of [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 6, upper left panel). In the presence of MgAMPPCP and at [Ca2+] < 10 μm, CaM inhibits cardiac SR ryanodine binding in both reducing and oxidizing conditions (Fig. 6, upper right panel). However, at [Ca2+] > 10 μm, CaM inhibits RyR2 ryanodine binding only in reducing conditions. Thelower left panel of Fig. 6 indicates that in agreement with a previous report (24Zable A.C. Favero T.G. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), skeletal SR [3H]ryanodine binding is markedly inhibited in the presence of GSH. [3H]Ryanodine binding to skeletal SR is activated by CaM at low Ca2+ concentrations both"
https://openalex.org/W2063459592,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases Src and Pyk2 have been implicated in linking a variety of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) to the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascade. In this report we apply a genetic strategy using cells isolated from Src-, Pyk2-, or EGFR-deficient mice to explore the roles played by these protein tyrosine kinases in GPCR-induced activation of EGFR, Pyk2, and MAP kinase. We show that Src kinases are critical for activation of Pyk2 in response to GPCR-stimulation and that Pyk2 and Src are essential for GPCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. By contrast, Pyk2, Src, and EGFR are dispensable for GPCR-induced activation of MAP kinase. Moreover, GPCR-induced MAP kinase activation is normal in fibroblasts deficient in both Src and Pyk2 (Src−/−Pyk2−/− cells) as well as in fibroblasts deficient in all three Src kinases expressed in these cells (Src−/−Yes−/−Fyn−/− cells). Finally, experiments are presented demonstrating that, upon stimulation of GPCR, activated Pyk2 forms a complex with Src, which in turn phosphorylates EGFR directly. These experiments reveal a role for Src kinases in Pyk2 activation and a role for Pyk2 and Src in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR following GPCR stimulation. In addition, EGFR, Src family kinases, and Pyk2 are not required for linking GPCRs with the MAP kinase signaling cascade."

We have investigated the binding properties and specificity of PBPs fromMamestra brassicae (MbraPBP1), Antheraea polyphemus (ApolPBP1), Bombyx mori (BmorPBP), and a hexa-mutant of MbraPBP1 (Mbra1-M6), mutated at residues of the internal cavity to mimic that of BmorPBP, using the fluorescence probe 1-aminoanthracene (AMA).

Several pheromones are able to displace AMA from the MbraPBP1- and ApolPBP1-binding sites, without, however, any evidence of specificity for their physiologically relevant pheromones.

Heterologously expressed PBPs from Antheraea polyphemus (ApolPBP1), Antheraea pernyi (AperPBP1 and -2), and Lymantria dispar (LdispPBP1) have already been used to develop quantitative binding assays with photoactivable derivatives of the pheromone or radioactive pheromones (8Prestwich G.D.

However, synthesis of photoactivable or radioactive pheromones is difficult and limits the candidate compounds tested, usually to the main components of pheromone blends identified in behavioral studies.In the present study, we have examined by fluorescence the binding affinity of 1-aminoanthracene (AMA) to recombinant PBPs of A. polyphemus (ApolPBP1), Mamestra brassicae (MbraPBP1),Bombyx mori PBP (BmorPBP), and a mutant of MbraPBP1 (Mbra1-M6) mutated at residues in the internal cavity to mimic the cavity found in B. mori PBP. The results show that AMA binds with high affinity to ApolPBP1 and MbraPBP1, but neither BmorPBP nor Mbra1-M6. The comparison of the binding behavior of MbraPBP1 and Mbra1-M6 indicates that AMA binds in the internal cavity of PBPs. The fluorescence of bound AMA was used to follow and quantify the binding of several pheromonal compounds, taking advantage of the ability of pheromones to displace AMA from the binding site. The dissociation constants estimated demonstrate a high affinity of MbraPBP1 and ApolPBP1 both for pheromones and fatty acids. The binding data reveal that the interaction of pheromones with binding sites of the two PBPs examined by AMA fluorescence shows little specificity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPheromones and AnaloguesPheromones and analogues were purchased from Chemtech B.V. (The Netherlands) and Sigma, and stored as specified by the manufacturers. AMA was from Fluka. All alcoholic solutions were freshly prepared.Subcloning in pET22b(+) Vector and ExpressionEscherichia coli strain XL1-Blue was used for DNA subcloning and propagation of the recombinant plasmid. TheMbraPBP1 gene was amplified by PCR using pQE30/PBP1 as template (25Campanacci V. Longhi S. Nagnan-Le Meillour P. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with the following primers: Mbra1-MscI 5′-CGAGTAAAGAACTGATCACG-3′; Mbra1-NotI 5′-CCGGGCGGCCGCCTACACGGCCGTCATGATCTC-3′. The amplified PCR fragment was purified and digested with MscI and NotI before being cloned between the same restriction sites of the pET22b(+) vector (Novagen). Recombinant MbraPBP1 was produced by growing E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the recombinant pET22b(+)/MbraPBP1 plasmid at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Cultures were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was decreased to 28 °C when A600reached the value of 0.8.The gene of ApolPBP1 was amplified, subcloned, and expressed in a similar way. PCR was performed using the primers: ApolPBP1-MscI 5′-CTTCGCCAGAGATCATGAAGAAT-3′ and ApolPBP1-XhoI 5′-AGACACTCGAGCAATCTAAACTTCAGCTA-3′. AnApolPBP1 cDNA clone (Apo-3 (7Raming K. Krieger J. Breer H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) was used as template. The fragment obtained by PCR was purified, digested by XhoI, and cloned into the MscI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET22b(+) vector. The recombinant pET22b(+)/ApolPBP1 plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) and expression was performed following the protocol of Wojtasek and Leal (26Wojtasek H. Leal W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30950-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) by growing the cells without induction at 28 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin untilA600 reaches a value >2.5. The gene of BmorPBP was amplified, subcloned, and expressed as described by Wojtasek and Leal (26Wojtasek H. Leal W.S. J. Biol.

Mbra1-NotI, 5′-CCGGGCGGCCGCCTACACGGCCGTCATGATCTC-3′.After amplification and purification, the PCR fragments were used to reconstruct a single and continuous cDNA using M6-NruI and Mbra1-NotI primers. After purification and digestion by NruI and NotI, the mutated cDNA was cloned between the MscI andNotI restriction sites of the pET22b(+) vector (as described above) and the final construct was referred as pET22b(+)/Mbra1-M6. The mutant, Mbra1-M6, was produced by growing E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed by the recombinant pET22b(+)/Mbra1-M6 plasmid at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. WhenA600 reached the value of 0.8, the cultures were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was decreased to 28 °C.Purification ProcedureThe purification of recombinant MbraPBP1 and Mbra1-M6 mutant was initiated by centrifugation harvesting of 0.5–4 liters of induced cultures after 20–24 h of induction. The periplasmic proteins were released by osmotic shock as described in the pET system manual. Periplasmic proteins, obtained from induced cultures of BL21(DE3) (pET22b(+)/MbraPBP1) were submitted to a 100% ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and purified by anion exchange on a ResourceQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Äkta FPLC) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Fractions (1 ml each) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the MbraPBP1 were pooled and concentrated by a 10-kDa Microsep (Filtron), and loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0; the elution was carried out at 0.25 ml/min. Purification of Mbra1-M6 followed the same procedure, with the exception of the ammonium sulfate precipitation step. The periplasmic fraction was directly dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, before purification by anion exchange on a ResourceQ column followed by gel filtration (see above). A second anion exchange on a ResourceQ column was performed with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Both proteins were shown to be >95% pure in SDS and native PAGE. The integrity of the hexamutant was checked by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing.Purification of the recombinant ApolPBP1 and BmorPBP proteins was performed by adjusting the periplasmic fraction to 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, and loading it onto a 20-ml DEAE HR16/10 column (Tyopearl 650S, TOSOH). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The collected fractions (1 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing PBP were pooled, concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Amicon), and separated on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. PBP containing fractions (1 ml each) were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and desalted by dialysis against 20 mmTris, pH 8.0. Purified ApolPBP1 and BmorPBP protein was shown to be >95% pure in SDS and native PAGE.Mass Spectrometry and Circular Dichroism AnalysisMass analysis of recombinant PBPs was performed with a Voyager-DE RP spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Samples (0.7 μl containing 15 pmoles) were mixed with an equal volume of sinapinic acid matrix solution and spotted on the target, then dried at room temperature for 10 min. The mass standard was apomyoglobin.The CD spectra were measured on a CD6 spectropolarimeter (Jobin Yvon). Spectra were recorded in 10 mm Na phosphate, pH 7.0, at 20 °C between 178 and 260 nm, with a 30-s averaging.Fluorescence AssaysIn the case of MbraPBP1, BmorPBP, and Mbra1-M6, the fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon FL 3–21 spectrofluorimeter at 20 °C using a front face fluorescence accessory. Slit widths of 1 and 10 nm were used for excitation and emission, respectively. The spectra were processed with DataMax software. In the case of ApolPBP1, the spectra were recorded in a right angle configuration on a PerkinElmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter using a 1-cm light path fluorimeter quartz cuvette. Slit width of 5 nm were used for both excitation and emission.Intrinsic Fluorescence of PBPsThe interaction of AMA and bombykol with PBPs was monitored by following the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence (excitation at 280 nm and emission 290–420 nm, slits as described above). Spectra were recorded with 1 μm protein in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 0.3% methanol and under the same conditions in the presence of different concentrations of AMA (0–10 μm).Fluorescence Emission Spectra Using AMAThe effects of solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide on AMA binding have previously been tested with rat OBP (27Briand L. Nespoulous C. Perez V. Remy J.J. Huet J.C. Pernollet J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In that study, methanol was demonstrated to be less effective than ethanol in displacing the bound AMA from the binding site. In our study, the displacement of AMA by ethanol and methanol has been determined by successively adding aliquots of solvent to the AMA·MbraPBP1 complex solution. As with rat OBP, ethanol was found to compete significantly with AMA bound to MbraPBP1, and methanol was found to have a lesser effect (data not shown). For this reason, methanol was used for dissolving AMA and its competitors in the fluorescence titrations.MbraPBP1, Mbra1-M6, and BmorPBPAll the fluorescence experiments were carried out in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 20 °C (excitation 298 nm, emission 400–575 nm). The binding affinity for AMA was titrated by adding to the protein sample (1 μm) aliquots of a stock solution of AMA (10 mm) solubilized in 100% methanol. The fluorescence of AMA was recorded after stabilization of the signal (5–6 min). In competition experiments, PBP (1 μm) was incubated in the presence of AMA (5 μm) for 1 h at room temperature, the fluorescence signal of AMA was then monitored and the decrease in fluorescence intensity upon addition of different test compounds was recorded. The competition experiments were carried out at constant methanol concentration (0.3%) and with a test compound concentration between 0 and 10 μm.ApolPBP1Binding and competition experiments were carried out in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 20 °C (excitation 256 nm, emission 440–600 nm). All values reported were obtained from three independent measurements. The curves for binding of AMA to ApolPBP1 were obtained by titration of 2 μm protein with increasing concentrations of chromophore dissolved in methanol. In competition assays, we monitored the fluorescence signal of AMA (2 μm) equilibrated with ApolPBP1 (2 μm) upon addition of increasing amounts of competitor. Fluorescence intensities at the maximum of emission (487 nm) were determined for different concentrations of competitor and were corrected before further data analysis by the extent of AMA fluorescence decrease due to the methanol present in the cuvette.Data AnalysisThe affinity of different compounds for MbraPBP1 and ApolPBP1 was estimated by plotting the decrease of intensity of AMA fluorescence at the emission maximum, calculated as (I −Imin)/(I0 −Imin) against the competitor concentration;I0 is the maximum of fluorescence intensity of the complex AMA·MbraPBP1 and AMA·ApolPBP1, at 492 and 487 nm, respectively, I is the fluorescence intensity after addition of an aliquot of competitor, and Imin the fluorescence intensity at saturating concentration of the competitor. The IC50 values were estimated on the direct plot by non-linear regression with equation corresponding to a single binding site using Prism 3.02 (GraphPad software, Inc).Kdiss values were calculated according toKdiss = [IC50]/(1 + [AMA]/KAMA), in which [AMA] = free AMA concentration and KAMA = dissociation constant for MbraPBP1/AMA and ApolPBP1/AMA, respectively.RESULTSDesign of the Mutant of MbraPBP1Residues were chosen using two criteria: first, they are localized in the binding pocket defined in the three-dimensional structure ofB. mori PBP (17Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and second, they are not conserved among the PBPs. Six residues of MbraPBP1 were thus replaced by their counterparts in B. mori PBP (Fig.1). Three primers were designed to introduce these mutations by PCR. The final DNA sequence, subcloned in pET22b(+), was verified by automated DNA sequencing to check the introduction of mutations and PCR fidelity.Subcloning, Expression, and PurificationAfter PCR amplification, gel purification, digestion, and precipitation, the MbraPBP1, hexamutant Mbra1-M6, BmorPBP, and ApolPBP1 cDNAs were subcloned into the pET22b(+) vector. This vector leads to expression of a pelB leader/PBP fusion protein in E. coli, which targets the recombinant proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm of the bacteria. Upon translocation, the pelB signal peptide is cut off and the PBP is released into the oxidative environment of the periplasm, favorable to the formation of disulfide bonds. This system has been successfully used for the expression of the pheromone-binding protein ofBombyx mori (26Wojtasek H. Leal W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30950-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which contains 3 disulfide bridges (28Leal W.S. Nikonova L. Peng G.

Jacquin-Joly, H. Darbon, C. Cambillau, and M. Tegoni, submitted for publication.PBP1 and Hexamutant of M. brassicaeUsing this system, we routinely obtained 2–3 mg of pure recombinant MbraPBP1 and Mbra1-M6 per liter of culture. Two predominant bands at around 17 and 20 kDa (Fig.2 A, lane 1) are present in the SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates of BL21(DE3) transformed with pET22b(+)/MbraPBP1. The band at 20 kDa is absent in the periplasmic fraction (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), and present in the cytoplasmic fraction (data not shown) suggesting that it corresponded to the MbraPBP1 with its signal peptide (16,168 Da for MbraPBP1 + 2,228 Da for the pelB signal peptide), whereas the band at around 17 kDa, present only in the periplasmic fraction, probably corresponded to the recombinant MbraPBP1 after cleavage of the signal peptide. Pure MbraPBP1 and Mbra1-M6 were obtained after two or three steps of purification (see “Experimental Procedures”) as shown on 15% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). N terminus sequencing and mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of the recombinant MbraPBP1 and the mutant Mbra1-M6.Figure 2Expression of moth PBPs in E. coliBL21(DE3).

Two bands at about 16 and 18 kDa (Fig. 2 B, lane 1), likely corresponding to recombinant ApolPBP1 (15,783 Da) and the pelB/ApolPBP1 fusion protein (15,783 Da + 2,228 Da) can be observed in the SDS-PAGE of whole cell lysates of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the pET22b(+)/ApolPBP1 construct. In contrast, only the 16-kDa band can be seen in the SDS-PAGE of the periplasmic fraction (Fig.2 B, lane 2). This size is identical to that of the purified ApolPBP1 (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). The identity of the isolated recombinant ApolPBP1 protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis using an antiserum directed against the wild type protein. Results similar to those described in Wojtasek and Leal (26Wojtasek H. Leal W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30950-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) were obtained for BmorPBP.Circular DichroismAnalytical methods such as CD have been used to define structural features of insect PBPs. The CD spectra of the four PBPs were recorded and showed that they are all well folded and have similar secondary structures. The two minima in the spectra around 208 and 222 nm are typical of a fold with a majority of α-helical secondary structure, in agreement with the crystal structure of B. mori PBP (17Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The α-helical content obtained by CD (55–70%) is in agreement with the Psi-Pred secondary structure predictions (30Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4386) Google Scholar), which indicates 61–66% helical content.Fluorescence Binding Assays Fluorescence Emission of AMA Upon Binding to PBPs—When excited at 256 or 298 nm, AMA in aqueous buffer shows a weak fluorescence emission with a maximum at 563 nm. In a hydrophobic environment, such as the binding pocket of MbraPBP1 or ApolPBP1, there is a blue shift of the fluorescence emission maximum and a large increase of intensity (Fig.3 A), resulting from the modification in the AMA environment. The fluorescence emission spectra show a maximum at 492 and 487 nm for MbraPBP1 and ApolPBP1, respectively (Fig. 3,B and C, inset). The concentration dependence of AMA binding to MbraPBP1 and ApolPBP1 can be described by a hyperbolic curve as expected for a one-site binding model (Fig. 3, B and C), andKdiss values of 4.5 and 0.95 μm, respectively, were calculated. The affinity of ApolPBP1 for AMA is thus greater than that of MbraPBP1.Figure 3AMA fluorescence. A, AMA fluorescence emission spectra. MbraPBP1 (- -), free AMA (···), MbraPBP1 + AMA (—).

Interestingly, the Mbra1-M6 mutant behaves like BmorPBP. In these cases, the fluorescence increase observed is not significantly greater than the experimental error, furthermore, the lack of saturation suggests either some nonspecific interaction between AMA and the proteins, not related to binding, or the formation of superstructures"
https://openalex.org/W2066439036,"Selenium, an essential biological trace element, has been shown to reduce and prevent the incidence of cancer. Our previous studies have shown that selenite is involved in the chemoprevention of cancer and induction of apoptosis of cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that selenite also inhibits the invasion of tumor cells. Cancer cell invasion requires coordinated processes, such as changes in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, degradation of the extracellular matrix, and cell migration. We found that selenite inhibited invasion of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. Adhesion of HT1080 cells to the collagen matrix was also inhibited by treatment with selenite, but cell-cell interaction and cell motility were not affected by selenite. Moreover, selenite reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which are involved in matrix degradation, but increased a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. This inhibitory effect of selenite on the protease expressions was mediated by the suppression of transcription factors, NF-κB and AP-1. However, selenate showed no remarkable effect on all the steps of cancer cell invasion. Selenium, an essential biological trace element, has been shown to reduce and prevent the incidence of cancer.

The cancer cells metastasis requires several sequential steps, such as changes in cell-ECM1interaction, disconnection of intercellular adhesions, and separation of single cells from solid tumor tissue, degradation of ECM, locomotion of tumor cells into the extracellular matrix, invasion of lymph and blood vessels, immunologic escape in the circulatory system, adhesion to endothelial cells, extravasation from lymph and blood vessels, proliferation of cells, and induction of angiogenesis (1Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Attachment of cells to ECM molecules is mediated by the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric proteins that transduce a variety of signals from the ECM. Through integrin and matrix interactions, many of the genes, which are critical for cell migration, survival, proliferation, differentiation (2Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar), and ECM degradation, are activated (3Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gilles C. Polette M. Seiki M. Birembaut P. Thompson E.W. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). In the majority of metastasizing tumors, cellular interactions with the ECM, which promote adhesion and migration, are thought to be required for primary tumor invasion, migration, and metastasis. The main groups of proteolytic enzymes involved in the tumor invasion are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteases. The MMPs, a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, are involved in tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis in cancer (5Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). MMPs are important enzymes for the proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, proteoglycan, elastin, laminin, and fibronectin (6Johnson L.L. Dyer R. Hupe D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). MMPs are synthesized as preproenzymes, and most of them are secreted from the cells as proenzymes. Among human MMPs reported previously, MMP-2 (gelatinase A/Mr 72,000 type IV collagenase) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B/Mr 92,000 type IV collagenase) are thought to be key enzymes for degrading type IV collagen, which is a major component of the basement membrane (5Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are abundantly expressed in various malignant tumors (7Johnsen M. Lund L.R. Romer J. Almholt K. Dano K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and contribute to invasion and metastasis documented in many reports (8Liabakk N.B. Talbot I. Smith R.A. Wilkinson K. Balkwill F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 190-196PubMed Google Scholar). The serine proteases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), can convert plasminogen to plasmin, which is capable of degrading extracellular matrix proteins like fibrin, fibronectin, vitronectin (9Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), and type IV collagen (10Mackay A.R. Corbitt R.H. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5997-6001PubMed Google Scholar) as well as activating latent forms of MMPs (11Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Beliveau R. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, uPA leads to a synergistic effect with MMPs. Selenium, an essential trace element for animals, has been shown to prevent cancer in numerous animal model systems (12Ganther H.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and cancer chemopreventive efficacy in humans (13Clark L.C. Combs Jr., G.F. Turnbull B.W. Slate E.H. Chalker D.K. Chow J. Davis L.S. Glover R.A. Graham G.F. Gross E.G. Krongrad A. Lesher Jr., J.L. Park H.K. Sanders Jr., B.B. Smith C.L. Taylor J.R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 276: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The known functions of selenium as an essential element in animals are attributed to ∼12 known mammalian selenoproteins, glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, phospholipid hydroperoxide, etc., that contain selenocysteine, specifically incorporated through a unique co-translational mechanism (14Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). However, the studies of the functions of selenium mainly have been focused on the chemopreventive effects, whereas the relationship between selenium and metastasis of cancer cells has not been firmly established. Here we demonstrate that selenite decreases the invasiveness of tumor cells in vitro, which is derived from inhibition of cell-matrix interaction, suppression of the MMPs and uPA expressions, and up-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). These results suggest that selenite can contribute to the reduction of invasion and metastasis in tumors. HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), 293 (embryonic kidney), and MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 50 mg/liter gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. T98G (glioblastoma) and NUGC-3 (gastric adenocarcinoma) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Human type I and IV collagens, bovine serum albumin, gelatin, sodium selenite, sodium selenate, plasminogen, fibrinogen, and thrombin were purchased from Sigma. Anti-MMP-9, anti-TIMP-1, anti-uPA, and anti-uPA inhibitor-1 (uPAI-1) were obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Matrigel was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) assays were performed as described in the supplier's protocol to evaluate the cytotoxicity of selenite and selenate. To confirm the MTT assay results, we also tested trypan blue dye exclusion assay. 5 × 104cells/chamber were used for each invasion assay. The lower and upper parts of Transwell (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 10 μl of type I collagen (0.5 mg/ml) and 20 μl of 1:2 mixture of Matrigel:DMEM, respectively. Cells were plated on the Matrigel-coated Transwell in the presence of various concentrations of selenite and selenate. The medium in the lower chambers also contained 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The inserts were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The cells that had invaded to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Random fields were counted under a light microscope. To determine the effect of the selenite and selenate on cell motility, cells were seeded into Transwell on membrane filters coated with 10 μl of type I collagen (0.5 mg/ml) at the bottom of the membrane. Migration in the absence or presence of selenite and selenate was measured as described in the invasion assay. MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities were assayed by gelatin zymography (15Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). uPA activity was assayed as described previously (16Granelli-Piperno A. Reich E. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) with some modification. For receptor-bound uPA, cells were incubated for 3 min with 50 mm glycine HCl (pH 3.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Samples of serum-free conditioned medium and buffers containing receptor-bound uPA were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with washing buffer, followed by a brief rinsing in washing buffer without Triton X-100. The gel was placed on a 0.5% agarose gel containing 0.3% (w/v) fibrinogen, 0.1 unit/ml thrombin, 0.2 unit/ml human plasminogen and incubated at 37 °C. After incubation, the gel was stained and destained. In this gel, a clear zone of fibrin digestion that appeared indicated the presence of uPA. MMP-9 promoter region (−670 to +3) was PCR-amplified and inserted upstream of the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). uPA promoter containing pGL2 luciferase reporter vector was provided by Dr. F. Blasi (Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy). NF-κB and AP-1 reporter constructs were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). HT1080 cells were plated in 6 wells and incubated at 37 °C. At 70–80% confluency, cells were washed with DMEM and incubated with DMEM without serum and antibiotics for 5 h. 2 μg of MMP-9 promoter containing pGL3 vector and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase vector were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, various concentrations of selenite and selenate were treated. After 24 h of incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using o-nitrophenyl β-galactopyranoside as a substrate. The same method was used for the measurement of uPA promoter, NF-κB, and AP-1 activities. HT1080 cells were plated in 24 wells and incubated at 37 °C to 100% confluency. Along with this, other HT1080 cells were radiolabeled with [3H]thymidine overnight and trypsinized. Radiolabeled cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and added to the unlabeled attached 100% confluent 24 wells. After 2–3 h of incubation, nonadherent cells were collected. Then plates were rinsed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4 7H2O, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4), and this was collected in the same container. Following this procedure, bound cells were trypsinized completely and collected in other containers. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counter, and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated. 24-Well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml type I collagen or type IV collagen. Nonspecific binding was blocked by PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were radiolabeled with [3H]thymidine overnight and trypsinized. Cells were then plated on coated culture plates and incubated for 30 min. Nonadherent and adherent cells were collected and counted, and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated as described in cell-cell adhesion assay method. Total cellular RNA was purified from cultured cells using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing 37% formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer. Membrane was fixed using an optimized UV cross-linking procedure. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 68 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). cDNA probes for MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, uPA, uPAI-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random primer kit (Takara, Japan). The blot was then washed twice with 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.05% SDS at 25 °C, 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, and autoradiographed at −70 °C. Conditioned media were collected and concentrated using Centricon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot analysis for secreted MMP-9, uPA, TIMP-1, and uPAI-1 was performed according to Burnette's method (17Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). Selenite and selenate are inorganic selenium compounds dissolved in water. Because they have rather different chemical and biological characteristics (18Spyrou G. Bjornstedt M. Skog S. Holmgren A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4407-4412PubMed Google Scholar), these compounds were used throughout the experiments for comparison of antitumor activities. We first tested the cytotoxic effects of selenite and selenate on HT1080, human fibrosarcoma cells, by MTT assay in serum-free and 10% serum-containing media. Selenite showed higher toxicity than selenate in both conditions, with and without serum (Fig.1). Treatment with 3 μmselenite increased cell viability, but a further increase in concentration of selenite decreased cell viability. At the serum-free conditions, 5 μm selenite began to show toxic effects to cells, and at media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μm selenite showed cytotoxicity (Fig. 1 A). Selenate did not show any cytotoxic effect below 50 μm in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 1 B). To confirm MTT assay, we performed trypan blue dye exclusion assay, and the results were similar to those of MTT assay, as expected. Noncytotoxic concentration of selenite and selenate was used for additional experiments. As shown in Fig.2 A, invasion of HT1080 cells was significantly reduced by treatment with 1 μm selenite and further inhibited with increased concentrations of selenite. Selenate did not exhibit a significant effect on the invasion at the concentrations used (Fig. 2 B). However, neither selenite nor selenate showed dramatic changes of motility (Fig. 2, C andD, respectively). Cell-matrix interaction is important for cancer cell invasion because this interaction affects protease expression, tumor cell locomotion, and survival. So, we tested whether selenite and selenate affect cell-matrix interaction. When HT1080 cells were preincubated for 6 h with selenium compounds, selenite markedly reduced the cells attachment to type I and type IV collagen in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). The attachment of cells to type I collagen was much more affected by selenite than type IV collagen. Unlike selenite, selenate did not significantly affect cell-collagen interactions (Fig. 3 B). To invade extracellular matrix, tumor cells must dissociate from solid tumors. At this time, cell-cell interaction is loosened. To examine the effects of selenite and selenate on HT1080 cells adhesion to HT1080 cells themselves, a monolayer cell adhesion assay was carried out. Adhesion of HT1080 cells to HT1080 was not changed even after 6 h (Fig. 3, C and D) and even longer treatment with selenite and selenate (data not shown). After the tumor cell became detached from the neighboring cells by loosening its intercellular junctions, the extracellular matrix was proteolytically degraded in order to allow migration and invasion of the cell. Extracellular matrix breakdown is vital to cellular invasion, indicating that matrix-degrading proteinases are essential for tumor cell metastasis. HT1080 cells constitutively secreted high levels of the MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA. To clarify whether activities of MMPs and uPA are involved in inhibition of invasion by selenite, we evaluated the effects of selenite and selenate on MMPs and uPA activities with the use of gelatin and fibrin zymography, respectively. MMPs and uPA bands were confirmed by size markers. When HT1080 cells were incubated with selenite and selenate for 3 days, selenite markedly reduced MMP-9 (Fig.4 A) and uPA (Fig.4 C) activities in a concentration-dependent manner but less effectively decreased MMP-2 activity (Fig.4 A). Membrane-bound uPA activity was also decreased by selenite (data not shown). But selenate did not show any inhibitory effect on MMP-2, -9, and uPA activities (Fig. 4, B andD). To confirm that the inhibitory effect of selenite on MMPs in HT1080 cells is general phenomena, several cell lines such as MDA-MB-231, NUGC-3, T98G, and 293 cells were further tested. The activities of MMP-9 were dramatically decreased by selenite in these cells, but those of MMP-2 were less dramatic (Fig.5).Figure 5Effects of selenite on the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in various cell lines. T98G, HEK 293, MDA-MB-231, and NUGC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of selenite for 3 days, and gelatin zymography was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We attempted to detect whether selenite is also effective in the presence of TPA and TNF-α, which are known to up-regulate MMP-9 expression and activate pro-MMP-2 to active MMP-2 (19Watanabe H. Nakanishi I. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Okada Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 991-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Migita K. Eguchi K. Kawabe Y. Ichinose Y. Tsukada T. Aoyagi T. Nakamura H. Nagataki S. Immunology. 1996; 89: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Treatment of HT1080 cells with TPA and TNF-α resulted in increased levels of MMP-9 expression, but pretreatment with selenite also decreased level of MMP-9 (Fig. 6,A and B). The expression and the activation of MMP-2 were much less affected by selenite, as expected. We next treated dexamethasone, which is known to decrease MMP-9 expression (21Liu W. Hillmann A.G. Harmon J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When selenite and dexamethasone were treated in cells simultaneously, MMP-9 activity was much more decreased than that of selenite or dexamethasone-treated cells only (Fig. 6 C). Unlike selenite, selenate showed no marked effects on MMP-9 activity in all cases (data not shown). We further tested whether the strong inhibitory effects of selenite on MMP-9 and uPA are by direct association between selenite and proteases. We performed two experiments. First, we incubated various concentrations of selenite with conditioned media without any HT1080 cells. Direct exposure of collected conditioned medium of HT1080 cells to selenite had no effect on MMPs and uPA gelano- and fibrolytic activities (data not shown), indicating that inhibition of MMPs and uPA was not attributable to a direct effect of the selenite on secreted MMPs and uPA. Second, we performed Western blotting to identify the protein amount. The results of Western blotting showed that selenite decreased MMP-9 and uPA, but increased or didn't change TIMP-1 and uPAI-1 levels (Fig.7), respectively. These two experiments indicate that selenite may exert its actions through the transcriptional regulation of these proteins. Further examination showed that the reduced activities of proteases are related to their mRNA levels. In addition, mRNA levels of their inhibitors were also studied. As shown in Northern blotting results (Fig. 8), selenite decreased MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA transcriptional levels, and MMP-9 mRNA was dramatically decreased at 3 μm selenite. Interestingly, selenite increased TIMP-1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner but decreased TIMP-2 mRNA levels. This Northern blotting pattern was similar to the results of zymography (Fig. 4, Aand C) and Western blotting (Fig. 7). However, selenate did not produce much of an effect on MMPs and uPA mRNA levels, as of zymographic analysis, and rather decreased TIMP-1 and short transcript of uPAI-1. Because the mRNA levels of MMP-9 and uPA were markedly decreased by selenite, we further examined them using MMP-9 and uPA promoter vectors. In this experiment, selenite reduced the activities of both promoters in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.9), which was a similar trend of Northern blotting. All of these results suggest that proteases and their inhibitors are transcriptionally regulated by selenium compounds, especially selenite.Figure 9Effects of selenite on the promoter activities of MMP-9 and uPA. MMP-9 (A) or uPA (B) promoter-containing reporter vectors were transfected, and various concentrations of selenite were treated, and luciferase activity was measured. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Results were statistically significant (*, p < 0.05) using Student's ttest.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several transcriptional factors regulate the expressions of MMPs, uPA, and their inhibitors. AP-1 is a major transcription factor, which regulates MMP-9, uPA, TIMPs, and uPAI-1 expression, and NF-κB is known to regulate MMP-9 and uPA expressions. We then tested the activities of these transcription factors regulated by selenite and selenate using AP-1 and NF-κB reporter vectors, which have binding sites to those factors. AP-1 and NF-κB activities were significantly decreased by treatment with selenite in the presence as well as in the absence of TPA (Fig. 10,A and C, respectively), but selenate slightly increased AP-1 and NF-κB activities (Fig. 10, B andD, respectively). It was demonstrated that selenite exerted stepwise suppression of cancer cell metastasis within the nontoxic range. Selenite significantly inhibited the invasion of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. This research was to determine which steps were regulated by selenite. Nontoxic levels of selenite markedly reduced cell-collagen attachment but had no effect on adhesion of the cell-cell and cell motility. Many reports show the importance of cancer cell-matrix interaction. Cell and matrix interactions promote cell migration, proliferation, and ECM degradation (2Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar, 3Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gilles C. Polette M. Seiki M. Birembaut P. Thompson E.W. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that prevention of tumor cell adhesion and migration is related to inhibition of tumor cell invasion into the basement membrane (22Liotta L.A. Tryggvason K. Garbisa S. Hart I. Foltz C.M. Shafie S. Nature. 1982; 284: 67-68Crossref Scopus (1556) Google Scholar), and agents that inhibit cell attachment in vitro decrease the invasiveness and/or metastatic potential of tumor cells in vivo (23Vollmers H.P. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3729-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Vollmers H.P. Imhof B.A. Braun S. Waller C.A. Schirrmacher V. Birchmeier W. FEBS Lett. 1984; 172: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Iwamoto Y. Robey F.A. Graf J. Sasaki M. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. Martin G.R.

Therefore, cellular interactions with the ECM, which promote adhesion and migration, are thought to be required for primary tumor invasion, migration, and metastasis (27Liotta L.A. Rao C.N. Wewer U.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1037-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). It is reported that selenite inhibits HeLa cells attachment to the ECM (28Yan L. Frenkel G.D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5803-5807PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated here that attachment of HT1080 cells to the type I and IV collagen was significantly decreased after 6 h of pretreatment with 2 μm selenite and further dramatically decreased with 3 μm. But selenate did not show any inhibitory effect on attachment. The cell-cell adhesion and cell motility are closely associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis (1Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cell. 1991; 64: 327-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar, 29Genda T. Sakamoto M. Ichida T. Asakura H. Hirohashi S. Lab.

Neurosci. 1999; 17: 625-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but selenite had no marked inhibitory or stimulatory effects on them in our experiments. Therefore, the inhibition of attachment of HT1080 cells to the matrix by selenite is a crucial mechanism for the inhibition of invasion. After the tumor cell has become detached from neighboring cells by loosening its intercellular junctions, the ECM has to be proteolytically degraded in order to allow migration and invasion of the cells. So, matrix-degrading proteinases are essential for tumor cell metastasis. Many studies reveal that enhanced production of MMPs and uPA correlates with the invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of the tumors (10Mackay A.R. Corbitt R.H. Hartzler J.L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5997-6001PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the relationship between the suppression of MMP-9 and the inhibition of invasion and metastasis has been explored with the use of anti-MMP-9 ribozyme (31Hua J. Muschel R.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5279-5284PubMed Google Scholar), ursolic acid (32Cha H.J. Bae S.K. Lee H.Y. Lee O.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Park B.C. Kim K.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2281-2284PubMed Google Scholar), and aspirin (33Murono S. Yoshizaki T. Sato H. Takeshita H. Furukawa M. Pagano J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of uPA levels using monoclonal antibody against urokinase or antisense oligonucleotides also showed reduced invasion and metastasis of tumor cells in mice (34Hearing V.J. Law L.W. Corti A. Appella E. Blasi F. Cancer Res. 1998; 48: 1270-1278Google Scholar). Here it was demonstrated that selenite decreased markedly MMP-9, uPA, and less dramatically MMP-2 expressions. The inhibitory effect of selenite on proteinases expression gives reasonable explanation for the inhibition of invasion. Moreover, selenite exerts its action through regulation of inhibitor of MMP-9, TIMP-1. Interestingly, selenite increased the TIMP-1 mRNA and protein level but decreased the TIMP-2 level. Although TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are inhibitors of MMP-9 and MMP-2, respectively, expressions of these inhibitors are differentially regulated in vivo as well as in the cell culture system (35Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As TIMP-1 is a natural inhibitor of MMP-9, the increase in its mRNA and protein can inhibit tumor cell invasion (37Nakano A. Tani E. Miyazaki K. Yamamoto Y. Furuyama J. J.

Plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) isoforms of the b splice type contain predicted PDZ (PSD95/Dlg/ZO-1) interaction domains. The COOH-terminal tail of PMCA2b isolated the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein SAP97/hDlg as a binding partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The related MAGUKs SAP90/PSD95, PSD93/chapsyn-110, SAP97, and SAP102 all bound to the COOH-terminal tail of PMCA4b, whereas only the first three bound to the tail of PMCA2b. Coimmunoprecipitations confirmed the interaction selectivity between PMCA4b and SAP102 as opposed to the promiscuity of PMCA2b and 4b in interacting with other SAPs. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the exclusive presence and colocalization of PMCA4b and SAP97 in the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. In hippocampal neurons, PMCA2b was abundant throughout the somatodendritic compartment and often extended into the neck and head of individual spines where it colocalized with SAP90/PSD95. These data show that PMCA b splice forms interact promiscuously but also with specificity with different members of the PSD95 family of SAPs. PMCA-SAP interactions may play a role in the recruitment and maintenance of the PMCA at specific membrane domains involved in local Ca(2+) regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1972399303,"Cellular dedifferentiation is the major process underlying totipotency, regeneration, and formation of new stem cell lineages in multicellular organisms. In animals it is often associated with carcinogenesis. Here, we used tobacco protoplasts (plant cells devoid of cell wall) to study changes in chromatin structure in the course of dedifferentiation of mesophyll cells. Using flow cytometry and micrococcal nuclease analyses, we identified two phases of chromatin decondensation prior to entry of cells into S phase. The first phase takes place in the course of protoplast isolation, following treatment with cell wall degrading enzymes, whereas the second occurs only after protoplasts are induced with phytohormones to re-enter the cell cycle. In the absence of hormonal application, protoplasts undergo cycles of chromatin condensation/decondensation and die. The ubiquitin proteolytic system was found indispensable for protoplast progression into S phase, being required for the second but not the first phase of chromatin decondensation. The emerging model suggests that cellular dedifferentiation proceeds by two functionally distinct phases of chromatin decondensation: the first is a transitory phase that confers competence for cell fate switch, which is followed, under appropriate conditions, by a second proteasome-dependent phase representing a commitment for the mitotic cycle. These findings might have implications for a wide range of dedifferentiation-driven cellular processes in higher eukaryotes.

The emerging model suggests that cellular dedifferentiation proceeds by two functionally distinct phases of chromatin decondensation: the first is a transitory phase that confers competence for cell fate switch, which is followed, under appropriate conditions, by a second proteasome-dependent phase representing a commitment for the mitotic cycle. These findings might have implications for a wide range of dedifferentiation-driven cellular processes in higher eukaryotes. fluorescence-activated cell sorter 6′-benzylaminopurine α−naphthalene acetic acid propidium iodide hydroxyurea micrococcal nuclease 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Skp1-Cdc53-F-box protein A high proportion of mature plant cells retain characteristic features of totipotent stem cells, i.e. they have the capability to dedifferentiate, re-enter the cell cycle, and proliferate, eventually giving rise to the various organs that make up a new plant (1Takebe I. Labib G. Melchers G. Naturwissenchaften. 1971; 58: 318-320Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In multicellular organisms, cellular dedifferentiation is the major process enabling the regeneration of complex tissues and organs as well as the establishment of new stem cell lineages; in animals it is often associated with carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying re-entry of differentiated animal cells into the cell cycle and reactivation of DNA synthesis have been intensively studied. Yet, little is known about the early events that accompany cellular dedifferentiation, i.e. the establishment of competence for cell fate switch and the determination of cell fate. The tobacco protoplast system provides an outstanding experimental tool for the study of the biochemical and molecular basis for cellular dedifferentiation. The fully differentiated, non-dividing mesophyll cells of tobacco leaves can be separated from their original tissue by cell wall-degrading enzymes. This treatment results in the formation of a large population of protoplasts (plant cells devoid of cell wall) that, following treatment with phytohormones (auxin and cytokinin) can re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate (2Nagata T. Takebe I. Planta. 1970; 92: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 3Galun E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 237-266Crossref Google Scholar, 4Trehin C. Planchais S. Glab N.

Plant Growth Regul. 1998; 17: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This system demonstrates a unique attribute of plant cells, totipotency,i.e. the capability for cloning in plants (1Takebe I. Labib G. Melchers G. Naturwissenchaften. 1971; 58: 318-320Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Dedifferentiation of mature tobacco cells was shown to be accompanied by a sharp increase in ubiquitin gene expression (6Jamet E. Durr A. Parmentier Y. Criqui M.C. Fleck J. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 29: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the biochemical tag that marks proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system (7Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevation in ubiquitin gene expression probably represents a critical point in cellular reorganization, namely, selective destruction of proteins involved in maintaining the previous function of a cell and a concomitant activation of proteins that are essential for cell proliferation (8Durr A. Jamet E. Criqui M.C. Genschik P. Parmentier Y. Marbach J. Plesse B. Lett M.C. Vernet T. Fleck J. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1993; 75: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 9Hershko A. Curr.

Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Genetic studies inArabidopsis demonstrated that some of the factors involved in auxin response are components of the cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-protein-ligase complex (E3), known as SCF (Skp1-Cdc53-F-box protein) (Ref. 12Gray W.M. Estelle M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and references therein). The SCF complex is required for the ubiquitination of specific phosphorylated substrates during G1 to S transition (9Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10Peters J-M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Krek W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the course of cellular dedifferentiation, mature cells undergo remarkable changes in their pattern of gene expression, switching from a program that drives the specific function of a given somatic cell to a new one that directs cell multiplication. How do differentiated cells remodel their gene expression program in a rapid and orderly manner? Conceivably, chromatin reorganization could serve that purpose. Indeed, it has been suggested that one of the first stages in cellular dedifferentiation is the unfolding of chromatin supercoiling (13Chiabrera A. Hinsenkamp M. Pilla A.A. Ryaby J. Ponta D. Belmont A. Beltrame F. Grattarola M. Nicolini C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We currently study mechanism(s) underlying dedifferentiation of mature plant cells, focusing on changes in chromatin structure. Using FACS1 and MNase analyses, we found that differentiated tobacco mesophyll cells undergo two distinct phases of chromatin decondensation prior to entry into S phase. We also report the involvement of the ubiquitin proteasome system in chromatin decondensation and entry of cells into S phase. Protoplasts were isolated from sterile leaves of Nicotiana tabacum (“Samsun NN”) essentially as described (14Zelcer A. Galun E. Plant Sci. Lett. 1976; 7: 331-336Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared protoplasts were washed and incubated at 22 °C in VKM medium containing 0.5 μg/ml 6′-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 2 μg/ml α−naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). In certain assays, protoplasts or leaves were incubated in the presence of 100 μm of the ubiquitin proteasome inhibitor MG132 (N-carbobenzyloxy (N-CBZ)-Leu-Leu-Leu-al, Sigma), or the protease inhibitor leupeptin (acetyl-Leu-Leu-Arg-al, Sigma), or 5 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma). All FACS measurements were performed on isolated nuclei to avoid interference of plastid and mitochondrial DNAs. Nuclei were isolated in a Hamilton buffer essentially as described (15Van Blokland R. ten Lohuis M. Meyer P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 257: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Saxena P.K. Fowke L.C. King J. Protoplasma. 1985; 128: 184-189Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), washed twice with FACS buffer (10 mm MES, 0.2 m sucrose, 0.01% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (16Saxena P.K. Fowke L.C. King J. Protoplasma. 1985; 128: 184-189Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) to remove soluble contaminants, and passed through two layers each of 150- and 100-μm filters to remove cell debris. Nuclei were precipitated (1000 × g, 7 min, 4 °C), resuspended in FACS buffer supplemented with 50 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 50 μg/ml PI (Sigma), viewed under the microscope, and subjected to FACS analysis using FACSort (Becton Dickinson). The position of PI fluorescence intensity for G0/G1nuclei has been changed from one experiment to another as a result of alteration in the amplifier gains for FL-2, which was necessary to accommodate fluorescence intensity of both G0/G1 and G2 nuclei. Protoplasts reactivated for S phase (72 h after their preparation) were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 30 min, after which nuclei were isolated, stained with PI, and analyzed by FACS. Nuclei were then sorted, and DNA was prepared (from about 50,000 nuclei) as described below, resolved on 0.8% agarose gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-BrdUrd (Becton Dickinson). Equal amounts of nuclei (determined by pack volume and relative density) prepared from protoplasts or from tobacco leaves were first permeabilized by incubation in Hamilton buffer containing 0.15% Triton X-100 (15Van Blokland R. ten Lohuis M. Meyer P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 257: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), washed and resuspended in 600 μl of nuclei digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (15Van Blokland R. ten Lohuis M. Meyer P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 257: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)). A sample (80 μl) was removed for untreated control. MNase (1000 units/ml) was then added and at various time points, samples (80 μl) were taken, mixed with 350 μl of stop solution (2 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2% SDS, (17Blank T. Trendelenburg M. Kleinschmidt J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)), and incubated overnight at 37 °C. To prepare DNA, each sample was added 140 μl of 5 m potassium acetate, mixed well, incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged (15 min, 12,000 ×g, 4 °C). The supernatant was collected, extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and DNA was precipitated by adding 1 ml of 100% ethanol, followed by centrifugation. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml, 25 min at room temperature), and nuclease digestion products were resolved on 1.6% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Total RNA was prepared from protoplasts by using the Tri-Reagent kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Equal amounts of RNA were resolved on 1.4% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred to a BioTrace pure nitrocellulose membrane (Gelman Sciences), and hybridized with32P-labeled Arabidopsis Skp1 antisense RNA.Arabidopsis Skp1 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using PWO DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following primers: Skp1-sense, 5′-GTCGACGAATTCGAGCTCTCACTCGAGTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTGATTCTCC-3′ flanked with the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, and Skp1-antisense primer, 5′-GTCGACGAATTCGAGCTCTCACTCGAGTCATTCAAAAGCCCATTGATTCTCC-3′ flanked withHincII and EcoRI sites. As a template we used the BAC clone T4L20 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AL023094), kindly provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC). The amplified DNA fragment was digested withBamHI and EcoRI, subcloned into the same sites of pBluescript SK, and sequenced to confirm identity. To prepare antisense RNA probes, the plasmid DNA was linearized with BamHI and subjected to in vitro transcription using the Riboprobe System (Promega) and T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tobacco leaves were treated with cell wall-degrading enzymes to produce a large population of protoplasts. We compared the FACS histograms of PI-stained nuclei isolated from freshly prepared protoplasts (t-0 protoplasts) versus nuclei prepared from leaves. Both t-0 protoplasts and leaf nuclei displayed a single peak corresponding to G0/G1 content of DNA (Fig.1, A and B). However, nuclei prepared from t-0 protoplasts (Fig. 1 B, G1 nuclei) reproducibly showed an upward shift in fluorescence intensity compared with leaf nuclei (Fig. 1 A, G0 nuclei). To verify that these changes in PI fluorescence reflected intrinsic differences in the PI binding capabilities of chromatin, both populations of nuclei were mixed and incubated on ice for 15–30 min prior to FACS analysis. Fig. 1 C shows that even after nuclei mixing, each population retained its position in the FACS histogram supporting an intrinsic difference in PI binding capabilities of chromatin. Because PI intercalates between the strands of DNA without sequence specificity, its fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to the level of accessible DNA, hence reflecting the condensation state of chromatin. We next applied a biochemical test, namely the MNase assay, to test whether the observed increment in fluorescence intensity of protoplasts nuclei reflected an increase in DNA accessibility to PI conferred by DNA decondensation (17Blank T. Trendelenburg M. Kleinschmidt J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To this end, permeabilized nuclei from leaves or from t-0 protoplasts were treated with MNase for various time periods, and protected DNA fragments were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 D, digestion by MNase resulted in a typical nucleosomal ladder visualized by ethidium bromide staining, where each band represents DNA protected by one or several nucleosomes. Chromatin of t-0 protoplasts showed a higer sensitivity to MNase than chromatin from leaf nuclei (Fig. 1 D, compare lane 6 withlane 11). This verified that chromatin in nuclei of t-0 protoplasts is at a relatively decondensed configuration compared with chromatin in leaf nuclei. By analyzing the effect of leaf and protoplast nuclear protein extracts on the activity of MNase, we excluded the possibility that the reduced sensitivity of leaf chromatin to MNase resulted from the presence of nuclease inhibitors, otherwise absent from protoplasts nuclei (data not shown). Taken together, we suggest that the removal of the cell wall and the separation of differentiated mesophyll cells from their original tissue induce a stress response leading to conformational changes in chromatin. Following preparation, protoplasts re-enter the cell cycle and reactivate DNA synthesis only upon application of the phytohormones auxin and cytokinin. In the absence of phytohormones protoplasts undergo cycles of chromatin condensation/decondensation and die (Fig.2). FACS analysis showed that within 24 h chromatin became condensed (Fig. 2 C), shifting from the G1 to G0 position (Fig. 2,G1 and G0), which is typical for leaf nuclei (Fig. 2 A). The chromatin is then gradually decondensed, and sub-G1 population, which is typical for cells undergoing apoptotic cell death (18Ormerod M.G. Collins M.K. Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Robertson D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 153: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), starts to accumulate (Fig. 2, Dand E), eventually leading to protoplast death (not shown). In the presence of phytohormones, protoplasts re-enter the cell cycle (Fig. 3); division patterns were first evident at 72 h after hormonal application (Fig. 3 D,right panel). FACS analysis showed that most freshly prepared protoplasts (t-0 protoplasts, Fig. 3 A) as well as those incubated with hormones for 24 h (Fig. 3 B) had DNA content corresponding to the G1 phase. By 48 h (Fig. 3 C), about 10% of protoplasts approached S phase, and by 72 h (Fig. 3 D) 30–40% were in S and G2phases of the cell cycle. An extra G1 peak (referred to as supra-G1; Fig. 3, *G1), revealing an increase in PI fluorescence intensity, was reproducibly evident at 72 h after protoplast preparation (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, cycling tobacco cells showed monophasic G1 (see Fig.4 C), suggesting that the occurrence of a supra-G1 peak is unique to differentiated cells re-entering the cell cycle. When protoplasts, however, were incubated for a longer duration (96 h), almost no original G1 nuclei were apparent; the majority of nuclei shifted to the supra-G1 position (Fig. 3 E). This pattern suggests that the supra-G1 peak represents a stage at which nuclei are competent to re-enter S phase, and, therefore, may be equivalent to G1 nuclei of cycling cells. To examine this possibility, we established a cell suspension culture of N. tabacum (cycling cells) and compared the FACS histograms of nuclei prepared from this culture with that of N. tabacumprotoplasts. Fig. 4 shows that G1 nuclei of cycling cells had a higher fluorescence intensity than nuclei of t-0 protoplasts (Fig. 4, compare A with C), coinciding with the position of the supra-G1 nuclei (Fig. 4, compareB with C). Each population of nuclei retained its position in the histogram after mixing (data not shown). These results indicate that the supra-G1 peak represents chromatin relaxation rather than increased DNA content. This conclusion is strengthened by the finding that treatment of protoplasts with HU (a blocker of DNA replication) resulted in accumulation of both G1 and supra-G1 nuclei (Fig.5 A, G1 and *G1), and by the absence of BrdUrd labeling from supra-G1 nuclei (Fig. 5,B and C). These results verify that the increased fluorescence intensity of PI-stained nuclei (supra-G1) prior to entry of cells into S phase resulted from chromatin decondensation, apparently an essential event for replication factors to approach and be assembled onto origins to initiate DNA replication.Figure 3Protoplasts approaching S phase display a second phase chromatin decondensation. Protoplasts were induced to re-enter the cell cycle by auxin and cytokinin. At the indicated time points after hormonal induction (t-0 to t-96), nuclei were isolated, and progression of protoplasts into S phase was monitored by FACS analysis (A-E). The appearance of protoplasts is shown (right panels, size bars = 20 μm); cell division patterns are seen at 72 and 96 h. Note the additional G1 peak designated supra-G1 (*G1) at D, a characteristic feature of protoplasts re-entering the cell cycle. To compare changes in fluorescence intensity in both G1 and G2nuclei, we changed the amplifier gains for FL-2 to put the G1 peak at about channel 360.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Supra-G1 nuclei converge with the G1 nuclei of cycling cells.

Durr A. Parmentier Y. Criqui M.C. Fleck J. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 29: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of the ubiquitin pathway in dedifferentiation, we tested the progression of protoplasts into S phase in the presence of MG132, a specific inhibitor of the ubiquitin proteasome system. MG132 had no effect on the occurrence of the first phase chromatin decondensation (data not shown). Freshly prepared protoplasts induced to re-enter the cell cycle were incubated with MG132 at various time points (0, 24, and 48 h), and their progression into S phase was monitored by FACS 72 h after preparation. Addition of MG132 at times 0 and 24 h completely abolished progression of protoplasts into S phase (Fig.6, A and B). When MG132 was added after 48 h (the time at which about 10% of the protoplasts approached S phase (see Fig. 3 C)), the FACS histogram showed two peaks corresponding to G1 and G2 content of DNA; no or very small amount of S phase protoplasts could be detected (Fig. 6 C). Notably, treatment of protoplasts with MG132 diminished the supra-G1 peak (Fig. 6, compare C with E). In contrast, the protease inhibitor leupeptin, used as a control in these experiments, enhanced protoplast progression into S phase (Fig. 6 D). These findings demonstrate the indispensability of the ubiquitin proteolytic system for the second phase chromatin decondensation and for protoplasts entry into S phase; progression from S to G2 phase is proteasome-independent. Consistent with the requirement for the proteasome system, Skp1 mRNA, a component of the cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCF), is absent in leaves, but its level is markedly increased in protoplasts progressing into S phase (Fig. 6 F). The results presented here demonstrate that chromatin decondensation is an integral part in cellular dedifferentiation. Tobacco mesophyll cells re-entering the cell cycle displayed two successive phases of increased PI fluorescence intensity of nuclei prior to reactivation of S phase. These phases reflect increased accessibility of DNA to PI conferred by chromatin relaxation rather than DNA synthesis. The first phase (transition from G0 to G1), which occurs in the course of protoplast isolation, is ubiquitin-independent and does not require exogenous application of auxin and cytokinin. The second phase (transition from G1to supra-G1) is auxin/cytokinin-dependent and occurs just before entry of cells into S phase. In agreement with these findings, an extra G1 peak, not attributed to DNA synthesis but rather to conformational changes in chromatin, has been recorded by FACS in dedifferentiating red blood cells of frog (13Chiabrera A. Hinsenkamp M. Pilla A.A. Ryaby J. Ponta D. Belmont A. Beltrame F. Grattarola M. Nicolini C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1979; 27: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also, two phases of chromatin decondensation, prior to reactivation of DNA synthesis, were found in chicken erythrocyte nuclei incubated inXenopus egg extract (17Blank T. Trendelenburg M. Kleinschmidt J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying chromatin remodeling of somatic nuclei transplanted into Xenopus egg extract has recently been shown to require the activity of the chromatin-remodeling nucleosomal adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) ISWI (19Kikyo N. Wade P.A. Guschin D. Ge H. Wolffe A.P. Science. 2000; 289: 2360-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), a member of the SWI2/SNF2 superfamily. The ISWI is a subunit of several distinct nucleosome remodeling complexes that increase the accessibility of DNA in chromatin (20Varga-Weisz P.D. Becker P.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that chromatin decondensation is a common mechanism underlying cellular dedifferentiation both in plants and animals. We propose that the first phase of chromatin decondensation represents a transitory phase that is necessary for activation of genes whose products are required for the establishment of competence for cell fate switch (Fig.7). The ensuing cell fate determination may be governed by growth factors and environmental signals. In plant cells, auxin and cytokinin induce dedifferentiation and re-entry into the cell cycle, auxin by itself may induce redifferentiation (21Vissenberg K. Quelo A-H. van Gestel K. Olyslaegers G. Verbelen J-P. Cell Biol. Int. 2000; 24: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas in the absence of phytohormones, cells die. The occurrence of the supra-G1 peak appears to be a unique feature of differentiated cells re-entering the cell cycle not found in cycling cells. The accumulation of protoplasts at the supra-G1, just before entry into S phase, indicates that the transition rate from G1 to supra-G1 is faster than from supra-G1 to S phase. This progression pattern may mark a check-point control known as the restriction point in animals or START in yeast, a point of commitment to the mitotic cell cycle (22Zetterberg A. Larsson O. Wiman K.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The stepwise manner by which chromatin decondensation occurs points to various levels of heterochromatin compaction, i.e.heterochromatin may not be a homogeneous but rather a heterogeneous structure displaying different degrees of chromatin condensation. This assumption is supported by recent findings demonstrating variations in chromatin (de)condensation within heterochromatin segments in meiotic chromosomes of Arabidopsis (23Fransz P.F Armstrong S. de Jong J.H. Parnell L.D. van Drunen C. Dean C. Zabel P. Bisseling T. Jones G.H. Cell. 2000; 100: 367-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We propose that the first phase of chromatin decondensation occurs in a less condensed heterochromatin, often called facultative heterochromatin, which is likely to be located at the boundary region between eu- and heterochromatin. This border chromatin might have an important biological significance in cellular plasticity, i.e. the interplay between differentiation, proliferation, and cell death. The role played by the ubiquitin system in regulating cell cycle progression has been well documented in animals (10Peters J-M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Krek W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and recently described also in plants (24Genschik P. Criqui M.C. Parmentier Y. Derevier A. Fleck J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 2063-2076PubMed Google Scholar). By using a specific inhibitor to the proteasome system we demonstrated its role in driving protoplasts into S phase. The fact that treatment of protoplasts with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 eliminated the supra-G1 and, consequently, entry into S phase supports the notion that DNA decondensation is essential for reactivation of DNA synthesis (25Hanks S.K. Rao P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results suggest that the activity of the ubiquitin proteolytic system plays a role, either directly or indirectly, in DNA relaxation, thereby enabling the assembly of replication proteins onto origins to initiate DNA replication. It is long standing that auxin and cytokinin are required to induce cell division in plant tissue culture (26Skoog F. Miller C.O. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1957; 11: 118-131PubMed Google Scholar) and are indispensable for the progression of protoplasts into S phase (3Galun E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 237-266Crossref Google Scholar, 4Trehin C. Planchais S. Glab N. Perennes C. Tregear J. Bergounioux C. Planta. 1998; 206: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Carle S.A. Bates G.W. Shannon T.A. J. Plant Growth Regul. 1998; 17: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Auxin and cytokinin presumably evoke signaling pathway(s) leading to a commitment for the mitotic cell cycle and reactivation of DNA replication (4Trehin C. Planchais S. Glab N. Perennes C. Tregear J. Bergounioux C. Planta. 1998; 206: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Meskiene I. Hirt H. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 791-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Riou-Khamlichi C. Huntley R. Jacqmard A. Murray J.A. Science. 1999; 283: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Notably, several mutations that confer resistance to auxin were found to encode components of the cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase complex SCF (12Gray W.M. Estelle M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 133-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) required for G1-S transition (10Peters J-M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Krek W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This implies that auxin exerts its effect, at least in part, by inducing an orderly regulated protein destruction via the ubiquitin proteasome system. Given that the ubiquitin proteolytic system is required for redifferentiation of Zinnia mesophyll cells into tracheary elements (29Woffenden B.J. Freeman T.B. Beers E.P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we suggest that the ubiquitin proteolytic system is not only involved in cell cycle progression but also in regulating cell fate determination.

Whole body energy expenditure was determined from the turnover of doubly labeled body water. Coupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle was evaluated from measurements of rates of ATP synthesis (using 31P NMR magnetization transfer experiments) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux (calculated from the time course of 13C enrichment in C-4 and C-2 of glutamate during an infusion of [2-13C]acetate). At the whole body level, we observed no change in energy expenditure. However, at the cellular level, skeletal muscle UCP3KO increased the rate of ATP synthesis from Pi more than 4-fold under fasting conditions (wild type, 2.2 ± 0.6versus knockout, 9.1 ± 1.4 μmol/g of muscle/min,p < 0.001) with no change in TCA cycle flux rate (wild type, 0.74 ± 0.04 versus knockout, 0.71 ± 0.03 μmol/g of muscle/min). The increased efficiency of ATP production may account for the significant (p < 0.05) increase in the ratio of ATP to ADP in the muscle of UCP3KO mice (5.9 ± 0.3) compared with controls (4.5 ± 0.4).

These mice showed no differences in body composition, growth characteristics, exercise tolerance, fatty acid oxidation, or cold-induced thermogenesis. The clearest evidence to date that UCP3 might have the capacity to act as an uncoupling protein comes from measurements in isolated mitochondria. These studies established for the first time that oxidative ATP production in mitochondria isolated from the muscle of UCP3KO mice were more coupled compared with normal littermates (3Vidal-Puig A.J.

Conversely, overexpression of UCP3 in muscle uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria (7Clapham J.C. Arch J.R.S. Chapman H. Haynes A. Lister C. Moore G.B. Piercy V. Carter S.A.

However, because these studies were performed in vitro under artificial concentrations of ADP and substrates, it is difficult to extrapolate these results to describe the physiologic function of UCP3.To determine whether the lack of UCP3 in muscle causes changes in the coupling of skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylationin vivo, we performed NMR saturation-transfer experiments to estimate rates of muscle ATP synthesis and isotopic labeling experiments to estimate rates of TCA cycle flux. In addition, we used the doubly labeled water method to determine total energy expenditure over days in the free moving mice (8Wolfe R.R. Radioactive and Stable Isotope Tracers in Biomedicine: Principles and Practice of Kinetic Analysis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1992: 207-233Google Scholar). The ratio of ATP synthesis rates and TCA cycle flux rates provides an index of mitochondrial couplingin vivo (9Jucker B.M. Dufour S. Ren J. Cao X. Previs S.F. Underhill B. Cadman K.S. Shulman G.I.

Deletion of UCP3 in muscle may result in any one or a combination of several potential physiological perturbations. If UCP3 ablation increases the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production, then ATP concentration could be maintained constant by a corresponding reduction in TCA cycle flux rate. However, if TCA cycle flux rate remains unchanged, then ATP production rates should increase, which must then be matched by an increase in ATP turnover. Finally, if UCP3 has no uncoupling functionin vivo, then neither ATP synthesis nor TCA cycle flux rate would be affected. We show here that deletion of muscle UPC3 does result in significant perturbations of mitochondrial energy productionin vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsAge- and weight-matched wild-type and UCP3KO mice were studied at 5–7 months of age. The generation of UCP3KO mice has been described previously (3Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D. Zhang C.-Y. Hagen T. Boss O. Ido Y. Szczepanik A. Wade J. Mootha V. Cortright R. Muoio D.M. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16258-16266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Animals were housed four per cage in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum unless noted otherwise. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocol was approved the Yale Animal Care and Use Committee.Doubly Labeled Water Method for Measurement of Whole Body Metabolic RateDosage and SamplingMice were injected intraperitoneally at 8 a.m. with a solution of D218O (15 μl/g of mouse, 80% D2O, and 20% H218O, 150 mm sodium chloride). Tail tip bleeds were taken at 24-h intervals over the course of a week.Analysis for Deuterium EnrichmentThe deuterium atom percent enrichment of plasma water was determined by reacting 10 μl of the plasma with calcium carbide to form acetylene gas and analyzed by GC-MS (electron impact ionization) (11Previs S.F. Hazey J.W. Diraison F. Beylot M. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A small amount (10–15 mg) of freshly ground calcium carbide was added to a dry crimp-top vial and capped with a rubber septum. The plasma sample was injected into the vial through the septum and allowed to react for 5 to 15 min. A 5-μl sample of the gas phase within the vial was drawn into a Hamilton glass syringe and injected into the GC-MS. The GC temperature was isothermal at 180 °C, and ions m/z 26 and 27 were selectively monitored.Analysis for Deuterium and 18O EnrichmentDeuterium and 18O isotopic enrichment of plasma water was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Metabolic Solutions, Inc., Nashua, NH) and are expressed as δV-SMOW (i.e. the difference from Vienna-standard mean ocean water). There was no difference in the kinetics of deuterium water turnover as determined by either method.CalculationsTotal energy expenditure was determined from the difference in the rates of loss of the deuterium and18O isotopes following a bolus injection of doubly labeled water (i.e. D2O/H218O). Deuterium is lost as water, whereas 18O is lost either as water or as C18O2, and the difference in the rates of isotopic loss (ko = rate of loss of18O; kh = rate of loss of deuterium) will be the rate of CO2 output, which is proportional to whole body metabolic rate (8Wolfe R.R. Radioactive and Stable Isotope Tracers in Biomedicine: Principles and Practice of Kinetic Analysis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1992: 207-233Google Scholar).The rate of CO2 loss, rCO2, was calculated asrCO2=0.4554×N1.01ko−1.04khEquation 1 where N is total body water calculated as the mean of the corrected isotope dilution spaces of D2O and H218O at the time of the bolus injection.Total energy expenditure (TEE) was calculated asTEE(kcal/day)=3.9rCO2/RQ+1.11rCO2Equation 2 Because it has previously been shown that there were no changes in the respiratory exchange quotient (RQ) as the result of UCP3 disruption in either the fed or fasted states (3Vidal-Puig A.J.

The mean RQ of 0.79 may tend to overestimate the proportion of fat to carbohydrate metabolized over the 7-day period that total energy expenditure was estimated but will not mask any differences in total energy expenditure between the groups.ATP Flux Rates in Skeletal Muscle in VivoAll in vivo NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) Biospec 7.0T system (horizontal/22-cm-diameter bore magnet). 31P NMR measurement of ATP flux was measured at 121.66 MHz using a 1-cm diameter inner coil (for 31P) and a 3-cm outer coil tuned to the proton frequency for scout imaging and shimming.On the day of the NMR experiment, overnight-fasted mice were secured in a Plexiglas tube restrainer that allowed the right hind limb to be secured to the outside of the tube and centered over concentric surface coils. The mouse and probe assembly were then placed in the magnet isocenter.Unidirectional rates of ATP synthesis from Pi are the product of the rate constant of ATP synthesis and the concentration of intracellular Pi. The unidirectional rate constant for ATP synthesis from Pi was measured using the saturation-transfer experiment (9Jucker B.M. Dufour S. Ren J. Cao X. Previs S.F. Underhill B. Cadman K.S. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 10Jucker B.M. Ren J. Dufour S. Cao X. Previs S.F. Cadman K.S. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39279-39286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The steady-state Pimagnetization, Mz, was measured with selective irradiation of the γ-ATP resonance, and compared with the equilibrium Pi magnetization, Mo, with the selective irradiation placed symmetrically down field from the Pifrequency. T1*, the spin lattice relaxation time for Pi when ATP is saturated, was measured using a modified version of the inversion recovery experiment (180°-τ-90°-acquire-ID) in the presence of a steady-state saturation of γATP during the interpulse delay (ID) of 4 s and during the variable delay, τ.Pi concentration was calculated from the ratio of integrated peak intensities (T1 corrected) of Pi and β-ATP. The concentration of ATP was determined by HPLC as described below.TCA Cycle Flux Rates in Skeletal MuscleIsotopic Measurement of TCA Cycle Flux RatesThe mice were studied 4 days after a catheter was surgically implanted into their jugular veins. Following an overnight fast, the mice were placed in tube restrainers, and an infusion of [2-13C]acetate at a rate of 4 μg/g of mouse/min was begun. Blood samples for determination of acetate concentration and isotopic enrichment were obtained immediately prior to the end of the experiment by tail tip bleeds. TCA cycle flux was calculated from the time course of13C enrichment in glutamate from perchloric acid extracts of freeze-clamped muscle sacrificed at a various times after the start of the [2-13C]acetate infusion. At the end of the infusion period (variable from 2 to 90 min), the mice (controls,n = 12, UCP3KO, n = 12) were sacrificed and the muscles freeze-clamped in situ for the determination of glutamate concentration and 13C enrichment.Analysis of [2-13C]Acetate and [13C]GlutamatePlasma acetate concentration and13C isotopic enrichment were determined by GC-MS as described in detail elsewhere (12Powers L. Osborn M.K. Yang D. Lien C.L. Murray R.D. Beylot M. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 30: 747-754Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of plasma was spiked with an equal volume of an internal concentration standard containing 50 μm sodium acetic-d3 acid. To this solution was then added 50 μl of 0.1 m HCl and ∼50 mg of solid NaCl. The acetate was then coupled to 2,4-difluoroaniline (100 μl of reagent, 0.2 m in hexane) using 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (100 μl of reagent, 0.2 m in toluene). The solution was capped and mixed for 1 h. After 1 h, 1 ml of 1 m sodium bicarbonate was added, and the acetyl-2,4-difluoroanilide was extracted (3×) into ethyl acetate (1 ml). The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under a stream of dry nitrogen gas for GC-MS analysis. 13C and d3 isotopic enrichments were corrected using standard curves at similar concentrations and processed as described above for the plasma samples. Analysis of the d3-acetate internal standard yielded a background acetate concentration of 8.0 ± 0.04 nm in the blank, which was less than 8% of the measured plasma acetate concentration. The plasma concentrations given are corrected for the acetate concentration in the blank.Analyses were carried out using a Hewlett-Packard (H-P) 5973MSD interfaced to an H-P 6890 gas chromatograph. The samples were then analyzed using electron ionization at 70 eV by monitoring ionsm/z 171, 172, and 174.Glutamate concentration and 13C enrichment in the muscle were determined as follows. 100–200 mg of muscle was weighed, homogenized in ice-cold perchloric acid (0.9 m), and neutralized with KOH. Glutamate concentration was measured in a 10-μl aliquot with a 2700 STAT Plus analyzer (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH) using a glutamate ion-specific electrode. The enrichment of glutamate at C-2, C-3, and C-4 was determined following purification from any glutamine by anion exchange chromatography as follows. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to ∼8, and the sample applied to a 1-ml mini-column of anion exchange resin (AG1-X8, Bio-Rad) in a pasture pipette. Glutamine was eluted with 5 ml of water, and glutamate was then eluted with 5 ml of acetic acid (0.5 m). The glutamate fraction was freeze-dried and reconstituted in 400 μl of D20 for analysis of concentration and enrichment. The relative enrichment at each carbon position was determined by13C-NMR spectroscopy and total enrichment by GC-MS (CI ionization with isobutane) as its trifluoroacetyln-butyl ester derivative (m/z 356, 357, 358) (13Leimer K.R. Rice R.H. Gehrke C.W. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 141: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Calculation of TCA Cycle Flux RatesRates of TCA cycle flux were calculated from the time course of 13C isotopic enrichment of plasma acetate and muscle glutamate C-2 and C-4 by iterative fitting of metabolic simulations to the data using the program Cwave (15Mason G.F. ISMRM Proc. 2000; 3: 1870Google Scholar). Mass and isotope balance equations were derived using the model of TCA cycle as shown in Scheme FS1. The isotopic enrichment and concentrations of plasma acetate, glucose, and free fatty acids are used as input drivers. Using these input parameters, flux rates are determined that provide the best fit to the observed time course of enrichment in [2-13C]- and [4-13C]glutamate.The mass balance equations used were as follows.dAcCoA/dt=Vac+Vdil−VTCAEquation 3 dOAA/dt=Vpc−Voaa Equation 4 dCit/dt=dαKG/dt=dGlu/dt=0Equation 5 The isotope balance equations used were as follows,\beginalignedd2−13CAcCoA/dt=&VacFE2−13CAc+Vdil(FE ffagluc )−VTCAFE2−13CAcCoAEquation 6 d4−13CCit/dt=VTCAFE2−13CAcCoA−VTCAFE4−13CCitEquation 7 \beginalignedd4−3CαKG/dt &=VgluFE4−13CGlu+VTCAFE4−3CCit−VTCAFE4−13CαKG−VgluFE4−13CαKGEquation 8 d4−11CGlu/dt=Vglu FE4−−3CαKG−Vglu FE4−13CGluEquation 9 \beginalignedd2−13COAA/dt &=0.5*VTCAFE4−13CαKG+0.5*VTCAFE2−13CαKG+VpeFE2−13CPyr−VTCAFE2−13ClOAAd2−13CCit/dt=VTCAFE2−−3COAA−VTCAFE2−13CCitEquation 11 \beginalignedd2−13CαKG/dt=Vglu FE2−13CGlu+VTCA FE2−13CCit−VTCAFE2−13CαKGVglu −FE2−13CαKGEquation 12 d2−13CGlu/dt=Vglu FE2−13CαKG−Vglu FE2−13CGluEquation 13 where FE is the fractional enrichment calculated as the quotient of the mass of 13C-labeled molecules and the total mass of labeled and unlabeled molecules.

Muscles were freeze-clamped in situ and then extracted with 0.9n ice-cold perchloric acid. The concentrations of nucleotides in the supernatant were then determined by HPLC using a modification of the method described by Sabina et al.(14Sabina R.L. Kernstine K.H. Boyd R.L. Holmes E.W. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10178-10183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP, ADP, and AMP in a 20-μl sample of the muscle extract were separated on a Supelcosil SAX1 (25 cm × 4.6 mm × 0.5 μm) column using a gradient of 5 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 2.8 (buffer A) and 750 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.9 (buffer B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A linear gradient was developed over 14 min at 0% buffer B to 9% buffer B, then from 14 to 32 min from 9% buffer B to 100% buffer B. A Rainin HPXL solvent delivery system (two pumps) with a Rainin Dynamax UV-1 absorbance detector (254 nm) controlled by Rainin Dynamax HPLC Method Manager was used for solvent programming and data collection. Peak identification was assigned by comparison of retention times to known external standards (AMP ∼ 5.5 min, ADP ∼ 25.7 min, ATP ∼ 29.0 min). Nucleotide concentrations were calculated from the concentration standard curves of absorbance for the external standards. Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1)1 has been shown to regulate non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue by allowing proton flux across the inner mitochondrial membrane to bypass ATP synthase (1Lin C.S.

These mice showed no differences in body composition, growth characteristics, exercise tolerance, fatty acid oxidation, or cold-induced thermogenesis. The clearest evidence to date that UCP3 might have the capacity to act as an uncoupling protein comes from measurements in isolated mitochondria. These studies established for the first time that oxidative ATP production in mitochondria isolated from the muscle of UCP3KO mice were more coupled compared with normal littermates (3Vidal-Puig A.J.

Conversely, overexpression of UCP3 in muscle uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria (7Clapham J.C. Arch J.R.S. Chapman H. Haynes A. Lister C. Moore G.B. Piercy V. Carter S.A.

However, because these studies were performed in vitro under artificial concentrations of ADP and substrates, it is difficult to extrapolate these results to describe the physiologic function of UCP3. To determine whether the lack of UCP3 in muscle causes changes in the coupling of skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylationin vivo, we performed NMR saturation-transfer experiments to estimate rates of muscle ATP synthesis and isotopic labeling experiments to estimate rates of TCA cycle flux. In addition, we used the doubly labeled water method to determine total energy expenditure over days in the free moving mice (8Wolfe R.R. Radioactive and Stable Isotope Tracers in Biomedicine: Principles and Practice of Kinetic Analysis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1992: 207-233Google Scholar). The ratio of ATP synthesis rates and TCA cycle flux rates provides an index of mitochondrial couplingin vivo (9Jucker B.M. Dufour S. Ren J. Cao X. Previs S.F. Underhill B. Cadman K.S. Shulman G.I.

Deletion of UCP3 in muscle may result in any one or a combination of several potential physiological perturbations. If UCP3 ablation increases the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production, then ATP concentration could be maintained constant by a corresponding reduction in TCA cycle flux rate. However, if TCA cycle flux rate remains unchanged, then ATP production rates should increase, which must then be matched by an increase in ATP turnover. Finally, if UCP3 has no uncoupling functionin vivo, then neither ATP synthesis nor TCA cycle flux rate would be affected. We show here that deletion of muscle UPC3 does result in significant perturbations of mitochondrial energy productionin vivo.

Eosinophils and basophils are major potential sources of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTs)1 (LTC4 and its extracellular derivatives, LTD4 and LTE4), products of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway of arachidonic metabolism (4Weller P.F. Smith J.H. Cook R.M. Immunopharmacology of Eosinophils: The Handbook of Immunopharmacology. Academic Press, London1993: 25-42Google Scholar). Cysteinyl LTs, as paracrine mediators, cause bronchoconstriction, mucous hypersecretion, increased microvascular permeability, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophil infiltration (5Lewis R.A.

Eosinophils and basophils contain the single LTC4-synthesizing enzyme, LTC4 synthase, and eosinophils are the predominant cellular source of this enzyme among resident and recruited cells in the bronchial tissues of asthmatics (9Cowburn A.S.

In all cells, the highly regulated generation of LTs is dependent on activation of specific phospholipases and LT-synthesizing enzymes and involves small molecules (e.g. Ca2+) and activation-dependent redistribution of 5-LO to specific membranous compartments within cells (11Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S36-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One major candidate mechanism potentially involved in regulating LT formation is the translocation of 5-LO to the nuclear envelope (10Cowburn A.S. Holgate S.T. Sampson A.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 456-465PubMed Google Scholar,11Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Although mechanisms that activate specific leukocytes to generate LTs currently focus on the perinuclear envelope as the site of regulated LT formation (11Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S36-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), eosinophils and other leukocytes associated with inflammatory reactions in vivocharacteristically contain increased numbers of extranuclear lipid-rich domains in the form of cytoplasmic lipid bodies (13Weller P.F. Dvorak A.M. Busse W.W. Holgate S.T. Asthma and Rhinitis. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston2000: 351-372Google Scholar). These enigmatic organelles, often overlooked if their defining lipid content is lost during cell staining, have long been noted to be prominent in many cell types associated with inflammation (14Robinson J.M. Karnovsky M.L. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 842-933Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Coimbra A. Lopes-Vaz A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1971; 19: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although lipid bodies lack a delimiting membrane, their lipid content overlies a poorly understood honeycomb membranous matrix (16Bozza P.T., Yu, W. Penrose J.F. Morgan E.S. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Neither the genesis nor function of these organelles is well defined. Although eicosanoid-forming enzymes have been localized to lipid bodies, including 5-LO and LTC4 synthase in eosinophil lipid bodies (16Bozza P.T., Yu, W. Penrose J.F. Morgan E.S. Dvorak A.M.

Both C-C chemokines, eotaxin and RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), signaling via CCR3 receptors expressed on eosinophils (18Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P.D. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and basophils (19Uguccioni M. Mackay C.R. Ochensberger B. Loetscher P Rhis S. LaRossa G.J. Rao P. Ponath P.D. Baggiolini M. Dahinden C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), are active in recruiting these leukocytes to sites of allergic inflammation (20Rothenberg M.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Since other chemoattractants can enhance LT formation (21Bates M.E. Green V.L. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10968-10975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we investigated the intracellular pathways by which these chemokines may activate leukocytes to enhance their regulated formation of cysteinyl LTs. Notably, chemokine engagement of CCR3 receptors initiated G protein-linked downstream signaling involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and p38, to induce the formation of new lipid body organelles and to enhance eosinophil LTC4release. Moreover, these cytokines elicited and promoted LTC4 formation via PI3K and MAP kinase signaling not at the perinuclear envelope but rather specifically at these extranuclear lipid body domains. Peripheral blood was obtained with informed consent from 12 normal donors, and eosinophils were isolated as described (22Bandeira-Melo C. Gillard G. Ghiran I. Weller P.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 244: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, after anticoagulated blood was mixed with 6% dextran-saline (MacGaw, Irvine, CA) to facilitate erythrocyte sedimentation, the leukocyte-enriched plasma was overlaid onto Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and centrifuged at 250 × g for 20 min. Granulocyte-enriched cell pellets and mononuclear cell-enriched layers were collected, washed at 4 °C with calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS−/−), and depleted of erythrocytes by hypotonic saline lysis. Eosinophils and basophils were negatively selected using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) with anti-CD16 plus anti-CD3 or a mixture of immunomagnetic beads, respectively. The viability of freshly isolated cells was >95% (by trypan blue exclusion), eosinophil purity was >99% (by HEMA3 ® staining, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and basophil purity was 75–85%. Purified cell suspensions were adjusted to 1 × 106 or 15 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS−/− containing 0.1% endotoxin-free ovalbumin or RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fatty acid free-human albumin (Sigma) for use in fluid- or gel-phase assays, respectively. Eosinophil or basophil suspensions (106/ml) were incubated (37 °C) with eotaxin (1–100 ng/ml), RANTES (1–100 ng/ml), IL-8 (500 ng/ml) (R&D Systems), PAF (1 μm) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), or medium alone for 1 h in HBSS−/− and then cytocentrifuged (500 rpm, 5 min) onto glass slides. For inhibitor studies, cells were pre-treated for 30 min with anti-CCR3 mAb (clone 61828.111; R&D Systems) or isotype control rat IgG2a at 10 μg/ml (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) (Calbiochem), the PAF receptor antagonist CV6209 (10 μm), the 5-LO inhibitor AA861 (10 μm), the 5-LO activating protein inhibitor MK886 (10 μm), the PKC inhibitors chelerythrine (10 μm) and calphostin C (1 μm), the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (1 μm) and LY294002 (10 μm), the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin (10 μm) and genistein (10 μm), or the MAP kinase inhibitors PD98059, U0126, and SB203580 (each 10 μm) (Biomol, Plymouth, PA), or their vehicles, as indicated. Stock solutions of stimuli and inhibitors were prepared in HBSS−/− containing 0.1% endotoxin-free ovalbumin, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. AA861, MK886, calphostin C, herbimycin, genistein, PD98059, U0126, SB203580, and A23187 were diluted in Me2SO. The final Me2SO concentration was <0.01% and had no effect on eosinophils. Cytospin slides, while still moist, were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in HBSS−/−, rinsed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), stained in 1.5% OsO4 (30 min), rinsed in distilled H2O, immersed in 1% thiocarbohydrazide (5 min), rinsed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, restained with 1.5% OsO4 (3 min), and then dried and mounted (23Bozza P.T. Payne J.L. Goulet J.L. Weller P.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Lipid bodies were enumerated by light microscopy with a 100× objective lens in 50 consecutively scanned cells. After samples were taken for lipid body enumeration, cell suspensions (106/ml) were washed in HBSS−/−, resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS containing calcium and magnesium, and then stimulated with 0.1 μmA23187 (Sigma) for 15 min (37 °C). Reactions were stopped on ice, cell suspensions were centrifuged (500 × g for 10 min; 4 °C), and supernatants were assayed for LTC4 by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (sensitivity < 7.8 pg/ml) (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Basophil suspensions (106/ml) were incubated (37 °C) with eotaxin (100 ng/ml) for 1 h and then cytocentrifuged (500 rpm, 5 min) onto glass slides. Cytospin preparations were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. After three 10-min washes with 0.05% saponin (Sigma) and 1% human serum (Pierce) in HBSS, slides were incubated for 30 min with 200 μl of polyclonal antiserum anti-5-LO (1:100 dilution) (Cayman) or with the isotype-matched rabbit IgG control. After washes with HBSS containing 0.05% saponin and 1% goat serum, slides were incubated for 30 min with Alexa546-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:100 dilution) (Molecular Probes), washed with 0.1% saponin, washed with HBSS, and an aqueous mounting medium (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) was applied to each slide before coverslip attachment. Slides were viewed with a 100× objective by both phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy using the Eclipse TE300 Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) fluorescence microscope. Electronic photography was performed by spot cooled color digital camera (model 1.3.0; Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) in conjunction with the image editing program Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). To immunolocalize LTC4 at its formation sites within eosinophils, viable eosinophils were embedded in an agarose matrix enabling their morphology and generated products to be microscopically localized (22Bandeira-Melo C. Gillard G. Ghiran I. Weller P.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 244: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With modifications of prior techniques (24Ogawa H. Kassell N.G. Sasaki T. Hongo K.

Hyg. 1992; 46: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), water-soluble 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) (Sigma) was used to cross-link eicosanoid carboxyl groups to amines in adjacent proteins. Briefly, to prepare the agarose matrix, 2.5% agarose (24 °C gelling point) (Promega, Madison, WI) in sterile distilled H2O was melted at 70 °C; and while liquid at 37 °C, 9 volumes of agarose were mixed with 1 volume of 10× concentrated RPMI 1640 medium. One volume of this medium-supplemented agarose was mixed at 37 °C with 3 volumes of eosinophils at 15 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fatty acid free-human albumin and 1 volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fatty acid free-albumin. As indicated, potential agonists, eotaxin (100 ng/ml), RANTES (100 ng/ml), or IL-8 (500 ng/ml), were added in 0.1 volumes to agarose/eosinophil mixtures. Immediately thereafter, 20-μl samples were gently spread onto microscope slides and covered with CoverWell™ chambers (Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR). Each slide was overlaid with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% albumin and an identical concentration of the stimulus present in the agarose/eosinophil mixture. Slides were incubated (37 °C, humidified 5% CO2) for 1 h. Overlying medium was removed and replaced with RPMI 1640, 1% albumin medium with or without 0.1 μmA23187, and incubated for 15 min (37 °C; 5% CO2). Incubations were stopped by removing the chambers and fixing and permeabilizing the cells with 0.5% EDAC in HBSS for 30 min. In control experiments, eosinophils were alternatively fixed with paraformaldehyde (2%, 5 min) with and without 0.1% saponin permeabilization. After three washes (5 min each) with HBSS, the Alexa488-labeled rat anti-cysteinyl LT detection mAb (clone 6E7; Sigma) (Alexa™488 protein labeling using a kit from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added (400 μl of 10 μg/ml) for 1 h. Slides were washed with HBSS, and an aqueous mounting medium (Polysciences) was applied to each slide before coverslip attachment. Slides were viewed by both phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy, and photography and image analysis were performed as above. Two hundred eosinophils were scored, and the percentages of those exhibiting green staining for intracellular immunoreactive LTC4 were calculated. As a specificity control for the immunolocalization of LTC4, Alexa488-labeled rat IgG1 (Sigma) was routinely included as a nonimmune isotype control for the anti-cysteinyl LT detection antibody. In addition, four other control conditions were evaluated: (i) substituting paraformaldehyde fixation with and without saponin permeabilization for the EDAC cross-linking and fixation step; (ii) using neutrophils rather than eosinophils embedded in the gel-matrix; (iii) pre-treating eosinophils in suspension for 30 min with the 5-LO activating protein inhibitor MK886 (10 μm) prior to chemokine stimulation, and (iv) pre-treating eosinophils with PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (1 μm), for 30 min prior to chemokine stimulation. To monitor changes in cell morphology, eosinophils were embedded in the agarose matrix, as described above, with or without chemokines. Following incubation of 1 h, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (5 min) and stained with OsO4 as described above. To obtain a measure of polarized redistribution of lipid bodies, cells were divided approximately into two halves, one of which contained the nucleus. Lipid bodies were enumerated in the two halves, and those cells found to have >75% of their lipid bodies in the nuclear half of the cell were scored as exhibiting polarized lipid body distribution. In four experiments, 25–50 cells were analyzed. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were done by analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls Student's test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Correlation coefficients were determined by linear regression with significance (F test) atp < 0.05. Resting eosinophils exhibited a spherical shape and a normal content of osmiophilic lipid bodies (9.2 ± 1.0 lipid bodies/cell, mean ± S.D., n = 12) distributed generally throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.1 A). As fully expected from prior fluid phase assays (18Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P.D. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), eotaxin (Fig. 1 B) and RANTES (Fig. 1 C), but not the C-X-C chemokine, IL-8 (Fig.1 D), elicited shape changes in eosinophils, including cytoplasmic veiling, increased polarization of their overall shape and nuclear location, and prominent cytoplasmic projections (lamellipodia and uropodia). Not anticipated by prior results, eotaxin and RANTES also elicited changes in intracellular lipid bodies within eosinophils. Both chemokines dose-dependently induced new lipid body formation (Fig. 2 A). The magnitude of lipid body induction with each C-C chemokine (at 100 ng/ml) was comparable to that with 1 μm PAF, a recognized stimulus for leukocyte lipid body formation (16Bozza P.T., Yu, W.

In contrast, IL-8 failed to elicit lipid body formation. In eotaxin- and RANTES-stimulated eosinophils, lipid bodies were located in cytoplasmic projections and especially in the perinuclear area (Fig. 1,B and D). In C-C chemokine polarized cells, many lipid bodies became aligned in groups proximate to the nuclear membrane and in the margin of the trailing uropod. Eosinophils in which >75% of lipid bodies were in the perinuclear half of the cell were 56 ± 9% with eotaxin (100 ng/ml) (p < 0.05versus unstimulated, n = 4) and 59 ± 5% with RANTES (100 ng/ml) (p < 0.05versus unstimulated, n = 3) in contrast to only 16 ± 7% with unstimulated eosinophils (mean ± S.D.,n = 4) and 19 ± 6% with IL-8 (500 ng/ml) (n = 3). Thus, eotaxin and RANTES induced both the formation of new lipid bodies and their polarized redistribution within eosinophils.Figure 2Lipid body formation (A) and priming for LTC4 production (B) by C-C chemokine-stimulated human eosinophils. Eosinophils were incubated with indicated chemokines or PAF for 1 h for induction of lipid bodies. Thereafter, eosinophils were incubated with 0.1 μmA23187 for 15 min for LTC4 production. To normalize for differences in base-line LTC4 release between different donors, results are presented as percentage of increase in the LTC4 released by A23187-stimulated cells.

Unstimulated basophils contained 3.1 ± 1.0 lipid bodies/cell (mean ± S.D., n = 4). Both eotaxin and RANTES, but not IL-8, stimulated new lipid body formation in basophils with magnitudes comparable to that with 1 μm PAF (Fig.3, A and B). The induction of lipid body formation in eosinophils and basophils by eotaxin and RANTES was mediated through the G protein-linked CCR3 chemokine receptor. Pre-treatment of eosinophils or basophils with either pertussis toxin or a blocking anti-CCR3 mAb (but not an isotype control antibody) significantly inhibited lipid body formation induced by both C-C chemokines (Table I, Fig.3 B). CCR3-initiated downstream signaling pathways active in lipid body formation included mobilization of intracellular pools of Ca2+ and PI3K and ERK 1/2 and p38 MAP kinases. Eotaxin-induced lipid body formation occurred in a Ca2+-free medium and was blocked (by 82 ± 1%;n = 3, p < 0.05) by pre-treatment with the cell permeable Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA-AM (25 μ 77), but not by its impermeable analog BAPTA free acid (8 ± 8%). Wortmannin and LY294002, the PI3K inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126, two specific inhibitors of the ERK1/2 activating kinase (MAP ERK kinase), and SB203586, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, each inhibited eotaxin-stimulated lipid body formation (Fig.4 A). Thus, eotaxin stimulated lipid body formation by CCR3-mediated, Gi protein-linked and PI3K-, ERK 1/2-, and p38 MAP kinase-mediated signaling.Table IC-C chemokine-induced lipid body formation in eosinophils is mediated via CCR3 receptor signaling, but not by endogenous PAF or 5-LO pathway derivativesConditionsLipid bodies/cellInhibition%Eotaxin (100 ng/ml)19.3 ± 1.2+ α-CCR3 mAb10 μg/ml8.2 ± 1.5*100+ Control IgG2a10 μg/ml19.7 ± 2.00+ Pertussis toxin100 ng/ml9.1 ± 2.3*97+ CV620910 μm17.9 ± 1.413+ AA86110 μm20.1 ± 1.50+ MK88610 μm18.1 ± 1.011RANTES (100 ng/ml)21.6 ± 3.0+ α-CCR3 mAb10 μg/ml9.7 ± 2.1*93+ Control IgG2a10 μg/ml19.5 ± 1.316+ Pertussis toxin100 ng/ml10.0 ± 3.0*91+ CV620910 μm20.0 ± 1.212+ AA86110 μm19.7 ± 2.014+ MK88610 μm22.4 ± 2.30PAF (1 μm)18.0 ± 3.0+ CV620910 μm7.5 ± 1.1*100+ AA86110 μm10.1 ± 2.0*86+ MK88610 μm8.2 ± 1.7*100Eosinophils, after 30-min treatment with any indicated inhibitors, were stimulated for 1 h with medium, eotaxin, RANTES, or PAF.

Both exogenous PAF (16Bozza P.T., Yu, W. Penrose J.F. Morgan E.S. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Bozza P.T. Payne J.L. Goulet J.L. Weller P.F. J. Exp.

Kita H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2982-2989PubMed Google Scholar) also signal via pertussis toxin-inhibitable G protein-linked PAF receptors to elicit lipid body formation. For PAF-induced lipid body formation, post-PAF receptor downstream signaling is obligately dependent on 5-LO activation to form 5-(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (23Bozza P.T. Payne J.L. Goulet J.L. Weller P.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We, therefore, evaluated whether CCR3 downstream signaling to form lipid bodies was mediated either by autocrine PAF formation or dependent on endogenous 5-LO activation. Concentrations of the PAF receptor antagonist CV6209, the 5-LO inhibitor AA861, and the 5-LO activating protein inhibitor MK886 that blocked PAF-induced lipid body formation in eosinophils did not inhibit lipid body formation induced by the C-C chemokines (Table I). Other downstream signaling for lipid body formation also differed for PAF- and CCR3-mediated responses. Although PAF-elicited lipid body formation is inhibitable by the protein kinase C inhibitors, chelerythrine and calphostin C (27Bozza P.T., Yu, W. Cassara J. Weller P.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Bozza P.T. Payne J.L. Morham S.G. Langenbach R. Smithies O. Weller P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11091-11096Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), these inhibitors did not block CCR3-mediated lipid body formation in eosinophils (Fig. 4 A). The tyrosine kinase inhibitors, herbimycin and genistein, inhibited neither CCR3-elicited (Fig.4 A) nor PAF-elicited (27Bozza P.T., Yu, W. Cassara J. Weller P.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 64: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) lipid body formation. Thus, the intracellular signaling pathways leading to lipid body induction differ between the PAF and CCR3 chemokine receptors, although both are G protein-linked, seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors that are expressed on eosinophils and basophils and can initiate lipid body formation. Both eotaxin and RANTES very effectively primed eosinophils for increased LTC4 release in response to a submaximal 0.1 μm concentration of calcium ionophoreA23187 (Fig. 2 B). Pre-stimulation of eosinophils for 1 h with eotaxin or RANTES, but not with IL-8, dose-dependently evoked increases in A23187-induced LTC4 production. At 100 ng/ml, eotaxin- and RANTES-pre-stimulated eosinophils released about 2.2- and 3.2-fold as much LTC4 as did eosinophils challenged with A23187 alone. The increased quantities of LTC4 generated by eosinophils primed with increasing concentrations of the C-C chemokines correlated highly with the increased numbers of elicited lipid bodies (r = 0.91 (p < 0.05) andr = 0.93 (p < 0.05), for eotaxin and RANTES, respectively) (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin and LY294002, ERK1/2 with PD98059 or U0126, and p38 with SB203580, at concentrations that inhibited eotaxin-induced lipid body formation (Fig. 4 A), also inhibited LTC4 production by eosinophils (Fig.4 B). Again, inhibitors of protein kinase C or tyrosine kinase, which did not inhibit eotaxin-induced lipid body formation (Fig. 4 A), also failed to affect the consequent LTC4 production (Fig. 4 B). Although eosinophils stimulated for 1 h with 100 ng/ml eotaxin or RANTES formed more lipid bodies, quantities of LTC4released extracellu"

However, the signal transduction pathways regulating NF-κB activation in human neutrophils in response to stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) are undefined. Since recent studies implicated activation of NF-κB as well as protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) in neutrophil apoptosis, we investigated involvement of PKCδ in the activation of NF-κB in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils. Specific inhibition of PKCδ by rottlerin prevented IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils. This regulation of NF-κB activation by PKCδ was specific only for TNFα signaling, since lipopolysaccharide- or interleukin-1β-induced NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation were not inhibited by rottlerin. In addition, we show that in human neutrophils, but not monocytes, IκBα localizes in significant amounts in the nucleus of unstimulated cells, and the amount of IκBα in the nucleus, as well as in the cytoplasm, correlates with the NF-κB DNA binding. These results suggest that in human neutrophils, the presence of IκBα in the nucleus may function as a safeguard against initiation of NF-κB dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes, and represents a distinct and novel mechanism of NF-κB regulation.

Since the knowledge that neutrophils are an important source of cytokines is relatively new, the molecular mechanisms regulating cytokine expression in these cells have only begun to be investigated (11McDonald P.P.

We have previously shown that NF-κB activity in human neutrophils consists of p50/50 homodimers and p50/65 heterodimers, and that their activation in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils is inhibited by dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug (13Vancurova I.

However, the signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation in response to neutrophil stimulation with TNFα are undefined. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that NF-κB also regulates both constitutive and TNFα-induced apoptosis in human neutrophils (14Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G. Fujihara S.

In this study, we show that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and PKCδ blocks activation of NF-κB in TNFα-stimulated human neutrophils by inhibiting degradation of IκBα. The regulation of NF-κB activation by PKCδ is specific only for TNFα signaling, since LPS- or IL-1β-induced activation of NF-κB and degradation of IκBα are not inhibited by rottlerin. In addition, we show that in human neutrophils, but not monocytes, IκBα localizes in significant amounts in the nucleus of resting unstimulated cells. The NF-κB DNA binding in the neutrophil does not correlate with nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, as is the case in most mammalian cells (21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Monoclonal mouse anti-SUMO-1 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(San Francisco, CA), and polyclonal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antibody (20-LG22) was purchased from Fitzgerald Industries International (Concord, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Arlington Heights, IL). All other reagents were molecular biology grade and were purchased from Sigma. All reagents and plasticware used throughout the experiments were pyrogen-free. Fresh blood was obtained from healthy adult human volunteers and collected in heparinized preservative-free tubes. Neutrophils and monocytes (95–98% purity) were separated under endotoxin-free conditions using Ficoll-Paque centrifugation (24Boyum A. Scand. J. Immunol. 1976; 5: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), and the neutrophils were subsequently purified by dextran sedimentation and hypotonic lysis of residual erythrocytes as described previously (6Tan N.D. Davidson D. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 38: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Purified cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% low endotoxin fetal calf serum, at a final concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C in polypropylene tubes with gentle agitation. For the inhibition experiments, the inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the cells were pretreated 15 min with either the inhibitor or with Me2SO alone, before stimulation with TNFα. The incubations were terminated by placing cells on ice and rapid centrifugation (1 min, 5,000 × g, 4 °C). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from 5 × 106 cells as described previously (13Vancurova I. Bellani I. Davidson D. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pelleted cells were resuspended in 300 μl of hypotonic buffer (buffer A: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 3 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing the following protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm levamisole, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma (P-8340), used at concentration 60 μl/5 × 106cells). After 15 min incubation on ice, 0.05 volumes of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added, the cells were vortexed (10 s) and immediately centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected, designated as cytoplasmic extracts, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The nuclear pellets were washed in 200 μl of buffer A containing the protease inhibitors, and re-centrifuged. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold nuclear buffer (NE buffer: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 0.8 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing the protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Following a 20-min incubation on ice (with occasional mixing), the samples were centrifuged (14,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants (nuclear extracts) were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce Coomassie Plus protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Contamination of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, respectively, was determined by Western analysis using LDH and SUMO-1 as specific markers. The oligonucleotide used as a probe for EMSA was a 42-base pair double-stranded construct (5′-TTGTTACAAGGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGC-3′) containing two tandemly repeated NF-κB-binding sites (underlined). Mutant oligonucleotide used for competition studies was 5′-TTGTTACAATCTCACTTTCCGCTTCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGC-3′. End labeling was accomplished by treatment with T4 kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the labeled oligonucleotide was purified on a Sephadex G-25 column, as described elsewhere (25Carter T.H. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (containing 4–6 μg of protein in 5–7 μl) were incubated (20 min at room temperature) with 5–10 fmol of radiolabeled oligonucleotide (∼70,000 cpm) in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol) supplemented with 20 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). For competition or supershift experiments, binding reactions were performed in the presence of 30m excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or 1 μg of specific polyclonal antibody, respectively, and incubated 15 min at room temperature before adding 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. The resulting complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels that had been pre-run at 100 V for 30 min in 0.5 × TBE buffer. Electrophoresis was conducted at 180 V for 2.5 h. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to Whatman DE-81 paper, dried, and exposed to autoradiographic film (Kodak BioMax MS) with intensifier screen at −80 °C. PKCδ enzymatic activity was assayed in whole cell lysates immunoprecipitated by PKCδ specific polyclonal antibody as follows. Neutrophils (5 × 106) were lysed in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor; 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm levamisole, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma (P-8340), used at concentration 60 μl/5 × 106 cells). Soluble proteins were pre-cleared by a 1-h incubation (4 °C) with 10 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose. The precleared supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of anti-PKC-δ or control anti-GR antibody (2 h, 4 °C), and immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose for an additional 1 h. The immune complexes were washed 5 times with lysis buffer and 1 time with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 20 μm ATP), and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer. Five μl of 5 × reaction buffer (1 mg/ml histone H1, 20 μm 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, and 0.25 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 8 μl of 5 × sample buffer, the samples were boiled and resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie, and the extent of histone H1 phosphorylation was determined by both autoradiography and scintillation counting of the excised Coomassie-stained histone polypeptide bands. In experiments examining the effect of rottlerin on PKCδ activity in vitro, rottlerin was added to the PKCδ immunoprecipitates in concentrations given in the text before the addition of 1 μm ATP. Denatured proteins were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked overnight with a 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk solution containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBSTM) before incubating with primary antibodies (1 h for IκBα, p65, p50, SUMO-1, and LDH antibodies, and overnight for actin antibody). Primary antibodies were diluted in TBSTM (1:250 for IκBα and actin, 1:700 for p65, 1:300 for p50, and 1:200 for LDH and SUMO-1). After washing, the membranes were incubated 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in TBSTM, and the labeled proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To confirm equivalent amounts of loaded proteins, or to re-probe the membrane with another antibody, the membranes were stripped with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mmTris-Cl (pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50 °C, and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in TBSTM. The signal was developed using secondary IgG-horseradish peroxidase and ECL detection as described above. Data presented here represent a minimum of three experiments, and, where appropriate, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by using ANOVA. To investigate whether the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation involves PLC- and PKCδ-dependent pathways, we used inhibitors of phosphatidylcholine (PC)- and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific PLC, and PKCδ: D-609 (26Schutze S.

Neutrophils were preincubated 15 min with or without the corresponding inhibitor, stimulated 30 min with TNFα, and the NF-κB DNA binding activity was measured in nuclear extracts by EMSA. As seen in Fig. 1 A, neutrophil stimulation with TNFα induced activation of the p50/65 heterodimer, and to a lower extent also the p50/50 homodimer. The specificity and identity of these complexes was confirmed using competition and supershift assay as shown in panel B. Since the NF-κB form responsible for induction of inflammatory and apoptotic genes is the p50/65 heterodimer, whereas the cellular function of the p50/50 homodimer is not fully understood (30Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar), we focused on DNA binding activity of the p50/65 NF-κB heterodimer. The p50/65 NF-κB DNA binding activity was inhibited by U-73122 (5 μm) and Et-18-OCH3 (50 μm), inhibitors of PI-PLC, and by PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin (50 μm). In contrast, inhibitor of PC-PLC, D-609 at 50 μmconcentration previously shown to be selectively effective to inhibit PC-PLC activity (26Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 31Kozawa O. Suzuki A. Kaida T. Tokuda H. Uematsu T. J. Biol.

The inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding by U-73122 was dose dependent (Fig. 2 A). The complete inhibition of p50/65 NF-κB was achieved at 5 μm U-73122 concentration, and the IC50 was ∼2 μm. This IC50 value is consistent with the previously reported IC50 for PLC specific inhibition by U-73122 in the neutrophil (27Smith R.J. Justen J.M. McNab A.R. Rosenbloom C.L. Steele A.N. Detmers P.A. Anderson D.C. Manning A.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 320-329PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang J.P. Hsu M.F. Kuo S.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 319: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The inactive structural analogue of U-73122, U-73343, in the range of 0.1–5 μmconcentrations, had no effect on NF-κB DNA binding (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows a dose response of the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin on NF-κB DNA binding in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils. The complete inhibition of the p50/65 NF-κB heterodimer was achieved by rottlerin concentrations of 50 μm, and the IC50 was ∼10 μm. These values correlate well with the previously reported rottlerin IC50 for PKCδ inhibition 3–6 μm, whereas the IC50 values for other PKC isoforms were 40–100 μm (17Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 18Reyland M.E. Anderson S.M. Matassa A.A. Barzen K.A.

Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In contrast, neutrophil pretreatment with Ro-31–8425 (100 nm), which inhibits the classical isoforms of PKC but not PKCδ (32Merritt J.E. Sullivan J.A. Tse J. Wilkinsin S.E. Nixon J.S. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), had no inhibitory effect on TNFα-induced NF-κB DNA binding even at concentration 10 times higher than the reported IC50 (data not shown). Importantly, the inhibitory effect of rottlerin on NF-κB DNA binding was specific only for TNFα induction, since LPS, as well as IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation was not inhibited by 50 μm rottlerin (Fig.3, panel A). These results demonstrate that the rottlerin effect is specific only for the TNFα signaling pathway, and indicate that the NF-κB activation in response to neutrophil stimulation with TNFα is mediated by PI-PLC and PKCδ dependent pathways. Rottlerin was originally reported to inhibit PKCδ by competing for ATP binding (17Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). To confirm that the same rottlerin concentrations inhibiting NF-κB activation in TNFα-stimulated neutrophils can also inhibit activity of PKCδ, the PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using PKCδ specific polyclonal antibody, and PKCδ kinase activity was measured using histone H1 as a substrate. For comparative purposes, immunoprecipitation using irrelevant glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antibody was performed as a control. As seen in Fig.4 A, while no histone phosphorylation was detected in lysates prepared from TNFα-stimulated neutrophils and immunoprecipitated with GR antibody (lane 1), immunoprecipitation with PKCδ antibody resulted in strong phosphorylation of histone H1 (lanes 2–5), demonstrating that the immunoprecipitation of PKCδ was specific. To determine whether rottlerin inhibits activity of PKCδ directly, or whether it inhibits events upstream of PKCδ, we performed two types of experiments. In the first set of experiments, PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from TNFα-stimulated neutrophils and incubated with rottlerin in vitro (Fig. 4 B). Rottlerin inhibited PKCδ activity in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 being about 10 μm, which is consistent with the rottlerin inhibition of NF-κB activation demonstrated above (Fig. 2 B). In the second set of experiments, neutrophils were preincubated with varying concentrations of rottlerin in vivo, prior to stimulation with TNFα, and PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from corresponding cell lysates and assayed for histone phosphorylation (panel A). Since it is very likely that the extensive washing of the immunoprecipitates efficiently removes rottlerin from PKCδ, this experiment differentiates between the direct and indirect effect of rottlerin on PKCδ activity. If rottlerin targets protein(s) (for example, another protein kinase(s)) upstream of PKCδ, then neutrophil preincubation with rottlerin in vivo would result in a reduced activity of the immunoprecipitated PKCδ. However, as seen in Fig. 4 A, neutrophil preincubation with varying concentrations of rottlerin in vivo did not significantly inhibit histone phosphorylation by the immunoprecipitated PKCδ. These results demonstrate that the effect of rottlerin on PKCδ is direct, and further suggest that the activity of PKCδ is required for NF-κB activation in response to neutrophil stimulation with TNFα. To determine whether PKCδ activates NF-κB through regulating cellular pools of the IκBα inhibitor, neutrophils were stimulated with TNFα (15 min, 10 ng/ml) in the presence of varying concentrations of rottlerin, and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using IκBα specific polyclonal antibody (Fig. 5 A). Consistent with a previous report (11McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), neutrophil stimulation with TNFα substantially reduced the cytosolic pool of IκBα (lane 2). Importantly, neutrophil pretreatment with rottlerin inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the TNFα-induced depletion of cytosolic IκBα (Fig. 5 A). The lower laneshows reprobing the membrane with control anti-actin antibody, demonstrating equal protein loading and transfer to nitrocellulose. To determine whether the increased cytoplasmic pools of IκBα by rottlerin resulted from new protein synthesis or increased protein stability, neutrophils were pretreated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml, 10 min) prior to incubation with rottlerin (50 μm, 15 min) and stimulation with TNFα (10 ng/ml, 30 min). As seen in Fig. 5,panels B and C, no new protein synthesis was required for the rottlerin up-regulation of IκBα and inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding, respectively. These results indicate that PKCδ is involved in the activation of NF-κB in response to neutrophil stimulation with TNFα by activating pathway(s) leading to degradation of IκBα. To confirm that the PKCδ involvement in NF-κB activation is specific for TNFα signaling (Fig. 3), neutrophils were preincubated with rottlerin (50 μm, 15 min) and stimulated 30 min with TNFα, LPS, or IL-1β, and cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed for IκBα expression (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 3 A), the rottlerin effect was specific only for TNFα, since the LPS- and IL-1β-induced IκBα degradation were not inhibited (Fig. 3 B). In most mammalian cells, activation of NF-κB has been shown to be controlled at the level of nuclear translocation of NF-κB proteins through their tightly regulated association with IκBα anchored in the cytoplasm (21Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar, 22Hay R.T. Vuillard L. Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether the inhibition of PKCδ-dependent activation of NF-κB in response to neutrophil stimulation with TNFα is mediated by cytoplasmic retention of p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits. Neutrophils were stimulated with TNFα with and without pretreatment with rottlerin, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using p50- and p65-specific antibodies. Surprisingly, both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear levels of p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits were not significantly affected by neutrophil stimulation with TNFα or pretreatment with rottlerin (Fig.6). Moreover, both NF-κB proteins were present in significant amounts in the nucleus even under conditions when the NF-κB DNA binding is inhi"
https://openalex.org/W2015820951,"CD38 is a bifunctional ectoenzyme synthesizing from NAD+ (ADP-ribosyl cyclase) and degrading (hydrolase) cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a powerful universal calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores. Recently, hexameric connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels have been shown to release cytosolic NAD+ from isolated murine fibroblasts (Bruzzone, S., Guida, L., Zocchi, E., Franco, L. and De Flora, A. (2001) FASEB J.15, 10–12), making this dinucleotide available to the ectocellular active site of CD38. Here we investigated transwell co-cultures of CD38+ (transfected) and CD38− 3T3 cells in order to establish the role of extracellular NAD+ and cADPR on [Ca2+] i levels and on proliferation of the CD38− target cells. CD38+, but not CD38−, feeder cells induced a [Ca2+] i increase in the CD38− target cells which was comparable to that observed with extracellular cADPR alone and inhibitable by NAD+-glycohydrolase or by the cADPR antagonist 8-NH2-cADPR. Addition of recombinant ADP-ribosyl cyclase to the medium of CD38− feeders induced sustained [Ca2+] i increases in CD38−target cells. Co-culture on CD38+ feeders enhanced the proliferation of CD38− target cells over control values and significantly shortened the S phase of cell cycle. These results demonstrate a paracrine process based on Cx43-mediated release of NAD+, its CD38-catalyzed conversion to extracellular cADPR, and influx of this nucleotide into responsive cells to increase [Ca2+] i and stimulate cell proliferation.

CD38 is able either to convert NAD+ to cADPR (ADP-ribosyl cyclase) and then to hydrolyze cADPR (cADPR hydrolase), or to catalyze a base exchange reaction leading to NAADP+ biosynthesis from NADP+and nicotinic acid (3, 4). Cyclase and base exchange activities are common to other members of the CD38 family, the best known of which is a soluble protein purified and characterized from the marine molluskAplysia californica (5, 6). Since both cADPR and NAADP+ are potent calcium mobilizers from distinct intracellular stores (3, 4), CD38 is held to play an essential role in the control of calcium homeostasis in many responsive cells. Specifically, cADPR has been demonstrated to regulate a number of calcium-related cellular events including proliferation, contraction, and secretion (3). Therefore, cADPR can reach its receptor-operated intracellular stores (7), although its site of CD38-catalyzed generation is in fact ectocellular (8, 9). This topological paradox holds both for CD38 in the plasma membrane and for the subcellular fraction of CD38 whose active site is hidden inside either exocytotic or endocytotic vesicles during intracellular trafficking. Indeed, both enhanced exocytosis and ligand-induced endocytosis of CD38-containing membrane vesicles proved to elude such compartmentation and to be causally associated to cADPR-dependent [Ca2+] i increases (10, 11). Elucidation of the topological paradox of the CD38/cADPR system came from some recent findings as follows. (i) The plasma membrane of several cell types harbors a passive transport system for pyridine dinucleotides, which is responsible for NAD+fluxes through the membrane (11), thus providing NAD+substrate to the otherwise inaccessible active site of CD38. This dinucleotide transporter has been identified with connexin 43 hemichannels (12). (ii) Transmembrane CD38 is an active transporter of catalytically produced cADPR across its oligomeric structure (13). (iii) A third, CD38-unrelated mechanism of permeation of extracellular cADPR across cell membranes has been postulated in selected cell types (14, 15). The presence of multiple transport systems for NAD+ and cADPR in the plasma membrane raises the possibility of a paracrine exchange of these molecules between neighboring cells via Cx43, CD38, and eventually cADPR influx. The possibility of NAD+/cADPR-related paracrine mechanisms and their potential role in regulating intracellular calcium were experimentally addressed in the present study by means of co-cultures of CD38 sense- and antisense-transduced 3T3 fibroblasts. CD38− 3T3 cells were found to respond to the paracrine production of cADPR by co-cultured CD38+ 3T3 cells with a calcium-related increase of proliferation. This previously unrecognized interplay between extracellular NAD+ and cADPR may represent a means for regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis and relevant cell responses in selected tissue microenvironments featuring CD38+ stromal cells and CD38−parenchymal cells, e.g. bone marrow (14) and smooth muscle (15). [32P]NAD+ (200 Ci/mmol) and [3H]NAD+ (40 Ci/mmol) were obtained by ICN (Milan, Italy) and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. cADPR, [32P]cADPR, and [3H]cADPR were prepared enzymatically from NAD+, [32P]NAD+, and [3H]NAD+, respectively, with recombinant ADP-ribosyl cyclase from A. californica (courtesy of Prof. H. C. Lee) and HPLC-purified (14). Cx43 antisense (5′-CTCCAGTCACCCATGTCTG-3′) oligodeoxynucleotide, complementary to the AUG translation start codon region of murine Cx43 mRNA and the corresponding sense (5′- CAGACATGGGTGACTGGAG-3′), were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fura 2-AM was obtained from Calbiochem. The anti-cADPR polyclonal antibody (16) and recombinant CD38 (17) were kindly provided by Prof. H. C. Lee. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. NIH 3T3 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultured as described (10). Transfection with sense (CD38+) or antisense (CD38−) CD38 cDNA was performed as described (10). Transfected cells were routinely maintained under geneticin (1 mg/ml) selection. NAD+glycohydrolase (NAD+ase), GDP-ribosyl cyclase, and cADPR hydrolase activities were assayed on 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm nicolinamide guanine dinucleotide, and 0.5 mm cADPR, respectively, by incubating intact CD38+/− 3T3 cells (106) in 400 μl of PBS containing 10 mm glucose (PBS/glucose) at 37 °C. At different times, 60-μl aliquots of the incubation mixtures were centrifuged for 30 s at 5,000 × g, and the corresponding supernatants were deproteinized with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) as described (14). HPLC analyses of nucleotides in the samples were performed as described (15). Protein content was determined according to Bradford (18). CD38+-transfected 3T3 cells, but not the CD38−ones, expressed at their outer surface the three enzymatic activities of CD38 as follows: NAD+ase (29 ± 3 nmol of ADPR/min/mg), GDP-ribosyl cyclase (2.8 ± 0.2 nmol of cGDPR/min/mg), and cADPR hydrolase (0.61 ± 0.04 nmol of ADPR/min/mg). Nicolinamide guanine dinucleotide was used as substrate for the cyclase activity because its enzymatic product cGDPR is not hydrolyzable and accumulates during the assay (19). Cell membranes were prepared by submitting CD38− 3T3 cells (50 × 106) to lysis in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 m sucrose, in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) at 0 °C. Following sonication in ice for 1 min at 3 watts (Heat-System Ultrasonics, W-380, New York), cell lysates were subjected to two subsequent centrifugations at 4 °C as follows: at 3,000 × g for 10 min and the corresponding supernatants at 100,000 × g for 15 min. Membrane pellets were then washed twice in 2 ml of PBS buffer. Total membranes (5 mg/ml) and intact 3T3 CD38− cells (4 × 106/ml) were incubated in 1.0 ml of PBS/glucose in the presence of 200 μm cADPR at 37 °C. At different times 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min (total membranes) or at 5,000 ×g for 30 s (intact cells). Pellets were washed in 2 ml of PBS/glucose, in order to dilute cADPR in the supernatants to HPLC-undetectable concentrations, and then were resuspended in 300 μl of water and sonicated for 1 min at 3 watts in ice. Aliquots of 270 μl were trichloroacetic acid-deproteinized (14), and cADPR content was analyzed by HPLC (see below). Protein content was determined on 30-μl aliquots according to Bradford (18). HPLC analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 instrument equipped with an HP1040 A diode array spectrophotometric detector set at 260 nm, using a 5-μm, 100-Å, 150 × 3.9-mm Delta pack C18 reverse phase column (Waters, Milford, MA). Solvent A was water, and solvent B was 70% 0.1 m KH2PO4containing 5 mm PIC A reagent (Millipore, Milan, Italy), pH 5, and 30% methanol; the solvent program was a gradient starting at 100% solvent A for 5 min, linearly increasing to 10% solvent B in 25 min, and then increasing to 100% solvent B in 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Identification and quantitation of the individual peaks were obtained both by co-elution with known standard compounds and by comparison of UV absorption spectra with those of computer-stored standards. cADPR eluted at 35 min, completely separated from other nucleotides and nucleosides. Sensitivity of this HPLC analysis of cADPR was ≥10 pmol per sample. CD38-antisense-transfected 3T3 cells (0.25 × 106) were seeded in transwell plates (24 mm diameter) on pre-established feeder layers of CD38+ or CD38− 3T3 cells (1.0 × 106), in 1.5 ml of fresh complete medium. Co-cultures were exposed to different cADPR antagonists (20) as follows: 1 μm 8-Br-cADPR for 24 h or 8-NH2-cADPR for 24, 48, and 72 h; or to the gap junction inhibitor oleamide (50 μm) for 24 h (21); or incubated with Cx43 sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (12) as described below. Purified NAD+ase (Sigma) was added to 3T3 CD38+/− co-cultures at a final concentration of 1.3 milliunits/ml. Recombinant ADP-ribosyl cyclase from A. californica was added to 3T3 CD38−/−co-cultures at a final activity of 3 nmol of cADPR/min/ml. Parallel long term incubation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase with 100 μmNAD+ revealed the formation of products other than cADPR, among which are ADPR, ADP, and AMP. Cx43 antisense and sense oligodeoxynucleotides were administered, each at 20 μm, in phosphatidylcholine liposomes (12) to CD38+/− feeders as well as to CD38− target cells pre-adsorbed on a 20-mm diameter coverslip, separately. After 16 h of culture at 37 °C, cells were refed with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and CD38−-treated cells were transferred onto transwell plates over CD38+/−-treated feeders. [Ca2+] i of CD38− 3T3 target cells was determined after 24 h of co-culture. CD38− 3T3 target cells (2.5–5 × 104) adherent on 20-mm diameter coverslips treated with or without Cx43 oligodeoxynucleotides were incubated in the presence of Fura2-AM (10 μm) for 45 min at 37 °C. Untreated cells on the coverslips were incubated without or with 50 μm oleamide or 50 μm 8-Br-cADPR or 100 μm 8-NH2-cADPR in zero calcium standard solution (10) in a 200-μl recording chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM35, Stuttgart, Germany). After 20 min incubation at 25 °C, 100 μm cADPR was added into the chamber, and intracellular calcium concentration in Fura2-AM-treated cells was continuously recorded for 30 min, as described (11). No differences were observed between CD38 antisense-transfected and native CD38− 3T3 cells as concerns the [Ca2+] i changes. For determination of [Ca2+] i in CD38− cells co-cultured with CD38+/− feeders, target CD38− cells were harvested at different times from the transwells, washed twice in 1 ml of PBS for 30 s at 5,000 × g, and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh complete medium. Calcium measures were performed in a 2-ml cuvette under continuous stirring in zero calcium solution, as described (14). Statistical analysis of different [Ca2+] values was performed using one-way analysis of variance and two-sided Dunnett's ttest. p values were considered statistically significant when <0.05. After 48 h co-culture on 75-mm diameter plates, CD38 target cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS, detached with trypsin, and washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS at 5,000 ×g for 30 s. Pellets were resuspended in 250 μl of cold water and frozen at −20 °C and then thawed and sonicated in ice 1 min at 3 watts. A 50-μl aliquot was withdrawn for assay of protein (18), whereas the rest of the sample was deproteinized with 10% trichloroacetic acid (14). The cADPR content of the cell extracts was analyzed by two subsequent HPLCs after addition of trace amounts of radiolabeled [H3]cADPR (2 × 1,000 cpm) as internal standard (14). Identification of the cADPR peak in the cell extracts was confirmed by co-elution with the radioactive standard, by comparison of the absorbance spectrum and elution time with standard cADPR, and by the disappearance of the corresponding peak in the matched CD38-hydrolyzed samples (14). The concentration of intracellular cADPR was calculated from the area of the HPLC peak, taking into account the percentage of nucleotide recovery obtained with the radioactive standard. At various times of co-culture of CD38− over CD38+/− 3T3 feeder cells in complete medium (without phenol red), the medium was collected and clarified by three repeated centrifugations at 300 ×g for 5 min. The cell-free medium was trichloroacetic acid-deproteinized (14) and submitted to enzyme digestion to hydrolyze nucleotides potentially interfering with the cADPR assay (16). cADPR content in the samples was determined by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) (16), rather than by HPLC as for intracellular cADPR levels (see above), because high salt concentrations in these samples proved to interfere with the latter type of analyses. Fresh co-culture media at different times and in different experimental conditions were collected and cells were removed by 3 subsequent centrifugations at 5,000 × g for 30 s. NAD+ content was measured on 200 μl aliquots by a sensitive enzymatic cycling procedure (22), as described (11). To calculate the percentage of cell lysis, hexokinase activity was assayed in aliquots of the same media (11). CD38− 3T3target cells were co-cultured in triplicate over CD38+/− feeders as described above; after 24, 48, and 72 h, target cells were harvested from the transwell with trypsin and washed twice in PBS at 5,000 × g for 30 s, and the dry cell pellet was frozen at −20 °C. The DNA content of the cell pellets was estimated with the CyQuant proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes, OR). DNA fluorescence of the samples was measured on an LS-50B fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results were expressed as percentages of proliferation compared with control cells (CD38− 3T3 cells co-cultured with CD38− 3T3 cells). The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to determine the significance of the difference between two cell populations. Following co-culture of CD38− cells (0.5 × 106) with CD38+/− 3T3 feeder cells (2 × 106) on 75-mm diameter transwell plates for 72 h, target cells were washed in 10 ml of PBS and incubated for 30 min with 30 μm5′-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were then washed with PBS and either immediately fixed (zero time) or further co-cultured on CD38+ or CD38− 3T3 feeders for 4 h. BrdUrd-labeled cells were detached with trypsin, washed twice in ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, and prepared for flow cytometry-mediated analysis of BrdUrd and DNA contents as described previously (10). Briefly, from flow cytometry-mediated and derived data of the CD38− target cells cultured on either CD38− or CD38+ feeder cells, the length of the S phase (T S ) was calculated on the basis of the fact that BrdUrd-labeled cells were allowed to progress through the cell cycle in a BrdUrd-free environment during the so-called “post-labeling” period (4 h). Specifically, T S values were calculated by comparing the mean DNA content of the cohort of BrdUrd-labeled cells which have moved through the cell cycle during post-labeling time, with that of G1 and G2/M phase cells, using the relative movement (RM) method (23). RM values were obtained using Equation 1, RM=(FS−FG1)/(FG2−FG1)Equation 1 where F is the mean red fluorescence of the corresponding phase of the cell cycle. T S (the length of the S phase) values were calculated from Equation 2, TS=[RMT0/(RMT4h−RMT0)]×4Equation 2 where RM T 0 is relative movement at the time of pulse labeling, RM T 4h = relative movement 4 h after pulse labeling, and 4 is the observation time of 4 h. The Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of the difference between the two cell populations in the four experiments performed. Digitonin-permeabilized murine 3T3 fibroblasts have been shown previously to respond to cADPR with an immediate, 8-NH2-cADPR-inhibitable elevation of [Ca2+] i levels (10). Influx of external cADPR has been postulated in cells as murine B-lymphocytes (24), rat cerebellar granule neurons (25), and smooth myocytes from bovine trachea (15), where sustained [Ca2+] i increases were observed following exposure to extracellular cADPR. Moreover, cADPR influx was measured directly in human hemopoietic progenitors, in which the alternative possibility of surface-bound cyclic nucleotide was ruled out by time dependence of cADPR association to extensively washed cells (14). Therefore, we investigated the possible permeation of extracellular cADPR across the plasma membrane of native CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts. Both intact cells and isolated membrane preparations were examined for their content of HPLC-detectable cADPR at different times of incubation with 200 μm cADPR (Fig.1). While membrane-associated cADPR kept stable over time at barely detectable levels, there was a progressive increase of the fraction of cell-associated cADPR which resisted washing of the incubated fibroblasts. This time dependence of association to equally washed cells and failure to record association to isolated cell membranes strongly favor a process of internalization of external cADPR over a simple surface binding. The data illustrated in Fig. 1 and the intrinsic occurrence of cADPR receptors inside the 3T3 cells (10) prompted us to investigate whether these intact cells respond to externally added cADPR with mobilization of [Ca2+] i levels. As shown in Fig.2, addition of the cyclic nucleotide to CD38− native cells resulted in a progressive increase of their [Ca2+] i levels. The lowest effective concentration of cADPR was 0.5 μm, similarly to results obtained with bovine tracheal smooth myocytes (15). The kinetics and extent of [Ca2+] i elevations were identical to those recorded in the same 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to oleamide, a known inhibitor of solute exchange across gap junctions (21) and of specific NAD+ transport through Cx43 hemichannels in isolated 3T3 cells (12). Also, the progressive [Ca2+] i increase was completely unaffected in CD38− cells pre-treated either with a specific anti-Cx43 deoxynucleotide or with the corresponding sense deoxynucleotide. Conversely, [Ca2+] i levels in CD38− cells pre-incubated with either of two cADPR analogs and antagonists (100 μm 8-NH2-cADPR or 50 μm8-Br-cADPR) failed to increase following addition of extracellular cADPR. These data demonstrate responsiveness of 3T3 fibroblasts to extracellular cADPR, similarly to earlier results obtained on the same permeabilized cells (10), yet with distinctive patterns of time dependence, i.e. a fast peak of [Ca2+] i elevation in the permeabilized cells (10) and a sustained response in the native 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 2). The latter pattern suggests influx of cADPR (and of both cADPR antagonists as well) across the plasma membrane. Cx43 hemichannels are not involved in the [Ca2+] i increases elicited by extracellular cADPR, in agreement with complete lack of cADPR transport into proteoliposomes reconstituted with homogeneous Cx43 (12). These results and the availability of both CD38− and CD38+ 3T3 fibroblasts prompted us to develop a model for co-culture where CD38+ fibroblasts were used as feeders for CD38− cells. Control co-cultures were grown on a feeder represented by the same CD38− cells. The properties we investigated in the CD38− 3T3 cells were the [Ca2+] i levels and also the rate of cell proliferation, which had been proved to be enhanced under conditions ofde novo expression of CD38 cells resulting in cADPR-mediated increases of the [Ca2+] i (10). Co-culturing with CD38+ 3T3 feeder cells determined a progressive increase of the [Ca2+] i of CD38− fibroblasts from a basal value of 20.3 ± 2 to 49.6 ± 4 nmwithin 72 h (Fig. 3). No increase whatsoever was detectable in the same cells grown in the same conditions, yet over CD38− 3T3 feeders. Addition of NAD+ase to the culture medium substantially decreased (p < 0.05) the sustained enhancement of [Ca2+] of cells co-cultured with the CD38-transfected fibroblasts (Fig. 3), indicating a causal role of extracellular NAD+ on the [Ca2+] i changes. Moreover, supplementation of soluble ADP-ribosyl cyclase to the medium conditioned by the presence of CD38− feeder cells elicited a significant (p < 0.05) and sustained increase of [Ca2+] i in the CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts over the remarkably stable levels observed in the same cells without any addition (Fig. 3). This increase witnesses NAD+ release from the CD38− feeder cells. In an attempt to investigate whether a quantitative relationship exists between the functional effects on the [Ca2+] i and the extracellular concentration of NAD+ and cADPR, both nucleotides were measured in the media of the various cultures shown in Fig. 3 at different times. Results are reported in TableI. Levels of extracellular NAD+ proved to be remarkably stable throughout the co-culture conditions up to 72 h of incubation. Moreover, they were not significantly modified in the CD38+/CD38− co-cultures nor in the CD38− cultures supplemented with ADP-ribosyl cyclase as compared with their corresponding CD38− control cultures. The only difference was observed in the CD38+ cultures supplemented with NAD+ase, where extracellular NAD+ was slightly (18%) lower than in CD38−cultures alone (Table I).Table IExtracellular NAD+ and cADPR levels in the media from CD38+ /CD38− co-cultures and from control culturesType of cultureNAD+ 72 h 1-aConcentrations of extracellular NAD+ at 24 and 48 h of culture were closely similar to those measured after 72 h.

ND, not detectable. The percentage of cell lysis in the media was ≤0.5% as determined by release of hexokinase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Accordingly, the NAD+ and cADPR concentrations measured in the media were not determined by cell lysis during the co-cultures. On the contrary, concentrations of extracellular cADPR, measured by means of a specific RIA (16), were progressively increasing in the CD38+/CD38− co-cultures, until reaching 6.0 ± 0.8 nm at 72 h (Table I). They were remarkably lower in the medium from the same co-cultures supplemented with NAD+ase, in agreement with a comparatively reduced [Ca2+] i increase (Fig. 3). Addition of ADP-ribosyl cyclase to the CD38− feeders resulted in increasing concentrations of extracellular cADPR, although lower than those measured in CD38+/CD38− co-cultures. Possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy are as follows: (i) the ADP-ribosyl cyclase is partially inactivated at 37 °C (19); (ii) theK m value of ADP-ribosyl cyclase for NAD+is higher (39 μm) than that of CD38 (14 μm) (19); (iii) long term incubation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase on NAD+ resulted in generation of nucleotides other than cADPR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results shown in Fig. 3 and in Table I demonstrate a good quantitative correlation between [Ca2+] increases of 3T3 cells and the concentrations of extracellular cADPR in the corresponding culture media. As mentioned, no such correlation was observed with the levels of extracellular NAD+, which were almost unaffected even under experimental conditions that result in the enzymatic conversion of the dinucleotide (by either CD38, ADP-ribosyl cyclase, or NAD+ase). The levels of extracellular NAD+ reported in Table I seem in fact to reflect steady-state concentrations arising from a two-step process of release and enzymatic conversion (see “Discussion”). In any case, the results shown in Fig. 3 suggest the involvement of extracellular NAD+ and cADPR in the co-culture medium as responsible for calcium mobilization in the CD38− target cells. In order to correlate better extracellular cADPR to intracellular calcium release, the specific cADPR antagonists 8-NH2-cADPR and 8-Br-cADPR were separately added to the co-culture medium. As shown in Fig. 4, supplementation of extracellular 8-NH2-cADPR or of known membrane permeant (26) 8-Br-cADPR (both at 1 μm) for 24 h completely inhibited the [Ca2+] i increase in the CD38− target cells grown over the CD38+ feeder cells. These cADPR antagonists had no effect on [Ca2+] i levels of target cells co-incubated over CD38− feeder cells (not shown). Extracellularly added 8-NH2-cADPR has been recently found to inhibit the [Ca2+] i increase elicited by cADPR in human hemopoietic progenitors (14) and in tracheal smooth myocytes (15). The increases of [Ca2+] i induced in the target CD38− 3T3 fibroblasts by co-culturing with CD38+ feeder cells demonstrate a paracrine role of extracellular NAD+ and cADPR in the mechanism underlying these changes. Specifically, NAD+release from cells followed by CD38-catalyzed generation of extracellular cADPR seem to be the required steps. Since NAD+ release has now been shown to take place in isolated 3T3 cells across hexameric hemichannels of Cx43 (12), we attempted to disrupt the paracrine effects of co-culture by inhibiting the NAD+-exporting activity of Cx43 hemichannels. Oleamide proved to block the [Ca2+] i increase in our co-culture setting almost completely (Fig. 4). Moreover, the specific anti-Cx43 oligodeoxynucleotide inhibited the [Ca2+] i increase in the target CD38−cells, whereas the corresponding sense deoxynucleotide was totally uneffective (Fig. 4). These results give further support to the idea of Cx43-mediated export of cellular NAD+ and of subsequent generation of extracellular cADPR at the outer surface of the CD38+ feeder cells followed by influx of cADPR into the target CD38− cells across a Cx43-unrelated transport system (Fig. 2). In an effort to directly demonstrate this paracrine mechanism, we measured intracellular cADPR in the target CD38− cells during the co-culture experiments. CD38− cells were incubated on 75-mm diameter transwell plates over pre-established CD38−/+ feeder layers for 48 h in the same conditions used for cell cycle analysis (see below). Cell extracts were then analyzed by HPLC. The intracellular cADPR concentration was undetectable in the CD38− target cells co-cultured over homologous CD38− layers (controls), whereas it was estimated to be 2.1 ± 0.1 picomoles/mg in the CD38− grown on CD38+ feeders. This value is in the range of reported intracellular concentrations of cADPR in constitutively CD38+ human lymphoid and myeloid cell lines (27, 28). D"

Adenoviral mediated expression of constitutively active phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the pancreatic β-cells, INS-1, suggested that PI3K was not necessary for glucose-induced β-cell proliferation but was required for IGF-1-induced mitogenesis. Examination of the signaling components downstream of PI3K, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, protein kinase B (PKB), glycogen synthase kinase-3, and p70-kDa-S6-kinase (p70S6K), suggested that a major part of glucose-dependent β-cell proliferation requires activation of mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K, independent of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1/PKB activation. Adenoviral expression of the kinase-dead form of PKB in INS-1 cells decreased IGF-1-induced β-cell proliferation. However, a surprisingly similar decrease was also observed in adenoviral wild type and constitutively active PKB-infected cells. Upon analysis of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2), an increase in ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation activation by glucose and IGF-1 was observed in kinase-dead PKB-infected cells, but this phosphorylation activation was inhibited in the constitutively active PKB-infected cells. Hence, there is a requirement for the activation of both ERK1/ERK2 and mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K signal transduction pathways for a full commitment to glucose-induced pancreatic β-cell mitogenesis. However, for IGF-1-induced activation, these pathways must be carefully balanced, because chronic activation of one (PI3K/PKB) can lead to dampening of the other (ERK1/2), reducing the mitogenic response.

However, recently it has become clear that key factors involved in causing type 2 diabetes are both impaired β-cell function (1Swenne I. Borg L.A. Crace C.J. Schnell Landstrom A. Diabetologia. 1992; 35: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and a failure to increase β-cell mass to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance (2Rhodes C.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). It is therefore critical that strategies be developed to replenish the loss of β-cells and/or to expand existing β-cell mass to compensate for insulin resistance. Such an approach relies on defining the mechanisms involved in regulating β-cell mitogenic signaling pathways in response to growth factors and nutrients. Previous studies have shown that certain growth factors, such as growth hormone (GH)1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), are important for stimulation of β-cell proliferation (4Cousin S.P.

In addition, these studies showed that GH and IGF-1 are dependent on glucose at concentrations in the physiologically relevant range of 6–18 mm to increase β-cell mitogenesis. However, the basis of this glucose dependence of β-cell proliferation remains unknown. GH signals via the janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 pathway in INS-1 β-cells. Although glucose has no independent effect on the activation of this pathway, it is nonetheless required for GH mitogenic action (4Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Reifel-Miller A.

However, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mediated by glucose is at least partially required for full GH-induced β-cell proliferation. IGF-1 has been shown to activate at least two major mitogenic signaling pathways, via PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (7Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J.

The mitogenic stimulation of receptors, such as the IGF-1 receptor, results in the phosphorylation and activation of the IRS family of proteins and the SH2-containing protein (Shc). Shc then interacts with Shc homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, such as the growth factor receptor-bound protein-2, whereas IRS proteins interact with the regulatory subunit of PI3K, p85, as well as growth factor receptor-bound protein-2. The recruitment of growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 and its association to murine sons of sevenless-1 protein (a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor) activates Ras, resulting in Raf-1 activation, which phosphorylates the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase, which in turn activates ERK1/ERK2 (8Kadowaki T.

Interaction of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K leads to the activation of the catalytic subunit, p110, which in turn phosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3′ position of the inositol ring, generating PIP3 (4Cousin S.P.

This increase in phosphorylated phosphoinositides leads to the localization of protein kinase B (PKB) to the membrane through the interaction of PIP3 and PIP2 with the pleckstrin homology domain of PKB (11Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Full activation of PKB appears to be dependent on the subsequent phosphorylation of two residues, Thr-308 in the activation loop of the kinase domain and Ser-473 in the carboxyl-terminal tail (12Alessi D.R.

The protein kinase shown to phosphorylate Thr-308 is 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) (13Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

PKB regulates multiple biological processes, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis, suggesting that it may phosphorylate a number of target proteins (reviewed in Ref 15Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase kinase-3 α and β (GSK3α/β) have been shown to be two such targets, and their phosphorylation on Ser-21 and Ser-9, respectively, negatively regulates GSK3α/β activity (16Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar). PKB has also been implicated in catalyzing phosphorylation activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which then mediates the phosphorylation of p70-kDa-S6-kinase (p70S6K) (17Nave B.T.

In β-cells, glucose and IGF-1 activation of p70S6K via the IRS-mediated signal transduction pathway is dependent on PI3K. However, the important signaling components involved in the regulation of mitogenesis that are downstream of PI3K, such as PDK-1, PKB, mTOR, and GSK3α/β, have not been characterized in β-cells, even though it has been shown that p70S6K is activated by glucose and IGF-1 (4Cousin S.P.

Therefore, in this study we set out to characterize the signaling elements downstream of PI3K that are regulated by glucose and IGF-1 and found that PKB and p70S6K are differentially activated.

All other reagents were of analytical grade from either Sigma or Fisher. The glucose-sensitive pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 (20Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) was maintained in the complete medium RPMI 1640 (11.2 mm glucose) containing 10‥ (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmglutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5‥ CO2 as described (20Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Thymidine incorporation was measured essentially as described, with minor changes. Briefly, INS-1 cells were cultured on 6-well plates to ∼60‥ confluence and infected with adenovirus as described below. The cells were then counted and ∼1 × 104 cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate. The cells were left to attach overnight and were then made quiescent by incubation in starvation medium for 24 h. The INS-1 cells were then incubated for 24 h in starvation medium with additional glucose ± 10 nm IGF-1 as described. During the final 4 h of this incubation 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added. The specific incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was then measured by transferring the cell lysates to UniFilter-96 GF/C filter plates using the Packard cell harvester, and the radioactivity on the filters was counted with the Packard cell counter. Cells were subcultured on either 6-well or 10-cm plates to ∼60‥ confluence. The cells were then subjected to 24-h serum and glucose deprivation with starvation medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1‥ bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) or infected with adenovirus (see “Adenovirus Infection”), when appropriate, prior to the 24-h incubation with starvation medium. After the quiescent period the cells were pre-treated for 15 min with or without inhibitors as indicated, followed by incubation with fresh starvation medium with or without inhibitors with 0.5, 3, or 15 mm glucose with or without 10 nm IGF-1 for the times indicated. The medium was removed, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the phosphate-buffered saline was replaced with ice-cold cell lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1‥ (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotonin. After sonication insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the samples were stored at −80 °C. Cells were stimulated as described (see “Stimulation and Lysis Conditions”). The PKB immunoprecipitation and kinase assay were carried out following the procedures described in the manual, whereas some changes were made to the PDK-1 kinase assay. Active PDK-1 was immunoprecipitated as described in the manual. Briefly, ∼1 mg of cell lysate was pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein G-agarose. The beads were removed, the lysate was then added to the protein G-antibody complex, and the samples were left rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. After two washes with cell lysis buffer, followed by two washes with PDK-1 assay dilution buffer, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of PDK-1 assay dilution buffer containing 10 μl (1 μg) of GSK3 fusion protein and 10 μl of Mg/ATP mixture. The assay was started by the addition of 10 μl (0.5 μg) of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase (SGK)-inactive recombinant protein. SGK is a member of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases whose kinase domain is most related to that of PKB. However, unlike PKB, SGK does not possess a pleckstrin homology domain enabling the assay to be carried out in the absence of PIP3. SGK is phosphorylated at the residue equivalent to Thr-308 of PKB, resulting in activation of this kinase (21Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Having established conditions to ensure that the kinase activity was well within the linear portion of the reaction, samples were incubated for 7.5 min at 25 °C with continuous shaking. The reaction was terminated with 30 μl of 3× SDS gel loading buffer, and samples were analyzed by immunoblotting (see “Protein Immunoblot Procedures”) with the phospho-GSK3α/β(Ser-21/9) antibody. The PI3K adenoviruses, inter Src homology region 2 (AdV-iSH2), and the catalytic p110α subunit (AdV-p110) were constructed as described (22Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The pUSEamp expression vectors containing Myc-His-tagged mouse PKBα (wild type), myr-PKBα (constitutively active), and PKBα-K179M (kinase-dead) were digested with the restriction enzymesHindIII and Pme1. Each of the cDNAs was inserted between the HindIII and SmaI sites of pBluescript, providing the necessary restriction sites for insertion into pAdTrack-CMV between KpnI and NotI. The PKB adenoviruses were generated and purified as described (23Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 24He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). The appropriate titer for each adenovirus was determined by the addition of various dilutions of each adenovirus to cells subcultured in 6-well plates (9.5 cm2) to 60‥ confluence (∼2 × 106 cells), giving a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) ranging from 50 to 2000 based on 0.5–2.0 × 106 plaque forming units/ml as measured byA 260. The viral stock was replaced with complete medium after 2 h, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5‥ CO2 for ∼16 h. The cells were then treated as described. Cell lysates were normalized for total protein after levels were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. For immunoblot analysis 25–50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were immersed in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1‥ Tween, and 5 or 10‥ (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h. This was followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in primary antibody dilution buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1‥ Tween, and 5‥ bovine serum albumin or 10‥ (w/v) nonfat dry milk). After a series of washes with blocking buffer without milk, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with gentle agitation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Washes were repeated as before, and the positive signals were visualized with chemiluminescence reagent and x-ray film. It has previously been shown that activation of PI3K is required for glucose and IGF-1-induced β-cell proliferation (4Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Reifel-Miller A. Rhodes C.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Hugl S.R. White M.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As such, it was examined whether bypassing the requirement for PI3K activation by an adenoviral mediated constitutively active form of PI3K would unveil the extent of the requirement for this enzyme activity on glucose and IGF-1-induced β-cell proliferation. Previous studies have shown that adenoviral expression of the iSH2 of the p85α subunit with the catalytic p110α subunit (p110) results in constitutive activation of PI3K (22Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of a Myc tag on each of the subunits, INS-1 cells infected with recombinant adenovirus to express iSH2 (AdV-iSH2), p110 (AdV-p110), or iSH2 + p110 (AdV-p110 + AdV-iSH2) could be confirmed by subjecting the lysates to immunoblot analysis with the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1 A). Bands at 35 and 115 kDa correspond to the predicted molecular mass of Myc-tagged iSH2 and p110, respectively, whereas the band at 40 kDa is nonspecific (as indicated by its presence in uninfected and AdV-β-Gal-infected control cells). The β-cell mitogenesis was determined in INS-1 cells infected with the control β-Gal (AdV-βGal), AdV-iSH2, AdV-p110, or AdV-p110 + AdV-iSH2. The uninfected and AdV-βGal controls showed similar increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to 3 or 15 mm glucose ± 10 nmIGF-1 (Fig. 1 B), as observed previously (4Cousin S.P. Hugl S.R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Reifel-Miller A. Rhodes C.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Hugl S.R. White M.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For uninfected INS-1 cells at 15 mm glucose, β-cell mitogenesis was increased 19-fold (p < 0.01), and in the additional presence of 10 nm IGF-1 was 48-fold (p < 0.005) above the 0.5 mm glucose control (Fig. 1 B). In AdV-p110-infected INS-1 cells β-cell mitogenesis in response to glucose and IGF-1 was not significantly different from the uninfected control. In addition, in AdV-iSH2-infected INS-1 cells glucose-induced β-cell mitogenesis was similar to the uninfected control; however, that at 15 mm glucose + 10 nm IGF-1 was elevated to 68.2 ± 8.4-fold (n = 3) above 0.5 mmglucose (Fig. 1 B; p < 0.02). In AdV-p110/AdV-iSH2-coinfected cells glucose-induced β-cell mitogenesis was not significantly altered compared with that in uninfected or AdV-βGal controls in INS-1 cells (Fig. 1 B). However, IGF-1-induced β-cell mitogenesis in AdV-p110/AdV-iSH2 coinfected INS-1 cells was significantly increased 22.2 ± 0.5-fold (n = 3;p < 0.01) at basal 3 mm glucose and 126.5 ± 12.9-fold (n = 3; p < 0.01) at a stimulatory 15 mm glucose above 0.5 mm glucose control (Fig. 1 B). PDK-1 has been suggested to lie downstream of PI3K in signal transduction pathways (15Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). It was determined whether PDK-1 plays a role in the mitogenic signal transduction in INS-1 cells in response to glucose ± IGF-1. PDK-1 activity was assessed in INS-1 cells incubated with 0.5, 3.0, or 15 mm glucose ± 10 nm IGF-1 for 2, 10, and 40 min. PDK-1 was found to be active at 0.5 mm glucose, but neither an increase in glucose nor the presence of IGF-1 had any significant effect on further increasing PDK-1 activity (Fig. 2 B). Total levels of PDK-1 in each of the samples did not vary, indicating that equivalent amounts of PDK-1 were immunoprecipitated (Fig.2 A). Thus, it would appear that PDK-1 is present in INS-1 cells and is constitutively active. Activation of PI3K leads to downstream activation of PKB (25Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that PKB translocation to the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin homology domain is increased via interaction with the PIP2 and PIP3 products synthesized by increased PI3K activity at the cell plasma membrane (11Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PKB membrane localization appears to be sufficient to allow PDK-1-mediated phosphorylation of PKB at Thr-308 and partial activation, although full activation requires additional phosphorylation at Ser-473 by an as yet unidentified kinase (13Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). PKB Thr-308 and Ser-473 phosphorylation and consequential regulation of PKB activity was examined in INS-1 cells incubated at 0.5, 3.0, or 15 mm glucose ± 10 nm IGF-1 for 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 min. PKB activity did not change significantly when cells were incubated at basal 3 mm glucose or stimulatory 15 mm glucose (Fig.3 A). In contrast, IGF-1 rapidly increased PKB activity, which reached a maximum after 5 min of IGF-1 treatment and was maintained over the 40-min period at a similar level whether at a basal 3 mm or stimulatory 15 mm glucose level (Fig. 3 A). As such, IGF-1-induced activation of PKB activity did not appear to be glucose-dependent. The PKB phosphorylation state was determined in parallel, and negligible phosphorylation at Thr-308 or Ser-473 was observed in INS-1 cells incubated at 3 or 15 mmglucose, correlating with a lack of glucose-induced PKB activity (Fig.3 B). In contrast, IGF-1 induced a rapid and marked increase in PKB Thr-308 phosphorylation, which was maximal at 2 min and then trailed off but was still significantly above that at time zero by 40 min (Fig. 3 B). IGF-1 also markedly increased phosphorylation of PKB at Ser-473 within 2 min, reaching a maximum between 10 and 20 min, which was maintained at 40 min (Fig. 3 B). In general, the Thr-308/Ser-473 phosphorylation of PKB by IGF-1 correlated with IGF-1-induced PKB activity (Fig. 3 A). Neither 3 or 15 mm glucose affected IGF-1-induced PKB Thr-308 or Ser-473 phosphorylation, also correlating with a lack of influence of glucose on IGF-1-induced PKB activity. The total amount of PKB did not significantly alter with glucose/IGF-1 treatment (Fig.3 B). GSK3α/β has been shown to be a phosphorylation substrate of PKB, where phosphorylation of GSK3α/β by PKB inhibits GSK3α/β activity (26Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was determined whether glucose and/or IGF-1 could influence endogenous GSK3α/β phosphorylation in β-cells (Fig.4). INS-1 cells were treated at basal 3 mm glucose or stimulatory 15 mm glucose ± 10 nm IGF-1 for 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 min and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with the phospho-GSK3α/β antibody or total-GSK3α/β antibody (Fig. 4). Neither 3 or 15 mmglucose had any significant effect on GSK3α/β phosphorylation over the 40-min time course (Fig. 4), correlating with a lack of effect of glucose on PKB activity (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, IGF-1 rapidly and markedly increased GSK3α/β phosphorylation within 2 min that was sustained throughout the 40-min time course and was independent of the glucose activation (Fig. 4). This GSK3α/β phosphorylation pattern correlated with IGF-1-induced PKB activity and phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). The total amount of GSK3α/β did not alter with glucose/IGF-1 treatment (Fig.4). Phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K has also been postulated to be downstream of PKB activation via activation of mTOR by PKB (17Nave B.T. Ouwens M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 18Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NatC substrates are rare, and none were encountered among 55 abundant proteins (2Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or among 68 ribosomal proteins (10Arnold R. Polevoda B. Reilly J.P. Sherman F. J. Biol.

There are 29 MAK genes defined on the basis of their requirement for stable propagation of M1 dsRNA (13Wickner R.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 250-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their modes of action are diverse, with the bulk of the MAK genes involved in the 60 S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p co-purify, suggesting that they constitute three subunits of a complex (14Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Moreover, protein-protein interactions between Mak3p and Mak10p, as well as between Mak31p and Mak10, were detected in a two-hybrid screen (15Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3900) Google Scholar). Significantly, of all of the MAKgenes, only MAK3, MAK10, and MAK31were found necessary for L-A virus propagation (16Sommer S.S. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1982; 31: 429-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Wickner R.B. Toh-e A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 159-174PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar to mak3 mutants, mak10 mutants grew slowly on media containing nonfermentable carbon sources (19Lee Y-J. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 1992; 132: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biological function of the MAK31 gene was not previously known, Séraphin (20Séraphin B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) suggested that Mak31p is an Sm-like protein based on protein sequence similarity. Sm-like proteins are small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) found associated with U1, U2, and U5 snRNAs, as well as with U4/U6 double snRNP and the U4/U6/U5 triple snRNP. snRNP are involved in various functions including pre-mRNA splicing, histone mRNA 3′formation, tRNA processing, rRNA maturation, and telomeric DNA synthesis (21Mattaj I.W. Tollervey D. Séraphin B. FASEB. J. 1993; 7: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, Mak31p is more divergent compared with other yeast Sm-like proteins, and it is the only member lacking a glycine or cysteine at position 107 as numbered according to the alignment of Sm domains. Furthermore, Mak31p did not precipitate any of the tested RNAs (20Séraphin B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2089-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We have investigated the requirements of the Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p subunits for acetylation with the yeast iso-1 system. Because the N-terminal region of iso-1 is dispensable for biosynthesis, function, and mitochondrial import (22Baim S.B. Pietras D.F. Eustice D.C. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Wang X. Dumont M.E. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6594-6604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), N-terminal processing can be investigated freely with essentially any alteration. In fact, altered forms of iso-1 proved to be ideally suited for investigating the specificity of N-terminal methionine cleavage and N-terminal acetylation (2Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Tsunasawa S. Stewart J.W. Sherman F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19638-19643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, because the mass of iso-1 is ∼12.5 kDa and because mass spectrometry can be used conveniently to determine molecules less than 30 kDa with an accuracy of ∼1 Da, we have used this method to determine acetylation of mutant forms of iso-1. In this study, we have demonstrated that each of the three subunits, Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p, is absolutely required for N-terminal acetylation of a NatC type of substrate in vivo. Deletion of any of the corresponding genes prevented acetylation of a NatC type of altered iso-1 but not of a NatA or NatB types of iso-1. We have also shown that all three deletion strains showed similar phenotypes, including slower growth on nonfermentable carbon sources at elevated temperatures. Thus, all three subunits (Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p) of the complex are required for NatC activity. Using standard genetic nomenclature,MAK3, for example, designates the normal wild-type allele;mak3-Δ designates the deletion or disruption of the gene; and Mak3p designates the protein encoded by MAK3. CYC1–853,CYC1-987, etc., designate genes encoding different mutant forms of functional iso-1, whereas cyc1–3and cyc1–115 designate alleles lacking or encoding nonfunctional forms of iso-1. The cyc7–67 allele denotes a partial deletion of the CYC7 gene that results in complete deficiency of iso-2-cytochrome c. Unless stated otherwise, yeast was grown at 30 °C in YPD or YPG medium or SD medium containing appropriate supplements (24Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). The strains used in this study are listed in Table II. The analysis of N-terminal acetylation was carried out with a series of isogenic strains originally derived from B-7528 (cyc1–31 MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10). The series of strains used for producing altered iso-1 were constructed by first using synthetic oligonucleotides to generate CYC1 mutations encoding the desired iso-1 and second by separately disrupting each of theMAK3, MAK10, MAK31, NAT1, or NAT3genes (see below). Strains are designated as “normal” if they contain the full complement of normal NAT genes.Table IIYeast strainsStrainGenotypeB-7528MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 cyc1–31B-12479MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1383B-13393MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1383 nat1-Δ::URA3B-13739MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1383 mak3-Δ::URA3B-7687MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–853B-7727MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–853 nat1-Δ::URA3B-9072MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–853 mak3-Δ::URA3B-11863MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–853 nat3-Δ::kanMX4B-13274MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–853 mak31-Δ::kanMX4B-8462MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1162B-9022MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1162 mak3-Δ::URA3B-9024MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1162 nat1-Δ::URA3B-11865MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1162 nat3-Δ::kanMX4B-12333MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1162 mak10-Δ::kanMX4B-13275MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–1162 mak31-Δ::kanMX4B-10645MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–987B-10672MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–987 mak3-Δ::URA3B-10689MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–987 nat1-Δ::URA3B-12045MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–987 nat3-Δ::kanMX4B-12332MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–987 mak10-Δ::kanMX4B-13276MAT a cyc7–67 ura3–52 lys5–10 CYC1–987 mak31-Δ::kanMX4B-6925MATα cyc7–67 trp2 can1 lys2 cyc1–115 Open table in a new tab Quantitative matings were determined by plating serial dilutions of logarithmically growing yeast cells onto SD plates containing a lawn of the tester mating strain, B-6925, and determining the frequencies of prototrophic diploid colonies arising after incubation for 3 days. Dilutions of the haploid strains were also plated on YPD plates to determine total number of cell. Mating efficiencies were expressed as the ratio of the number of diploid colonies to the number of haploid cells plated on the lawn of the tester strain. Strains with altered forms of iso-1 were conveniently produced by transforming yeast directly with synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously by Yamamoto et al. (25Yamamoto T. Moerschell R.P.

The amounts of iso-1 in yeast strains were estimated by low temperature (−196 °C) spectroscopic examinations of intact cells (26Sherman F. Slonimski P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 90: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and comparing the intensities of the Cα band at 547 nm with the corresponding band of strains having known amounts of cytochrome c. Standard molecular biological procedures were performed as described previously (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). TheNAT1, NAT3, MAK3, MAK10, andMAK31 genes were disrupted by replacing a portion of the genes with either the kanMX4 or URA3 genes and using the appropriate fragment for gene replacements. The PCR-generated fragment required for producing thenat3-Δ::kanMX4 disruption was prepared by the method of Baudin et al. (28Baudin A. Ozier K.O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) using the pFA6-kanMX4 plasmid (29Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar) as template and the primers Oligo 1 and 2 (Table III). The correct disruptions in the transformants were identified by PCR using the set of primers Oligo 3 and 4. The fragment required for producing thenat1-Δ::URA3 disruption was prepared from the plasmid pAA1132 (also designated JM111) (3Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The correctnat1-Δ disruptions were identified with Oligo 5 and 6. The fragment required for producing themak3-Δ::URA3 disruption was prepared from the plasmid pJC11C (also designated pAA1131) (31Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The correctmak3-Δ disruptions were identified with Oligo 7 and 8.mak10-Δ and mak31-Δ disruptions were made by PCR-based technique using disrupter Oligo 9 and 10, and Oligo 13 and 14, respectively. The correct disruptions were identified with Oligo 11 and 12 for mak10-Δ and Oligo 15 and 16 formak31-Δ, respectively. The strains were grown and the cells treated with ethyl acetate as described previously (30Sherman F Stewart J.W. Parker J.H. Inhaber E. Shipman N.A. Putterman G.J. Gardisky R.L. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5446-5456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iso-1-cytochromes c were purified using two subsequent rounds of weak cation exchange BioRex70 column chromatography, 100–200 mesh and 200–400 mesh (Bio-Rad), respectively, in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with a 0–1.0m potassium chloride linear gradient. After chromatography the protein samples were dialyzed against 0.1 m potassium phosphate and, if necessary, concentrated by Centricon-3 (Amicon-Millipore, Bedford, MA). For MALDI-TOF experiments the protein samples were either dialyzed against H2O or the phosphate buffer was replaced by H2O using Centricon-3. MALDI samples were prepared by mixing one part of the protein sample with one part of the sinapinic acid matrix at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 30% acetonitrile and applying 1 μl of this mixture to the sample probe. For some samples, 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to the sample before mixing with matrix in order to enhance the MALDI signal. Samples were allowed to air dry before inserting them in either a Voyager-DE STR linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at the Microchemical Protein/Peptide Core Facility, University of Rochester or a Bruker ProFLEX III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA) at the Mass Spectrometry Facility, Department of Chemistry, Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, LA). Positive ion mass spectra were recorded using 25 keV of total acceleration energy and with a grid voltage of 93.5%. External mass calibration was performed using a sample containing insulin, thioredoxin, and apomyoglobin in sinapinic acid matrix or using horse cytochromec. It has been previously reported that mak3-Δ (31Tercero J.C. Riles L.E. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20270-20276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mak10-Δ (19Lee Y-J. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 1992; 132: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mutants have diminished growth on medium with glycerol or ethanol as a carbon source. These phenotypes were confirmed and others were investigated in this study using the following isogenic series of strains that were prepared from strain B-7528 by making null deletions of MAK3, MAK10, and MAK31 genes by disrupter plasmids (see “Materials and Methods”) or PCR-based disrupters (see Table III for corresponding oligonucleotides): normal (B-8462),mak3-Δ (B-9072), mak10-Δ (B-12333), andmak31-Δ (B-13275). As shown in Fig.1, mak3-Δ,mak10-Δ, and mak31-Δ mutants grew poorly on YPG medium at 37 °C, although growth on YPD medium at 37 °C was normal, thus displaying the Nfs− phenotype (diminished growth on media containing a nonfermentable substrates as the sole carbon and energy source). Similar reduced growth for all of the deletion mutants was detected on YPE (ethanol), YPGal (galactose), and YPRaf (raffinose) media (not shown). (Because the normal strain, B-8462 is Gal− and Raf+/−, the diminished growth on YPGal and YPRaf media is a secondary consequence of the Nfs− phenotype; ρ− derivatives of B-8462 also did not grow on YPGal and grew poorly on YPRaf media, especially at 37 °C.) Also, the mating frequencies of mak3-Δ (B-9022), mak10-Δ (B-12333), and mak31-Δ (B-13275) mutants were the same or similar to the mating efficiency of normal strain B-8462 (not shown), a result that is in contrast to the results with the ard1,nat1, and nat3 mutants, which have reduced mating efficiencies (2Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In addition, iso-1 levels in themak3-Δ, mak10-Δ, and mak31-Δ deletion mutants did not differ significantly from the corresponding normal MAK + strains, as estimated by low temperature spectroscopic examination of intact cells (TableIV). It is noteworthy that themak3-Δ (B-9022), mak10-Δ (B-12333), andmak31-Δ (B-13275) mutant strains contained the normal complement of all of the cytochromes when grown on YPD medium at 37 °C. Thus, the lack of growth at 37 °C on media with nonfermentable carbon sources cannot be attributed to a cytochrome deficiency.Table IVN-terminal acetylation of altered iso-1 from normal and mutant strainsPercent acetylation values shown in parentheses are from Polevodaet al.

For this study, we chose four different CYC1 alleles with corresponding altered iso-1 N termini, each representing one class of NAT substrates (Table IV). Iso-1 from the normal strain and from each of the mak3-Δ, mak10-Δ, mak31-Δ,nat1-Δ, and nat3-Δ mutants were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Peaks corresponding to iso-1 were observed at masses between 12.5 and 13 kDa depending on the altered N-terminal sequence. The iso-1 were identified by the masses determined from the spectra, the masses deduced from the gene sequences, and knowledge of previously established modifications. The results of MALDI-TOF determinations of molecular masses for altered iso-1 are presented in Table V. Examples of some spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The lack of protein acetylation leads to a diminished molecular mass of ∼42 Da, which corresponds to the mass of the acetyl group. In general, the samples were either completely or almost completely acetylated or were completely unacetylated, except for a NatA′ substrate fromCYC1–987 strains having one or another of themak3-Δ, mak10-Δ, mak31-Δ, andnat3-Δ deletions in which the iso-1 contained ∼5–10% of the unacetylated form.Table VMolecular masses and percent acetylation of altered iso-1 prepared from normal and mutant strainsSubstrate typeCYC1alleleNormalmak3-Δmak10-Δmak31-Δnat1-Δnat3-ΔNatACYC1–1383StrainB-12479B-13739B-13393Mass (Da)Observed12,67112,67212,638Expected12,68412,68412,642% Acetylation1001000NatBCYC1–853StrainB-7687B-9072B-13274B-7723B-11863Mass (Da)Observed12,76312,76412,719Expected12,77412,77412,732% Acetylation100(100)100(100)0NatCCYC1–1162StrainB-8462B-9022B-12333B-13275B-9024B-11865Mass (Da)Observed12,88412,83912,83712,83812,88312,884Expected12,89212,85012,85012,85012,89212,892% Acetylation100000100100NatA′CYC1–987StrainB-10645B-10672B-12332B-13276B-10689B-12045Mass (Da)Observed12,71812,71812,72312,712—12,723Expected12,73012,73012,73012,73012,68812,730% Acetylation100∼95∼95∼95(0)∼90The “observed” mass refers to the mass obtained experimentally, whereas the “expected” mass refers to the values deduced from the structure either having or lacking the acetyl group as indicated in the table.

Overall, the analysis of iso-1 acetylation from the complete sets of isogenic strains gave rise to expected results (Tables IV and V). The decrease of the molecular mass of Ser-Glu-Ile (CYC1–1383) iso-1 by ∼42 Da, indicative of the lack of acetylation, was observed in B-13393 (nat1-Δ mutant) but not in B-13739 (mak3-Δ mutant). The Met-Glu-Phe (CYC1–853) iso-1 was not acetylated in B-11863 (nat3-Δ) mutant but remained acetylated in the B-7723 (nat1-Δ), B-9072 (mak3-Δ), and B-13274 (mak31-Δ) mutants. The Met-Ile-Arg (CYC1–1162) iso-1 was not acetylated in the B-9022 (mak3-Δ) mutant but was acetylated in the B-9024 (nat1-Δ) and B-11865 (nat3-Δ) mutants. The Ser-Glu-Phe (CYC1–987) iso-1 was acetylated in B-12332 (mak10-Δ) and B-13276 (mak31-Δ) mutants but not in B-10689 (nat1-Δ). Also, CYC1–987 iso-1 from B-10672 (mak3-Δ) and B-12045 (nat3-Δ) were partially acetylated (Fig. 2). All of these results could be predicted from the previously identified NAT substrates (2Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Importantly, acetylation was not detected in altered iso-1 Met-Ile-Arg (CYC1–1162) from B-12333 (mak10-Δ) and B-13275 (mak31-Δ) mutants. Thus, the presence of the functional Mak3p, Mak10p, and Mak31p is absolutely required for acetylation of NatC-type substrates in vivo. One important question concerns the N-terminal acetyltransferases and the nature of N-terminal acetylation in other eukaryotes. Moerschell et al. (6Moerschell R.P. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19638-19643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) point out the similarity in the pattern of N-terminal acetylation of proteins from higher eukaryotes and S. cerevisiae, suggesting that the same systems may operating in all eukaryotes. In addition, Polevoda, Sherman, and colleagues (2Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) point out the existence of orthologous genes encoding the catalytic subunits of the three N-terminal acetyltransferases, also indicative of the same or similar N-terminal acetyltransferases operating in higher eukaryotes. Species containing orthologs of the yeast Ard1p and Nat3p includeCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster,Homo sapiens, as well as others (2Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, BLAST (basic local alignment search tool program) (33Altshul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69594) Google Scholar) comparisons revealed that species containing orthologs of the yeast Mak3p includeSchizosaccharomyces pombe, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, Mus musculus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and H. sapiens. Also proteins with high similarity to Mak3p are present in Archaeoglobus fulgidus,Aeropyrum pernix, Campylobacter coli,Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Methanococcus jannaschii, Pyrococcus abyssi, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Escherichia coli. However, it is doubtful that the similar proteins in prokaryotes are N-terminal acetyltransferases that act co-translationally on a wide range of proteins but are rather more similar, for example, to E. coli RimIp that acetylates the N terminus of ribosomal protein S18 (34Isono K. Isono S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 177: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). BLAST comparisons also revealed orthologous genes encoding snRNP Sm-like proteins, similar to Mak31p, in S. pombe,Medicago sativa, Thermoplasma acidophilum,C. elegans, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens, with 35–55% amino acid sequence similarity spanning almost the entire protein (Fig.3 B). Although it is unclear whether these proteins have Sm or Mak31p functions, the Gly or Cys residues at position 107 conserved in Sm proteins are not found in the these proteins. Lee and Wickner (19Lee Y-J. Wickner R.B. Genetics. 1992; 132: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously pointed out the sequence similarity of Mak10p to the variable regions of the T cell receptor α-subunit. Also, the Mak10p sequence is similar to open reading frames of unknown function from S. pombe, Rattus norvegicus, C. elegans, H. sapiens,Guillardia theta, D. melanogaster, and A. thaliana, and to a lesser extent to the folate transporter fromC. elegans, Flo3p and Gea2p from S. cerevisiae, and a presumable peroxisomal targeting signal receptor from S. pombe (alignment not presented). Clearly, some of these defined proteins are not N-terminal acetyltransferases, and the similarities may reflect the presence of one or two hypothetical transmembrane domains in Mak10p. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether Mak10p is truly a membrane protein. We conclude that the NatC N-terminal acetyltransferase is a Mak3p·Mak10p·Mak31p complex and that each of the subunits is required for acetylating NatC-type substratesin vivo, including the killer viral major coat protein, Gag, and an unidentified component responsible for normal utilization of nonfermentable substrates."

Upon phosphorylation by the activated receptor kinases, the receptor-regulated Smad, such as Smad2, forms a heterocomplex with the co-mediator Smad, Smad4. This heterocomplex is then translocated into the nucleus, where it associates with other transcription factors and regulates expression of ligand-responsive genes. The stoichiometry between receptor-regulated Smad and co-mediator Smad is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the signaling process. Using purified recombinant proteins, we demonstrate that Smad2 and Smad4 form a stable heterodimer and that the Smad4 activation domain is important for the formation of this complex. Many tumor-derived missense mutations disrupt the formation of this heterocomplex in in vitro interaction assays. Mapping these mutations onto the structures of Smad4 and Smad2 identifies a symmetric interface between these two Smad proteins. Importantly, two previous models on the formation of a heterocomplex are incompatible with our observations and other reported evidence.

Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). The signal is then propagated by the type I receptor-mediated phosphorylation of specific R-Smads. For example, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are phosphorylated by the bone morphogenetic protein receptors, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the activin and TGF-β receptors. The phosphorylated R-Smad hetero-oligomerizes with Co-Smad Smad4, translocates into the nucleus, and associates with sequence-specific DNA-binding protein(s), resulting in the positive or negative regulation of ligand-responsive genes.The Smad proteins are conserved across species, particularly in the N-terminal MH1 domain and the C-terminal MH2 domain. The MH2 domain, to which most of the tumor-derived mutations map, is responsible for receptor recognition, transactivation, interaction with transcription factors, and homo- and hetero-oligomerization among Smads. The MH1 domain, on the other hand, exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding activity and negatively regulates the functions of the MH2 domain.Formation of a heterocomplex between Co-Smad and R-Smad is indispensable for the signaling process (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar).

The NC2 domain has been implicated in catalyzing the antiparallel dimer formation of type VII procollagen. In this study, we produced the entire 161 amino acids of the NC2 domain plus 186 amino acids of adjacent collagenous domain (NC2/COL) and purified large quantities of the recombinant NC2/COL protein. Recombinant NC2/COL readily formed disulfide-bonded hexamers, each representing one antiparallel dimer of collagen VII. Removal of the collagenous helical domain from NC2/COL by collagenase digestion abolished the antiparallel dimer formation. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that mutation of either cysteine 2802 or cysteine 2804 alone within the NC2 domain blocked antiparallel dimer formation. In contrast, a single cysteine mutation, 2634, within the collagenous helical domain had no effect. A generated methionine to lysine substitution, M2798K, that is associated with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, was unable to form antiparallel dimers. Furthermore, autoantibodies from epidermolysis bullosa acquisita patients also reacted with NC2/COL.

The relatively high degree of conservation of this segment is highlighted by the presence of 67-amino acid residues spanning the junction of the collagenous and NC2 domains which is 100% conserved between hamster, mouse, and human sequences (20Greenspan D.S. Human Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this region contains the cleavage site for proteolytic removal of the NC2 domain. This region also contains a pair of cysteines in amino acid positions 2802 and 2804 which are likely to be involved in the disulfide-bond linkages that stabilize antiparallel dimers. In addition, there is a conserved single cysteine residue in amino acid position 2634 within the adjacent collagenous domain which may be involved in interchain disulfide bonding (20Greenspan D.S. Human Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The NC2 domain of type VII collagen has been implicated in initiating the triple-helical assembly of type VII collagen and catalyzing the antiparallel dimer formation of procollagen (2Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact function of the NC2 domain is not known. This is at least partly due to the extremely low quantities of procollagen VII in skin and cell culture. Furthermore, there has been a very limited amount of NC2 available because of its susceptibility to nonspecific proteolytic degradation during biochemical purification. Therefore, there has been great difficulty obtaining sufficient quantities of pure NC2. The major antigenic epitopes for autoantibodies in patients with EBA and bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (BSLE) reside within the NC1 domain of type VII collagen (21Lapiere J.C. Woodley D.T.

Dermatol. 1994; 102: 706-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recently a novel EBA subgroup with a milder clinical presentation was defined in children with tissue bound and circulating autoantibodies targeting only the triple-helical central domain of type VII collagen (24Tanaka H. Yamamoto A.I. Hashimoto T. Hiramoto K. Harada T. Kawachi Y. Shimizu H. Tanaka T. Kishiyama K. Hopfner B. Takahashi H. Lizuka H. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 623-632PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that EBA may exhibit a wider, more heterogeneous spectrum of autoantibody reactivities than previously assumed. In this study, we prepared a cDNA construct for the NC2 domain plus its immediately adjacent collagenous domain (COL). This construct was used in an eukaryotic expression system to produce large quantities of purified NC2/COL, a 50-kDa carboxyl terminus of the type VII collagen α-chain. We demonstrate herein that purified NC2/COL readily forms disulfide-bonded hexameric aggregates, each representing one anti-parallel dimer of collagen VII. We also demonstrate that the adjacent COL domain is essential for the formation of antiparallel dimers. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that mutating either cysteine 2802 or cysteine 2804 within the NC2 domain inhibits antiparallel dimer formation. In contrast, a single cysteine mutation, cysteine 2634, within the collagenous domain had no effect. Furthermore, a methione to lysine substitution mutation, M2798K, within the NC2 domain also caused an inability to form antiparallel dimers. Interestingly, this mutation has been reported to be associated with recessive DEB. The eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) which contains the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and enhancer was used to express a chimeric cDNA (Fig. 1). The cDNA contains a 16-amino acid signal peptide sequence derived from human type VII collagen, a 186-amino acid COL domain, and the entire 161-amino acid NC2 domain. To generate the expression vector, a 1.8-kilobase pair of COL and NC2 cDNA fragment was released from pGEX-PCR10 byBamHI/EcoRI digestion (21Lapiere J.C. Woodley D.T. Parente M.G. Iwasaki T. Wynn K.C. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1831-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and made blunt-ended by DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) following a standard protocol. This fragment was then ligated to the KasI-digested and blunt-ended pRC/CMV to generate a construct designated CMV/NC2*. Then, a cDNA fragment containing signal peptide, COL domain, and NC2 domain was released from CMV/NC2* by NruI/MscI digestion and ligated into the NruI/XbaI (blunt-ended) pRC/CMV vector, resulting in the final expression construct as shown in Fig. 1. We designated the protein product of this construct NC2/COL. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression vector was used to transfect a human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), and stable clones were selected using 500 μg of G418/ml as previously described (25Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. Cai X.Y. Rao C.N. O'Toole E.A. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted using guanidine isothiocyanate-CsCl2 density gradient centrifugation as previously described (26Wang S.Y. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5880-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The total RNA was size fractionated and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, DuPont, Boston, MA) and hybridized to a 32P-labeled (random-primer labeling kit, BMB, Indianapolis, IN) 1.4-kilobase pair human type VII collagen cDNA probe containing NC2/COL domain. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the NC2/COL chimeric cDNA in the pRC/CMV vector using a commercial kit (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers with 39 bases was designed, and mutation to change cysteine to serine or methione to lysine was placed in the middle of the primers. A double cysteine mutant was created by changing cysteine at a given site to serine and using this mutant DNA as a template in the next round of mutagenesis. Parental cDNA inserted in pRC/CMV was amplified usingPyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase with these primers for 12 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI, the amplified DNA with nucleotide substitution incorporated was transformed intoEscherichia coli (XL1-Blue). The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. For Western blot analysis, clonal cell lines resistant to G418 were grown to confluence, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cultures were maintained for an additional 24 h. The media were collected, concentrated 10-fold by Centricon-30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The presence of recombinant NC2/COL was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared from our laboratory against the NC2/COL domain of type VII collagen followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Corp.) (27Chen M. O'Toole E.A. Muellenhoff M. Medina E. Kasahara N. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24429-24435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For large-scale purification of recombinant NC2/COL, serum-free media were equilibrated to 5 mm EDTA, 50 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μm N-ethylmaleimide, and precipitated with 400 mg/ml ammonium sulfate at 4 °C overnight with stirring. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 1 h, resuspended and dialyzed in buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA and passed over a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in the same buffer. Elution was then carried out with a linear gradient from 0.5 to 1.0 m NaCl of appropriate volume size. The proteins that eluted between 0.8 and 1 mNaCl were pooled and further purified on a Superdex 200 (HR 10/30, Pharmacia) equilibrate in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm NaCl. The inhibitory activity of recombinant NC2/COL for various proteases was examined. We tested whether NC2/COL could inhibit selected proteases from degrading recombinant NC1 domain of type VII collagen. The recombinant NC1 (200 μg/ml) as substrate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 as described previously (28Mayer U. Poschl E. Nischt R. Specks U. Pan T.C. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The proteases (2 μg/ml) were incubated with inhibitors in 10- or 50-fold excess (by molar) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of recombinant NC1. Digestions were allowed to incubate for 4 h at 37 °C and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Purified recombinant NC2/COL (5 μg) was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide and then subjected to 10 units of bacterial collagenase (clostridiopeptidase A, type III, Sigma) digestion at 37 °C for 1 h. For testing IgG reactivity with NC2/COL, EBA and BSLE sera were used. The diagnosis of EBA was based on clinical findings, characteristic histology, demonstration of linear IgG deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction by direct immunofluorescence, and demonstration of IgG deposits at the dermal floor of the patients skin when dermal-epidermal junction was fractured though the lamina lucida by treatment with 1 m NaCl (29Gammon W.R.

Talley M.J. Silver M. Grotendorst G. Qwarnstrom E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 149-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We showed previously that these sera contained autoantibodies against the NC1 domain of type VII collagen (31Chen M. Chan L.S. Cai X.Y. O'Toole E.A. Sample J.C. Woodley D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 108: 68-72Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ELISA was performed as described previously except that purified recombinant NC2/COL (0.15 μg/per well) was used as antigen to coat 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon-4, Dynatch Laboratory Inc., Alexandria, VA) (31Chen M. Chan L.S. Cai X.Y. O'Toole E.A. Sample J.C. Woodley D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 108: 68-72Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant NC2/COL protein (100 ng/well) was subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE, then electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Cut strips of the nitrocellulose were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS). After washing with TTBS buffer, the strips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with individual patient antisera or control antisera diluted in TTBS with 5% nonfat dry milk (1:200). The strips were then washed as before with TTBS three times. The immunoreactivity was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Organon Teknika-Cappel, Durham, NC) diluted in TTBS with 5% nonfat dry milk (1:5,000) for 30 min at room temperature and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine directly if the purified recombinant NC2/COL could form hexameric structures (antiparallel dimers), the purified protein was subjected to rotary shadowing electron microscopy by an established protocol (18Morris N.P. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bentz H. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5638-5644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg/ml of the purified NC2/COL protein was dialyzed against 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, and then sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica. The mica was then transferred to a Balzers BAE 250 evaporator and coated while rotating with a mixture of Pt-C at an angle of 6°. The surface replica was floated free from the mica, then transferred to grids in preparation for examination using a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope. A potent eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV was used to express the entire 161 amino acids of the NC2 domain plus 186 amino acids of the adjacent collagenous domain of type VII collagen attached to the type VII collagen signal peptide (Fig.1 A). The signal peptide sequence from human type VII collagen was used because efficient expression and secretion was obtained for the recombinant NC1 domain using the same expression vector (25Chen M. Marinkovich M.P. Veis A. Cai X.Y. Rao C.N. O'Toole E.A. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The expression vector NC2/COL was initially examined by transient transfection of human 293 embryonic kidney cells. Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody against the NC2/COL domain of type VII collagen detected the expression of a 50-kDa doublet in both serum-free medium and cellular extracts of transfected 293 cells (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 4). These bands were absent in the control, vector alone transfected 293 cells (Fig. 1B,lanes 1 and 3). The parental 293 cells did not produce endogenous type VII collagen. Stable cell clones were then established by G418 selection. Northern hybridization of the NC2/COL stably transfected 293 cell clones demonstrated abundant amounts of a 1.5-kilobase pair exogenous mRNA which corresponds in size to that of the cDNA insert (Fig.1C, lane 2). No hybridization, even after longer exposure, was observed with parental 293 cell RNA, indicating that there is very little or no production of endogenous type VII collagen in 293 cells (lane 1). The recombinant NC2/COL was purified from serum-free culture medium from a high expressing 293 cell clone by a two-step procedure. An ammonium sulfate precipitate of the conditioned medium proteins (Fig.2, lane 1) was passed over a Q-Sepharose column. Most of the NC2/COL proteins eluted from the column in high salt fractions (0.8–1 m NaCl) (lane 2). Further purification was achieved using molecular sieve chromatography on a Superdex-200 (lane 3). The final purified yields were 2–5 mg/liter of culture medium. Previous studies suggested that dimerization is catalyzed by binding of the NC2 domain to a specific region of the triple helix (2Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the ability of recombinant NC2/COL to assemble into disulfide-bonded oligomers. Fig. 3 shows that prior to reduction, the recombinant NC2/COL migrated as a disulfide-bonded 300-kDa hexamer, equivalent to one antiparallel dimer (that is, a molecular dimer) (lane 3). Reduction effectively dissociated the aggregate into a 50-kDa monomer of NC2/COL (lane 1). These results indicate that the recombinant NC2/COL is capable of forming a hexameric complex such as those that comprise antiparallel dimers consisting of six α-chains of type VII collagen. To examine whether the adjacent COL domain is required for the hexamer formation, we subjected purified recombinant NC2/COL to collagenase digestion. As also shown in Fig. 3, digestion of NC2/COL by bacterial collagenase converted the 50-kDa NC2/COL into a 32-kDa fragment under reducing conditions (lane 2). This apparent molecule mass corresponds to that expected for the NC2 domain of type VII collagen. Under nonreducing conditions, the 32-kDa NC2 runs as a 64-kDa dimer (D) and a 100-kDa trimer (T), but not as a hexameric complex of 192 kDa (lane 4). The NC2 domain is capable of forming trimers, but not hexamers. Therefore, the 186-amino acid collagenous sequences adjacent to NC2 are essential for the formation of hexamers and the initiation of antiparallel dimers. To determine more directly if NC2/COL formed hexameric structures akin to antiparallel dimers, we subjected purified recombinant protein to rotary shadowing. Rotary-shadowed images of the recombinant NC2/COL showed an extended overlapping rod COL domain with two distinct small globular folding NC2 domains at both ends (Fig.4 A). Within the field of rotary-shadowed structures, some of the molecules were separated along their length and appeared to be held together at their globular ends (Fig. 4 B). The rotary-shadowed molecules measured ∼60 nm within the overlapping COL domains, similar to the 60-nm lengths estimated from intact native type VII collagen dimers (18Morris N.P. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bentz H. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5638-5644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further identify the cysteine residues involved in the formation of the disulfide linkages to stabilize the antiparallel type VII collagen dimers, we generated four site-directed Cys-Ser mutant constructs and transfected them into 293 cells. As shown in the immunoblot analysis in Fig.5 A, transfection with C2634S, C2802S, C2804S, and C2802S/C2804S constructs resulted in the secretion of the 50-kDa NC2/COL at a similar level as wild type (comparelanes 2–5 to 1). Under nonreducing conditions, the protein product of two single cysteine mutations within the NC2 domain (C2802S and C2804S) runs as a 50-kDa monomer, a 100-kDa dimer, and a 150-kDa trimer (lanes 8 and 9). A double cysteine mutation within the NC2 domain (C2802S/C2804S) runs predominately as a 50-kDa monomer, but some 100-kDa dimers are also observed (lane 10). In contrast, a single cysteine mutation within the collagenous domain (C2634S) runs as a 300-kDa hexamer similar to the wild type (lanes 6 and 7). Thus, both cysteine residues at amino acid 2802 and 2804 within the NC2 domain are vital for hexamer (antiparallel dimer) formation. Previous studies have identified a homozygous methionine to lysine missense mutation at the amino acid residue 2798 in a patient with recessive DEB (32Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Hoffman G.G. Zhang X. Tamai Y. Lin A.N. Dietz H.C. Hovnanian A. Uitto J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular defect underlying this mutation, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the same mutation in the NC2/COL construct. As shown in the immunoblot analysis in Fig. 5 B, transfection of the M2798K construct into 293 cells resulted in the secretion of a 50-kDa NC2/COL at a similar level as the wild type (compare lanes 1 and2). Under nonreducing conditions, the M2789K mutation protein product runs mostly as a 50-kDa monomer and a 150-kDa trimer (lane 4). However, the mutation protein product was incapable of forming hexameric complexes. These data indicate that a methione to lysine mutation within the NC2 domain impairs the ability of NC2/COL to form antiparallel dimers. Sequence analysis of the NC2 domain reveals the presence of a segment with homology to Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (12Christiano A.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20256-20262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether NC2 functions as a protease inhibitor. To examine this issue, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and several other proteases with a trypsin-like specificity or other specificities were incubated with the NC1 domain of type VII collagen with and without the presence of purified recombinant NC2/COL added at 10- or 50-fold excess. Recombinant NC1 domain of type VII collagen was selected as the protein substrate simply because of its large size (145 kDa) and the presence of many protease cleavage sites. As shown in Fig.6, degradation of NC1 by either trypsin or chymotrypsin was completely protected by a 50-fold excess of aprotinin (lanes 2 and 6). However, no protective effect could be observed with recombinant NC2/COL added at 10-fold excess (lanes 3 and 7) or 50-fold excess (lanes 4 and 8). The same lack of inhibitory activity of NC2/COL was also found for thrombin and plasmin (data not shown). Previously, we and others have identified the 4 immunodominant epitopes within the NC1 domain of type VII collagen for EBA and BSLE autoantibodies (21Lapiere J.C. Woodley D.T. Parente M.G. Iwasaki T.

In this paper we present evidence supporting the proposed role of Net1 in regulating Cdc14 and exit from mitosis.

An analysis of truncation mutants indicates that the Cdc14 binding site is located within a segment of Net1 containing residues 1–341. We propose that Net1 inhibits by occluding the active site of Cdc14 because it acts as a competitive inhibitor, binds to a site located within the catalytic domain (residues 1–374), binds with reduced affinity to a Cdc14 C283S mutant in which an active site Cys is replaced, and is displaced by tungstate, a transition state analog known to bind in the catalytic site of protein-tyrosine phosphatases.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The onset of mitosis occurs when cyclin-dependent kinases are activated following their association with mitotic cyclins. Exit from mitosis requires the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases, a process that involves the ubiquitination and subsequent destruction of cyclins and other regulatory proteins. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a tightly regulated multisubunit ubiquitin ligase that first initiates anaphase, then exit from mitosis, by targeting proteins for degradation in an ordered and tightly coordinated fashion (for review, see Ref. 14Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, inactivation of the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdc28) occurs by two processes, the APC/C-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent destruction of B-type cyclins (Clb1–6) and the synthesis of the Clb/Cdc28 inhibitor Sic1 (12Morgan D.O.

Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cdc14 dephosphorylates inhibitory sites and thereby activates the APC/C regulator Cdh1/Hct1 so that a subset of mitotic cyclins, Clb2 and Clb3, is targeted for ubiquitination by the APC/C (8Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 10Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Morgan D.O. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Swi5 is a zinc finger transcription factor that is required for expression of theSIC1 gene. The dephosphorylation of Swi5 permits its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it can activate Sic1 transcription (8Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The Sic1 protein itself may be protected from premature degradation when dephosphorylated by Cdc14 (8Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Net1 (also known as Cfi1) is a core component of the nucleolar RENT complex that regulates Cdc14 during the cell cycle (for review, see Refs. 15Visintin R. Amon A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Cockell M.M. Gasser S.M. Curr.

Cell. 1999; 97: 825-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). From G1 to anaphase, Net1 sequesters Cdc14 in the nucleolus, where its access to substrate is limited, and its phosphatase activity is suppressed (18Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C.

At late anaphase, Cdc14 is transiently released from Net1 permitting the active phosphatase to reach targets in the nucleus and cytoplasm (18Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D.

Nature. 1999; 398: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The RENT complex appears to have multiple functions besides Cdc14 regulation including roles in maintaining the integrity of the nucleolus (20de Almeida A. Raccurt I. Peyrol S. Charbonneau M. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 649-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Straight A.F. Shou W. Dowd G.J. Turck C.W. Deshaies R.J. Johnson A.D. Moazed D.

Johnson A.D. Moazed D. Cell. 1999; 97: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity of Sir2 silences rDNA chromatin and represses recombination among tandem rDNA repeats, a deleterious process that leads to senescence of cells (22Guarente L.

Biol. 2000; 10: R708-R711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Cdc14 is released from Net1 is not yet clear, but it is dependent in part on activation of a signaling pathway known as the mitotic exit network (9Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Tinker-Kulberg R.L. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 11Cerutti L. Simanis V. Curr. Opin. Genet.

When the dividing nucleus spans the bud neck during late mitosis, the mitotic exit network pathway is activated, and a signal is propagated which promotes release of Cdc14 (25Bardin A.J. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2000; 102: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Pereira G. Hofken T. Grindlay J. Manson C. Schiebel E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The APC/C-mediated destruction of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1 is not only necessary for sister-chromatid separation but also for the subsequent release of Cdc14 (27Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Shirayama M. Toth A. Galova M. Nasmyth K.

However, Pds1 degradation and Cdc14 release are not sufficient for exit from mitosis unless the Clb5 cyclin has also been destroyed by the APC/C at the metaphase to anaphase transition (28Shirayama M. Toth A. Galova M. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1999; 402: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple controls ensure that exit from mitosis occurs only after chromosome segregation and correct partitioning of the dividing nucleus to the mother and daughter cells (25Bardin A.J. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2000; 102: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Pereira G. Hofken T. Grindlay J. Manson C. Schiebel E. Mol.

Previous studies have not determined whether Net1 on its own is sufficient to inhibit Cdc14 activity. In this paper we have characterized the direct effect of Net1 on Cdc14 activity in vitro. We have shown that a 600-residue NH2-terminal fragment of Net1 alone binds the catalytic domain of Cdc14 and acts as a potent and specific competitive inhibitor of its activity toward physiologic substrates. We have defined a segment of Net1 spanning residues 1–341 which contains the Cdc14 binding site and fully inhibits phosphatase activity. We also provide evidence that Net1 acts by occluding the active site of Cdc14. Plasmids were constructed using standard cloning and polymerase chain reaction techniques as briefly outlined below. The authenticity of all plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing. For two-hybrid analyses, the coding sequence of theCDC14 gene was cloned into the pGBDU-C1 vector (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create pGBDU-CDC14, which encodes a fusion protein with theGAL4 DNA binding domain. Using polymerase chain reaction, the NET1 coding sequence was inserted into pGAD-C1 (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce pGAD-NET1, which expresses a fusion protein with theGAL4 activation domain. Restriction fragments derived from pGAD-NET1 were used to construct a series of six pGAD plasmids encoding fusion proteins comprised of Net1 truncation mutants containing residues 1–601, 1–341, 1–207, 92–341, 342–1189, and 92–1189. A pGAD vector encoding a fusion protein with Net1(1–146) was constructed using a fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The completeSWI5 coding sequence and codons 1–600 of NET1were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pET21a to generate the pET-SWI5-His6 and pET-NET1(1–600)-His6 expression plasmids. A restriction fragment from pGAD-Net1(1–341) was inserted into pET21a to give pET-NET1(1–341)-His6 expression plasmid. All of these pET expression plasmids encode proteins bearing NH2-terminal T7 tags. A two-hybrid screen was performed by transforming the yeast strain PJ69–4A (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the pGBDU-CDC14 plasmid expressing the Cdc14 bait protein. This strain was then transformed with each of three S. cerevisiae Y2HL genomic libraries (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and about 2 × 106 colonies with each library were screened for activation of the HIS3and ADE2 reporter genes (see below). After establishing that reporter activation was dependent on the presence of both bait and target proteins, plasmids from positive clones were isolated and sequenced. This screen identified several positive clones containing 5′-coding sequences from the yeast YJL076W (NET1) gene. Two-hybrid assays were used to assess the ability of Net1 truncation mutants to interact with Cdc14. After transformation of the yeast strain PJ69–4A (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the pGBDU-CDC14 plasmid and a pGAD vector encoding one of the Net1 truncation mutants (see above) cells were plated on medium permitting detection of reporter gene activation. Ade+ cells were identified by growth on SC medium lacking adenine, leucine, and uracil, whereas His+ cells grew on SC medium lacking histidine, leucine, and uracil but containing 1 mm 3-aminotriazole. Activation of the lacZreporter gene was assessed by performing liquid β-galactosidase assays as described (31James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast GST-Cdc14 and GST-Cdc14(1–374) were overexpressed in Escherichia coliBL21 (DE3) cells as described (1Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) except that lysates were treated with polyethyleneimine (PEI) prior to affinity purification. Using a stock solution of 5% (w/v) PEI at pH 8, lysates were adjusted to a final PEI concentration of 0.15% (w/v) and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, mixed and clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) prior to purification using glutathione-Sepharose (1Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The GST-HCdc14A (1) and GST-HCdc14B (1) fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli BL21 (DE3) cells from pET-GST vectors (1Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and purified from PEI-treated extracts as described above. The TC45 splice variant of the human T cell phosphatase was expressed and purified using the method of Hao et al. (32Hao L. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29322-29329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant VHR and PPT1 protein phosphatases were provided by Drs. Zhong-Yin Zhang and S. Rossie, respectively. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with expression plasmids encoding Net1(1–600)-His6, Net1(1–341)-His6, and Swi5-His6 were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until theA 600 was about 0.7. Following the addition of 50 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells expressing Net1(1–600)-His6 and Swi5-His6 were grown for 14–16 h at room temperature, whereas cells producing Net1(1–341)-His6 were induced with 400 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 4 h at 30 °C. Swi5-His6 and Net1(1–600)-His6 were purified directly from extracts using His-Bind resin (Novagen) according to protocols from the manufacturer, whereas lysates containing Net1(1–341)-His6were treated with PEI as described above before purification on His-Bind resin. For further purification, Net1(1–600)-His6 (1–2 mg) was dialyzed with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), loaded on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column, and eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Peak fractions were combined, dialyzed with 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercapthoethanol for phosphatase assays or with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.6 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for in vitro binding assays and concentrated with Centricon-10 (Amicon) membranes. Net1(1–341)-His6 was purified further on a Sephacryl S300 HR 1 × 80-cm column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.6, 350 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercapthoethanol and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using the fast protein liquid chromatography system. Peak fractions were combined and concentrated by either ultrafiltration with a Centriprep-10 (Amicon) membrane or dehydration in a dialysis bag covered with dry Sephadex G-25. Sic1-Myc-His6 was expressed as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein and purified as described (33Verma R. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Carr S.A. Reynard G. Deshaies R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The Cdc28 cyclin-dependent kinase was immunopurified from yeast as a complex with either the Clb2 or Cln2 cyclin carrying epitope tags derived from human influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) as described (34Futcher B. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 80-84Google Scholar). Yeast with copies of either GAL1-HA-CLB2 orGAL1-HA-CLN2 genes were grown in medium containing 2% galactose to induce expression and disrupted with glass beads. The HA-Clb2·Cdc28 and HA-Cln2·Cdc28 kinase complexes were immunopurified from extracts using 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads (34Futcher B. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 80-84Google Scholar). GST, GST-Cdc14, and GST-Cdc14 C283S affinity matrices were prepared by adding 0.5 nmol of each protein to 200 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose in binding buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Each mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a final volume of 1 ml buffer B. The supernatant was removed, and each of the three affinity matrices was suspended in buffer B and split into two aliquots of equal volume. 1 nmol of Net1 in buffer B was added to one aliquot of each affinity matrix (final volume of 1 ml of buffer B), whereas the second sample of affinity resin received an equal volume of buffer B without Net1. After mixing by inversion for 30 min at 4 °C, the resin was centrifuged and washed four times with 1 ml of buffer B containing 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. Washed beads were suspended in 50 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and an aliquot (20 μl) was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. Densitometry was used to estimate the relative amounts of Net1 fragment and GST-Cdc14 proteins in the SDS gels assuming that the two proteins have equal staining with Coomassie dye. Images of gels dried between translucent membranes were obtained from a scanner (Astra 2200, Umax) used in the transparency mode and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Swi5 and histone H1 were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP using the partially purified HA-Clb2·Cdc28 complex, whereas Sic1 was phosphorylated with the HA-Cln2·Cdc28 kinase (see above). Myelin basic protein (MBP) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was phosphorylated on tyrosine using GST-lyn kinase as described (35Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled casein phosphorylated on Ser residues was provided by Dr. S. Rossie. Protein substrate concentrations given herein represent the total concentration of phosphorylated residues used in each assay. The phosphatase activity of yeast Cdc14, HCdc14A, HCdc14B, VHR, and TC45 toward pNPP and protein substrates was measured as described (1Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Hao L. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29322-29329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in reactions carried out at 30 °C for 5–40 min in buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Assays with radiolabeled Sic1, Swi5, histone H1, and Tyr(P)-MBP substrates were performed in a total volume of 30 μl; 50-μl reactions were employed for pNPP and casein. The final assay buffer for yeast PPT1 contained 56 mm Tris, 36 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 1.8 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6 μm phosphocasein. Digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (0.15 μg) was performed for 60 min at room temperature with 75.5 μg Net1(1–600) in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, 4 mm Tris, 22 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm KCl, 3% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Cleavage with 1.5 μg of endoproteinase Arg-C (stored at −20 °C in water) was carried out at 30 °C as described above for staphylococcal V8 protease except that the digestion buffer contained 80 mmammonium bicarbonate at pH 8. Aliquots (50 μl) of each digest were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described previously (32Hao L. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29322-29329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The remainder of each reaction (equivalent to 1 nmol of the Net1(1–600) fragment) was stopped by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and used for in vitro binding assays with affinity matrices containing 0.25 nmol of GST-Cdc14 or GST (see above). For amino acid sequencing, proteolytic fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described (36Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein bands on the membrane were stained with Coomassie Blue, excised, and analyzed by automated gas phase sequencing. Because of its high affinity for Cdc14, the Henderson method (37Henderson P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) for tight binding inhibitors was used for the analysis of Net1 inhibition. For these experiments, the activity of GST-Cdc14 (5 nm) was measured at six different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.27 to 17 μm Tyr(P)-MBP. For each concentration of substrate, six assays were performed with Net1(1–600) concentrations between 0 and 100 nm. For each substrate concentration, the value It/(1 −v i/v 0) was plotted on they axis versus v 0/v i on the xaxis, where It is the total Net1(1–600) concentration, andv i and v 0 are the velocities with and without inhibitor, respectively. This plot generates a series of lines for each concentration of substrate which were fit by unweighted linear regression using a fixed intercept value of 5 nm, which was the total enzyme concentration (37Henderson P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). TheK i and mechanism of inhibition were determined from a replot of the slopes of these lines versus substrate concentration. In addition to a genetic screen described by Shou et al. (18Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), we and others (19Visintin R. Hwang E.S. Amon A. Nature. 1999; 398: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) also identified Net1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen for regulators or substrates of Cdc14 (TableI). Along with the immunolocalization and genetic studies (18Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J.

Cell. 1999; 91: 649-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these two-hybrid results support the notion that Net1 and Cdc14 interact in vivo, but they fail to establish whether this interaction is direct or mediated by other proteins. To determine whether there is a direct interaction between Net1 and Cdc14 in vitro, we used binding assays employing recombinant GST-Cdc14 (1Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and Net1(1–600)-His6. This NH2-terminal fragment of Net1 was used to preclude problems associated with the bacterial expression of the 1,189-residue full-length protein. Sequence analysis of Net1 clones obtained in our two-hybrid screens indicated that the NH2-terminal half of Net1 (residues 1–641) interacted with Cdc14. A two-hybrid assay confirmed that a fragment of Net1 containing residues 1–601 could interact with Cdc14 (Table I, third row).Table ITwo-hybrid interaction of Net1 or Net1 mutants with Cdc14Activation domain fusion proteinADE2activationHIS3activation1-aTransformants were screened for activation of the HIS3 gene on SC-His-Leu-uracil medium containing 1 mm 3-aminotriazole.LacZactivationβ-Gal activity1-bβ-Galactosidase activities are the mean of values obtained in triplicate.

https://openalex.org/W2050026707,"We have characterized a novel Sac domain-containing inositol phosphatase, hSac2. It was ubiquitously expressed but especially abundant in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Unlike other Sac domain-containing proteins, hSac2 protein exhibited 5-phosphatase activity specific for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. This is the first time that the Sac domain has been reported to possess 5-phosphatase activity. Its 5-phosphatase activity for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Km = 14.3 μm) was comparable with those of Type II 5-phosphatases. These results imply that hSac2 functions as an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. We have characterized a novel Sac domain-containing inositol phosphatase, hSac2. It was ubiquitously expressed but especially abundant in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Unlike other Sac domain-containing proteins, hSac2 protein exhibited 5-phosphatase activity specific for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. This is the first time that the Sac domain has been reported to possess 5-phosphatase activity. Its 5-phosphatase activity for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Km = 14.3 μm) was comparable with those of Type II 5-phosphatases. These results imply that hSac2 functions as an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol (3Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirshner M.W. J.

These lipids are now widely recognized as important regulators in a variety of cellular functions such as membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell survival and cell proliferation (1Cremona O.

A variety of phosphoinositides are hydrolyzed by phosphatases with different substrate specificities. They are classified into four groups according to the position of the phosphate that they hydrolyze, 1-, 3-, 4-, or 5-phosphatase. Among many phosphoinositide phosphatases, 5-phosphatase forms a fairly large family. According to the substrate specificity, it is classified into four types. Type I 5-phosphatases hydrolyze only water-soluble substrates such as Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (5Verjans B. De Smedt F. Lecocq R. Vanweyenberg V. Moreau C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Type II enzymes hydrolyze not only the water-soluble inositol phosphates but also lipid substrates such as PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. Type II 5-phosphatases are further divided into four subgroups. All type II 5-phosphatases have two conserved motifs, WXGDXNXR and KXRXPAW(T/C)DR(I/V)LW(R/)K. The first subgroup includes a 75-kDa protein isolated from human platelets and is now called 5-phosphatase II or GIP (GAP domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase) (6Ross T.S. Jefferson A.B. Mitchell C.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20283-20289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This subgroup also includes Lowe's oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL) protein. This protein hydrolyzes the phospholipid substrates 10–30-fold more than type I 5-phosphatase (7Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the kidney proximal tubule cells from a Lowe's syndrome patient, PI(4,5)P2 was found to accumulate, even though other inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases were present, suggesting that OCRL protein regulates the PI(4,5)P2 levels in the cells (8Zhang X. Hartz P.A. Philip E. Racusen L.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1574-1582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Synaptojanin 1 and 2 are also subjected to group II enzymes that participate in synaptic vesicle trafficking. Synaptojanin forms complexes with dynamin, amphiphysin, and Grb2 to promote synaptic vesicle recycling (9McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 10Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Synaptojanins contain two phosphatase domains. One is a phosphatase domain at the C terminus, which is common to all type II 5-phosphatases. This domain can hydrolyze PI(4,5)P2 to PI(4)P but cannot use PI(4)P, PI(3)P, or PI(3,5)P2 as a substrate (11Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition to this 5-phosphatase, synaptojanins contain Sac domains in the N terminus, which are homologous to yeast Sac1. Recently, the synaptojanin Sac domain and yeast Sac1 protein were found to dephosphorylate PI(4)P, PI(3)P, and PI(3,5)P2 but not PI(4,5)P2 (12Guo S. Stolz E.L. Lemrow M.S. York D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thus synaptojanins have both a PI(4,5)P2 5-phosphatase activity and a phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. Proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIPP) is a recently identified type II 5-phosphatase that localizes at membrane ruffling areas (13Mochizuki Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36970-36975Google Scholar). This phosphatase hydrolyzes phosphate at the 5-position of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and PI(4,5)P2. 5-Phosphatase that induces arbolization (Pharbin) and skeletal muscle- and kidney-enriched inositol phosphatase (SKIP) also seem to be members of the type II 5-phosphatases (14Asano T. Mochizuki Y. Matsumoto K. Takenawa T. Endo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,15Ijuin T. Mochizuki Y. Fukami K. Funaki M. Asano T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10870-10875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pharbin has a CaaX motif at the C terminus and localizes at membranes. It hydrolyzes Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 more effectively than PI(4,5)P2. On the other hand, SKIP preferentially hydrolyzes phosphoinositides, such as PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 to water-soluble inositol polyphosphates. Type III enzymes hydrolyze phosphate at the 5-position of phosphoinositide and inositol polyphosphate, which have a 3-position phosphate group. There are two such enzymes designated as SHIP 1 and 2 SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (16Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 17Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). SHIPs contain an SH2 domain at the N terminus and form complexes with intracellular signaling molecules such as Grb2 and Shc (18Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D.A. Chin S.M. Deuter-Reinhard M. Jefferson A.B. Norris F.A. Masiarz F.R. Cousens L.S. Majerus P.W. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 438-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because these enzymes hydrolyze PI 3-kinase products such as PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, SHIPs are thought to have a negative function and to terminate signals from PI 3-kinase. Type IV 5-phosphatase was originally reported to hydrolyze only PI(3,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, but it has now been found that it also hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2 (19Kisseleva V.M. Wilson P.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20110-20116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, this group of 5-phosphatases does not use water-soluble inositol phosphates as substrates. The Sac domain was originally found in yeast Sac1p (20Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis A.V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Novick P. Osmond C.B. Botstein D.D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 659-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TheSAC1 mutation suppressed the phenotypes seen in Sec14mutant yeast. Sec14p is the yeast PI/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein. Several of the Sac domain-containing proteins have been identified in yeast. Fig4p protein, which was composed only of the Sac domain, was identified from the yeast mutant that causes mating defects (22Erdman S. Lin L. Malczynski M. Snyder M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p are 5-phosphatases that contain the Sac domain in the N terminus-like synaptojanin. Recently, Guoet al. (12Guo S. Stolz E.L. Lemrow M.S. York D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) found that these Sac domains, except Inp51p, possess phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. The Sac domain is ∼400 amino acids in length and consists of seven conserved motifs that appear to define the catalytic regions of enzyme activity (see Fig. 3). The sequence RXNCLDCLDRTN within the sixth motif is the most particular. The CX5R(T/S) motif found within this sequence appears to define the catalytic region of the phosphatase and is also seen in a variety of metal-independent protein phosphatases (12Guo S. Stolz E.L. Lemrow M.S. York D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition to synaptojanins, three additional Sac domain-containing proteins (KIAA0851, KIAA0966, and KIAA0274) exist in humans. Among these proteins, only the rat homolog of KIAA0851 (rSac1), which is the most closely related to yeast Sac1p, was characterized (23Nemoto Y. Kearns G.B. Wenk R.M. Cherr H. Mori K. Alb G.J. De Camilli P. Bankaitis A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34293-34305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This enzyme showed the same spectrum for the substrate specificity of yeast Sac1p and hydrolyzed PI(3)P > PI(4)P > PI(3,5)P2. However, KIAA0966 (hSac2) and KIAA0274 (hSac3) still have not been characterized. We studied the characterization of hSac2 and determined the lipid specificity. This enzyme has a different substrate specificity than rSac1, in that it can dephosphorylate the 5-position of phosphoinositide, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3. It hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2 most effectively, and its substrate specificity for PI(4,5)P2 is comparable with those of Type II phosphatases. Phosphoinositides (PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol (Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) were purchased from Cell Signals, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Science Products. Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin and rhodamine-labeled phalloidin were each purchased from Sigma and Molecular Probes. Polyclonal antibody against c-Myc was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Full-length human cDNA clone of human Sac2 (GenBankTM accession number Hj06369) was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute. hSac2 is a 4924-bp cDNA with 17-bp poly(A)+ stretch, which was inserted at theSalI-NotI site of pBluescript II SK+ vector. A membrane containing mRNA (2 μg of poly(A) was contained in each lane) (human 12-lane multiple tissue Northern blot) was purchased from CLONTECH. The N-terminal 666-base pair cDNA were 32P-labeled using a random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo) following the manufacturer's protocol. The expression constructs of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or GST-tagged full-length hSac2 (GST·hSac2) were constructed as follows. GST construct was produced by ligatingBglII-BamHI site polymerase chain reaction products encoding full-length GST amplified from pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector into the BamHI site of pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Then BamHI-NotI site full-length hSac2 fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction were introduced into the BamHI site of the GST construct (GST·hSac2). The GST and GST·hSac2 proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells by infecting them with 1 ml of 1 × 109 units/ml recombinant virus and cultured in Sf 900 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum at 28 °C for 48 h. Baculovirus-expressing Sf9 cells were centrifuged and lysed in a cold lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cells were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to 400 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), then washed five times with a wash buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and three times with assay buffers for phosphoinositide phosphatase (50 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mmKCl, 0.25% β-d-octyl glucoside, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The recombinant proteins were eluted with three bed volumes of elution buffer (10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-maleate, pH 6.0). Phosphoinositide phosphatase and inositol 5-phosphatase activity assays were carried out as described by Maehama et al. (24Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 175-176Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using 50 μmPI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(5)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, Ins(1,4,5)P3, and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as substrates and purified baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins as enzymes. Recombinant hSac2 protein was added, the mixture was further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the phosphate release was quantified using a malachite green-based colorimetric assay for inorganic phosphate. (24Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 175-176Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The 5-phosphatase activity for PI(4,5)P2 was measured as follows. The PI(5)P 4-kinase was used to produce [32P]PI(4,5)P2. Myc-tagged full-length human PI(5)P 4-kinase α was expressed in COS-7 cells and purified by imunoprecipitation with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody. The PI(5)P/PI(4,5)P2 mixture was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and then dried with nitrogen gas. A phosphatase activity assay was performed under the same conditions as described above. The lipids were extracted and separated by TLC usingn-propyl alcohol, 2 m acetic acid (2:1, v/v) and visualized by autoradiography. An investigation of the effect of cations or chelate, and pH on enzyme activity was carried out under the same conditions described above. Phosphatase activities were examined under various conditions of cations or chelate and pH values in Tris maleate or Tris/HCl buffer in the presence of 50 μm PI(4,5)P2 as substrate were determined. The Sac domain is a recently identified novel inositol polyphosphate phosphatase, and several family proteins have been identified in yeast. Nemoto et al. (23Nemoto Y. Kearns G.B. Wenk R.M. Cherr H. Mori K. Alb G.J. De Camilli P. Bankaitis A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34293-34305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) identified a rat homologue of yeast Sac1p, which was a prototypic member of the Sac domain-containing protein. Sac domain-containing proteins possess conserved amino acid motifs that are essential for inositol polyphosphate phosphatase activities. In an attempt to identify another member of the Sac domain-containing proteins, we searched the cDNA data base based on the amino acid sequence of these motifs and identified two novel clones. One is KIAA0274, (GenBankTM accession number NM014845) which is homologous to yeast Fig4p protein (22Erdman S. Lin L. Malczynski M. Snyder M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The other is KIAA0966 (GenBankTM accession number XM005971), a 4923-bp clone, with an estimated open reading frame of 3396-bp that encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 120 kDa (Fig.1). Unlike other Sac domain-containing proteins, KIAA0966 has no yeast counterparts (Fig.2). We named this hSac2 (human Sac2). hSac2 shares 34.2% amino acid identity with Sac1p and possesses seven motifs conserved in the Sac domain-containing proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, an active site motif CX5R(T/S) is found within the sixth motif, which also exists in metal-independent protein phosphatases and inositol polyphosphate phosphatases. Some dissimilar amino acids in the fifth motif (Val417 to Asp427) were also observed (Fig. 3).Figure 2Comparison of the domain structures of the various Sac domain-containing proteins. hSac2, yeast Sac1p, rat Sac1p, Inp52p, and Inp53p share the homology sequence at the C terminus of the Sac domain (white box). Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p have a type II 5-phosphatase catalytic domain and a proline-rich region at the C terminus of the protein. However, hSac2 has no putative domain besides the Sac domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of hSac2 was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. The 4.9-kilobase transcript was detected in every tissue tested but was especially high in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta (Fig.4). The Sac-containing proteins studied so far exhibited intrinsic inositol phosphatase activities. Yeast Sac1 and rat Sac1 exhibited phosphatase activities for PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(3,5)P2 but not PI(4,5)P2(22Erdman S. Lin L. Malczynski M. Snyder M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 461-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We expressed GST-conjugated full-length hSac-2 protein in insect cells and purified the protein. The intrinsic phosphatase activities of the purified recombinant protein for the phosphoinositides were analyzed. Unexpectedly, hSac2 only hydrolyzed PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, as synaptojanin 1 or SKIP did (Fig.5 a). It did not hydrolyze PI(3)P, PI(4)P or PI(3,5)P2, as rat Sac1 did. We also analyzed its phosphatase activities for inositol phosphates, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Neither of them was hydrolyzed, and this revealed that hSac2 is a phosphoinositide-specific 5-phosphatase (Fig. 5 a). The mutant in which asparagine at amino acid 460 was replaced with alanine lost its phosphatase activity, suggesting that the Sac domain is the only domain responsible for phosphatase activity (data not shown). The apparent Km value of the PI(4,5)P25-phosphatase activity determined by a Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis was 14.3 μm, which was comparable with those of Type II 5-phosphatase, SKIP and synaptojanin 1 (Fig. 5, b andc) (15Ijuin T.

To determine whether hSac2 is a 4-phosphatase or 5-phosphatase, we generated 32P-labeled PI(4,5)P2 from PI(5)P using PI(5)P 4-kinase α (26Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Then 32P-labeled PI(4,5)P2 was incubated with the recombinant hSac2 protein. If hSac2 is a 5-phosphatase, labeled PI(4)P will be formed, and if it is a 4-phosphatase, labeled phosphate is hydrolyzed and only unlabeled PI(5)P will be generated. As shown in Fig.6, labeled phosphatidylinositol monophosphate was formed by the incubation with hSac2 protein. This result confirmed that hSac2 is a 5-phosphatase. To further characterize the enzymatic activities, we analyzed the optimal pH for the phosphatase activities of hSac2. High phosphatase activity was maintained over a wide range between pH 5.5 and 8.0 and was optimal at pH 6.0 (Fig.7 a). Next we examined the effect of cations on the catalytic activities. Guo et al. (12Guo S. Stolz E.L. Lemrow M.S. York D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) reported that inositol phosphatase activity of the Sac domain of yeast Inp53p was inhibited partly by Mg2+. However, in the presence of Mg2+ or K+, phosphatase activities were slightly up-regulated, and addition of 5 mmMg2+ in the presence of 25 mm K+increased the PI(4,5)P2 activity 4-fold (Fig.7 b). Addition of other cations, such as Mn2+ or Ca2+, or EDTA did not affect PI(4,5)P25-phosphatase activity of hSac2. In this study, we found that hSac2 is 5-phosphatase for PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. This is the first report to demonstrate that the Sac domain has phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase activity, whereas the Sac domain of yeast Sac1p and rat Sac1 has already been shown to dephosphorylate PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(3,5)P2. As shown in Fig. 3, the motifs of the catalytic site of the Sac domain in hSac2 are conserved, but some alternations in other parts of the Sac domain are present, which may contribute to the substrate specificity. Thus far phosphoinositide and inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases have been classified into five types. In these types, all phosphatases have two conserved motifs that are essential for 5-phosphatase activity. However, hSac2 does not contain such motifs, and phosphatase activity seems to exist in the Sac domain, suggesting a new type of phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase. We report here that the hSac2 protein is a 5-phosphatase of which the substrate specificity is different from that of the rat Sac1, suggesting that each Sac domain may have different substrate specificity. In mammalians, at least three Sac-containing proteins (Sac1, Sac2, and Sac3) are present in addition to synaptojanins. Thus it remains to be determined whether these Sac proteins have different substrate specificities and functions. We thank Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan) for kindly donating a cDNA clone of KIAA0966 (hSac2) and Dr. Takeshi Endo (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan) for much helpful advice."

Previous studies suggest that scrapie is transmitted naturally through exposure to the scrapie agent in wasted placentas of infected ewes. This study determined the distribution and biochemical properties of PrP cellular (PrP-C) and the distribution of PrP scrapie (PrP-Sc) in reproductive, placental, and selected fetal tissues and fetal fluids in sheep. Glycosylated, N-terminally truncated, proteinase K-sensitive PrP-C with apparent molecular masses of 23–37 kDa was present in reproductive, placental, and fetal tissues and fetal fluids. PrP-C was low or undetectable in intercotyledonary chorioallantois, amnion, urachus, amniotic fluid, and fetal urine. In pregnant ewes, cotyledonary chorioallantois, allantoic fluid, and caruncular endometrium contained higher levels of PrP-C than did intercaruncular endometrium, myometrium, oviduct, ovary, fetal bladder, or fetal kidney. Caruncular endometrial PrP-C was up-regulated during pregnancy. Despite the wide distribution of PrP-C in reproductive, placental, and selected fetal tissues and fetal fluid, PrP-Sc was detected only in caruncular endometrium and cotyledonary chorioallantois of pregnant scrapie-infected ewes. The embryo/fetus may not be exposed to scrapie in utero because it is separated physically from PrP-positive allantois and chorioallantois by PrP-negative amnion.

In pregnant ewes, cotyledonary chorioallantois, allantoic fluid, and caruncular endometrium contained higher levels of PrP-C than did intercaruncular endometrium, myometrium, oviduct, ovary, fetal bladder, or fetal kidney. Caruncular endometrial PrP-C was up-regulated during pregnancy. Despite the wide distribution of PrP-C in reproductive, placental, and selected fetal tissues and fetal fluid, PrP-Sc was detected only in caruncular endometrium and cotyledonary chorioallantois of pregnant scrapie-infected ewes. The embryo/fetus may not be exposed to scrapie in utero because it is separated physically from PrP-positive allantois and chorioallantois by PrP-negative amnion. proteinase K prion PrP cellular PrP scrapie recombinant ovine PrP monoclonal antibody peptide:N-glycosidase F Scrapie in sheep and goats is a naturally occurring fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of the abnormally folded, PK1-resistant prion protein (PrP-Sc) (1Caughey B.

J. 1974; 130: lxv-lxviiCrossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reported that oral inoculation with placental membranes derived from scrapie-infected ewes caused scrapie in both sheep and goats. Race et al. (9Race R. Jenny A. Sutton D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) recently showed that PrP-Sc was detected by Western blotting in the placenta from scrapie-infected ewes and scrapie infectivity in tissue homogenates of placental membranes. Under natural conditions, fetal fluids and placental tissues are expelled during or shortly after parturition and contaminate the body surface of the dam and the area where lambing takes place. Lambs may be exposed to scrapie by ingesting the transmissible agent during contact with contaminated wool and mammary gland of the dam. Adult sheep in the same flock may also be exposed orally through contaminated feed sources.In the present study, we investigated the distribution of PrP-C and biochemical properties of PrP-C and distribution of PrP-Sc in the ovine female reproductive, placental, and selected fetal tissues and fetal fluids of infected and uninfected ewes. In contrast to the ubiquitous distribution of PrP-C in the female reproductive tract and conceptuses, PrP-Sc was present only in the uterine caruncular endometrium and placental cotyledonary chorioallantois of pregnant infected ewes. N-terminally truncated, glycosylated, PK-sensitive PrP-C with apparent molecular masses of 23–37 kDa was present in cotyledonary chorioallantois, allantoic fluid, fetal bladder, and fetal kidney as well as endometrium, myometrium, oviduct, and ovary of pregnant and nonpregnant uninfected ewes. PrP-C levels were low or undetectable in intercotyledonary chorioallantois, amnion, urachus, amniotic fluid, and fetal urine. In pregnant ewes, cotyledonary chorioallantois, allantoic fluid, or caruncular endometrium contained higher (p < 0.05) levels of PrP-C than did intercaruncular endometrium, myometrium, oviduct, ovary, fetal bladder, or fetal kidney. PrP-C expression in caruncular endometrium was up-regulated (p < 0.05) during pregnancy when compared with caruncular endometrial PrP-C of nonpregnant ewes. Pregnancy status had no effect on PrP-C expression in the brain, myometrium, oviduct, and ovary. PrP-C detected in uninfected ewes had a protein core of ∼18–22 kDa in tissues and ∼16.5 kDa in allantoic fluid.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrated that PrP-C was differentially expressed by tissues and fluids of the female reproductive tract and conceptuses. Despite the wide distribution of PrP-C in the reproductive, placental, and fetal tissues and fetal fluids, PrP-Sc accumulation was only detected in the caruncular endometrium and cotyledonary chorioallantois of the placentome from pregnant infected ewes. These results may implicate a role of PrP-C in reproductive and fetal physiology and facilitate a further understanding of prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal transmission of scrapie under field conditions.The biochemical properties of PrP-C in ovine reproductive, fetal, and placental tissues and fetal fluids have not been reported. This study used mAbs recognizing nonoverlapping epitopes of PrP to characterize PrP-C in these tissues and fluids. mAb binding showed that PrP-C in these tissues and fluids had an intact C terminus; however, the N terminus of PrP-C in reproductive, placental, and selected fetal tissues and allantoic fluid was differentially truncated. After theN-linked carbohydrate structures of PrP-C were removed, the protein core of ∼29 kDa may represent the full-length PrP-C and that of ∼18–22 kDa may represent the N-terminally truncated, potentially PK-resistant, C-terminal fragment of PrP-C (24Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Manson J.C. Brown P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results suggest that PrP-C in these tissues and allantoic fluid is differentially glycosylated and truncated, giving rise to various apparent molecular masses. The results are consistent with the intrinsic partial protease resistance of the C-terminal portion of PrP-C in several species (27Buschmann A. Kuczius T. Bodemer W. Groschup M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), indicating that an intermediate C-terminal fragment is present in many of the peripheral tissues as a result of limited protease digestion of PrP-C prior to a complete proteolysis. The additional truncation of PrP-C in allantoic fluid may indicate a further processing by proteases in the allantoic fluid, which is suggested by the synthesis and secretion of a number of proteases by the ovine placenta during pregnancy (30Xie S.C. Low B.G. Nagel R.J. Kramer K.K. Anthony R.V. Zoli A.P. Beckers J.F. Roberts R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Green J.A. Xie S. Roberts R.M. Rev. Reprod. 1998; 3: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The present study investigated the distribution of both PrP-C and PrP-Sc in the ovine reproductive tract, placental and selected fetal tissues, and fetal fluids. The findings suggest potential sites of maternal transmission of scrapie. In sheep, the ovum is released from the ovary at estrus, and it takes 3–4 days for the ovum to reach the uterus through the oviduct, where the ovum is fertilized to form an embryo. The embryo will not be hatched from the zona pellucida, a noncellular mucoprotein structure immediately surrounding the embryo, until it is in the uterus. The present study showed that PrP-C, but not PrP-Sc, was present in the ovine ovary and oviduct. Our findings with four pregnant infected ewes are consistent with the report that scrapie infectivity was absent from ovaries of seven infected ewes (32Hadlow W.J. Race R.E. Kennedy R.C. Eklund C.M. Prusiner S.B. Hadlow W.J. Slow Transmissible Diseases of the Nervous System. Academic Press, New York1979: 3-12Google Scholar). However, Hourrigan et al. (33Hourrigan J.L. J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 1990; 196: 1678-1679PubMed Google Scholar) reported that scrapie infectivity was detected in ovaries of 4 of 14 ewes with unknown reproductive status. The presence of PrP-C or PrP-Sc in the ova, preimplantation embryos, and the zona pellucida with attached granulosa cells has not been reported. Although studies using embryo transfer to determine scrapie (34Foster J.D. McKelvey W.A. Mylne M.J. Williams A. Hunter N. Hope J. Fraser H. Vet.

Virol. 1999; 80: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) transmission by preimplantation embryos were conducted by several laboratories, the presence of PrP-Sc in embryos and disease transmission through embryos remain inconclusive (20Wrathall A.E. Rev. Sci. Tech. 1997; 16: 240-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Ridley R.M. Baker H.F. Br. Med. J. 1995; 311: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 39Ridley R.M. Baker H.F. Nature. 1996; 384: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). More studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm ovarian PrP-Sc using both bioassay and Western blotting.PrP-C was abundantly present in the ovine uterus, which confirmed the previous finding (4Horiuchi M. Yamazaki N. Ikeda T. Ishiguro N. Shinagawa M. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2583-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); our study extended that observation by demonstrating that PrP-C was detectable in direct tissue homogenates of separated caruncular and intercaruncular endometria and myometrium. In addition, higher levels of PrP-C were detected in pregnant caruncular endometrium than in nonpregnant caruncular endometrium, suggesting that PrP-C is up-regulated during pregnancy. Since PrP-C up-regulation was limited to the caruncular region (caruncles) of the endometrium of pregnant ewes, it suggests that the intimate cellular contact or factor(s) synthesized and released by the apposing cotyledonary chorioallantois (cotyledon) as well as pregnancy-associated hormones and cytokines at the interface play a role in regulating PrP-C synthesis by the maternal endometrium. Since the caruncular endometrium is glandless and PrP-C was low in intercaruncular endometrium (rich in glands), PrP-C in caruncular endometrium may be primarily contributed by the surface endometrial epithelium. The present study for the first time demonstrated that PrP-Sc was present in the caruncular endometrium, but not in intercaruncular endometrium of the uterus of pregnant scrapie-infected ewes. These findings are consistent with the observation that low levels of scrapie infectivity were present in the ovine uterus, although the report provided no details on reproductive status of the animals and specific parts of the ovine uterus tested (33Hourrigan J.L. J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 1990; 196: 1678-1679PubMed Google Scholar).As the allantois grows during early gestation, it fuses with the chorion to form chorioallantois, which establishes extensive contact with the uterine endometrium at both caruncular and intercaruncular regions. The most intimate contact between the uterus and placenta is within the placentome (Fig. 1). In contrast to the placentation of primates and rodents, the conceptuses (fetus and associated membranes) of ruminants establish interactions with the uterus through noninvasive placentation within the uterine lumen. The cellular interactions and molecular exchange are active at the fetal-maternal interface of placentomes where leakage of maternal blood by endometrial villi and phagocytosis of maternal blood and degenerating endometrial cells by fetal trophoblast cells take place (40Wimsatt W.A. Am. J. Anat. 1950; 87: 391-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 41Burton G.J. Samuel C.A. Steven D.H. Q. J. Exp. Physiol. Cogn. Med.

The placental trophoblast cells may acquire nonspecifically pathogens at the interface during the physiological process of uptake nutrients during gestation. The present study and studies by others showed that scrapie infectivity (7Pattison I.H. Hoare M.N. Jebbett J.N. Watson W.A. Vet. Rec. 1972; 90: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Pattison I.H. Hoare M.N. Jebbett J.N. Watson W.A. Br. Vet.

Muramatsu Y. Shinagawa M. Microbiol. Immunol. 1993; 37: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), PrP-Sc (9Race R. Jenny A. Sutton D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and PrP-C (44Kubosaki A. Ueno A. Matsumoto Y. Doi K. Saeki K. Onodera T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are present in the ovine uterus and placenta; therefore, PrP-Sc in the cotyledonary chorioallantois may be derived from direct phagocytosis of or conversion by the maternal PrP-Sc in the caruncular endometrium of infected ewes.As the embryo develops, the amnion is formed and filled with amniotic fluid in which the embryo is suspended. The fetal urine and lung liquid secretion are the primary sources for amniotic fluid. The allantois is formed as a result of outgrowth of the hindgut and filled with allantoic fluid surrounding the amnion (Fig. 1). The allantoic fluid is primarily derived from fetal urine drained from the bladder through the urachus. Allantoic fluid may also be derived from chorioallantois secretion (45Wintour E.M. Laurence B.M. Lingwood B.E. Aust. Vet. J. 1986; 63: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The present study showed that high levels of soluble PrP-C were present in allantoic fluid, but not in other fetal fluids such as amniotic fluid and fetal urine. The source for allantoic fluid PrP-C was not directly determined. The absence of detectable PrP-C in fetal urine and amnion fluid shown in this study may indicate that fetal kidney, bladder, and urachus do not secret detectable PrP-C into the urine, although PrP-C is synthesized by the kidney and bladder. Thus, we conclude that cotyledonary chorioallantois may be the primary source for allantoic PrP-C. The presence of PK-resistant allantoic PrP could not be demonstrated in the present study due to the presence of protease inhibitors in allantoic fluid.Taken together, it appears that PrP-Sc is only present in tissues (such as caruncular endometrium and cotyledonary chorioallantois) expressing high levels of PrP-C, and the embryo/fetus is physically separated from the PrP-rich allantoic fluid and chorioallantois by the amnion, which has no detectable PrP-C. Based on the results of this study and previous reports, we propose that the ovine embryo/fetus may not be exposed to scrapie prior to parturition. The oocyte or early conceptus may not be exposed to PrP-Sc prior to hatching in the uterus, because the presence of an intact zona pellucida at this stage may protect the embryos from infection, as suggested by studies of a number of other pathogens (46Chen S.S. Wrathall A.E. Br. Vet. J. 1989; 145: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The hatched, preimplantation embryo may not be exposed to PrP-Sc due to the formation of extraembryonic membranes. After placentation, the fetus may not be exposed to PrP-Sc due to the presence of a PrP-negative zone, the amnion, around the developing fetus during the gestational period. A neonate is most likely to be exposed to PrP-Sc during or after parturition when fetal membranes are broken and chorioallantoic tissues and allantoic fluid contaminate the birth canal, body surface, and wool of both the mother and neonate, mammary glands, and the lambing area. PrP-Sc from both fetal membranes and fluids may serve as a source for horizontal transmission of scrapie under natural conditions (7Pattison I.H. Hoare M.N. Jebbett J.N. Watson W.A. Vet. Rec. 1972; 90: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Overall, we propose that 1) the embryos/fetuses are less likely to be exposed to scrapie in utero, 2) lambs are likely to be exposed to scrapie at birth and during nursing, and 3) wasted placenta and possibly allantoic fluid of infected ewes may serve as a primary source for horizontal transmission.The results of this study provide useful information for a better understanding of maternal transmission of scrapie during the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal periods. Despite some differences in placentation among different species, ovine scrapie represents a valuable model for investigating PrP-Sc replication at the fetal-maternal interface in prion diseases such as chronic wasting disease and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in which PrP-Sc is distributed outside of the nervous system (47Sigurdson C.J.

Lancet. 1997; 349: 99-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These results also contribute to our understanding of the regulation of PrP-C at different stages of pregnancy and fetal development and the role of PrP-C in fetal-maternal interactions at the interface. Scrapie in sheep and goats is a naturally occurring fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of the abnormally folded, PK1-resistant prion protein (PrP-Sc) (1Caughey B. Nat.

Dis. 1998; 178: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) recently showed that PrP-Sc was detected by Western blotting in the placenta from scrapie-infected ewes and scrapie infectivity in tissue homogenates of placental membranes. Under natural conditions, fetal fluids and placental tissues are expelled during or shortly after parturition and contaminate the body surface of the dam and the area where lambing takes place. Lambs may be exposed to scrapie by ingesting the transmissible agent during contact with contaminated wool and mammary gland of the dam. Adult sheep in the same flock may also be exposed orally through contaminated feed sources. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of PrP-C and biochemical properties of PrP-C and distribution of PrP-Sc in the ovine female reproductive, placental, and selected fetal tissues and fetal fluids of infected and uninfected ewes. In contrast to the ubiquitous distribution of PrP-C in the female reproductive tract and conceptuses, PrP-Sc was present only in the uterine caruncular endometrium and placental cotyledonary chorioallantois of pregnant infected ewes. N-terminally truncated, glycosylated, PK-sensitive PrP-C with apparent molecular masses of 23–37 kDa was present in cotyledonary chorioallantois, allantoic fluid, fetal bladder, and fetal kidney as well as endometrium, myometrium, oviduct, and ovary of pregnant and nonpregnant uninfected ewes. PrP-C levels were low or undetectable in intercotyledonary chorioallantois, amnion, urachus, amniotic fluid, and fetal urine. In pregnant ewes, cotyledonary chorioallantois, allantoic fluid, or caruncular endometrium contained higher (p < 0.05) levels of PrP-C than did intercaruncular endometrium, myometrium, oviduct, ovary, fetal bladder, or fetal kidney. PrP-C expression in caruncular endometrium was up-regulated (p < 0.05) during pregnancy when compared with caruncular endometrial PrP-C of nonpregnant ewes. Pregnancy status had no effect on PrP-C expression in the brain, myometrium, oviduct, and ovary. PrP-C detected in uninfected ewes had a protein core of ∼18–22 kDa in tissues and ∼16.5 kDa in allantoic fluid. DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrated that PrP-C was differentially expressed by tissues and fluids of the female reproductive tract and conceptuses. Despite the wide distribution of PrP-C in the reproductive, placental, and fetal tissues and fetal fluids, PrP-Sc accumulation was only detected in the car"

It contains P0, an insoluble protein anchoring P1 and P2 to the ribosome. Here, rat recombinant P0 was overproduced in inclusion bodies and solubilized in complex with the other P-proteins. This method of solubilization appeared suitable to show protein complexes and revealed that P1, but not P2, interacted with P0. Furthermore, the use of truncated mutants of P1 and P2 indicated that residues 1–63 in P1 connected P0 to residues 1–65 in P2. Additional experiments resulted in the conclusion that P1 and P2 bound one another, either connected with P0 or free, as found in the cytoplasm. Accordingly, a model of association for the P-proteins in the stalk is proposed. Recombinant P0 in complex with phosphorylated P2 and either P1 or its (1–63) domain efficiently restored the proteosynthetic activity of 60 S subunits deprived of native P-proteins. Therefore, refolded P0 was functional and residues 1–63 only in P1 were essential. Furthermore, our results emphasize that the refolding principle used here is worth considering for solubilizing other insoluble proteins.

J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2810-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During translation of messenger RNA into protein, the ribosome is helped by several soluble factors that operate in a sequential manner to improve both efficiency and fidelity of this process (2Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Ibba M. Soll D. Science. 1999; 286: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). How this extraordinary coordination is performed is not yet exactly understood. Still, because most of the translation factors are GTPases, the driving of the factors by the ribosome is likely to be controlled by GTP hydrolysis (4Czworkowski J. Moore P.B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 293-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A small portion of the 28 S rRNA designated as the GTPase center is known to be involved in GTP hydrolysis activation (5Uchiumi T. Traut R.R. Elkon K. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2054-2062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GTPase center is connected directly to the stalk (6Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an elongated and very flexible protuberance interacting with elongation factors (7MacConnell W.P. Kaplan N.O. Biochem.

However, despite decades of research, the organization and functions of the proteins constituting the stalk remain unclear. The number and the nature of the proteins constituting the stalk are different depending on the biological system, although their general organization, made of five proteins, is likely to be similar. In prokaryotes, four identical proteins (L7/L12) are linked to the GTPase center by L10 connected itself with a sixth protein, L11 (11Highland J.H. Howard G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 813-814PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, the equivalents of the four L7/L12s are two different proteins, P1 and P2, each being present in two copies. These proteins are bound to P0, the equivalent of L10, which is itself bound to L12, the eukaryotic equivalent of L11, and to the GTPase center (6Uchiumi T. Kominami R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19179-19185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Saenz-Robles M.T. Vilella M.D. Pucciarelli G. Polo F. Remacha M. Ortiz B.L. Vidales F.J. Ballesta J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In plants, an additional protein, P3, has been described (13Szick K. Springer M. Bailey-Serres J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2378-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In yeast, there are two variants of both P1 (P1α and P1β) and P2 (P2α and P2β); the precise repartition and function of each variant remains unsettled (14Ballesta J.P.G. Guarinos E. Zurdo J. Parada P. Nusspaumer G. Lalioti V.S. Perez-Fernandez J. Remacha M. Garret R.A. Douthwaite S.R. Liljas A. Matheson A.T. Moore P.B. Noller H.F. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 115-125Google Scholar). This structural heterogeneity seems to correspond to functional differences, and data obtained in one system cannot be extrapolated directly (10Gomez-Lorenzo M.G. Spahn C.M. Agrawal R.K. Grassucci R.A. Penczek P. Chakraburtty K. Ballesta J.P. Lavandera J.L. Garcia-Bustos J.F. Frank J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2710-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Both L7/L12 and P1/P2 have in common their size (around 110–120 residues), their acidity, and the fact that N- and C-terminal domains are joined by an alanine-rich flexible region (15Bushuev V.N. Gudkov A.T. Liljas A. Sepetov N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4498-4505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal protruding region (16Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G.

In the rat, P2 phosphorylation has been shown to stimulate the proteosynthetic activity of the ribosome (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the GTPase activity of eEF-2 (19Bargis-Surgey P. Lavergne J.P. Gonzalo P. Vard C. Filhol-Cochet O. Reboud J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of P1 and P2, although of very different lengths in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, are involved in P0 and L10 binding, respectively (20Schop E.N. Maassen J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 21Jose M.P. Santana-Roman H. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Zinker S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7941-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, an exchange between the ribosome-bound P1 and P2 (but not P0) and a cytoplasmic pool of these proteins has been shown (22Zinker S. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mitsui K. Nakagawa T. Tsurugi K. J. Biochem.

( Tokyo ). 1985; 98: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a situation not found with L7/L12 in prokaryotes. The functions and conditions of this exchange remain unexplained. P0, contrary to L10, contains the flexible alanine-rich region and the phosphorylable C-terminal domain found in P1 and P2. Mobility complicates the study of the components of the stalk that represent two of the last three proteins not shown in the crystallographic structure of the 50 S ribosomal subunit of the archaea, Haloarcula marismortui (25Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 26Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar). Besides, structural studies of the isolated proteins are incomplete (27Wahl M.C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mobility is biologically relevant (28Dey D. Bochkariov D.E. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1670-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the conformation of the stalk was shown to be different depending on the step of the ribosomal cycle (8Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Wintermeyer W. van Heel M. Nature. 1997; 389: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc.

Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Hence, it is a major goal to understand how these dramatic conformational changes operate at a molecular level. In previous works from our laboratory, rat recombinant P1 and P2 proteins were overproduced and studied when linked to the ribosome (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and as isolated proteins (19Bargis-Surgey P. Lavergne J.P. Gonzalo P. Vard C. Filhol-Cochet O. Reboud J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The lack of P0 prevented us from going further in the study of the functions of these proteins in a ribosomal context. Here, recombinant P0 was successfully overproduced and shown to be effective in reconstituting a functional stalk together with P1 and phosphorylated P2. Several approaches were used to determine the interactions between the stalk components and led us to propose a new model for its functional architecture. The RNAgents total RNA isolation system kit, the oligo(dT)15 used as a primer for the reverse transcription, the BamHI and SmaI restriction enzymes, the T4 DNA ligase, and the Escherichia coli cells (JM109 strain) were from Promega. The primers used for the DNA polymerase chain reactions were from Isoprim. PwoDNA polymerase, RNase H, and β-octylglucoside were acquired fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals. Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc. The pQE-30 plasmid and the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel came from Qiagen. Preparation and properties of the monoclonal antibody (4C3) used to detect the P-proteins in the Western blot have been previously described (31Fabien N. Moreira A. Lavergne J.P. Desbos A. Surgey P. Alves de Olivera C. Gonzalo P. Venot A. Bienvenu J. Perrier H. Reboud J.P. Monier J.C. J. Autoimmun. 1999; 13: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cDNA of P0 was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of total RNA prepared from 1 g of rat liver (Wistar strain) using the general guanidinium thiocyanate plus 2-mercaptoethanol method (32Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription step was performed under Superscript II standard conditions. Polymerase chain reaction (30 cycles) was performed using 0.2 μl of the reverse transcription product and 10 μm 5′ (TAT GGA TCC ATG CCC AGG GAA GAC AGG GCG ACC) and 3′ (TAT CCC CGG TTA GTC GAA GAG ACC GAA TCC CAT) primers. The annealing temperature was 59 °C. P0 cDNA (960 base pairs) was cloned (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and its sequence was in full agreement with the Swiss-Prot P0 sequence of Rattus norvegicus (entry name: RLA0 RAT; primary accession number:P19945) corrected for three conflicts compared with the previously published sequence (33Wool I.G. Chan Y.L. Gluck A. Suzuki K. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1991; 73: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar). P0, overproduced as described for P1 and P2 (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was mostly insoluble and purified from inclusion bodies. The pellet of the bacterial lysate was submitted to a sequential extraction with 12 volumes of 1.5–3 m and 6m guanidine. P0, extracted in the 3 and 6 mguanidine fractions, was eluted via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel chromatography with 190 mm imidazole in a buffer containing 4 m guanidine, 50 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol. After dialysis against this buffer, the preparation, divided into aliquots, was frozen at −80 °C. The final yield from a 1-liter culture was 15 mg. Truncated mutants of P1 and P2 were used in this work. N1 and N2 comprise the amino acids 1–63 and 1–65 from P1 and P2, respectively. These proteins were overproduced after the cloning and sequencing of their cDNAs as described previously (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). cDNAs were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using P1-pQE-30 and P2-pQE-30 vectors as templates (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the 5′ primers previously described (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the following 3′ primers: ATT AAG CTT TTA TAC ATT GCA GAT GAG GCT TCC for N1 and ATT AAG CTT TTA CAC ACT GGC CAG CTT GCC AAC for N2. N2 was overproduced in the supernatant only and purified as described for P1 and P2 (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). N1, found only in inclusion bodies, was purified following the procedure used for P0, except that 8m guanidine was necessary to solubilize and purify it. Renaturation was carried out by removing the guanidine with an overnight dialysis at 4 °C. 10 μm P0 (or 20 μm N1) and 20 μmligand(s) (P1 alone or N1 plus either P2 or N2, in the case of P0, or N2 or P2, in the case of N1) in 2 m guanidine, 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm EDTA, and 20% (v/v) glycerol were dialyzed against the same buffer but without guanidine. A similar procedure was used for N1 using P2 or N2 as ligands. The yields of solubilization of either P0 or N1 by increasing ligand concentrations were determined according to the following procedure. Mixtures containing a fixed concentration of either P0 or N1 were dialyzed with increasing ligand concentrations and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. In each test, the concentration of the proteins in the supernatant (solubilized P0 or N1 plus the ligands) was determined using the Coomassie Blue plus protein assay reagent kit from Pierce. Then, the soluble P0 or N1 concentration was obtained by subtracting the ligand concentration from the measured concentration. This calculation is well founded, because ligands behaved as soluble proteins that were not found in the pellets in a significant amount after the renaturation process. These measures were checked by analyzing aliquots of both the supernatants and the pellets via SDS-PAGE1 and by quantifying the bands corresponding to either P0 or N1 using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics) equipped with the Image QuanNT software as previously described (19Bargis-Surgey P. Lavergne J.P. Gonzalo P. Vard C. Filhol-Cochet O. Reboud J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The supernatant of the dialyzed solutions of the P-proteins was loaded onto a non-denaturing, 1.5-mm-thick, 6% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (13 cm × 13 cm) cooled at 4 °C (35Madjar J.J. Arpin M. Reboud J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm β-octylglucoside, 5 mm MgCl2, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. A premigration was carried out during 1 h at 80 V before loading the samples. The sample buffer contained 150 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-octylglucoside, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% bromthymol blue. The overlay buffer poured onto samples was identical, except that it contained only 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 mm KCl. Migration was performed at 100 V for 1 h, 200 V for 2 h, and then 250 V until the tracking dye reached the end of the gel. Electrophoresis buffer (150 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm dithiothreitol) was changed every hour. The gel was Coomassie Blue-stained, and the slab corresponding to the first electrophoresis was cut and included in the stacking layer of a 2-mm-thick 17% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Extraction of P0 from 60 S subunits and reconstitution of the biological activity after addition of either the split or recombinant proteins were adapted from the method described by Nietoet al. (37Nieto M.A. Hernandez F. Palacian E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 86: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 1) 60 S subunits and DMMA concentrations were 0.8 μm and 21.6 mm, respectively; 2) all steps were performed on ice; 3) split proteins were separated from the DMMA particles by ultracentrifugation through a 15% sucrose layer; 4) core particles and split proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing BisTris, pH 6.0 in place of sodium cacodylate; 5) reconstitution was performed in the same buffer at pH 7.0; and 6) proteins not bound to DMMA particles were separated by a second ultracentrifugation through a 15% sucrose layer. The proteosynthetic activity of the subunits was measured by the polyphenylalanine synthesis test (38Conquet F. Lavergne J.P. Paleologue A. Reboud J.P. Reboud A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). P0 overproduced in an E. coli system fused with an N-terminal poly(His) tag was found mostly in inclusion bodies, contrary to what had been found previously with P1 and P2 overproduced under similar conditions (18Vard C. Guillot D. Bargis P. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20259-20262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Coproduction of P0 with the chaperonines GroES/GroEL or with thioredoxin did not improve the amount of soluble P0 in the bacterial supernatant. Hence, P0 was purified from inclusion bodies using 4m guanidine. Several methods to obtain non-denatured soluble P0 from this solution were unsuccessful. Dilution or dialysis of the guanidine under different conditions resulted in P0 precipitation, as did an attempt to refold it immobilized on the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel affinity column used for its purification. This led us to try to renature P0 in the presence of its available potential ligands in the stalk, the soluble proteins P1 and P2. P0 was mixed with recombinant proteins P1 and P2 in 2 m guanidine to keep it soluble. When guanidine was removed by dialysis (Fig.1), nearly all P0 remained soluble in the presence of P1 alone and (P1 + P2) but surprisingly not in the presence of P2 alone (compare the insoluble proportion of P0 in lanes 2, 4, and 3, respectively, with that inlane 1, corresponding to P0 alone). The small amounts of P1 and/or P2 that were found in the pellets in lanes 2–4 were also found when P1 and/or P2 were submitted to the solubilization process in the absence of P0 (data not shown). This precipitation should originate from a very limited denaturation of P1 and P2 under the conditions of the solubilization process. This experiment suggested that P1 but not P2 could interact with P0 to make a soluble complex. Quantitative data were obtained, and the effect of P1 concentration on P0 solubilization led to the determination of the stoichiometry of this complex (see Fig. 4, filled circles).Figure 4Effects of increasing concentrations of potential ligands on P0 solubilization. Solubilization of 1 nmol of P0 (35 μg) in 100 μl was performed by removing the guanidine with an overnight dialysis in the presence of increasing concentrations of various ligands. After centrifugation, the concentration of soluble P0 was measured by subtracting the ligand concentration from that of the total soluble protein concentration. Furthermore, results given by this calculation were assessed by quantifying the bands corresponding to P0 in the pellets and in the supernatants after separation via SDS-PAGE, as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Ref. 19Bargis-Surgey P. Lavergne J.P. Gonzalo P. Vard C. Filhol-Cochet O. Reboud J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. When two proteins were added together, they were in equal molar concentration. The proteins tested for P0 solubilization were P1 (●), P2 (▴), N1 (▪), (N1 + P2) (○), (N1 + N2) (♦). (P1 + P2) gave a curve superposable with that given by P1 alone, and that of N2 was identical to that of P2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because it had been suggested that N-terminal domains in P1 and P2 were involved in the binding to P0 in yeast (21Jose M.P. Santana-Roman H. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Zinker S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7941-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we prepared truncated mutants of rat P1 and P2. N1 and N2, the N-terminal domains of P1 and P2, respectively, contained the first 63 and 65 residues of P1 and P2 preceded by a poly(His) tag. N1 and N2 sequences are highlighted in gray in Fig. 2, in which hydrophobic regions are shown under the sequences. N2, predicted to be a very hydrophilic protein, was purified from the bacterial supernatant. In contrast, N1, mostly made of hydrophobic regions, was overproduced and purified only from inclusion bodies in 8m guanidine. Dialyses of N1 in the presence of P2 or N2, which were potential ligands for N1, were carried out to determine whether it was possible to solubilize N1 in the absence of guanidine (Fig.3 A). N1, a completely insoluble protein (Fig. 3 A, lane 1), was solubilized by both N2 (lane 2) and P2 (lane 3). The effect of increasing concentrations of either N2 or P2 on N1 solubilization (20 μm) was studied (Fig. 3 B). For that, N1 solubilization was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of either N2 or P2, and the concentrations of N1 remaining soluble after dialysis of the guanidine were determined using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 3. Using either P2 or N2, we observed that the soluble N1 concentration was directly proportional to that of P2 or N2 up to 20 μm. The shapes of these curves revealed equimolar complexes between N1 and P2 or N1 and N2, because the slopes were equal to one. Furthermore, the level of the plateau indicated that the solubility of the complex N1-P2 (Fig. 3 B, open squares) was 20 μm at least, this concentration corresponding to the solubilization of all the N1 available in the test. The complex N1-N2 (Fig. 3 B,filled diamonds) was slightly less soluble (about 18 μm), because a small fraction of N1 remained insoluble for any concentration of N2 tested. This result indicated that P1 and P2 could bind each other and that their N-terminal domains were involved in the process of heterodimerization. This suggested also that the common C-terminal domain might play a main part in the P-protein solubility, which might be due to its high hydrophilicity (see Fig. 2). On the two-dimensional electrophoreses displayed in Fig. 5, P1-P2 and N1-P2 complexes were visualized as complexes C1 inpanel A and C2 in panel B, respectively (see below for more details).Figure 5Two-dimensional gel electrophoreses of P-protein complexes. A, an equimolar mixture of P1 and P2 was loaded onto a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.5, and its migration is represented by the horizontal slab stained with Coomassie Blue. This slab was cut and included in the staking layer of an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional electrophoresis reveals that P1 and P2 migrate mainly as a complex (C1) and that almost no P2 is found in the broad band F containing free P2 (compare withpanel B). B, after dialysis and centrifugation, the soluble fraction of a P0, N1, and P2 mixture (molar ratio of 1:2:2) was separated in bands L, C3, and C2using a non-denaturing 6%-polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.5 stained with Coomassie Blue. L, at the basement of the well, contained aggregated proteins unable to enter into the gel. The slab was cut and included in the staking layer of an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). After migration and staining with silver nitrate, the gel showed that L contained only P0, that C3 was a complex of P0 with N1 and P2, and thatC2 was a complex of N1 with P2. P0 and N1 that are insoluble did not migrate in the absence of P2 under these non-denaturing conditions. The broad band F represents the migration of free (unbound) P2 (see “Results”).

Using P2 as a potential ligand, no enhancement of P0 solubility was shown, regardless of the P2 concentration (Fig. 4, filled triangles). Using P1 as a ligand (Fig. 4, filled circles), the concentration of soluble P0 increased linearly with P1 concentration, with a slope of about 0.5 (P0 (μm)/P1 (μm)) up to about 20 μm P1. This slope suggested that a complex containing two P1 molecules for one P0 was formed (P0 concentration in the test was 10 μm). Above 20 μm P1, a plateau corresponding to the solubilization of all the P0 available was observed. A similar result was obtained using (P1 + P2) in place of P1 alone. These results showed that two P1 molecules (or two heterodimers, P1/P2) had to associate with P0 to solubilize it. To test whether N1, the insoluble N-terminal domain of P1, interacted with P0, a trial of (N1 + P0) cosolubilization was performed (Fig. 4,filled squares). It resulted in no solubilization of P0 and even in a reduction of its solubility. This suggested that a complex between N1 and P0 was formed but was insoluble, which might originate from the fact that the hydrophobic regions constituting mainly P0 and N1 were not all buried in the complex (see Fig. 2). Then, the ability of the complexes N1-P2 and N1-N2 to solubilize P0 was studied (Fig. 4). Contrary to P2 or N2 alone (Fig. 4, filled triangles) that did not modify the solubility of P0, the addition of increasing concentrations of either (N1 + P2) (open circles) or (N1 + N2) (filled diamonds) resulted in a substantial increase in P0 solubility. These observations indicated that P2 did not bind to P0 directly but through an interaction between its N-terminal domain and that of P1. Still, the shapes of the curves suggested that these complexes were less efficient than full-length P1 (or (P1 + P2)) in achieving P0 solubilization. Indeed, the maximal effect was obtained with a higher molecular ratio (∼3 versus ∼2), suggesting that the P0 affinity for N1-P2 or N1-N2 was lower than that"

Gnas, the gene encoding the Gs α-subunit, is imprinted, and targeted disruption of this gene in mice leads to distinct phenotypes in heterozygotes depending on whether the maternal (m−/+) or paternal (+/p−) allele is mutated. Notably, m−/+ mice become obese, whereas +/p− mice are thinner than normal. In this study we show that despite these opposite changes in energy metabolism, both m−/+ and +/p− mice have greater sensitivity to insulin, with low to normal fasting glucose levels, low fasting insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance, and exaggerated hypoglycemic response to administered insulin. The combination of increased insulin sensitivity with obesity in m−/+ mice is unusual, because obesity is typically associated with insulin resistance. In skeletal muscles isolated from both m−/+ and +/p− mice, the basal rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was normal, whereas the rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in response to maximal insulin stimulation was significantly increased. The similar changes in muscle sensitivity to insulin in m−/+ and +/p− mice may reflect the fact that muscle Gsα expression is reduced by ∼50% in both groups of mice. GLUT4 expression is unaffected in muscles from +/p− mice. Increased responsiveness to insulin is therefore the result of altered insulin signaling and/or GLUT4 translocation.

Each G protein is composed of distinct α, β, and γ subunits (1Spiegel A.M. Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 536-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The α-subunit binds guanine nucleotide and interacts with specific effectors, such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and ion channels. The α-subunit for Gs (Gsα) is ubiquitously expressed and transmits the stimulatory signal from hormone-bound receptors to adenylyl cyclase and is therefore required for hormone-stimulated cAMP generation. Both catecholamines (whose receptors activate Gs) and cAMP have been implicated as negative regulators of insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in various cell types, including adipocytes and muscle cells (2Taylor W.M.

Paternal transmission of GNAS1 mutations produces offspring with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy alone (pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism), whereas maternal transmission produces offspring who also have multihormone resistance (termed pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia) (13Davies S.J. Hughes H.E. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 30: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Gsα gene is imprinted. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon characterized by parental allele-specific differences in gene expression (14Bartolomei M.S. Tilghman S.M. Annu. Rev.

In mice Gsα is expressed primarily from the maternal allele in some tissues, such as renal proximal tubules and adipose tissue, but is biallelically expressed in most other tissues (17Yu S., Yu, D.

Although this could explain the presence of hormone resistance in pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia and its absence in pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, the imprinting of Gsα in humans has yet to be directly demonstrated (19Campbell R.

GNAS1 (and the murine homolog Gnas) are now known to produce two additional gene products by use of alternative promoters and first exons, which splice onto a common second exon. XLαs, a novel isoform of Gsα, is expressed exclusively from the paternal allele, whereas NESP55, a chromogranin-like neurosecretory protein, is expressed exclusively from the maternal allele (20Hayward B.E.

We generated mice with an insertional disruption of Gnasexon 2 (GsKO), an exon common to all known Gnas transcripts (17Yu S., Yu, D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Homozygotes (−/−) die during early postimplantation development. Heterozygotes with disruption of the paternal (+/p−) or maternal (m−/+) allele have distinct phenotypic manifestations (17Yu S., Yu, D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), leading to early death in the majority of heterozygotes. m−/+ and +/p− mice that survive past weaning have diametrically opposite abnormalities in fat mass, resting metabolic rate, and activity levels (18Yu S. Gavrilova O. Chen H. Lee R. Liu J. Pacak K. Parlow A.F. Quon M.J. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Adult +/p− mice are lean, hypermetabolic, and hyperactive, whereas m−/+ mice are obese and have lower resting metabolic rate and activity levels. These effects may be due to increased and decreased sympathetic activity in +/p− and m−/+ mice, respectively. In this report we demonstrate that both lean +/p− mice and obese m−/+ mice are more sensitive to insulin than normal mice, with increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This is the first direct demonstration in a genetically altered in vivo model that Gs-coupled pathways negatively regulate insulin signaling. Mice with insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette into exon 2 of Gnas were previously created by targeted mutagenesis (17Yu S., Yu, D. Lee E. Eckhaus M. Lee R. Corria Z. Accili D. Westphal H. Weinstein L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8715-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Female mutants were mated to wild type CD-1 males (Charles River) to generate m−/+ mice, and male mutants were mated to wild type CD-1 females to generate +/p− mice. Wild type littermates of m−/+ and +/p− mice are designated m+/+ and +/p+ mice, respectively. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (6 a.m./6 p.m.) and a standard pellet diet (NIH-07, 5% fat by weight). For the measurement of fasting serum glucose and insulin levels, animals were sacrificed after an overnight fast (16 h), and serum was collected. Serum insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research Immunoassay, St. Charles, MO). Serum glucose was measured using the glucose HK kit (Sigma). For glucose tolerance tests, mice were fasted overnight and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (35 μg/g of body weight) and ketamine (70 μg/g of body weight). Glucose (2.5 mg/g of body weight in 0.9% NaCl solution) was administered intraperitoneally, and blood was collected from the retroorbital veins in heparinized capillary tubes at time 0 (prior to injection) and at 20, 40, 60, and 120 min after injection. Glucose was measured using the glucose HK kit (Sigma). For insulin tolerance tests, fasted mice were anesthetized with either pentobarbital and ketamine or pentobarbital alone. Human regular insulin (Humulin, 0.75 mIU/g of body weight in 0.9% NaCl solution) was administered intraperitoneally, blood was collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, and glucose was measured using either the glucose HK kit or the Lifescan Surestep glucometer (Johnson & Johnson). Anesthesia had no significant effect on base-line glucose levels or response to insulin. In vitro glucose uptake into isolated extensor digitorum longus muscle was measured using [3H]2-deoxyglucose, with [14C]mannitol to correct for extracellular fluid (30Lauro D. Kido Y. Castle A.L. Zarnowski M.J. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, muscles were isolated, allowed to recover for 3 h in Krebs-Heinseleit buffer containing glucose (6 mm), mannitol (18 mm), and pyruvate (2 mm) in a 95% O2, 5% CO2atmosphere, and then incubated in the presence or absence of 10 milliunits/ml insulin (Humulin, Eli Lilly) for 20 min, followed by addition of 100 μm (2.4 μCi) [1,2-3H]2-deoxyglucose and 0.7 μCi of [1-14C]mannitol. After 20 min at 30 °C, the tissue3H and 14C were measured, and the tissue3H uptake into fibers was determined after adjustment for14C uptake into extracellular spaces. Anterior tibialis muscles were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Muscles were weighed, homogenized on ice with a Teflon pestle at 1:10 (w/v) in HEPES-EDTA-sucrose buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mmsucrose, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (Complete capsules,Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and solubilized in 2.3 murea, 1.43% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 14.3 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 100 mm dithiothreitol (all final concentrations). Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex). After confirming equal loading of lanes by staining the gel with Ponceau S, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Filters were blocked, incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 (1:500 dilution), and then incubated with 0.25 μCi/ml [125I]protein A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (31Al-Hasani H. Yver D.R. Cushman S.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Bands were quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji BAS1000). All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using the pairedt test or multi-factor ANOVA, with differences considered significant at p < 0.05 (2-tailed). To determine whether insulin sensitivity is altered in adult +/p− and/or m−/+ mice, we measured glucose and insulin in fasted adult mice and glucose after intraperitoneal administration of glucose or insulin. Both +/p− and m−/+ mice had significantly lower fasting serum insulin levels than their wild type littermates (TableI). For +/p− mice five of six animals had fasting insulin levels below the detection limit of the assay (0.05 ng/ml). Simultaneous glucose levels were less than or equal to those of wild type littermates (Table I).Table IFasting serum glucose and insulin+/p++/p−m+/+m−/+Glucose (mg/dl)100 ± 8 (6)91 ± 9 (6)133 ± 19 (6)104 ± 21 (6)1-ap ≤ 0.05 vs. wild type littermates, paired Student's t test.Insulin (ng/ml)2.3 ± 0.8 (6)<1.2 ± 0.7 (6)1-ap ≤ 0.05 vs. wild type littermates, paired Student's t test.1-bFive of six determinations were less than the detection limit of the assay and were assigned a value of 0.05 for determination of statistics.3.4 ± 1.0 (6)1.3 ± 0.4 (6)1-ap ≤ 0.05 vs. wild type littermates, paired Student's t test.Serum glucose and insulin levels were measured in 2–3-month-old male mice after an overnight (16 h) fast. +/p+ and m+/+ are the wild type littermate controls of +/p− and m−/+ mice, respectively.

Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n). Glucose tolerance tests were next performed in 10-week-old male mice. Glucose levels were lower in both +/p− and m−/+ mice compared with wild type littermates at all time points after injection of glucose (2.5 mg/g of body weight), with the genotype having a significant effect on the overall handling of glucose load (Fig.1 A). An overall decrease in the glucose curve was observed in both groups of mutant mice, although the return toward base-line glucose levels was more pronounced in +/p− mice. This difference in glucose tolerance between +/p− and m−/+ mice might be predicted, given that +/p− mice are lean, whereas m−/+ mice are obese. We next examined the glucose response to administered insulin (0.75 mIU/g of body weight, intraperitoneal) (Fig.1 B). In this study base-line glucose was similar in all groups. In both +/p− and m−/+ mice the hypoglycemic response to injected insulin was significantly greater than in wild type littermates. Therefore, both +/p− and m−/+ mice have increased insulin sensitivity, based on the findings of lower fasting insulin levels with normal or low fasting glucose, improved glucose tolerance, and a greater than normal acute hypoglycemic response to insulin. Increased insulin sensitivity might be expected in the lean +/p− mice, because insulin sensitivity is generally inversely related to adiposity. However, in m−/+ mice increased insulin sensitivity is associated with obesity. The dissociation of obesity and insulin resistance has been described previously in a few other animal models (e.g. mice with a knockout of the adipocyte-specific aP2 gene; Ref. 32Hotamisligil G.S. Johnson R.S. Distel R.J. Ellis R. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1377-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The fact that m−/+ are obese whereas +/p− are lean may explain why glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity appear to be somewhat greater in +/p− mice as compared with m−/+ mice (Fig. 1). Most of the acute hypoglycemic response to insulin is normally due to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, associated with translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 from internal vesicles to the plasma membrane (33Zisman A. Peroni O.D. Abel E.D. Michael M.D. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Lowell B.B. Wojtaszewski J.F.P. Hirshman M.F. Virkamaki A. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Kahn B.B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle (extensor digitorum longus) was removed from +/p− and m−/+ mice and their wild type littermates, and the rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake were measured in the presence of either no insulin (Fig.2, Basal) or a maximal concentration of insulin (10 milliunits/ml; Fig. 2,Insulin). In the absence of insulin, rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake were similar in muscles from +/p−, m−/+, and wild type mice. In contrast, in the presence of insulin the rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake were significantly higher in muscles from both +/p− and m−/+ mice when compared with those from wild type mice. The maximal responses to insulin (increase over basal) were 55 and 48% greater in muscles from +/p− and m−/+ mice, respectively, than the response in muscles from wild type mice. These large differences in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle largely account for the greater hypoglycemic effect of insulin in +/p− and m−/+ mice. One potential mechanism for the observed increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is increased expression of GLUT4 in this tissue. cAMP has been shown to negatively regulate the GLUT4 promoter (34Kaestner K.H. Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Janicot M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and therefore decreased expression of Gsα might be expected to lead to GLUT4 overexpression due to decreased intracellular cAMP concentrations. However, immunoblotting of whole homogenates of skeletal muscle (anterior tibialis) with a GLUT4-specific antibody showed that GLUT4 expression was unaffected in skeletal muscles of +/p− mice (99 ± 15% of the level in paired wild type littermates; n = 4 pairs; see Fig.3). Decreased levels of Gsα expression and/or intracellular cAMP in skeletal muscle of m−/+ and +/p− mice probably lead to increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake either by increasing the responsiveness of the proximal insulin-signaling pathway to insulin or by increasing GLUT4 translocation or transporter activity. Several studies show that catecholamines or cAMP analogues can lead to decreased insulin binding or decreased insulin receptor kinase activity in response to insulin in cultured cells (3Klein H.H. Matthaei S. Drenkhan M. Ries W. Scriba P.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36–47), although some studies failed to show an effect of these agents on insulin receptor function (48Joost H.G. Steinfelder H.J. Schmitz-Salue C. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 49Ciaraldi T.P. Maisel A. Biochem.

One potential mechanism for these effects is through serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) (40Miele C. Formisano P. Sohn K.-J.

Serine/threonine phosphorylation of downstream components, such as IRS-1 and -2, may decrease the ability of these molecules to be activated by the insulin receptor (52Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E. Kanety H. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We are presently embarking on studies to directly examine the ability of insulin to activate the insulin receptor and other proximal insulin-signaling components in tissues from Gnas knockout mice. There is also evidence that catecholamines or cAMP may have a direct effect on GLUT4 transporter, perhaps through decreasing the accessibility of GLUT 4 to the cell surface (4Ferrara C.M. Cushman S.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 53Joost H.G. Weber T.M. Cushman S.W. Simpson I.A. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 288: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One recent study suggests that the rate of fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane in the presence of insulin is reduced by catecholamines (4Ferrara C.M. Cushman S.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although in many respects +/p− and m−/+ have distinct phenotypes, both groups of mice seem to have similar changes in insulin sensitivity, despite the fact that one group is leaner than normal and the other is obese. We think this is most likely due to the fact that Gsα is not imprinted in skeletal muscle, and therefore its expression in skeletal muscle is decreased to a similar extent in +/p− and m−/+ mice (18Yu S. Gavrilova O. Chen H. Lee R. Liu J. Pacak K. Parlow A.F. Quon M.J. Reitman M.L. Weinstein L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Gnas also produces two other imprinted gene products, NESP55, a chromogranin-like protein that is expressed only from the maternal allele, and XLαs, an alternative isoform of Gsα with a long amino-terminal extension that is only expressed from the paternal allele (20Hayward B.E. Kamiya M. Strain L. Moran V. Campbell R. Hayashizaki Y. Bonthron D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10038-10043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 21Hayward B.E. Moran V. Strain L. Bonthron D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15475-15480Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It would seem unlikely that loss of these products leads to the observed increase in insulin sensitivity, because XLαs expression is lost only in +/p− mice, whereas NESP55 appears to be expressed in both m−/+ and +/p− mice. 2S. Yu and L. S. Weinstein, unpublished data. Moreover, we could not detect expression of either of these gene products in skeletal muscle of normal mice by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown). Hormones that counterregulate insulin, including catecholamines and glucagon, activate Gs-coupled pathways. Therefore Gsα deficiency might be expected to produce an apparent increase in insulin sensitivity due to resistance to counterregulatory hormones. However, in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia the glycemic response to maximal glucagon stimulation is normal (55Levine M.A. Downs Jr., R.W. Moses A.M. Breslau N.A. Marx S.J. Lasker R.D. Rizzoli R.E. Aurbach G.D. Spiegel A.M. Am. J. Med. 1983; 74: 545-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,56Brickman A.S. Carlson H.E. Levin S.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In our experiments the time course of the response to administered insulin in +/p− and m−/+ mice is consistent with a direct effect on skeletal muscle glucose utilization independent of the effects of counterregulatory hormones. This was confirmed in our studies that directly examined insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in the absence of counterregulatory hormones. Although our studies suggest that Gsα may negatively regulate insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, evidence suggests that two other heterotrimeric G proteins, namely Gq/11 and Gi2, have the opposite effect on the metabolic response to insulin. Two studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes demonstrated that Gq/11α is required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (57Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S.

One study suggested that Gq/11α might work upstream of phosphoinositide 3′-OH kinase and be tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor (57Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas the other study suggested that Gq/11α works downstream of phosphoinositide 3′-OH kinase (58Kanzaki M. Watson R.T.

Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), whereas those expressing activated Gi2α had increased insulin sensitivity (60Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y.

Further studies are required to determine whether Gsα inhibits insulin signaling directly or through the actions of cAMP and/or cAMP-dependent protein kinase and what steps in the insulin receptor-GLUT4 pathway are affected by decreased Gsα expression.

Acta. 1999; 1461: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). There are six known members, MRP1 to MRP6, of which cMOAT is known as MRP2. These proteins function as export “pumps” and extrude a broad range of compounds from the cell. MRP1 was the first (3Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

Peters W.H. Lamers W.H. Hepatology. 1985; 5: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 9Jansen P.L. Groothuis G.M. Peters W.H. Meijer D.F.

Sci. 1992; 42: 27-34PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that MRP1 and MRP2 have similar substrates, which include glutathione conjugates, glucuronide conjugates, reduced glutathione, and chemotherapeutic drugs. Although these two proteins have similar functions, their tissue distribution would indicate that they have different roles. MRP1 is found throughout the body in many tissues, including the hematopoietic system, the blood brain barrier, lungs, and at lower expression levels in the liver and kidneys. In contrast, MRP2 is only found at significant levels in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys. In these two tissues, where both proteins are expressed, they differ in their specific cellular localization. MRP1 is found in the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane and thus may serve to redirect potential excretion products back into the bloodstream. Conversely, MRP2 is solely found in the apical membrane, and this defines its function as an export pump of compounds destined for terminal excretion from the body. Although both proteins can be found in the hepatocyte, higher expression levels of MRP2 than MRP1 create the vectorial transport of excretion products from the blood into bile. The polarization of cells, such as epithelial cells lining the bile duct or the kidney proximal tubules, is created largely by the differential localization of specific proteins. To use the hepatocyte as an example, the proteins required for the excretion of products are concentrated solely in the membrane that creates the canalicular border of the cells. To create the polarization of cells, proteins destined for specific membranes have been shown to contain molecular targeting signals. Such signals include glycosylation, phosphorylation, transmembrane domains, or cytoplasmic motifs (12Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent identification of a PDZ-interacting domain in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is the first report of a targeting motif in mammalian ABC transporters (13Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This domain interacts with PDZ domain containing proteins, which are commonly involved in scaffolding and stabilization at the plasma membrane (14Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The signals responsible for the differential targeting of the MRP proteins to particular domains have not been determined. Initially we aimed to further characterize the function of MRP2 by expressing the protein in a hematopoietic cell line. However, these transfected cells did not show MRP2 function due to intracellular accumulation of the protein and minimal cell membrane localization. Similar results have been reported by others (15Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, MRP1 shows total cell membrane localization in these cells. We were therefore interested in the sorting signals responsible for the difference in localization of these two proteins in both epithelial cell lines and cells with a hematopoietic lineage. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins and site-directed mutagenesis we have been able to identify a sequence motif responsible for exclusive apical localization of MRP2 in polarized MDCK cells. Deletion of the motif results in lateral localization of MRP2 in polarized MDCK cells and allows cell membrane localization in L1210 cells. The mutated protein was able to transport 2,4-dinitrophenyl glutathione (DNP-GS), a known substrate of MRP2. GFP was fused to the C-terminal of MRP1 and MRP2 and utilized to detect the localization of the fusion proteins. Human MRP2 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to remove the stop codon and introduce restriction enzyme sites suitable for cloning. The cDNA was amplified using the sense primer (5′-AGCGCTAGCGATGCTGGAGAAGTTCTGCAAC), which adds an NheI site immediately adjacent to the start codon, and the antisense primer (5′-TACGGTACCGGTGCGAATTTTGTGCTGTTCACATTC), which adds anAgeI site after the final codon and removes the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withNheI/AgeI and ligated into theNheI/AgeI-digested EGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). Human MRP1 cDNA was cloned from HL60ADR cells and ligated into EGFP-N1 (SacII/AgeI) using the same polymerase chain reaction method. The MRP1 sense primer (5′-GCGGCCGCGGATGGCGCTCCGGGGCTTC) introduces a SacII site immediately adjacent to the start codon, and the antisense primer (5′-TACGGTACCGGTGCCACCAAGCCGGCGTCTTTGG) adds an AgeI site and removes the stop codon of MRP1. The constructs were transiently transfected into MDCK cells and L1210 cells using a LipofectAMINE transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 1 μg of DNA. Transfections of MDCK cells were carried out using Transwell plates (Costar, 24 mm × 3 μm polycarbonate membrane) to enable cell polarization. Cells were imaged using a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope linked to a Radiance 2000 Laser Scanning System for confocal microscopy and Lasersharp 2000 imaging software (Bio-Rad). All mutations were achieved using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing through the site of the mutations using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Two clones from separate mutagenesis reactions were selected for all mutants and transfected separately to eliminate the chance that an unintended mutation that would interfere with the targeting of the protein would be incorporated during the amplification reaction. A construct that expressed MRP2 with the C-terminal TKF motif deleted (ΔMRP2) and without the GFP tag was prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. A construct of the MRP2 cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) (7Taniguchi K. Wada M. Kohno K. Nakamura T. Kawabe T. Kawakami M. Kagotani K. Okumura K. Akiyama S. Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4124-4129PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. The sense primer (5′-GAATGTGAACAGCTAGCAGAAGGCC) and antisense primer (5′-GGCCTTCTGCTAGCTGTTCACATTC) deleted the nine nucleotides that coded for the amino acid residues Thr1543, Lys1544, and Phe1545. Successful mutagenesis of two clones from separate reactions was confirmed by sequencing. Stable transfectants in L1210 cells were selected for further study. DNP-GS was generated in L1210 cells by exposure to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and its efflux determined as described previously (16Olive C. Board P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Detection and localization of untagged mutant MRP2 (ΔMRP2) was achieved by immunofluorescence using the antibody M2III6 (Kamiya Pty. Ltd). 2 × 105 cells were washed with PBSF (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum). The cells were permeabilized using digitonin (5 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBSF and then incubated with the primary antibody (2 μg) for 1 h at room temperature before being washed twice with PBSF. The cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated F(ab′)2 (Silenus, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia) (1:80 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally the cells were washed three times and resuspended in PBSF ready for immediate confocal microscopy. Detection of P-glycoprotein was achieved using the antibody MRK16 (Kamiya Pty. Ltd.). 2 × 105 cells were washed with PBSF and incubated with the primary antibody (2 μg) for 1 h at room temperature then washed two times with PBSF. The cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated F(ab′) (1:400) for 30 min, washed three times, and resuspended in PBSF ready for immediate confocal microscopy. The protein sequence of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of 37 ABC transporters from the P-glycoprotein and MRP subfamilies were aligned with the histidine permease (HisP) sequence using the ClustalW alignment program. The multiple sequence alignment was used with the coordinates of the HisP crystal structure (17Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) to generate a homology model of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain from MRP1 and MRP2 usingBioNavigator at the ANGIS Internet site (BioNavigator by eBioinformatics Pty. Ltd.). The models were generated using the Rigorous Models software (18Abagyan R.A. Trotov M.M. Kuznetsov D.N. J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) and presented using Swiss PdbViewer (v3.6b3) (19Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar). To conveniently detect the localization of the proteins under investigation, we constructed GFP fusion proteins and used confocal microscopy to visualize the fluorescent product. Using an MRP2-specific antibody, native MRP2 was previously shown to localize to the apical membrane of MDCK cells (15Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cui Y. Konig J. Buchholz J.K. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, human MRP2 with GFP fused to its C terminus localized to the apical membrane in polarized MDCK cells, consistent with the localization of the native protein (Fig. 1). The apical membrane of polarized MDCK cells grown on Transwell membranes is the surface facing the media as opposed to the surface adhering to the membrane (basolateral). MRP1 has been previously immunolocalized to the basolateral membrane of a pig kidney epithelial cell line (LLC-PK1) (21Evers R. Zaman G.J. van Deemter L. Jansen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Borst P. Schinkel A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the present study, human MRP1 with GFP fused to its C terminus also demonstrated basolateral localization in polarized MDCK cells (Fig.2). These studies establish that fusion of MRP1 and MRP2 to GFP does not interfere with the normal targeting of these proteins to the basolateral and apical membranes. Recently a specific apical targeting signal was identified in CFTR (13Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The signal consisted of a three-residue PDZ-interacting motif at the C terminus. The alignment of C-terminal sequences of MRP1 and MRP2 revealed a similar C-terminal motif in MRP2 (TKF) that was absent in MRP1 and has recently been shown to function as a PDZ-interacting domain (22Kocher O. Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1161-1170PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the TKF motif influenced the apical localization of MRP2, we constructed ΔMRP2-gfp in which the three C-terminal residues were deleted. When expressed in polarized MDCK cells, ΔMRP2-gfp was found to localize predominantly in the lateral membranes rather than the apical localization of MRP2-gfp (Fig.3). To further characterize the TKF motif of ΔMRP2-gfp and to determine the relative importance of each residue, individual alanine mutations were introduced into each of the residue positions 1543–1545 of the MRP2-gfp construct. Since residues 1542–1544 (STK) form a predicted phosphorylation site, residue 1542 was also mutated to alanine. Fig.4, A—E, show the localization of each of these mutants in MDCK cells. The effects of the substitutions were determined by visualizing the change in localization of the mutant compared with the native protein. The T1543A and K1544A mutants had both apical and basolateral targeting (nonpolarized distribution) with an increase in protein accumulation in intracellular vesicles. The F1545A mutant did not have altered targeting. Mutation of all three residues to alanines caused the protein to be distributed in a nonpolarized manner. In initial unpublished studies we found little evidence for the transport of DNP-GS by MRP2 expressed in the mouse leukemia cell line L1210 (data not shown). This lack of function suggests that the protein did not localize to the cell membrane in these cells. To confirm this observation, MRP2-gfp was expressed in L1210 cells and was found to localize predominantly in intracellular vesicles with only minor membrane localization (Fig.5 A, (i)). Since ΔMRP2-gfp localized basolaterally in MDCK cells, we were interested to determine whether it was able to localize in the L1210 cell membrane. In contrast to MRP2-gfp, ΔMRP2-gfp expressed in L1210 cells almost exclusively localizes to the cell membrane (Fig. 5 A,(ii)). To confirm the localization, we studied cells stably expressing MRP2 and ΔMRP2 without the GFP tag by immunofluorescence. MRP2 was detected intracellularly and had a vesicular localization within the cell (Fig. 5 B, (i)), the same distribution as in Fig. 5 A. ΔMRP2 was detected in the cell membrane (Fig. 5 B, (ii)), the same localization as ΔMRP2-gfp shown in Fig. 5 A, (ii). These results suggest that the deletion of the TKF motif from MRP2 allows the successful targeting of the protein to the membrane of nonpolarized L1210 cells. However, some L1210 cells expressing ΔMRP2 or ΔMRP2-gfp demonstrated a degree of intracellular accumulation, suggesting that localization of ΔMRP2 in the cell membrane of L1210 cells is not as stable as in MDCK cells. L1210 cells are nonadherent and nonpolarized and could be potentially used as a convenient cell line for assessing the transport function of MRP2. Although deletion of the TKF motif allowed expression of MRP2 in the L1210 cell membrane, it was not clear if the motif was also necessary for its transport function. As shown in Fig.6, L1210 cells stably expressing ΔMRP2 demonstrated significantly higher efflux of DNP-GS compared with control L1210 cells or L1210 cells expressing native MRP2. To gain an overview of the potential differences in structure of the MDR and MRP proteins targeted to apical membranes, an alignment was made of the sequences encoding the C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of 37 ABC transporter proteins. Part of the alignment is represented in Fig.7, which shows that those MRP proteins that localize to the apical membrane (MRP2 from four species) have a C-terminal extension when compared with MRP1, MRP3, MRP5, and MRP6, which are targeted to the basolateral membrane. MRP4 also appears to have a potential PDZ-interacting domain at its C terminus, but its site of expression has not been described. The structural coordinates for the ATP binding subunit of histidine permease from Salmonella typhimurium (17Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) and the full ABC transporter sequence alignment allowed the construction of homology models of the equivalent regions of MRP1 and MRP2 (Fig.8). Since the C-terminal motif of MRP2 extends beyond the alignment with HisP, the exact position of the TKF residues cannot be predicted. However, the models predict that the TKF motif is positioned on the outside of the protein, away from the ATP binding cassette and regions involved in the cytoplasmic subunit interface. In addition, the external position of the motif would favor interactions with other proteins involved in the targeting process. Human MRP2 specifically localizes to the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells in the liver and kidney. This localization can be replicated experimentally in MDCK cells (15Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cui Y.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and we demonstrate in this study that an MRP2-gfp fusion protein also localizes to the apical membrane (Fig. 1). This allowed us to undertake mutational analysis to determine targeting signals for apical localization. Deletion of the three amino acids from the C terminus of MRP2 (ΔMRP2-gfp) caused a dramatic change in the targeting of the protein to the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells. The mutant's localization in a polarized cell now mimics MRP1 (Fig. 2), which does not have the deleted motif. This observation indicates that the three-amino acid motif targets MRP2 to the apical membrane and dominates any (as yet unidentified) basolateral targeting signals. Conversely, the motif could exclude the protein from the basolateral domain thus only allowing apical localization. Targeting and/or exclusion are usually mediated by a secondary protein(s) responsible for the recognition of such sorting signals. Interestingly, the motif responsible for apical targeting of MRP2 is a predicted PDZ-interacting domain and has been reported to associate with a PDZ protein, PDZK1 (22Kocher O. Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1161-1170PubMed Google Scholar). This is an analogous mechanism to that of CFTR, which is also targeted apically by a PDZ-interacting domain at its C terminus (13Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,30Moyer, B. D., Duhaime, M., Shaw, C., Denton, J., Reynolds, D., Karlson, K. H., Pfeiffer, J., Wang, S., Mickle, J. E., Milewski, M., Cutting, G. R., Guggino, W. B., Li, M., and Stanton, B. A. (2000) 275,27069–27074.Google Scholar). CFTR was shown to associate with EBP-50, a PDZ protein, and both EBP-50 and PDZK1 were shown to localize specifically to the apical domains in polarized cells (13Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,22Kocher O. Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1161-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Whether PDZK1 and EBP-50 are responsible for sorting and targeting of their respective ABC transporters is yet to be determined. Alternatively these PDZ proteins may be responsible for stabilizing transporters such as CFTR and MRP2 in the membrane, which could also explain their localization solely at the apical domain. To further characterize the motif, alanine was introduced into the position of each residue separately, and an additional mutant was made in which all three residues were replaced by alanine. The T1543A mutant did produce a change in targeting compared with the native protein, allowing both basolateral and apical targeting, i.e.nonpolarized targeting, and also an increased accumulation in vesicles, suggesting some instability in the targeting mechanism. This is consistent with the motif being a PDZ-interacting domain characterized by the motif Ser/Thr-X-hydrophobic residue, whereX represents any amino acid (26Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). This was consistent with the results obtained by the TKF-AAA mutant. The F1545A mutant did not alter normal targeting, suggesting that alanine is a sufficiently hydrophobic residue. The canonical PDZ domain is reported to tolerate any residue (X) at the −1 position, but the K1544A caused nonpolarized targeting, suggesting some flexibility in the constraints determining functional PDZ domains. Interestingly, the serine residue at position 1542 forms a predicted phosphorylation site, and mutation of the serine caused the fusion protein to localize in subapical vesicles. This suggests that the serine may be phosphorylated and could regulate recruitment into the apical membrane. The deletion of the TKF motif increases the sequence similarity of MRP2 to MRP1 and results in the same basolateral targeting. To investigate the tertiary structure of the subunit and the position of the motif, homology models of both MRP1 and MRP2 were created based the crystal structure of HisP. Comparisons of the homology models clearly show the difference in length of the C terminus of MRP1 and MRP2. It is not clear whether it is the interaction with the PDZ-interacting domain that is solely responsible for the apical localization or whether it is the spatial arrangement of the extension and the predicted motif that allows binding/modification to another part of the protein. From the homology model of MRP2 it appears likely that the motif is available for interaction and not buried within the subunit. Also, the position of the C terminus in this model suggests that the motif does not interact with functionally significant areas such as the ATP binding sites. This is further supported by the ability of the deletion mutant ΔMRP2 to transport 2,4-dinitrophenyl glutathione when expressed in L1210 cells (Fig. 6). Alignment of MRP2 with the basolateral MRP proteins MRP1, MRP3, MRP5, and MRP6 shows the absence of the motif in the basolateral transporters. Based on this alignment the MRP2 residues 1539–1545 may play a role in the targeting mechanism as this is the full length of the extension of the C terminus compared with the basolateral proteins. If this motif is the sole targeting signal, then one could predict that MRP4 will be found to be apically targeted in polarized cells. The P-glycoprotein homologues MDR2 (or MDR3) and sPgp (all apically targeted in polarized cells) also have a difference in length compared with the basolaterally localized proteins (alignment not shown). However their overall similarity to MRP2 is very low and does not allow a prediction based on the MRP2 motif. Further studies are required to determine the targeting signals of the Pgp subfamily. There is a notable difference in the sorting of MRP2 in L1210 cells compared with the MDCK cells. When expressed in the L1210 cells, MRP2 transport function was minimal (results not shown). Immunofluorescence studies of cells expressing MRP2 and confocal imaging of cells expressing MRP2-gfp both confirm the intracellular localization of the protein in L1210 cells (Fig. 5). Deletion of the apical targeting motif (the PDZ-interacting domain) from MRP2 and MRP2-gfp allows the mutant protein to be expressed in the plasma membrane. Therefore it is the apical targeting motif that excludes the native MRP2 from the membrane. The stability of the protein in the membrane also differs between MDCK cells and L1210 cells. In MDCK cells ΔMRP2-gfp has basolateral localization in the majority of cells. In L1210 cells, the majority of cells have intracellular localization of ΔMRP2-gfp or ΔMRP2 with the remainder of the cells having cell membrane targeting. This suggests an instability of the mutant protein in the membrane, and it is possible that an additional protein responsible for stabilizing MRP2 in the membrane is not present in L1210 cells. The attachment of GFP to the C terminus of MRP1 or MRP2 did not interfere with correct targeting in this study nor in a previous study of MDR1 (27Sai Y. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the homology models in Fig. 8, the position of the C-terminal helix indicates that GFP would sit on the outside of the subunit. The position of GFP therefore would suggest that the PDZ-interacting domain does not need to be freely exposed and carboxylated to function. In support of this, rabbit MRP2 has a predicted PDZ-interacting domain in the same position as human, mouse, and rat MRP2 but is followed by a further 21 amino acids (Fig.7). The GFP fusion proteins were expressed at consistent levels under the CMV promoter of the EGFP-N1 vector. MRP2-gfp localized apically in the majority of polarized MDCK cells as represented in Fig. 1. However, a minority of cells had very high levels of MRP2-gfp expression and exhibited both apical and lateral localization. This situation could occur in vivo in cancer cells where a number of multidrug-resistant proteins are up-regulated and thus “over”expressed. MRP2 has been found to be expressed in ovarian cancer cells lines (28Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. van Eijk M.J. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar), renal clear cell carcinomas (29Schaub T.P. Kartenbeck J. Konig J. Spring H. Dorsam J. Staehler G. Storkel S. Thon W.F. Keppler D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1159-1169PubMed Google Scholar), lung, gastric, and colorectal cancer cells (25Narasaki F. Oka M. Nakano R. Ikeda K. Fukuda M. Nakamura T. Soda H. Nakagawa M. Kuwano M. Kohno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Depending on the expression levels of MRP2 in these cells, the localization may not be solely apical but may also be lateral and basolateral. Interestingly, P-glycoprotein is specifically apical in polarized cells but can also be expressed in the membrane of hematopoietic cells without the intracellular accumulation observed with MRP2 in L1210 cells (results not shown). Furthermore, Pgp is normally expressed in polarized cells of the gastrointestinal tract but is expressed in MDR tumors in other tissue types that are not necessarily polarized. This indicates a difference in the targeting signals between MRP2 and P-glycoprotein. This study demonstrates that the PDZ-interacting domain of MRP2 functions as the apical targeting signal in MDCK cells yet excludes the protein from the cell membrane in L1210 cells. This motif is not present in the basolaterally targeted MRP proteins 1, 3, 5, and 6.

https://openalex.org/W2067419202,"Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins must bind membranes in an orientation that permits the protein-protein interactions necessary for regulatory activity. RGS4 binds to phospholipid surfaces in a slow, multistep process that leads to maximal GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity. When RGS4 is added to phospholipid vesicles that contain m2 or m1 muscarinic receptor and Gi, Gz, or Gq, GAP activity increases ∼3-fold over 4 h at 30 °C and more slowly at 20 °C. This increase in GAP activity is preceded by several other events that suggest that, after binding, optimal interaction with G protein and receptor requires reorientation of RGS4 on the membrane surface, a conformational change, or both. Binding of RGS4 is initially reversible but becomes irreversible within 5 min. Onset of irreversibility parallels initial quenching of tryptophan fluorescence (t12 ∼ 30 s). Further quenching occurs after binding has become irreversible (t 12 ∼ 6 min) but is complete well before maximal GAP activity is attained. These processes all appear to be energetically driven by the amphipathic N-terminal domain of RGS4 and are accelerated by palmitoylation of cysteine residues in this region. The RGS4 N-terminal domain confers similar membrane binding behavior on the RGS domains of either RGS10 or RGSZ1."

However, 8-bromo-cGMP, a PKG stimulator, acutely increased KCC3 mRNA expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion; this effect was blocked by the PKG inhibitor KT5823 but not by actinomycin D. These findings show that VSMCs express mainly two mRNA isoforms, KCC1 and KCC3, and suggest that PKG participates post-transcriptionally in the acute KCC3 mRNA regulation.

Two type 1 isoforms, 1α and 1β, are the result of the alternative splicing of a unique gene (5Orstavik S. Natarajan V. Tasken H. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These 75-kDa isoforms differ at the N terminus, but they share the same C terminus, wherein the cGMP-binding sites and the catalytic domain reside (6Ruth P. Pfeifer A. Kamm S. Klatt P. Dostmann W.R.G. Hofmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10522-10528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In VSMCs, almost all of the PKG immunoreactivity belongs to PKG-1, and only PKG-1α was detected by Northern blot (7Soff G.A. Cornwell T.L. Cundiff D.L. Gately S. Lincoln T.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although PKG regulation of gene expression remains largely unknown, a recent report indicates that PKG may be a weak activator of cAMP-dependent transcription because of its cytoplasmic restriction. These data suggest that regulation of gene expression by PKG involves phosphorylation of uncharacterized cytoplasmic protein(s) (8Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both repetitive passage and chronic exposure of VSMCs to NO donors are associated with reduced to undetectable expression levels of PKG-1 (7Soff G.A. Cornwell T.L. Cundiff D.L. Gately S. Lincoln T.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This enzyme determines the phenotype of VSMCs (9Cornwell T.L. Soff G.A. Traynor A.E. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc.

Thus, PKG-expressing cells possess a contractile-like morphology, whereas PKG-deficient cells become dedifferentiated and “synthetic.” Transfection of PKG-deficient VSMCs with cDNAs encoding the full-length PKG-1 or its C-terminal catalytic domain restores their original contractile morphology (11Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in PKG-deficient mice, the loss of PKG abolishes NO/cGMP-dependent relaxation of VSM, resulting in severe vascular dysfunction. However, PKG-deficient VSM responds normally to cAMP, indicating that cAMP and cGMP signal via independent pathways with PKG being the specific mediator of the NO/cGMP effects (12Pfeifer A. Klatt P.

Here we report the mRNA expression pattern and relative abundance of the KCC isoforms in low passaged VSMCs and the regulation of KCC3 at the mRNA level by PKG. KCC1 and KCC3 mRNAs were found to be expressed in normal, PKG+, and PKG− VSMCs. Furthermore, in all cell types, KCC3 mRNA was expressed at lower levels than KCC1 mRNA, and PKG appeared to be involved in the regulation of the KCC3 mRNA isoform. KCC1 mRNA regulation by the NO/cGMP signaling pathway is the subject of a separate study. The Renaissance NEL-100 immunochemiluminescence kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primary rabbit polyclonal anti-human PKG-1-specific antibody, secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG antibody, KT5823, and actinomycin D were from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, tissue culture grade, and molecular biology reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Total RNA extraction, Access RT-PCR kit, rat actin PCR primers, and 100-bp DNA ladder were from Promega Corp. Primary cultures were obtained according to the protocols described previously (10Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc.

Briefly, aortas from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) sacrificed by asphyxiation in CO2-saturated chambers were obtained from the Wright State University Animal Facilities. Aortas were excised and placed in a wash medium of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20 mm HEPES, 5 μm amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The aortas were cleaned and placed in digestion medium (130 units/ml collagenase type IV and 5 μg/ml DNase I) for 10 min at 37 °C. The tunica adventitia was removed, and the medial layers were minced and further digested for 1–2 h in digestion medium containing 200 units/ml collagenase until a single cell suspension was obtained. Cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10‥ fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, 70 μmstreptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μm amphotericin B and plated in 6-well culture plates. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10‥ fetal bovine serum as before in a controlled atmosphere of air-CO2 (5‥) at 37 °C until confluence (6–7 days). Confluent VSMCs at passages 0–2 were used after 24 h of serum deprivation. Normal VSMCs expressing no endogenous PKG were transfected with the active cGMP-independent catalytic domain of PKG-1 or with the empty vector, as reported earlier (11Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transfected VSMCs were cultured in the same culture medium and conditions as above but in the presence of 10‥ CO2 and 1 mm geneticin until they reached confluence. The culture medium was changed every 48 h during 5–6 days. For the experiments reported here, at least three independent clones of cells expressing the PKG catalytic domain (PKG+ cells) or vector only (PKG− cells) were examined. Agents to be tested were incorporated on day 6–7 of culture after 24 h of serum deprivation in triplicate dishes and for the time indicated. Cell viability, as assessed by the trypan-blue exclusion test, ranged from 85 to 95‥. Total RNA from normal, PKG−, and PKG+ VSMCs was obtained by standard procedures (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi A. Anal.

These primers were used to obtain the first cDNA strand by RT, and the subsequent amplification of each KCC mRNA isoform present in VSMCs was done by PCR. Briefly, RT: 45 min at 48 °C; denaturation, 2 min at 94 °C; and PCR: denaturation, 1 min at 94 °C; annealing, 1 min at 55 °C; and extension, 1 min at 68 °C, during 40 cycles. The semiquantitative RT-PCR conditions were established in our laboratory to allow comparisons between the expression of KCC1, KCC3, and actin transcripts. Under these conditions, the efficiency of the RT-PCR reaction for each gene did not plateau, and the numbers of cycles used in these experiments were kept to a minimum (Fig. 2 B, inset). The relative expression levels of KCC1 and KCC3 mRNA isoforms were determined by using 1.0 μg of total RNA as template and 30 cycles of PCR with the same thermal conditions as before. As control, we analyzed the expression of actin mRNA using specific rat primers, the same amount of total RNA as before, and 25 PCR cycles. These were optimal conditions for the semiquantitative analysis of VSMC KCC mRNAs, and the analysis was limited to the products generated only in the exponential phase of the amplification (Fig. 2 B, inset). The general semiquantitative RT-PCR protocol was as follows: RT-PCR reactions were performed by preparing a master RT-PCR mixture containing 3.0 μg of total RNA from VSMCs and aliquoted in three separate tubes containing the specific set of primers for KCC1, KCC3, and actin, respectively. As a negative control for each set of primers, RT-PCR reactions were performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase and/or RNA. After RT-PCR, the content of each independent reaction tube was analyzed by 2‥ agarose gel electrophoresis. The bands (KCC1, 233 bp; KCC3, 663 bp; and actin, 285 bp) were visualized with ethidium bromide. All of the ethidium bromide-stained gels were depicted as an inverse image for clear results. The identities of rat KCC1 and KCC3 were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion according to the sequences published and the expected DNA fragments obtained (data not shown). VSMCs were rinsed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5‥ Triton X-100, and protein phosphatase and protease inhibitors (40 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin A). Total cellular protein extracts were obtained by successive passages through a syringe with needle and centrifuged at 13,000 × g(23Di Fulvio M. Coleoni A.H. Pellizas C.G. Masini-Repiso A.M. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein content of the supernatant was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Expression of PKG-1 (75 kDa) was assayed in protein extracts from normal VSMCs by Western blot by using a specific PKG-1 antibody directed against the last 15 amino acids at the C terminus, according to published procedures (24Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extracts (50 μg) from normal VSMCs were diluted with 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8), plus loading buffer and subjected to 10‥ PAGE (Mini-Protean II, electrophoresis cell, Bio-Rad) with 0.4‥ SDS, in parallel with prestained molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C during 70 min at 100 V in a Trans-Blot cell (Mini Trans-Blot, electrophoretic transfer cell, Bio-Rad). PKG-1 antibody was used at 1:10,000 dilution. Mouse anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000) was used as horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagent. The horseradish peroxidase-reaction was developed by immunochemiluminescence. The analysis of multiple intergroup differences in each experiment was conducted by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test. Ap < 0.05 was used as the criterion of statistical significance. Except where indicated, all values were obtained from three independent experiments in which at least triplicate samples were assayed. Expression of the different KCC mRNA isoforms in VSMCs is unknown. Thus, we performed simple RT-PCR reactions with KCC isoform-specific primers to obtain some information about the expression of KCC mRNAs in these cells, as well as in PKG− and PKG+ VSMCs. Under normal conditions, KCC1 and KCC3 mRNA isoforms of the expected sizes were detected in the three VSMC types (Fig. 1 A). To corroborate the ability of our KCC-specific primers to amplify each KCC isoform, we conducted simultaneously RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from rat kidney and brain, because it has been reported that these tissues express mainly KCC1 and KCC3 and all of the mRNA isoforms, respectively (Fig. 1 B). We also detected a faint band of the size expected for the brain-specific KCC2 mRNA isoform in VSMCs under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that KCC1 mRNA expression was more abundant than KCC3 mRNA, both relative to actin mRNA expression (Fig.2). In this study, only results for KCC3 mRNA regulation have been presented. Parallel studies involving KCC1 mRNA regulation will be reported separately. To define the relationship between PKG and KCC3 mRNA expression in VSMCs, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR in normal VSMCs as a function of cell passage, a well documented way to deplete gradually endogenous PKG-1 expression (7Soff G.A. Cornwell T.L. Cundiff D.L. Gately S. Lincoln T.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows the semiquantitative RT-PCR results as well as the densitometric analysis normalized with respect to actin (Fig. 3 B). The expression levels of PKG-1 protein in normal VSMCs were simultaneously examined by Western blot. Fig. 3 C shows a representative Western blot in which the anti-PKG antibody detected a single major band with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa corresponding to the native endogenous PKG. These experiments demonstrate no correlation between endogenous PKG and basal KCC3 mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between the relative expression levels of KCC3 mRNA in normal, PKG+, and PKG− VSMCs (Fig.4).Figure 4KCC3 mRNA expression in PKG−, normal, and PKG+ VSMCs. PKG−, PKG+, and normal VSMCs were cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Total RNA was extracted, and KCC3 and actin mRNA expression levels were tested by RT-PCR using specific primers. A, representative RT-PCR products separated in 2‥ agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide showing the bands of the expected sizes: 663 (KCC3) and 285 bp (Actin). B, densitometric analysis (optical density in arbitrary units as a ‥ of Normal cells) representing the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments, each done in triplicate. All of the results were normalized with respect to actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish a possible relationship between PKG activity and KCC3 mRNA expression, we incubated normal VSMCs at passage 0–2 with 8-Br-cGMP, a known stimulator of PKG activity. As shown in Fig. 5, KCC3 mRNA expression was acutely stimulated at the lowest cGMP analog concentration (0.1 mm) in normal VSMCs following the indicated exposure time to the drug (Fig. 5, A and B). At higher 8-Br-cGMP concentrations, the effect reached a plateau (Fig. 5,C and D). These findings suggest for the first time that PKG activity participates in acute regulation of KCC3 mRNA expression in normal VSMCs. The opposite situation was found in the presence of KT5823, a known inhibitor of PKG actions. As shown in Fig.6, A and B, KT5823 was able to inhibit the 8-Br-cGMP-induced effect on KCC3 mRNA expression in normal VSMCs. Furthermore, KT5823 per se had no effect on KCC3 mRNA expression under these experimental conditions (Fig. 6 C). Because the onset of the effect of 8-Br-cGMP was fast, we studied whether the changes observed in KCC3 mRNA expression were due to transcriptional regulation. To this end, we incubated normal VSMCs at passage 0–2 with 0.1 mm 8-Br-cGMP in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. As shown in Fig. 7,A and B, no major changes induced by actinomycin D in the presence of the cGMP analog were observed in our experimental conditions. This finding indicates that the transcriptional machinery is not needed for the 8-Br-cGMP-induced effect on KCC3 mRNA expression. Analysis of rat normal, PKG−, and PKG+ VSMC mRNAs by RT-PCR using specific sets of primers showed a specific expression pattern of KCC isoforms. KCC1 and KCC3 mRNAs were found to be abundantly expressed, with higher KCC1 mRNA levels relative to KCC3 mRNA in VSMCs. Similar results have also been shown by others in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells in which KCC1 mRNA was found at highest abundance with respect to KCC3 mRNA (15Hiki K. D'Andrea R.J.

KCC1 mRNA has been found to be expressed in all tissues tested so far (20Su W. Shmukler B.E. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. de Franceschi L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C899-C912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of KCC3 mRNA expression revealed a more tissue-restricted expression pattern than KCC1 mRNA (15Hiki K. D'Andrea R.J. Furze J. Crawford J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10661-10667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the KCC1 mRNA levels relative to KCC3 mRNA in the different tissues were not determined, and the reason for the selective VSM distribution of these two different KCC mRNAs remains unknown. We were unable to detect KCC4 mRNA, which suggests undetectable levels or absence of KCC4 mRNA in VSMCs under our experimental conditions. On the other hand, a faint band of the expected size for KCC2 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in our cells. This implies that using Northern blot as the major criteria for tissue-specific distribution of transcripts clearly needs further reconsideration. The absence of correlation between KCC3 mRNA expression levels and PKG protein expression as a function of cell passage and the finding of a similar KCC3 mRNA expression level in normal, PKG−, and PKG+ VSMCs suggest no major involvement of this protein kinase in the maintenance of basal KCC3 mRNA expression. Recently, it has been shown that basal expression levels of the mitogen-activated protein kinase remain without changes in normal VSMCs and in endogenous PKG-depleted VSMCs. However, the NO/cGMP signaling pathway increases mitogen-activated protein kinase activity only in normal VSMCs (24Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Besides, the absence of differences between KCC3 mRNA expression levels in normal low and high passaged PKG-depleted VSMCs and in PKG− and PKG+ VSMCs suggests a lack of PKG-dependent phosphorylation of putative proteins involved in KCC3 mRNA regulation. Little information is available on how the cGMP-activated PKG-dependent signal transduction pathways may influence gene expression. Recently, NO-releasing agents and membrane-permeable analogs of cGMP at concentrations able to increase protein phosphorylation in VSMCs have been shown to activate transcription from activator protein-1 responsive promoters or by other mechanisms in rodent fibroblast and epithelial cell lines (25Pilz R.B.

NO can also regulate RNA polymerase II-independent gene expression by altering mRNA stability (28Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The positive effect of 8-Br-cGMP on KCC3 mRNA expression suggests a direct participation of PKG as a modulator of KCC3 mRNA expression. The inhibitory actions of KT5823 on the 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated KCC3 mRNA expression levels in normal VSMCs occurred at concentrations that selectively block PKG-driven phosphorylations (24Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of action of these drugs are still obscure, our findings suggest that the PKG pathway is important in KCC3 mRNA regulation. Besides, the fact that KT5823 has little or no effect on cAMP-dependent protein kinase (24Komalavilas P. Shah P.K. Jo H. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34301-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and that there is no effect of 8-Br-cGMP in VSMCs lacking endogenous PKG but with normal cAMP-dependent protein kinase (data not shown) suggest that cGMP is not cross-talking with the cAMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, as has been proposed for other effects of the nucleotide (24Komalavilas P.

Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, cAMP and other signaling pathways should not be simply ignored in KCC regulation because both may target the same factors before converging in the same final effect (8Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further confirmation is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the KCC3 gene expression in VSMCs. Post-transcriptional modifications may also contribute to the induction of KCC3 mRNA expression in VSMCs. The inhibition of the transcriptional machinery during the exposure time of the cGMP analog by actinomycin D showed no effect on KCC3 mRNA expression. These data suggest that the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway leads to an increase in KCC3 mRNA expression by a post-transcriptional mechanism(s) in VSMCs. Several lines of evidence support the notion that NO is able to promote stabilization of different mRNAs against target endonucleolytic degradation in the absence of active transcription (28Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,30Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been recently demonstrated that the fate of mRNAs are mostly controlled by interactions between specific mRNA-binding proteins and certain mRNA 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions (33Kaldy P. Menotti E. Moret R. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6073-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be of interest to identify the pertinent 5′- and/or 3′-untranslated control regions of the KCC3 mRNA and the PKG-regulated protein(s) that interact with them. The fact that KT5823 inhibited the 8-Br-cGMP effect on KCC3 mRNA expression, that these effects cannot be reproduced in VSMCs lacking endogenous PKG (data not shown), and that there was a lack of effect of actinomycin D on the 8-Br-cGMP-induced KCC3 mRNA expression are consistent with the hypothesis that KCC3 gene expression is regulated by PKG at the post-transcriptional level in VSMCs. Together these data show for the first time a possible and direct role of PKG in the acute regulation of KCC3 mRNA expression in VSMCs. Protein kinase G regulates potassium chloride cotransporter-4 expression in primary cultures of rat vascular smooth muscle cells. VOLUME 276 (2001) PAGES 21046-21052Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 281Issue 30PreviewThe oligonucleotides used in this paper for KCC3 mRNA amplification in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were designed based on sequences reported in Mount et al. (1). Because the KCC3 sequence described by Mount et al. in fact corresponds to KCC4 (see Ref. 1 below), the title of our paper (shown corrected above) as well as figure labels and their legends making reference to KCC3 mRNA expression or regulation in VSMCs should be changed to refer to KCC4 (potassium chloride cotransporter-4). Since, independently, we have shown the presence of KCC3a and KCC3b isoforms and their regulation by the NO/sGC/PKG/cGMp signaling cascade (2), this correction does not change the overall interpretation of the data, except that we now conclude that KCC3a, KCC3b, and KCC4 mRNAs are subjected to regulation by the signal transduction pathways originally proposed by us (2, 3).

Monocytes are the key components of the cellular infiltrates present in these disorders. We hypothesized that soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) might mediate the chemotaxis of monocytes. In this report, we show that sE-selectin induced normal human peripheral blood monocyte migration in the nanomolar range in a concentration-dependent manner. Neutralization studies using RA human joint synovial fluids and anti-E-selectin antibody showed a mean 31% reduction in RA synovial fluid-mediated monocyte chemotaxis (p < 0.05), indicating that sE-selectin is a major monocyte recruiter in RA. Next, we investigated the role of tyrosine phosphorylation pathways in sE-selectin-induced monocyte chemotaxis. Human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with sE-selectin showed a time-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a broad range of cellular proteins, predominantly in the molecular size range of Src family kinases (50–60 kDa) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Western blot analysis of Src family kinases showed a time-dependent increase in Src, Hck, and Lyn phosphorylation.

E-selectin is a single-chain 115-kDa glycoprotein with a lectin-like N-terminal domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif, and a variable number of repeat units homologous to the consensus repeats of complement binding proteins (3Chapman P.T.

The lectin domain of E-selectin plays a major role in ligand recognition and binds to sialyl LeX on leukocytes as well as on endothelial cells (4Phillips M.L. Nudelman E. Gaeta F.C.A. Perez M.

Soluble isoforms of these adhesion molecules are rapidly shed from the cellular surfaces on cellular activation (1Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found elevated levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) in patients with RA (7Koch A.E. Turkiewicz W. Harlow L.A. Pope R.M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 69: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast to the earlier hypothesis that soluble adhesion molecules serve an anti-inflammatory role, our laboratory has shown a unique role for sE-selectin as a proinflammatory, angiogenic mediator (8Koch A.E. Halloran M.M. Haskell C.J. Shah M.R. Polverini P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The infiltration of monocytes into the synovial tissue is a key factor in amplifying and perpetuating RA. The functions of elevated levels of sE-selectin and the mechanism of action of sE-selectin are still poorly understood. One of the primary mechanisms by which leukocytes are activated might be through the activation of protein tyrosine kinases at the cell surface (9Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A.

The Src family of tyrosine kinases is activated during a number of biological functions including monocyte interaction with endothelial cells (11Chisholm L.J. Dovgan P.S. Agrawal D.K. McGregor P.E. Edwards J.D. J. Vasc. Surg. 1996; 23: 288-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), endothelial cell differentiation (12Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A number of pathways lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs are a family of 38–45 kDa proteins that exist in a dephosphorylated form in quiescent cells and can be activated in response to various growth factors and chemoattractants (14Suzuki M. Tetsuka T. Yoshida S. Watanabe N. Kobayashi M. Matsui N. Okamoto T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Mocsai A. Jakus Z. Vantus T. Berton G. Lowell C.A. Ligeti E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4321-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated by MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which in turn is activated by MEK kinase (MEKK). One of the extensively studied MEKKs is Raf kinase (16Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). Raf kinase is in turn activated by binding to Ras-GTP (17Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and Src is an important upstream kinase linked to Ras-Raf activation (12Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,18Penuel E. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role and mechanism of action of sE-selectin in mediating monocyte recruitment. We report that sE-selectin is a potent chemotactic factor for monocytes, and its neutralization in RA synovial fluids, led to a significant decrease in RA synovial fluid-mediated monocyte migration. Furthermore, our results suggest that sE-selectin mediates signaling in monocytes through a Src-Ras-MAPK pathway. The inhibition of Src kinase by the Src-specific inhibitor, PP2, abolished sE-selectin-mediated monocyte chemotaxis. These results suggest that sE-selectin mediates chemotaxis through the Src pathway, and this could thus be a potential target for modulating monocyte recruitment-driven diseases.

Synovial fluids were obtained from patients with RA who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA (19Arnett F.C. Edworthy S.M. Bloch D.A. McShane D.J. Fries J.F. Cooper N.S. Healey L.A. Kaplan S.R. Liang M.H. Luthra H.S. Medsger T.A.J. Mitchell D.M. Neustadt D.H. Pinals R.S. Schaller J.G. Sharp J.T. Wilder R.L. Hunder G.G. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (18391) Google Scholar). All specimens were obtained with Institutional Review Board approval. MN were isolated from the peripheral blood (PB) of normal healthy volunteers using Accu-Prep. PB was collected from normal healthy adult donors in heparinized tubes. After collecting a buffy coat, MN were purified under sterile conditions by centrifugation on Accu-Prep at 400 × g for 30 min at room temperature. MN were collected at the interface, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in HBSS with calcium and magnesium at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The viability of MN used was >98%, and the purity was >99%. The method of monocyte separation was described previously (20Denholm E.M. Wolber F.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 144: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 ml of MN (5 × 107 cells) was gently layered over 8 ml of isolation buffer (1.65 ml of 10× HBSS in 10 ml of Percoll, pH 7.0). After centrifugation at 400 × g for 25 min at room temperature, monocytes at the interface were collected. The viability of monocytes determined by trypan blue exclusion was found to be >98%, and the purity was >90%. Monocytes (1 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated in 24-well plates for 3 h in HBSS (with calcium and magnesium) prior to stimulation with sE-selectin for various time points. At the end of each time period, supernatants were gently aspirated, and cells were lysed in extraction buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm NaP2O4, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture tablets, 1 tablet/10 ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For experiments with signaling inhibitors, monocytes were preincubated with the respective inhibitor before activation with sE-selectin. The protein content of different samples was quantitated using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit. Cell lysates were mixed at 1:1 with Laemmli's sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. 15 μg of each sample was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Tris-glycine buffer. To block nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated in respective primary antibody in TBST + 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000) or with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) for 45 min at room temperature. An enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect specific protein bands. The different bands were then scanned and quantitated using an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were precleared with rabbit nonimmune serum prebound to sheep anti-rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma). Lyn and Hck kinases were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of each precleared sample by incubation at 4 °C for 16 h with 2 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-Lyn (Upstate Biotechnology) or 3 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-Hck antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. The immune complexes were further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C after the addition of sheep anti-rabbit IgG-agarose conjugate. Immunopellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, reconstituted in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. These samples were subsequently run on 10% SDS-PAGE as described above. The presence of activated Lyn and Hck kinases was detected by probing the blots with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10 clone) (Upstate Biotechnology). The immunoblots were stripped for 30 min at 55 °C in 67 mm Tris at pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-Lyn or rabbit polyclonal anti-Hck antibody, respectively. Ras activation was studied using a Ras activation kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Monocytes were stimulated with sE-selectin (50 nm) for different time periods. At each time point monocytes were extracted with cell lysis buffer, and the protein content in each sample was quantitated. The Ras activation assay involved two steps. In the second step, the presence of activated Ras was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of each monocyte lysate sample with an immobilized Raf-1-Ras binding domain and subsequently run on 10% SDS-PAGE as described above. The presence of activated Ras in samples was then detected by probing with a specific mouse monoclonal anti-Ras antibody (1 μg/ml). The different bands were then scanned and quantitated using an imaging densitometer. Monocyte chemotaxis was performed using 48-well chemotaxis chambers (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) with a polyvinylpyrolidone-free polycarbonate filter as described previously (21Volin M.V. Shah M.R. Tokuhira M. Haines G.K. Woods J.M. Koch A.E. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1998; 89: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, 25 μl of stimulant or buffer was added to the bottom wells of the chambers. A 5-μm membrane was placed in the assembly, and 40 μl of monocytes at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml was placed in the top of wells. The chemotaxis chambers were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The filters were removed, and the membranes were fixed in methanol and stained with Diff-Quik (VWR Scientific Products, Chicago, IL). Each test group was assayed in quadruplicate. Three high power (×400) microscope fields were counted in each replicate well, and the results were expressed as cells per high power field. In synovial fluid neutralization studies, 1:2 diluted synovial fluid was preincubated with anti-sE-selectin antibody (5 μg/ml) (Biogen) or corresponding control antibody (mouse IgG1) for 1 h at 37 °C. In the signaling inhibitor studies, monocytes (2.5 × 106cells/ml) were preincubated with their respective inhibitors for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing twice with HBSS containing calcium and magnesium, the cells were adjusted to 2.5 × 106cells/ml and then assayed in response to different concentrations of sE-selectin. The results are expressed as the mean and S.E. of three high power fields (×400) per replicate well, and each test group was assayed in quadruplicate. The incubation of monocytes with the Src inhibitor PP2 at 1 μm did not alter cell viability. For all assays, controls included HBSS (negative control), fMLP (positive control), and Me2SO (a vehicle for the Src inhibitor). Data were analyzed using Student'st test, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Our laboratory has shown that sE-selectin levels are up-regulated in synovial fluids from patients with RA (7Koch A.E. Turkiewicz W. Harlow L.A. Pope R.M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 69: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine the hypothesis that sE-selectin might be chemotactic for monocytes, we studied monocyte chemotaxis in response to sE-selectin in a modified Boyden chamber. A representative assay from five experiments is shown in Fig.1. sE-selectin-induced chemotaxis in a concentration-dependent manner and was significantly higher at 10, 50, and 100 nm sE-selectin concentrations as compared with the negative control (p< 0.05). We have shown earlier that RA synovial fluid is potently chemotactic for monocytes (22Tokuhira M. Hosaka S. Volin M.V. Haines III, G.K. Katschke Jr., K.J. Kim S. Koch A.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1122-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and we have also demonstrated that high levels of sE-selectin are present in the RA synovial fluid (7Koch A.E. Turkiewicz W. Harlow L.A. Pope R.M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 69: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of sE-selectin present in the RA synovial fluid to the chemotaxis of normal PB monocytes, a 1:2 dilution of RA synovial fluid was preincubated with isotype-matched control antibody or anti-E-selectin antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. The incubation of RA synovial fluid with anti-E-selectin antibody significantly decreased monocyte chemotaxis (129 ± 3.2, 193 ± 4.4, and 90 ± 7.5) as compared with the isotype control antibody in the respective samples (225 ± 5.9, 270 ± 13.7, and 134 ± 4.1) (TableI). These data indicate that sE-selectin contributes significantly to the RA synovial fluid chemotactic activity for monocytes.Table IPercent suppression of normal human PB monocyte migration in response to RA synovial fluid (SF) incubated with anti-E-selectin antibodyPatientsControl antibody or neutralizing antibodyMean cells ± S.E./high-power field 1-aRA SF samples were diluted 1:2 in Hanks' balanced salt solution and assayed for normal PB monocyte chemotaxis.

Open table in a new tab We next investigated the signaling pathways involved in the sE-selectin-mediated monocyte chemotaxis. sE-selectin (50 nm) induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in monocytes in a time-dependent manner showing two peaks. Western blot analysis showed a first peak at 30 s and a second peak at 30 min. Proteins phosphorylated at tyrosine residues corresponding to molecular sizes of 130–140, 70, 60–65, 50–55, 42–44, 35–40, and 25 kDa were detected (Fig. 2) by using a mouse monoclonal antibody (4G10), which specifically reacts with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. As the predominant bands (50–65 kDa) observed with the 4G10 antibody corresponded to the molecular sizes of the Src family kinases, we next studied the role of Src family kinases Src, Hck, and Lyn in sE-selectin-mediated signaling in monocytes. We first performed a time course study of Src kinase activation followed by a Src inhibition study with the Src inhibitor PP2. Western blot analysis of activated Src with a phosphorylation state-specific antibody (Tyr(P)418) showed a biphasic activation of Src with the first peak at 30 s and a second peak at 30 min (Fig.3). The pretreatment of monocytes with the Src inhibitor PP2 (1 μm) for 30 min prior to stimulation with sE-selectin partially inhibited Src phosphorylation (Fig. 4). We next studied the role of two other Src family kinases (Hck and Lyn) in sE-selectin-mediated signaling in monocytes. Hck and Lyn kinases were immunoprecipitated from sE-selectin-stimulated monocytes by polyclonal rabbit anti-Hck or polyclonal rabbit anti-Lyn antibodies, respectively. The activation of Hck and Lyn kinases was determined by subjecting these immunoprecipitates to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10). Hck kinase showed a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.5 A), whereas Lyn kinase showed a minor peak at 30 s and a major peak at 30 min (Fig.5 B). The pretreatment of monocytes with PP2 markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of both Hck and Lyn kinases (Fig. 5). The total protein phosphotyrosine profile analysis in monocytes pretreated with PP2 prior to sE-selectin stimulation showed inhibition of the phosphorylation of proteins in the MAPK region (35–45 kDa) in addition to the inhibition of Src family kinase region (60–70 kDa) (Fig.2 B).Figure 4Inhibition of sE-selectin-mediated Src activation by the Src-specific inhibitor PP2. Monocytes were pretreated with the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C before being stimulated with sE-selectin for different time points. Cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer at each time point, and the protein concentration in each sample was quantitated. 15 μg of each sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-pSrc antibody (0.5 μg/ml). The pretreatment of monocytes with the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 markedly decreased Src phosphorylation by sE-selectin. This blot is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Hck and Lyn activation in monocytes stimulated with sE-selectin. Monocytes, untreated or preincubated with 1 μm PP2 for 30 min, were stimulated with sE-selectin (50 nm). Cell extracts were prepared at various time points, and the protein concentration in each sample was quantitated. Each sample (100 μg) was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Hck or anti-Lyn antibodies and Western-blotted (WB) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) to detect activated Hck or Lyn kinase. Alternatively, the blots were probed for total Hck or Lyn kinase. sE-selectin induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Hck (A) and Lyn (B) in a time-dependent manner, which was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with PP2. These results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the hypothesis that the sE-selectin signal from Src family kinases might be acting through MAP kinases, we studied the time course of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK activation in monocytes. ERK1/2 showed a biphasic activation profile as observed with Src kinase with the first peak occurring at 1 min and the second peak at 30 min (Fig. 6). However, p38 MAPK did not show phosphorylation until 5 min after stimulation and showed a single peak at 30 min (Fig. 7). Next, we studied the role of the Src inhibitor PP2 on ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation. The pretreatment of monocytes with the Src inhibitor PP2 prior to stimulation with sE-selectin revealed 89 and 83% inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, respectively, as compared with sE-selectin-stimulated monocytes (Figs.8 and 9) at 30 min. Similar levels of the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK were observed at other time points.Figure 7p38 MAPK activation in monocytes stimulated with sE-selectin. Monocytes were stimulated with sE-selectin (50 nm) at various time points as indicated in Fig. 6(m, minutes). Cells were extracted with cell lysis buffer, and the protein content of each sample was quantitated. 15 μg of each sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 antibody (1:1000 dilution). The sE-selectin stimulation of monocytes induced the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in a time-dependent fashion as compared with the control nonstimulated monocytes.

Haskard D.O. Br. Med. Bull. 1995; 51: 296-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), so we tested whether sE-selectin mediates its action through the EGF receptor. Our results show that sE-selectin does not induce the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (data not shown). We also studied the phosphorylation profile of focal adhesion kinase, a substrate for the Src family kinases. However, we failed to detect the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase in sE-selectin-stimulated monocytes (data not shown). These data indicate that in contrast to Src family kinases (Src, Hck, and Lyn) and MAPKs (ERK1/2 and p38), the EGF receptor and focal adhesion kinase pathways are not involved in sE-selectin-mediated monocyte signaling. A number of studies have shown that Raf kinase is a predominant MEK kinase (16Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 23Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that in turn is activated by binding to Ras-GTP (17Marshall M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Src family kinases have also been shown to be linked to MAPK through Ras/Raf kinases (12Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Penuel E. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To study the activation of Ras/Raf kinases, we first immunoprecipitated activated Ras with a Raf-1-Ras binding domain conjugated to agarose beads and subsequently probed with mouse monoclonal anti-Ras antibody. sE-selectin stimulation of monocytes showed a time-dependent activation of the Ras/Raf pathway, which peaked at 30 min (Fig.10). Next, to examine the functional role of Src kinase in sE-selectin-induced monocyte chemotaxis, we performed monocyte chemotaxis in the presence and absence of the Src inhibitor PP2 (1 μm). Monocytes were pretreated with PP2 for 30 min at 37 °C prior to performing the chemotaxis assay. fMLP served as the positive control, and HBSS served as the negative control. Fig.11 shows a representative assay from three independent experiments. The pretreatment of monocytes with the Src inhibitor PP2 significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) monocyte chemotaxis as compared with sE-selectin alone, thereby suggesting that sE-selectin could be mediating monocyte chemotaxis through the Src pathway. Monocyte recruitment into the synovial tissue is a key step in RA pathogenesis because activated monocytes and/or macrophages can function as antigen-presenting cells, and these cells also have the ability to secrete a variety of inflammatory mediators including prostaglandins (24Penglis P.S.

Mazarakis D.D. Haines G.K. Burdick M.D. Pope R.M. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 921-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have reported a number of putative monocyte/macrophage chemoattractants in the RA synovial fluid, such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (29Koch A.E. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. Mazarakis D.D. Haines G.K. Burdick M.D. Pope R.M. Strieter R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 921-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Villiger P.M. Terkeltaub R. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 722-727PubMed Google Scholar), which may be involved in monocyte/macrophage recruitment into the RA synovial tissue. In this report, we show that sE-selectin is a potent chemotactic agent for monocytes in the nanomolar range. We have previously shown elevated levels of sE-selectin (in the nanomolar range) in the RA synovial fluid (7Koch A.E. Turkiewicz W. Harlow L.A. Pope R.M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 69: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that at the concentrations found in the RA joints, sE-selectin might be acting in large part to recruit and activate monocytes. To address the contribution provided by the sE-selectin to RA synovial fluid chemotactic activity for monocytes, we immunodepleted RA synovial fluid sE-selectin by using neutralizing mouse monoclonal anti-E-selectin antibodies. The neutralization of RA synovial fluid sE-selectin significantly decreased monocyte chemotaxis (mean of 31%, p < 0.05) as compared with the matched isotype control antibody. Thus, these results suggest a novel function for sE-selectin as a chemotactic factor for monocytes in the RA synovial fluid. Recent studies have shown that intact, transmembrane E-selectin can transduce signals in endothelial cells during inflammatory leukocyte recruitment (31Yoshida M. Seikagaku. 1998; 70: 1270-1274PubMed Google Scholar). Hu et al. (23Hu Y. Kiely J.M. Szente B.E. Rosenzweig A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2142-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that the cross-linking of endothelial cell surface E-selectin with antibodies leads to the up-regulation of mRNA for c-fos, an early response gene, through the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway. However, we are not aware of any studies regarding the signaling pathway used by sE-selectin to mediate its biological function. In this regard, we investigated sE-selectin-mediated signaling in normal PB monocytes. sE-selectin induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of monocyte proteins corresponding to molecular sizes of 130–140, 70–74, 60–65, 50–55, 42–44, 35–40, and 20–25 kDa in a time-dependent manner. Marked increases in tyrosine phosphorylation were detected as early as 30 s after stimulation and peaked at 30 min, which is consistent with a typical time course of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (13Haas M. Askari A. Xie Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 32McGilvray I.D. Lu Z. Bitar R. Dackiw A.P.B. Davreux C.J. Rotstein O.D. J.

The Src family of tyrosine kinases is reported to be activated during a number of biological phenomena including monocyte adherence to endothelial cells (11Chisholm L.J. Dovgan P.S. Agrawal D.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27832-27837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In our studies, sE-selectin up-regulated the phosphorylation of Src family kinases (Src, Hck, and Lyn) in a time-dependent manner. The pretreatment of monocytes with PP2 for 30 min prior to sE-selectin stimulation partially inhibited Src phosphorylation, whereas Hck and Lyn phosphorylation was markedly inhibited. These results indicate that the Src family kinases may be an important mediator in sE-selectin-mediated signaling in monocytes. We next studied the role of PP2 on the total cellular phosphotyrosine pattern. The pretreatment of monocytes with PP2 prior to stimulation with sE-selectin showed the partial inhibition of a 60-kDa band. However, other Src family kinases (50–60 kDa) were substantially inhibited, thus corroborating our other findings that PP2 has a partial effect on sE-selectin-mediated Src phosphorylation, whereas it markedly inhibited Hck and Lyn kinases. In addition to the Src family kinases, PP2 also showed substantial inhibition of the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the MAPK region (35–45 kDa). MAPK is a key signaling central point at which a number of pathways converge (34Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). MAPK is involved in a number of basic physiological phenomena, including cell migration, cell cycle, and apoptosis, in addition to playing an important role in the signaling of a number of important genes such as chemokines (35Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and adhesion molecules (36Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 37Huttunen P. Hyypia T. Vihinen P. Nissinen L. Heino J. Virology. 1998; 250: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We next determined whether sE-selectin-mediated signaling involves the activation of MAPK. sE-selectin-stimulated monocytes showed the time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. ERK1/2 activation was observed as early as 30 s and persisted until 30 min. However, p38 activation was detectable from 5 min onwards. To test the hypothesis that the signal from Src might be going through MAPK, we pretreated monocytes with the Src inhibitor PP2 and then studied the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38. Pretreatment with the Src inhibitor (PP2) showed 89 and 83% inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38, respectively, at 30 min after sE-selectin stimulation. These results suggest that MAPKs (ERK1/2 and p38) are activated in monocytes by sE-selectin through the Src kinase pathway. Schmid-Alliana et al. (38Schmid-Alliana A. Menou L. Manie S.

A similar signaling cascade involving Src, Ras, and MAPK was reported by Jalaliet al. (35Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) in vascular endothelial cells stimulated with shear stress. Raf kinase is one of the best characterized MEKKs (16Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). Raf kinase is activated by binding to Ras-GTP, which then phosphorylates MEK. Ras kinase has been shown to be activated by Src kinase (12Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To test whether Ras and Raf kinases are also activated during the sE-selectin activation of monocytes, we immunoprecipitated Ras with the Raf-1-Ras binding domain linked to agarose beads and then probed with mouse monoclonal anti-Ras antibody. sE-selectin stimulation showed a time-dependent activation of Ras, thereby suggesting a possible link between Src and MAPK in sE-selectin signaling through Ras-Raf kinase. We next determined whether this Src-MAPK signaling cascade has functional relevance and whether it is essential for sE-selectin-mediated monocyte chemotaxis. PB monocytes were pretreated with the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 at a concentration of 1 μm for 30 min at 37 °C before performing chemotaxis in response to sE-selectin. PP2 completely blocked sE-selectin-mediated chemotaxis. These data suggest that sE-selectin uses the Src pathway to mediate monocyte chemotaxis. In summary, we have demonstrated a novel function for sE-selectin as a monocyte chemotactic agent. sE-selectin accounted for a significant proportion of the monocyte chemotactic activity in the RA synovial fluid. We have further shown that sE-selectin uses the Src-Ras-MAPK signaling pathway to mediate its biological function. Thus, sE-selectin may be a potent recruiter of monocytes in the RA joint and may contribute to RA pathogenesis through the Src-Ras-MAPK signaling pathway.

We used an isolated muscle preparation incubated with high levels of glucose and insulin to further evaluate how glucose-induced insulin resistance (GIIR) is mediated. Incubation with 2 milliunits/ml insulin and 36 mm glucose for 5 h resulted in an ∼50% decrease in insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport. The decrease in insulin responsiveness of glucose transport induced by glucose was not due to impaired insulin signaling, as insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and protein kinase B phosphorylation were not reduced. It has been hypothesized that entry of glucose into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway with accumulation of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines (UDP-HexNAcs) mediates GIIR. However, inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme GFAT (glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase) did not protect against GIIR despite a marked reduction of UDP-HexNAcs. The mRNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide both completely protected against GIIR despite the massive increases in UDP-HexNAcs and glycogen that resulted from increased glucose entry. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase also protected against GIIR. These results provide evidence that GIIR can occur in muscle without increased accumulation of hexosamine pathway end products, that neither high glycogen concentration nor impaired insulin signaling is responsible for GIIR, and that synthesis of a protein with a short half-life mediates GIIR. They also suggest that dephosphorylation of a transcription factor may be involved in the induction of GIIR.

There are currently three disparate hypotheses regarding the mechanism responsible for glucose-induced insulin resistance of glucose transport. One is that accumulation of large amounts of glycogen, as a result of glucose flooding into the cell, causes insulin resistance (7Fell R.D. Terblanche S.E. Ivy J.L. Young J.C. Holloszy J.O. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 52: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,11Jensen J. Aslesen R. Ivy J.L. Brors O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E649-E655PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kawanaka K. Han D.-H.

A second hypothesis is that glucose toxicity is mediated by activation of protein kinase C (5Laybutt D.R. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Saha A.K. Ruderman N.B. Biden T.J. Kraegen E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1070-E1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pillay T.S. Xiao S. Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,22Filippis A. Clark S.

The third is that glucose-induced insulin resistance is due to an increased flux of glucose into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway with accumulation of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines (UDP-HexNAcs) (13Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol.

In addition to disagreement regarding the mechanism, there is controversy regarding whether rapid entry of glucose into the cell, mediated by high concentrations of both glucose and insulin (30Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or just exposure to a high concentration of glucose (8Richter E.A. Hansen B.F. Hansen S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Hansen B.F. Hansen S.A. Ploug T. Bak J.F. Richter E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E440-E446PubMed Google Scholar), is responsible for glucose-induced insulin resistance. In this study we used an in vitro skeletal muscle preparation to evaluate these hypotheses and to further examine the mechanism responsible for glucose-induced insulin resistance. Our results do not support any of the current hypotheses regarding the etiology of glucose toxicity. They show that the decrease in insulin responsiveness of glucose transport results from a rapid influx of glucose and suggest that increased expression of a protein with a short half-life mediates the insulin resistance. The antiphospho-protein kinase B (PKB)1 Ser473 and Thr308 polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. [14C]Mannitol, 3-O-[3H]methyl-d-glucose, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 2-Deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Polyclonal antibody F349 against GLUT4 protein was a gift from Dr. Mike Mueckler of Washington University School of Medicine. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. This research was approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University. Male Wistar rats weighing 100–140 g were obtained from Charles River and fed Purina chow and water until the evening before an experiment, when food was removed at ∼6:00 p.m. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital, 5 mg/100 g of body weight, and a polyethylene catheter was placed in an external jugular vein. The catheter was tunneled under the skin, exteriorized between the shoulder blades, sutured in place, and filled with saline. The surgical incision was closed, and the externalized catheter was covered with a jacket (Harvard Apparatus). After the rats had recovered from surgery for 3 days, the catheters were threaded through a flexible spring tether attached to a swiveling infusion device (Harvard Apparatus) that allowed the animals to move freely during the infusion. The rats were infused with either 50% glucose at an infusion rate of 50 mg glucose/kg of body weight/min or with 0.9% saline for 24 h. At the end of the infusion period, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, 5 mg/100 g of body weight. Blood samples were obtained for measurement of glucose and insulin (31Morgan D.R. Lazarow A. Diabetes. 1963; 12: 115-126Crossref Google Scholar). The epitrochlearis muscles were dissected out and incubated for 60 min with 60 microunits/ml or 2 milliunits/ml insulin prior to measurement of glucose transport activity. After removal of the epitrochlearis muscles, insulin was infused at a rate of 7.2 milliunits/min/100 g of body weight for 30 min to induce a maximal insulin stimulus; glucose was also infused to prevent hypoglycemia. After 30 min of insulin infusion, the gastrocnemius/plantaris muscle group was excised for determination of GLUT4 in the sarcolemma. Epitrochlearis muscles were placed in 2 ml of oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (KHB) with or without 2 milliunits/ml insulin, 0.1% radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin, various concentrations of glucose, and sufficient mannitol so that the concentration of glucose plus mannitol was 40 mm. Routinely, 36 mm glucose was used to induce muscle insulin resistance, and 5 mm glucose was used as the control. The other additions to the incubation medium are described for each experiment under “Results” and/or the figure legends. The muscles were incubated with shaking at 35 °C, and the flasks were gassed continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2. During 5-h long incubations, the muscles were placed in fresh incubation medium after 2.5 h. After the incubations some muscles were blotted and used for measurement of metabolites, while others were used for measurement of glucose transport activity. After the initial incubation period, the muscles were quickly rinsed twice in KHB and transferred to flasks containing 2 ml of KHB with 40 mmmannitol, with the same concentration of insulin as in the initial incubation, and incubated with shaking at 30 °C to remove glucose. This procedure was repeated once. Glucose transport activity was then measured as described previously (32Young D.A. Uhl J.J. Cartee G.D. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 16049-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in GLUT4 protein in the plasma membrane in response to a maximally effective insulin stimulus was compared in muscles of the rats infused for 24 h with 50% glucose or 0.9% saline. The muscles were processed and homogenized as described previously (34Ren J.-M. Semenkovich C.F. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14396-14401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 48,000 × g, and the pellet was used to prepare a plasma membrane fraction as described by Hirshman et al.

GLUT4 immunoreactivity in the whole homogenate and the plasma membrane fraction were determined by Western blot analysis as previously described (36Hansen P.A. Han D.-H. Nolte L.A. Chen M. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1704-R1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the COOH terminus of GLUT4 (F349). Muscle extracts were prepared as described previously (18Kawanaka K. Han D.-H. Nolte L.A. Hansen P.A. Nakatani A. Holloszy J.O. Am. J.

Glycogen was measured on perchloric acid homogenates of muscle using the amyloglucosidase method (38Passoneau J.V. Lauderdale V.R. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 60: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Muscle glucose 6-phosphate,2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate and ATP concentrations were measured fluorometrically (39Lowry O.H. Passoneau J.V. A Flexible System of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1972: 123-124Google Scholar) on neutralized perchloric acid extracts (33Ren J.-M. Marshall B.A. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Johnson D.W. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16113-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle samples were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.5 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). Homogenates were incubated with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 60 min and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. For analysis of PI 3-kinase activity associated with phosphorylated tyrosine, aliquots of supernatant containing 1 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated overnight with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C in the presence of 40 μl of monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed, suspended in assay medium, and analyzed for PI 3-kinase activity as described by Goodyear et al.(40Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Balon T.W. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E987-E995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For quantification of phosphorylated PKB, aliquots of the 200,000 × g supernatant were treated with 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. Samples (80 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% resolving gel) and were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 10 (TBST), pH 7.5, overnight. The membranes were rinsed in TBST and incubated with either antiphospho-PKB Ser473antibody or antiphospho-PKB Thr308 antibody for 4 h. The membranes were rinsed in TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min. Antibody-bound protein was visualized by ECL. The intensity of the bands corresponding to phosphorylated PKB was assessed by densitometry. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. The significance of differences between two groups was assessed using Student's unpaired t test. For multiple comparisons, the significance was evaluated by analysis of variance. A Newman-Keul's post hoc test was used to locate significant mean differences. In our initial experiment, we gave rats glucose by intravenous infusion for 24 h. The glucose infusion resulted in large increases in plasma glucose and insulin, to levels in the range sometimes found in untreated patients with type 2 diabetes (Table I). Muscle glycogen was also increased. Fig. 1 shows insulin-stimulated 2DG transport rates in epitrochlearis muscles studied in vitro after the 24-h infusion period. The increase in 2DG transport above basal induced by either 60 microunits/ml or 2 milliunits/ml of insulin was ∼60% smaller in muscles from the glucose-infused as compared with the saline-infused animals.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it seems clear that the insulin-induced increase in GLUT4 in the plasma membrane fraction was ∼50% smaller in the glucose-infused group (Fig.2). To examine the mechanisms by which rapid glucose entry into muscle cells causes a decrease in insulin responsiveness, we developed an in vitromodel in which this phenomenon can be studied under controlled conditions in a reasonable time period. Fig.3 shows the effect of incubating rat epitrochlearis muscles for 5 h with 2 milliunits/ml insulin and various concentrations of glucose. Insulin responsiveness decreased with increasing glucose concentration. Incubation of epitrochlearis muscles with 36 mm glucose and insulin for 5 h resulted in as great a decrease in insulin responsiveness as that induced by the 24-h glucose infusion used in our initial experiment. This experimental protocol, i.e. incubation of muscles for 5 h with 36 mm glucose and 2 milliunits of insulin, was therefore routinely used to induce insulin resistance in subsequent experiments. Epitrochlearis muscles tolerated the 5 h of in vitroincubation well. This was evidenced by maintenance of a normal ATP concentration in muscles, rapid glycogen synthesis (see below), and normal extracellular space. ATP concentration was the same in muscles incubated for 5 h with 5 mm (4.4 ± 0.2 μmol/g) or 36 mm glucose (4.6 ± 0.2 μmol/g) compared with 4.6 ± 0.3 μmol/g for muscles clamp-frozen in situ(values are means ± S.E. for 6 muscles/group). Insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity was also normal after 5 h, as evidenced by the finding that 3MG transport rate was not significantly different after 5 h, as compared with 1 h of incubation with 5 mm glucose plus 2 milliunits of insulin (TableII).Table IIComparison of 3MG transport rates and glycogen concentrations in muscles incubated for 1 or 5 hGlucoseInsulin1-h incubation5-h incubation3-Methylglucose transportmm2 milliunits/mlμmol/ml/10 min5−0.18 ± 0.02 (8)0.20 ± 0.05 (6)36−0.26 ± 0.06 (6)0.28 ± 0.02 (8)5+1.00 ± 0.09 (15)1.19 ± 0.06 (13)36+0.98 ± 0.05 (5)0.60 ± 0.04 (20) 2-ap < 0.01, 36versus 5 mm glucose.Glycogenμmol/g muscle5+11.2 ± 1.9 (6)22.2 ± 1.1 (10)36+20.3 ± 1.6 (6)42.1 ± 3.1 (9)2-ap < 0.01, 36versus 5 mm glucose.Rat epitrochlearis muscles were incubated for 1 or 5 h in oxygenated KHB containing either 5 or 36 mm glucose.

Open table in a new tab Rat epitrochlearis muscles were incubated for 1 or 5 h in oxygenated KHB containing either 5 or 36 mm glucose. Muscles were then washed in glucose-free medium for two 10-min periods to remove glucose from the extracellular space followed by measurement of glucose transport activity using 3MG, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Muscles were incubated with 2 milliunits/ml insulin throughout the experiment when insulin-stimulated glucose transport was measured. Results are expressed as micromoles of 3MG taken up per milliliter of intracellular water in 10 min. Values are the means ± S.E. The number of muscles per group is given in parentheses. It has been reported that exposure of muscles to a high concentration of glucose in the absence of insulin causes insulin resistance (8Richter E.A. Hansen B.F. Hansen S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of exposure of muscles to 36 mm glucose in the absence of insulin. Muscles were incubated for 5 h without insulin and then incubated with 2 milliunits/ml insulin for the 20-min period during which glucose was washed out of the extracellular space and during the measurement of 3MG transport. As shown in Fig. 4, muscles incubated with 36 mm glucose for 5 h without insulin showed no decrease in insulin responsiveness, whereas muscles that underwent the same procedure in the presence of insulin became markedly insulin-resistant. Thus, the insulin resistance is due to rapid entry of large amounts of glucose into muscle rather than to exposure to either a high glucose or a high insulin concentration. That a high insulin concentration per se is not responsible for the insulin resistance is evidenced by the finding that muscles exposed to 5 mm glucose and 2 milliunits/ml insulin for 5 h did not become insulin-resistant. Studies by Marshall and co-workers (13Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10155-10161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on fat cells have led to the concept that glucose toxicity-induced insulin resistance is due to the accumulation of hexosamine pathway end products. One finding that led to this conclusion was that inhibition of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, with the glutamine analog 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON), protected fat cells against glucose-induced insulin resistance (13Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A treatment of muscles with DON was effective in inhibiting GFAT, as evidenced by a large decrease in the concentration of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines. However, despite the marked decrease in UDP-HexNAcs, DON had no protective effect against the development of glucose-induced insulin resistance (Fig. 5 B). In their experiments on primary cultures of adipocytes, Marshall et al. (14Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10155-10161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that the inhibitors of mRNA synthesis, actinomycin D and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-D ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), prevented glucose-induced insulin resistance. They attributed this protective effect to inhibition of the synthesis of a short-lived protein, which they thought was probably GFAT. We found that both actinomycin D (Fig.5 B) and DRB (data not shown) also completely prevent the insulin resistance induced by high glucose and insulin in skeletal muscle. Cycloheximide, at a concentration that inhibits protein synthesis in our muscle preparation (32Young D.A. Uhl J.J. Cartee G.D. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16049-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has a similar protective effect (Fig. 5 B). None of these inhibitors had any effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in control muscles incubated with 5 mm glucose (Fig. 5 B). They also had no effect on basal transport, and in the case of cycloheximide, basal 3MG transport averaged 0.203 ± 0.05 μmol·ml−1·10 min−1 in muscles incubated for 5 h with 5 mm glucose and 0.217 ± 0.02 μmol·ml−1·10 min−1 for muscles incubated for 5 h with glucose and 75 μm cycloheximide (means ± S.E. for 6 muscles/group). The prevention of glucose-induced insulin resistance by inhibition of protein synthesis is clearly not mediated by a decrease in GFAT in muscle; this is evident from the finding that UDP-HexNAc concentrations were markedly higher in the muscles treated with cycloheximide or actinomycin D (Fig. 5 A). This greater increase in UDP-HexNAcs is likely due to more glucose being transported into the muscle cells and ent"

The visual pigments in photoreceptors are bound to 11-cis-retinal and are responsible for the initiation of visual excitation. Retinochrome-like opsins in the RPE are bound to all-trans-retinal and play an important role in chromophore metabolism. The retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) of the RPE and Müller cells is an abundant opsin that generates 11-cis-retinal by stereospecific photoisomerization of its bound all-trans-retinal chromophore. We have analyzed a 32-kDa protein (p32) that co-purifies with bovine RGR from RPE microsomes. The co-purified p32 was identified by mass spectrometric analysis as 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (cRDH), and enzymatic assays have confirmed the isolation of an active cRDH. The co-purified cRDH showed marked substrate preference to 11-cis-retinal and preferred NADH rather than NADPH as the cofactor in reduction reactions. cRDH did not react with endogenous all-trans-retinal bound to RGR but reacted specifically with 11-cis-retinal that was generated by photoisomerization after irradiation of RGR. The reduction of 11-cis-retinal to 11-cis-retinol by cRDH enhanced the net photoisomerization of all-trans-retinal bound to RGR. These results indicate that cRDH is involved in the processing of 11-cis-retinal after irradiation of RGR opsin and suggest that cRDH has a novel role in the visual cycle.

Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 2Stryer L. Harvey Lect. 1991–1992; 87: 129-143PubMed Google Scholar). It has long been known that formation of 11-cis-retinal for regeneration of rhodopsin is dependent on retinoid metabolic reactions in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE),1 where the majority of enzymes of the visual cycle are located (reviewed in Ref. 3Saari J.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar). In the current model of the visual cycle, all-trans-retinal from bleached rhodopsin is reduced to all-trans-retinol by an all-trans-retinol-specific dehydrogenase (tRDH) located in photoreceptor outer segments (4Wald G. Hubbard R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1949; 32: 367-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Saari J.C. Garwin G.G. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The all-trans-retinol is then delivered to the RPE, where it is converted by the lecithin:retinol acyltransferase to all-trans-retinyl ester (7Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8636-8640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ruiz A. Winston A. Lim Y.H. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Bok D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3834-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A key step in the visual cycle is performed by an isomerohydrolase that catalyzes the formation of 11-cis-retinol from all-trans-retinyl ester (9Rando R.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 133-146PubMed Google Scholar, 10Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the isomerization of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol is achieved via an intermediate with an anhydro-like carbocation structure (11McBee J.K. Kuksa V. Alvarez R. de Lera A.R. Prezhdo O. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11370-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An 11-cis-retinol-specific dehydrogenase (cRDH) is able to oxidize 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal (12Lion F. Rotmans J.P. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Zimmerman W.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1976; 23: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which is transferred to the outer segments of photoreceptors for recombination with opsin to form rhodopsin. Under light-adapted conditions, the rate of synthesis of 11-cis-retinal must be sufficient for regeneration of steady-state levels of visual pigments (15Alpern M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1971; 217: 447-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 16Alpern M. Masseidvaag F. Ohba N. Vision Res. 1971; 11: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Besides isomerohydrolase, another type of isomerase in the RPE may include the retinochrome-like visual pigment homologues peropsin or the RPE retinal G protein-coupled receptor (RGR) opsin (17Sun H. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9893-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Jiang M. Pandey S. Fong H.K.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 3669-3678PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the visual pigments, RGR is bound in the dark to endogenous all-trans-retinal and is localized to intracellular membranes in RPE and Müller cells (19Pandey S. Blanks J.C. Spee C. Jiang M. Fong H.K.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Hao W. Fong H.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6085-6090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Upon illumination, all-trans-retinal bound to RGR is photoisomerized stereospecifically to the 11-cis isomer (20Hao W. Fong H.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6085-6090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that RGR may function to generate 11-cis-retinal in vivo and participate in a light-dependent photic visual cycle. A proposed mechanism of RGR function is that 11-cis-retinal dissociates from irradiated RGR and directly enters the pathway for regeneration of rhodopsin under photic conditions. A central hypothesis of the photoisomerase model is that exchange of the chromophore bound to RGR occurs and involves distinct geometrical isomers. Retinal must uncouple and bind anew to RGR through a stereospecific cycle that is driven by light energy. The observation that microsomal RGR can be labeled with 3H-labeled all-trans-retinal (21Shen D. Jiang M. Hao W. Tao L. Salazar M. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13117-13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and that ∼50‥ of RGR isolated from RPE is in the form of the apoprotein (22Hao W. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggests that the binding of retinal is reversible and that the process of binding and dissociation of the chromophore occursin vivo. One of the factors that may control Schiff base hydrolysis and dissociation of 11-cis-retinal from RGR in vivois specific protein interactions. We have observed that when RGR is isolated in digitonin solution from bovine RPE microsomes by immunoaffinity chromatography, it co-purifies consistently with a 32–34-kDa protein (p32) (22Hao W. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is possible that the co-purified protein forms a physical complex or associates functionally with RGR. Hence, the identification of the co-purified p32 protein may provide important insights into the mechanism of RGR function. In this paper, we report the analysis and characterization of co-purified p32, which has been identified as 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase of the RPE. We demonstrate enzymatic activity of the co-purified cRDH and discuss its potential role in RGR function. Digitonin was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Hydroxylamine and all-trans-retinal were purchased from Sigma. 11-cis-Retinal was provided by Dr. Rosalie Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). An 11-cis-retinol standard was prepared by reduction of 11-cis-retinal in the presence of NaBH4 and was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously (23Landers G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Organic solvents were HPLC grade. Dichloromethane and hexane were obtained from Fisher. Ether and methanol were from J. T. Baker Inc. Dioxane was from Burdick & Jackson. All isolation procedures were performed under dim red light. RPE cells were isolated from fresh bovine eyes, as described previously (22Hao W. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cells were washed in ice-cold 0.25m sucrose, 30 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer. After a low speed centrifugation at 300 × g, the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. RPE microsomes in the supernatant were sedimented by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until later use. For isolation of RGR, the microsomal membranes were extracted three times for 1 h at 4 °C with 1.2‥ digitonin solution containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The extracts were centrifuged each time at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pooled supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Affi-Gel 10 resin (Bio-Rad) conjugated to monoclonal antibody 2F4, which is directed to the carboxyl terminus of bovine RGR (21Shen D. Jiang M. Hao W. Tao L. Salazar M. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13117-13125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The resin was transferred to a column and washed with 25 bed volumes of wash buffer (0.1‥ digitonin in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). RGR was eluted from the column with 10 times 0.5 bed volumes of wash buffer containing 50 μm bovine RGR carboxyl-terminal peptide (CLSPQRREHSREQ). The eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated ∼4-fold using a Centricon 3 concentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. The amount of isolated protein was determined with a densitometer by measurement of relative band intensity and comparison with known amounts of bovine serum albumin protein standard. The amount of RGR used in some experiments was based on a typical yield of ∼64 ng/eye isolated from 15–80 eyes. In a modification of the isolation procedure, 20‥ glycerol was included in all buffers for the isolation of RGR from RPE microsomes, as indicated in Fig. 5. Immunoaffinity-purified RGR was electrophoresed in a 15‥ SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. A 32-kDa protein (p32) was found to co-purify consistently with RGR. The p32 protein band was excised from the gel and used for a trypsin in-gel digestion (24Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). A portion of the digested peptide mixture was analyzed using a custom-built capillary liquid chromatography system (25Davis M.T. Stahl D.C. Hefta S.A. Lee T.D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 76: 4549-4556Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) interfaced directly to a Thermo-Finnigan (San Jose, CA) LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer, as described previously (26Davis M.T. Lee T.D. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Full mass range spectra, high resolution zoom scan spectra, and fragment ion (MS/MS) spectra were collected using the automated, data-dependent acquisition functions of the LCQ data system. The protein identification was made by correlating the collected MS/MS spectra to the OWL protein sequence data base using the Sequest data base search program (27Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar). The reduction activity of cRDH was measured as described previously (12Lion F. Rotmans J.P. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Suzuki Y. Ishiguro S. Tamai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The thiobarbituric acid method was used to monitor the colored derivative formed by retinal and thiobarbituric acid (29Futterman S. Saslaw L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1652-1657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoaffinity-purified RGR or RPE microsomal proteins were used as the source of cRDH enzyme. For the reduction of exogenous substrate, the substrate solution contained 10 nmol of exogenous retinal isomer, 12‥ acetone, 1.2‥ Tween 80, 1 mm NADH or NADPH, and 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Controls were performed by omitting the NADH or NADPH cofactor or by addition of a heat-inactivated protein sample. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 μl of substrate solution to 50 μl of protein solution. After incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of ethanol. Subsequently, 0.2 ml of thiourea and 0.2 ml of thiobarbituric acid reagent were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The solutions were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm on a tabletop centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5415C, Germany) for 1 min. 50 μl of distilled water was added to each supernatant to prevent precipitation. Color development was measured at 530 nm. Ethanol was used as a reagent blank for the color development. The concentration of exogenous retinal isomer was determined by absorbance measurements with a Hitachi U-3000 scanning spectrophotometer. NADH and NADPH were prepared immediately before use in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The retinal chromophore of RGR was extracted under dim red light and analyzed by the method of hydroxylamine derivatization, as described by Groenendijk et al. (30Groenendijk G.W.T. De Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Groenendijk G.W.T. De Grip W.J. Daemen F.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In a typical extraction procedure, 100–300 μl of purified RGR were mixed with 0.1 volume of 2 m hydroxylamine, pH 6.5, and then 300 μl of methanol and 300 μl of dichloromethane. The sample volume was brought to 900 μl by the addition of 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm EDTA. The extraction with dichloromethane (aqueous buffer/methanol/dichloromethane, 1:1:1 by volume) was performed by vortexing for 30 s. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min, the lower organic phase was removed, and the upper phase was extracted twice more with 300 μl of dichloromethane. The organic layers were pooled and dried under a nitrogen stream. The extracted retinaloximes were then solubilized in 600 μl of hexane, filtered through glass wool, and dried again under nitrogen. The residue was either stored in darkness at −80 °C or analyzed immediately by HPLC. The isomers of retinaloximes were analyzed by HPLC, as described previously (20Hao W. Fong H.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6085-6090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The extracted retinaloximes were dissolved in hexane and applied to a LiChrosorb RT Si60 silica column (4 × 250 mm, 5 μm) (Merck). The HPLC system was equipped with a Beckman model 126 solvent module and model 166 UV-visible detector (Beckman Instruments). The 20-μl samples were injected and the components were resolved in a running solvent consisting of hexane supplemented with 8‥ diethyl ether and 0.33‥ ethanol with flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC column was calibrated using all-trans- and 11-cis-retinaloxime standards. Identification of the retinaloxime isomers was based on the retention times of the known retinaloxime products. Absorbance was measured at 360 nm, and the absorbance peaks were analyzed with the Gold Nouveau software (Beckman Instruments). The proportion of each isomer in the loading sample was determined from the total peak areas of both its syn- and anti-retinaloxime and was based on the following extinction coefficients (ε360, in hexane): all-trans syn = 54,900, all-trans anti = 51,600, 11-cis syn = 35,000, 11-cisanti = 29,600, 13-cis syn = 49,000, and 13-cis anti = 52,100 (31Groenendijk G.W.T.

Vision Res. 1986; 26: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 11-cis-Retinol was co-extracted with retinaloximes and analyzed by HPLC, as described above. In some experiments, the retinoids were separated on a Resolve silica column (3.9 × 150 mm, 5 μm) (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) using a Waters 2690 HPLC module. The samples were resolved in a running solvent consisting of hexane supplemented with 8‥ diethyl ether and 0.33‥ ethanol. Retinaloximes and 11-cis-retinol were measured simultaneously with a Waters 2487 dual wavelength absorbance detector at 360 and 320 nm, respectively; sensitivity was ∼6-fold higher than that of our Beckman system. The absorbance peaks were analyzed with the Millennium 32 Chromatography Manager software, version 3.20 (Waters Corp.). Identification of 11-cis-retinol was based on the retention time of a purified standard. The 11-cis-retinol standard (λmax = 318 nm) was prepared from known 11-cis-retinal, as described previously (23Landers G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The HPLC system was calibrated with 8.8–0.88 pmol of 11-cis-retinol and 9.1–0.91 pmol ofsyn-all-trans-retinaloxime standards. RGR was irradiated with 470-nm monochromatic light using an Oriel light source (Oriel Corp., Stratford, CT) equipped with a 150-W xenon arc lamp. Monochromatic light beams at 470 nm were formed by passing the light through a 470-nm interference filter (Oriel #53845) and 455-nm long pass filter (Oriel #51284). Nonirradiated control samples were held under dim red light, but otherwise were treated identically. The samples contained immunoaffinity-purified RGR in 0.1‥ digitonin, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, and 20‥ glycerol and were incubated in the presence of 3 mm NADH cofactor or in buffer only as indicated under “Results.” NADH was freshly prepared in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The final reaction volume (100 μl) was adjusted by the addition of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Incubations were performed for the desired time at 37 °C in a quartz cuvette positioned 60 cm from the light source. After delivery of the intended amount of light, the mixture was taken out of the water bath, and 0.2m hydroxylamine was added to stop the reaction. The retinal chromophore was extracted by hydroxylamine derivatization and analyzed by HPLC, as described previously. The incubation of RGR at 37 °C rather than room temperature did not affect the distribution of retinal isomers from irradiated RGR. RPE microsomal membrane proteins were extracted in 1.2‥ digitonin solution at pH 6.5, and solubilized RGR was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography under dim red light. Under these conditions, a 32-kDa protein (p32) was found to co-purify reproducibly with RGR (Fig. 1). The p32 protein band was readily detectable in SDS-polyacrylamide gels by staining with Coomassie Blue. It was not recognized on Western blots by the antibody that was coupled to the immunoaffinity resin, even when the immunoblots were overdeveloped (results not shown). The relative amount of p32 that was co-purified with RGR was significantly increased by the inclusion of glycerol in the isolation procedure (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). When the antibody binding sites of the immunoaffinity column were blocked by prewashing with excess peptide, neither RGR nor p32 was eluted from the column (Fig. 1 B), and p32 did not appear isolatable as a nonspecifically adsorbed protein. The p32 band was excised from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by liquid chromatography MS/MS. When the resulting MS/MS spectra were correlated to the data base of known protein sequences, a number of them gave positive matches to 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase, a known critical enzyme of the visual cycle (Fig.2).Figure 2Mass spectrometric identification of p32. The co-purified p32 was excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel shown in Fig. 1 A, lane 2. The protein band was subjected to trypsin in-gel digestion, and the peptide fragments were analyzed by liquid chromatography MS/MS. The MS/MS data were correlated to the data base of known protein sequences using Sequest.A, peptides of p32 that matched the sequence of cRDH, 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (Accession no.

Exogenous 11-cis-retinal was used as the substrate. The reduction of 11-cis-retinal was followed by its disappearance and was dependent on the amount of immunoaffinity-purified RGR added to the reaction (Fig.3). The activity required the NADH cofactor. The reduction activity of cRDH was found to accompany each step in the purification of RGR and was abolished if RGR was heat-inactivated (results not shown). These observations indicated that cRDH is co-purified with RGR in a detergent solution and remains an active enzyme. Important features that distinguish cRDH from its counterpart, the tRDH in photoreceptor cells, are substrate stereospecificity and cofactor dependence of the enzyme. These properties of the dehydrogenase were tested in preparations of RGR to further characterize the co-purified cRDH. The cRDH in immunoaffinity-purified RGR reacted with exogenous 11-cis-retinal but not with all-trans-retinal (Fig. 4 A). Co-purified cRDH preferred NADH rather than NADPH as the cofactor in the reduction reaction (Fig. 4, A and B). For comparison, the activity of cRDH in RPE microsomal membranes was also assayed. As expected, microsomal cRDH was active in the reduction of 11-cis-retinal, and there was only little activity with all-trans-retinal as the substrate (Fig. 4, C andD). The enzyme in the microsomal membranes displayed substrate-specific activity with either cofactor, NADH or NADPH. These observed properties of microsomal cRDH were consistent with the results of previous studies (12Lion F. Rotmans J.P. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Zimmerman W.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1976; 23: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since cRDH reacts specifically with 11-cis-retinal, the role of co-purified cRDH in RGR function may be to reduce and remove bound 11-cis-retinal from RGR after stereospecific photoisomerization of its all-trans-retinal chromophore. In previous experiments, cRDH reduction activity was not observed because the required cofactor was not added (20Hao W. Fong H.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6085-6090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RGR was kept in the dark or irradiated with blue light. Subsequently, each sample was incubated in the dark in the presence or absence of NADH. The predominant chromophore extracted from nonirradiated RGR was all-trans-retinal, as expected (Fig.5 A), and incubation with NADH had no effect on the all-trans chromophore in the dark (Fig.5 B). The irradiation of RGR and subsequent incubation in the dark without NADH resulted in stereospecific isomerization of ∼55‥ of the bound all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 5 C); these results were in agreement with previous studies (20Hao W. Fong H.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6085-6090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). When RGR was irradiated and then incubated in the dark in the presence of NADH, there was a significant decrease in total retinal. The decrease in total retinal was brought about by the selective loss of 11-cis-retinal with little effect on the amount of the all-trans isomer (Fig. 5 D). Changes in the chromophore of RGR were most prominent when NADH was present during irradiation of RGR. Under conditions in which the cofactor is included and cRDH is active, irradiation of RGR resulted in significant loss of both 11-cis- and all-trans retinal (Fig.6). To confirm that 11-cis-retinal was reduced by the co-purified cRDH with retention of the expected isomeric configuration, we demonstrated the production of 11-cis-retinol upon irradiation of RGR in the presence of NADH. The retinoid extracts from irradiated preparations of RGR were analyzed after exposure to light for different lengths of time. Absorbance was measured at 320 nm to optimize the detection of 11-cis-retinol. The irradiation of RGR in the presence of NADH resulted in significant decline of all-trans-retinal and a concomitant time-dependent increase in 11-cis-retinol (Fig.7). The amount of 11-cis-retinol formed corresponded closely to the amount of all-trans-retinal lost at 5 min; however, the production of 11-cis-retinol lagged the more rapid decline in all-trans-retinal in the first 1–2 min of incubation. Since cRDH uses the 11-cis isomer specifically, we conclude that the increase in 11-cis-retinol is due to the reaction of cRDH on free or bound 11-cis-retinal, the photoisomerization product of irradiated RGR. The RGR opsin is a major all-trans-retinal-binding protein in the RPE. Physiological evidence that supports the processing of precursor all-trans-retinol and its incorporation into the chromophore of RGR in the dark has been obtained recently (33Yang, M., Wang, X.-G., Stout, J. T., Chen, P., Hjelmeland, L. M., Appukuttan, B., Fong, H. K. W., Mol. Vis., 6, 2000, 237, 242, (, http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v6/a32, ).Google Scholar). Illumination of RGR results in stereospecific conversion of the bound all-trans-retinal to 11-cis-retinal. Since retinoid-binding proteins would be required to transfer the chromophore to or from RGR, the mechanism by which RGR functions may depend on specific protein interactions. In this paper, we demonstrate functional interaction in vitro between the RGR opsin and cRDH. Indeed, the isolation of highly purified RGR from bovine RPE results in consistent co-purification of cRDH in a manner that suggests that cRDH binds to RGR in a protein complex. In the presence of glycerol, co-purification of cRDH was optimal and Coomassie Blue staining of cRDH was typically as intense and specific as that of RGR in polyacrylamide gels. A general effect of glycerol is to stabilize the protein complex and reduce nonspecific binding to the affinity resin (34Formosa T. Barry J. Alberts B.M. Greenblatt J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 24-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The co-purified enzyme was active and held several properties similar to those of microsomal cRDH (12Lion F. Rotmans J.P. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Zimmerman W.F. Exp.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3106-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), isolated cRDH (28Suzuki Y. Ishiguro S. Tamai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), or recombinant cRDH (35Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 36Driessen C.A.G.G. Janssen B.P.M. Winkens H.J. van Vugt A.H.M. de Leeuw T.L.M. Janssen J.J.M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1988-1996PubMed Google Scholar). It was efficient in the reduction of exogenous 11-cis-retinal and had little reactivity with the all-trans isomer. NADH was preferred over NADPH as a cofactor in the reduction reaction. In contrast, microsomal cRDH activity was observable with both NADH and NADPH (Fig. 4, Cand D). Despite the presence in the RPE of cRDH activity that uses NADPH (12Lion F. Rotmans J.P. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Jang G.-F. McBee J.K. Alekseev A.M. Haeseleer F. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28128-28138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), co-purification of the NADPH-dependent enzyme with RGR was not evident. Most noteworthy was the substrate stereospecificity of cRDH in reactions with the chromophore of RGR. The co-purified enzyme was inert to all-trans-retinal bound to RGR in the dark but active toward endogenous 11-cis-retinal that was generated by irradiation of RGR. The cRDH was remarkably stable during co-purification with RGR over a period of 28 h, and its activity did not require purification of the enzyme in the presence of NADH, as reported previously (28Suzuki Y. Ishiguro S. Tamai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The functional significance of RGR and cRDH interaction may lie in the mechanism of chromophore dissociation from RGR. Like squid rhodopsin and other invertebrate visual pigments (38Hubbard R. St. George R.C.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1958; 41: 501-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 39Hillman P. Hochstein S. Minke B. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 668-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the chromophore of RGR opsin does not readily dissociate after photoisomerization in vitro, and irradiation does not lead to bleaching of RGR, as determined by difference absorption spectra before and after light exposure (22Hao W. Fong H.K.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6251-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). If RGR operates in vivo as a stereospecific photoisomerase to directly generate the 11-cis chromophore in the visual cycle, then all-trans-retinal should be photoisomerized and 11-cis-retinal should be released from RGR catalytically. The previous experiments on irradiation of RGR were run without NADH and achieved at most ∼50‥ net conversion of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinal (20Hao W. Fong H.K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6085-6090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We now can demonstrate more complete photoisomerization of the bound all-trans-retinal to the 11-cis isomer. When RGR is irradiated in the presence of NADH, isomerization of the chromophore is coupled to efficient reduction by cRDH. These results strongly suggest that 11-cis-retinol is generated in a photic visual cycle. Possible steps in further processing of 11-cis-retinol include its conversion to 11-cis-retinyl esters or binding to cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. The results do not exclude an additional mechanism of dissociation and direct transfer of 11-cis-retinal from RGR to cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein or any effect of cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein on the interaction between RGR and cRDH. The functional coupling of RGR with cRDH extends the evidence that RGR and rhodopsin have evolved with distinct, yet parallel, features. The chromophores of RGR and rhodopsin are photoisomerized in opposite directions; hence, each is bound to 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal at a specific photochemical state of the opsin. After photoisomerization of the chromophore, 11-cis-retinal from RGR is reduced by cRDH, and all-trans-retinal from rhodopsin is reduced by tRDH to the respective alcohols. The cRDH and tRDH are highly homologous retinol dehydrogenases (6Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1988-1996PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction of all-trans-retinal participates in the inactivation of rhodopsin and is a rate-limiting step of the visual cycle at high light levels (5Saari J.C. Garwin G.G. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The tRDH is tightly associated with the rod outer segments (40Blaner W.S. Churchich J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Nicotra C. Livrea M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11836-11841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ishiguro S.

Asson-batres M.A. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13741-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, its orientation in the rod outer segment membrane and possible binding to rhodopsin are unknown. In comparison, there is evidence that the catalytic domain of cRDH in the RPE is situated toward the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (44Simon A. Romert A. Gustafson A. McCaffery J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This membrane topology of cRDH suggests that 11-cis-retinal from irradiated RGR is reduced by cRDH and presented at the lumenal surface of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum for transport or further processing of the alcohol. The physiological significance of the 11-cis-retinal reduction reaction involving cRDH and RGR needs to be corroborated byin vivo studies. Another reductase role for cRDH was first proposed by Lion et al. (12Lion F. Rotmans J.P. Daemen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Most models of the visual cycle since then have emphasized the oxidation reaction of cRDH instead, because no experiment to regenerate rhodopsin with 11-cis-retinol in excised mammalian retina has succeeded (45Bridges C.D.B. Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 24: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 46Yoshikami S. Noll G.N. Science. 1978; 200: 1393-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 47Perlman J.I. Nodes B.R. Pepperberg D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 885-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cone pigments in excised retina can be regenerated with 11-cis-retinol (48Jones G.J. Crouch R.K. Wiggert B. Cornwell M.C. Chader G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this case, the reduction of 11-cis-retinal from RGR to 11-cis-retinol might be sufficient for chromophore synthesis by the RPE in a cone visual cycle. Alternatively, the 11-cis-retinol from RGR may be converted to the retinyl ester for storage or usage as a requisite intermediate in the synthesis of 11-cis-retinal. Our results provide a new argument for a reductase role of cRDH in addition to its role in oxidation of 11-cis-retinol. The placement of RGR and cRDH in a common pathway may generate additional insights into the molecular defect in cases of fundus albipunctatus that involve mutations in the human cRDH gene (49Yamamoto H.

On the other hand, LDL receptor-independent pathways mediate about one-third of LDL removal in normal individuals and are responsible for most of the LDL removal in individuals homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia who lack functional LDL receptors (3Goldstein J.L.

The LDL receptor processes LDL via receptor-mediated endocytosis in which the LDL particle is delivered to lysosomes where the CE is hydrolyzed to free cholesterol for use by the cell. In addition to receptor-mediated endocytosis, LDL CE also can be taken up by cells via a selective uptake pathway in which lipoprotein CE is transferred into the cell membrane without the uptake and degradation of the LDL particle. Although the selective uptake pathway has been studied predominantly with HDL, numerous studies have shown the selective uptake of LDL CE in steroidogenic cells of rodents (4Azhar S. Cooper A.

Little is known about the mechanism of LDL CE selective uptake or the cell surface receptors responsible for this process. In the Y1-BS1 clone of murine adrenocortical cells, SR-BI mediates a major fraction of LDL CE selective uptake as judged by inhibition with antibodies directed to the extracellular domain of SR-BI (14Swarnakar S.

Thus, SR-BI may contribute to LDL CE selective uptake in some cell types. In a previous study, we found that expression of apoE in murine Y1 adrenocortical cells enhanced the selective uptake of LDL CE by 2–2.5-fold (16Swarnakar S. Reyland M.E. Deng J. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12140-12147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The clone of Y1 cells used in that work, Y1/E/tet/2/3, was engineered to express human apoE4 under control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter, permitting apoE expression to be induced some 20-fold by removal of tet from the culture medium. Experiments in the present study were designed to explore the mechanism by which apoE alters LDL CE selective uptake and, in particular, to test the hypothesis that the enhancement by apoE occurred via SR-BI-mediated LDL CE selective uptake. Surprisingly, we found that the Y1/E/tet/2/3 adrenocortical cell line does not express detectable levels of SR-BI. Furthermore, characterization of the LDL CE selective uptake pathway in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells showed its properties to be distinct from that mediated by SR-BI and to involve cell surface chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, apoE, and a member of the LDL receptor family. Thus, these findings identify a new pathway for the selective uptake of LDL CE.

Human HDL3 (1.125 g/ml < ρ <1.210 g/ml) and human LDL (1.019 g/ml < ρ <1.063 g/ml) were double-labeled with 125I-dilactitol tyramine and [3H]cholesteryl oleolyl ether as described (5Azhar S.

Inhibition of degradation was performed by incubating Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells with different concentrations of RAP or α2M* for 1 h before the addition of 125I-α2M*. To inhibit proteoglycan synthesis (26Kolset S.O. Sakurai K. Ivhed I. Overvatn A. Suzuki S. Biochem.

To inhibit sulfation (27Humphries D.E. Sugumaran G. Silbert J.E.

For selective removal of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, cells were treated for 3 h at 37 °C with 3 unit/ml heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7) or heparinase I and III together each at 3 units/ml before the addition of the double-labeled lipoprotein particles. For selective removal of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, cells were treated with chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) for 3 h at 37 °C with 1 unit/ml before the addition of the double-labeled particles. Each enzyme (Sigma) was dissolved in F-10 medium and used immediately. Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells were prepared from the Y1 parent cell line by two rounds of cloning to place apoE expression under control of the tet-off system described by Gossen and Bujard (28Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells express apoE at 2–2.5 μg/ml in the medium in the absence of tet and suppress apoE expression to 0.1 μg/ml in the presence of tet (16Swarnakar S. Reyland M.E. Deng J. Azhar S.

To examine the effect of Bt2cAMP on SR-BI expression in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells and to compare with the level of SR-BI expression in Y1-BS1 cells, postnuclear supernatant was used for Western blot analysis using antibody raised against the C-terminal tail of murine SR-BI (20Azhar S. Nomoto A. Leers-Sucheta S. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1616-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells plus or minus tet in the presence or absence of Bt2cAMP did not show detectable SR-BI expression. As expected, SR-BI expression was readily detected in Y1-BS1 cells and showed the expected increase in the presence of Bt2cAMP (19Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B.

These results indicate that Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells do not make detectable SR-BI in the presence or absence of apoE expression or upon activation of the protein kinase A pathway by Bt2cAMP. A Western blot using an antibody to the C-terminal tail of SR-BII also failed to detect this splice variant of the class B scavenger receptors in the presence or absence of apoE expression (Fig.2). Note that SR-BI expression was detected in the parent Y1 cell line, from which the Y1/E/tet/2/3 clone was generated, at ∼14‥ of the expression level in the Y1-BS1 cell line as determined by quantitative Western blotting (14Swarnakar S.

The basis for the loss of SR-BI expression in the Y1/E/tet/2/3 cell line is unknown, but a wide range of SR-BI expression levels has been observed in unselected subclones of the parent Y1 cell line isolated by limited dilution cloning (14Swarnakar S.

Membrane strips were probed with the indicated antibody for 3 h at room temperature followed by incubation with secondary antibody and development via chemiluminescence. Positive controls (cont) were provided by α-SR-BII (mouse testis extract), α-LR8B (extract of COS-7 cells transfected with expression vector for LR8B), α-LRP (extract of mouse embryo fibroblast cells), α-VLDLR (extract of Y1-BS1 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since neither SR-BI nor SR-BII seemed likely to be the basis for the apoE-mediated enhancement of LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells, we surveyed the cells for other apoE receptors that are members of the LDL receptor superfamily. As shown in Fig. 2, the LRP/α2M receptor and the VLDL receptor were both detected in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells with no reproducible differences in expression in the presence or absence of apoE expression. As expected, the LDL receptor was also detected in other Western blots (data not shown). The presence of each of these receptors in normal adrenal cells was confirmed with Western blots of extracts from Y1-BS1 cells and from mouse adrenal glands (data not shown). Western blots with antibody against the LR8B/apoER2 receptor failed to detect this receptor in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells (Fig. 2), Y1-BS1 cells, or mouse adrenal glands, although this antibody against chicken LR8B/apoER2 readily detected this receptor in extracts of mouse Neuro2A cells (29DeMattos R.B. Rudel L.L. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 976-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody against gp330 detected a faint band in extracts of Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells, but this was not seen with Y1-BS1 cells or mouse adrenal glands (data not shown). Thus, the LDL receptor, the LRP/α2M receptor, and the VLDL receptor were the most prominent members of the LDL receptor family detected in adrenal cells. To determine whether these members of the LDL receptor family might play a role in apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake, Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells were incubated with RAP, which inhibits the binding of apoE as well as other ligands to many members of this receptor family (30Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, increasing concentrations of RAP blocked the apoE-dependent component of LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells but had no effect on LDL CE selective uptake in the absence of apoE expression. In a separate experiment with Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells induced to express apoE, RAP inhibited LDL CE selective uptake but had no effect on HDL CE selective uptake (Fig. 3 B). Fifty percent of the apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake component was inhibited at a RAP concentration of ∼50 nm. The effect of RAP on both LDL CE selective uptake and HDL CE selective uptake was also tested in Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells in which the majority of LDL CE and HDL CE selective uptake is due to SR-BI (14Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,32Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). At neither of two lipoprotein concentrations (10 μg/ml or 100 μg/ml) did RAP at 1 μm have an appreciable effect (<10‥ inhibition) on LDL CE selective uptake or HDL CE selective uptake in Y1-BS1 cells (data not shown). Thus, SR-BI-mediated LDL CE and HDL CE selective uptake is not sensitive to RAP inhibition in Y1-BS1 cells, whereas apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells that do not express SR-BI is completely sensitive to RAP. Based on the RAP inhibition data, we asked whether the LRP/α2M receptor might be responsible for apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake. Functional activity of the LRP/α2M receptor in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells in the presence of apoE was first tested by monitoring the degradation of 125I-α2M*. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells degraded 125I-α2M* at a rate similar to that of mouse embryo fibroblast cells, which are known to express the LRP/α2M receptor. Both RAP and α2M* blocked the degradation of125I-α2M* in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells. In addition, RAP inhibited 50‥ of α2-M* degradation by Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells at a concentration of 50–100 nm (Fig.4 B), which is similar to the concentration dependence for inhibition of apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake (Fig.3 B). Inhibition by RAP is consistent with the participation of the LRP/α2M receptor but is not diagnostic for this receptor alone, since RAP interacts with other members of the LDL receptor family (30Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In contrast, α2M* is specific for the LRP/α2M receptor. The experiment in Fig.5 A shows that α2M* inhibited ∼30‥ of the total LDL CE selective uptake activity in apoE-expressing Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells. The enhancement of LDL CE selective uptake by apoE expression in this experiment was ∼2-fold (Fig. 5 B); hence, the 30‥ inhibition of total LDL CE selective uptake by α2M* reflects a 60‥ inhibition of apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake. In three such experiments, α2M* inhibited an average of 68‥ of apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake but inhibited less than 10‥ of LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells not induced to express apoE or in Y1-BS1 cells that do not express apoE (data not shown). These data suggest that the LRP/α2M receptor is responsible for a substantial fraction of the apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells. We attempted to confirm the role of the LRP/α2M receptor by blocking the activity with antibody against human LRP/α2M receptor. Under conditions where the antibody effectively blocked 125I-α2M* uptake, we obtained inconsistent inhibition of apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake. In two experiments, 50–60‥ of the apoE-dependent component was blocked by anti-LRP/α2M receptor, but in two other experiments, no inhibition was seen. Cell surface proteoglycans are known to be important for the endocytic uptake of apoE-containing β-VLDL particles by the LRP/α2M receptor (33Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ji Z.S. Fazio S. Lee Y.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, direct internalization of lipoproteins bound to the cell surface via heparan sulfate proteoglycans, particularly syndecan and perlecan, may occur without the participation of an LDL receptor family member (35Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,36Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To test the role of proteoglycan in apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells, we used two approaches to inhibit proteoglycan formation. In the first, the sulfation of glycosaminoglycan side chains was inhibited by treatment of cells with 30 mm sodium chlorate for 20 h before the addition of125I-labeled [3H]LDL. In three experiments, treatment of Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells with sodium chlorate caused about 75‥ inhibition of the apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake (Fig. 6 A) but had no effect on SR-BI-mediated LDL CE selective uptake in Y1-BS1 cells that do not make apoE (Fig. 6 B). In the second approach, cells were treated with 1 or 2 mm p-nitrophenyl-β-d- xylopyranoside (β-xyloside) to inhibit the incorporation of glycosaminoglycan side chains into cell surface proteoglycans before incubation with 50 μg/ml 125I-labeled [3H]LDL. The results in Fig.7 A show that β-xyloside completely blocked apoE-dependent LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells but had no effect on LDL CE selective uptake in Y1/E/tet/2/3 cells when apoE expression was suppressed. Similarly, this inhibitor had no effect on SR-BI-mediated LDL CE selective uptake in Y1-BS1 cells that do not make apoE (Fig. 7 B). These results indicate that cell surface proteoglyc"

Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ to this site stimulates transport activity and also removes Na+-dependent inactivation (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen.

Two highly conserved repeat motifs, referred to as α-repeats (5Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies indicate that the α-repeats face opposite sides of the membrane and may include re-entrant loops analogous to the P loops of ion channels (1Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D.

The goal of this study was to identify domains of the cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger important for activity, expression, or trafficking of the protein. The Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein was conceptualized as consisting of two domains: a N-terminal domain (N), constituted by the first five transmembrane segments, and the C-terminal domain (C), made up of the last four transmembrane segments. We then constructed a variety of “split” exchangers composed of the N or C domains with varying lengths of the intracellular loop attached. The N or C domains were expressed alone or coexpressed. Transport activity was determined by Na+-gradient-dependent45Ca2+ uptake or by electrophysiology, and surface expression was studied by linking GFP (9Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene. 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) to either the N or C domain. Functional reassembly of protein domains has been demonstrated for both ion channels and membrane transporters (10Chan K.W. Csanády L. Seto-Young D. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This approach has been useful in defining the roles of domains within a protein. Heterologous expression of domains from two Ca2+-activated potassium channels with different Ca2+ sensitivities led to identification of the region responsible for Ca2+regulation (15Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Coexpression of segments of CFTR in Xenopusoocytes helped define boundaries of the cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding site (10Chan K.W. Csanády L. Seto-Young D. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the cardiac Na+-Ca2+exchanger is also divisible into two domains that can reassemble in the membrane of Xenopus oocytes. Reassembly of the two domains gives Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity as judged by45Ca2+ uptake and by electrophysiology. The currents generated by the coexpression of the two domains are similar to those of the wild type (unsplit) exchanger in retaining Ca2+ regulation, Na+-dependent inactivation, and sensitivity to XIP and chymotrypsin. GFP fusion constructs are used to monitor the pattern of expression of split exchangers in Xenopus oocytes. Four GFP-exchanger chimeras were generated. Three fusion proteins were made with the GFP inserted at the C-terminal end of split exchanger proteins, and one fusion protein was made with GFP inserted at the N-terminal end of a split exchanger protein (see Fig. 3). To construct N265-GFP, the vector pEGFPN-1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was digested withXhoI/BglII, and the exchanger was excised from pCDNA3.1 with SalI/BamHI. The exchanger fragment was ligated into the pEGFPN-1 vector, giving the following amino acid linker region between the exchanger and GFP: ELKLRILESTVPPAPDPPVAT. To construct N358-GFP, the vector pEGFPN-1 was digested with PstI/BglII, and the exchanger was excised from pCDNA3.1 with NsiI/BamHI. The exchanger fragment was ligated into the pEGFPN-1 vector, giving the following amino acid linker region between the exchanger and GFP: STVPPAPDPPVAT. To construct N468-GFP, the vector pEGFPN-1 was digested withSmaI/BglII, and the exchanger in pCDNA3.1 was digested with StuI, blunt-ended, and then excised withBamHI. The exchanger fragment was ligated into the pEGFPN-1 vector, giving the following amino acid linker region between the exchanger and GFP: GDPPVAT. The cDNA for the fusion protein GFP-532C was constructed by digesting the pEGFPC-1 vector withXhoI/HindIII and ligating aXhoI/HindIII exchanger fragment into the vector. For all oocyte expression analyses, the fusion constructs were subcloned into the pGEM vector between Xenopus globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. RNA was synthesized using the mMessage mMachine T7 RNA kits (Ambion, Austin TX). Xenopus laevisoocytes were injected with 46 nl of cRNA and kept at 18 °C for 4–7 days. Sections of oocytes were prepared according to Terada et al. (16Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K.I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h, immersed in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 30% sucrose at 4 °C for 18 h, fixed in Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature compound, frozen overnight at −20 °C, and sectioned (≈8 μm thick). Giant inside-out patches were excised from oocytes 4–7 days after cRNA injection. Records were low pass-filtered at 50 Hz and acquired on line at 4 ms/point. Experiments were performed at 35 °C at a holding potential of 0 mV. To excise a membrane patch, the vitelline membrane was manually removed in a solution of 110 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7. After membrane excision, solutions were rapidly changed using a computer-controlled 20-channel solution switcher. Recordings were obtained with the following solutions: pipette solution, 100 mm N-methylglucamine, 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 8 mmCa(OH)2, 0.1 mm niflumic acid, and 0.15 mm ouabain, pH 7 (using methanesulfonic acid); bath solution, 100 mm CsOH or NaOH, 20 mmtetraethylammonium hydroxide, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 0 or 5.75 mm Ca(OH)2(0 or 1 μm free Ca2+), pH 7 (using methanesulfonic acid). Solutions with higher Ca2+ (15 μm) were prepared by adding 10 μmCa(OH)2 in the absence of EGTA. One goal was to split the cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger into two segments and restore transport activity by coexpression of the two domains in Xenopus oocytes. We generated two expression constructs: one coding for the N domain, consisting of the first five transmembrane segments and the cytoplasmic loop up to residue 671 (N671), and one coding for the C domain (672C), starting at residue 672 including the remainder of the protein. Exchange current was measured using excised inside-out giant patches from oocytes expressing the split exchangers. Alternatively, exchange activity was monitored as Na+gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake. Expression of either the N or the C domain alone produced no detectable exchange activity, as assayed by either technique (TableI). However, coexpression of the N + C domains produced transport activity. Fig.1 shows representative traces recorded from oocytes expressing the wild type (i.e. intact; Fig.1 A) and N671 + 672C exchangers (Fig. 1 B). Upon application of bath Na+ (100 mm) to the cytoplasmic surface of the patch in the presence of 8 mmCa2+ in the pipette, an outward exchange current was recorded. For both the wild type and split exchangers, current peaked and then decayed to a steady state level. The decay is caused by the presence of cytoplasmic Na+, which drives some exchangers into an inactive state (Na+-dependent inactivation or I1) (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Current decay was fit with a single exponential to determine the time constant. Values were 2.9 ± 0.2 s (n = 11) for the wild type and 3.2 ± 0.4 s (n = 15) for the N671 + 672C exchanger (see Fig. 6). Although the time constant did not change significantly, the number of split exchangers that enter the inactive state was less compared with the wild type. A measure of the distribution of active and inactive state is the fractional activity,F act, defined as the ratio of steady state to initial current. F act for the wild type exchanger was 0.26 ± 0.02 (n = 22), whereas for the N671 + 672C exchanger F act was 0.60 ± 0.04 (n = 15). Thus, the split exchanger retains inactivation although the magnitude of inactivation is decreased (see Fig. 6).Table IActivity of split exchangers relative to wild type activityConstructsTotal number of amino acids present in the cytoplasmic loop% 45Ca2+ uptake relative to wild typeControl oocytes0.2 ± 2N6714530.5 ± 0.3672C921 ± 8N671 + 672C54532 ± 8N265-GFP470.4 ± 1272C4922 ± 0.6N265-GFP + 672C13924 ± 6N265-GFP + 272C53952 ± 11N358-GFP1402 ± 1N358-GFP + 672C23215 ± 3*N358-GFP + 272C63242 ± 7N468-GFP2500 ± 0.4N468-GFP + 672C34233 ± 7*N468-GFP + 272C74255 ± 11N5493313 ± 1GFP-532C2322 ± 2*N549 + GFP-532C56443 ± 9Transport activity was measured as Na+-dependent uptake of 45Ca2+ into oocytes expressing each of the constructs.

Activity was normalized to wild type activity. Uptake was performed 3 or 4 times in each case with 6 or more oocytes used each time. The asterisks indicate split exchangers with overlapping residues. Control oocytes were injected either with cRNAs encoding for GFP or Shaker K+ channel. Constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 3. Errors represent S.E. The wild type exchanger is regulated by cytoplasmic Ca2+, which binds to a high affinity site in a region of the intracellular loop between residues 371 and 508 (4Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This binding site is distinct from the Ca2+ transport site. For the wild type exchanger (Fig. 1 A), increases of internal regulatory Ca2+evoke an increase of the peak current, whereas removal of internal Ca2+ drives the exchanger into a Ca2+-dependent inactive state (I 2) (17Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The effects of regulatory Ca2+ on the activity of the split exchanger were examined. Fig. 1 B shows traces recorded from two different oocytes, both expressing split exchanger N671 + 672C, and their response to change in internal Ca2+ concentrations. In one case, removal of internal Ca2+ evoked a decay of exchange current (upper trace), whereas in another case, the level of the current was insensitive to cytoplasmic Ca2+ (lower trace). Of 15 experiments, 8 showed an absence of Ca2+regulation, whereas 7 displayed Ca2+ regulation. Note that in all cases, transported Ca2+ is always present within the patch pipette at the extracellular surface of the membrane patch; only intracellular regulatory Ca2+ is varied. The ionic regulatory mechanisms controlled by Na+ and Ca2+ interact. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ alters the rate of entry and exit from the I1-inactive state and, at high concentrations (10–30 μm), completely eliminates Na+-dependent inactivation (17Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Fig. 1demonstrates the effect of high concentrations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ on Na+-dependent inactivation for the wild type and the split exchangers. Upon application of Na+ in the presence of 15 μm internal Ca2+, the wild type exchanger current increased and then decayed, reaching a steady state that was 87 ± 5% (n = 15, [Ca2+]i = 15 μm) of the peak current. In contrast, when a high concentration of internal Ca2+ in the presence of Na+ was applied to an excised patch expressing split exchangers (Fig. 1 B), the current peaked and then slowly decayed to a new steady state that was 55 ± 9% (n = 4, [Ca2+]i = 15 μm) of the peak current. Brief exposure of the intracellular surface of the giant patch to chymotrypsin deregulates the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (18Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Deregulation removes both Na+- and Ca2+-dependent regulatory properties, leaving transport properties intact (19Hilgemann D.W. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Matsuoka S. Hilgemann D.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 963-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mechanism and the site of action of this proteolytic enzyme are not known. Fig.2 A shows the effect of chymotrypsin on the split exchanger N671 + 672C. As with the wild type exchanger, application of cytoplasmic chymotrypsin removed Na+-dependent inactivation and Ca2+regulation (not shown) and increased the split exchanger current by 1.66 ± 0.27-fold (n = 4). Thus, activity of the split exchanger can still be up-regulated by chymotrypsin. The XIP (exchanger inhibitorypeptide) region of the exchanger is a stretch of basic and hydrophobic amino acids located at the N-terminal region of the large cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 219–238). A peptide corresponding to this region, XIP, is a potent inhibitor of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger activity (2Li Z.P. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the XIP binding site is unknown, although a previous report suggested that the XIP binding site is located within the intracellular loop (21Hale C.C. Bliler S. Quinn T.P. Peletskaya E.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If the XIP peptide is to bind in the large intracellular loop located between transmembrane segments 5 and 6, the structure and conformation of the loop could be important for this interaction. The trace in Fig. 2 B displays the effect of 1 μm internal XIP on the exchange current generated by a split exchanger. As observed for the wild type exchanger, XIP blocked ∼90% of exchange current. Similar results were observed in four additional experiments. Thus, the split exchanger still retains sensitivity to XIP. To visualize the distribution of the exchanger N and C domains inXenopus oocytes, we linked the GFP (9Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene. 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) to a variety of constructs. In addition, the length of the cytoplasmic portions of the N and C domains was varied to examine the role of the large cytoplasmic loop in controlling function and surface expression of the transporter. Constructs are designated as N or C, referring to the N or C domains, with a number indicating either the last amino acid residue of the N domain or the first residue of the C domain. If GFP is fused to a domain, the amino acid number also indicates the position at which GFP is linked. cRNA coding for the constructs shown schematically in Fig.3 was injected into Xenopusoocytes individually and in combinations. Four to six days after injection, the localization of the chimeric proteins was examined using a standard epifluorescence microscope. Fig.4 shows examples of fluorescence microscopic images of intact oocytes expressing the indicated constructs. Whole oocyte views (Fig. 4 A) show that expression of GFP-tagged halves N358, N468, and 532C generated a diffuse green fluorescence signal that was mainly restricted to the vegetal pole. A reduced fluorescence from the animal pole is likely due to a filtering effect of the pigments present only in this region of the oocytes. N265-GFP failed to produce any fluorescence, and the signal was comparable with background autofluorescence. Fig. 4 B shows fluorescence images of intact oocytes acquired at higher magnification to better resolve plasma membrane labeling. Since the pigments, located below the plasma membrane on the animal pole, partially filter cytoplasmic fluorescence, we analyzed this region of the oocytes (except for N265-GFP; see Fig. 4 legend). Only coexpression of the two domains generates a fluorescent signal in the plasma membrane of the oocytes. Plasma membrane localization was most intense when the N domains were coexpressed with a long C domain fragment (i.e. 272C). Oocytes injected with cRNA encoding GFP alone showed a uniform cytoplasmic fluorescent signal, without plasma membrane staining. This indicates that the fluorescence observed at the plasma membrane reflects the true localization of GFP-tagged split exchangers. To visualize in more detail the distribution of the GFP-tagged split exchangers, cryosections of oocytes were analyzed. Examples of fluorescent images obtained from oocyte sections (8–10 μm thick) are shown in Fig.5. Uninjected oocytes or oocytes expressing an untagged exchanger were used as negative controls. Analysis of the cryosections confirmed the membrane localization of split exchangers only when both domains were coexpressed. As seen with intact oocytes, the intensity of the signal detected at the plasma membrane depended on two factors: the presence of both domains and the length of the large cytoplasmic loop located between transmembrane segments 5 and 6. In oocyte sections, it was possible to occasionally observe a weak plasma membrane fluorescence in oocytes expressing single domains (with the exception of N265-GFP, which did not generate any signal above background). This signal was restricted to the animal pole, whereas coexpression of the N and C domains delivered the protein to both the animal and vegetal poles. In addition, oocytes expressing the wild type exchanger with no GFP tag also sometimes exhibited weak surface autofluorescence (Fig. 5). Thus, the significance of the weak membrane labeling by individual domains of the exchanger is unclear. To determine whether linkage to GFP altered transport properties of split Na+-Ca2+ exchangers, the activities of fusion proteins were analyzed by Na+-gradient dependent45Ca2+ uptake and by the giant patch technique. Table I shows the activity of GFP-tagged split exchangers relative to the wild type activity, as determined by Na+gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake. In no case did expression of individual domains of the protein generate significant exchanger activity. Transport activity was reconstituted only after coinjection of both N and C domains. Exchanger activity correlated with the intensity of fluorescence in the plasma membrane, and the highest level of transport was obtained when the full length of the protein was reconstructed. For example, the GFP-labeled split exchanger composed of the two halves N265-GFP and 672C showed only 24 ± 7% of the activity of the wild type (not split) exchanger, whereas the exchanger N265-GFP + 272C restored 52 ± 13% of the activity of the wild type exchanger. Similar results were obtained when fragments N365-GFP and N468-GFP were expressed with either 672C or 272C. We investigated the biophysical properties of the GFP-tagged split exchangers using the giant patch technique. All GFP-tagged split exchangers were active, displaying an outward current upon application of cytoplasmic Na+. As with the wild type exchanger, current peaked and then decayed (Na+-dependent inactivation) to a steady state level. The extent of Na+-dependent inactivation for the GFP-tagged split exchangers was measured as fractional activity,F act. Fig. 6 shows recordings from excised patches from oocytes expressing the indicated constructs and the corresponding F act and inactivation time constants. The magnitude of inactivation was generally decreased with respect to that of the wild type exchanger, although split exchangers N468-GFP + 272C and N265-GFP + 272C hadF act values similar to wild type. We also examined the kinetics of the Na+-dependent inactivation by fitting the current decay to an exponential. The rate by which N549 + GFP-532C, N265-GFP + 672C, and N468-GFP + 672C entered the inactivated state did not significantly deviate from that of the wild type. In contrast, the split exchangers containing the N358-GFP domain and N468-GFP + 272C had faster time constants, whereas N265-GFP + 272C entered the inactivated state with a slower rate. Similar to the untagged split exchanger, the constructs N265-GFP + 272C, N358-GFP + 272C, and N468-GFP + 272C showed regulation by intracellular Ca2+, whereas splits N549 + GFP-532C, N358-GFP + 672C, and N265-GFP + 672C lacked Ca2+-dependent regulation (not shown). The data indicate that the addition of GFP to the exchanger and the omission or overlap of large portions of the cytoplasmic loop did not drastically affect the molecular processes involved in Na+-dependent inactivation or Ca2+-dependent regulation. All the GFP-tagged split exchangers retained chymotrypsin and XIP sensitivity. As an example, Fig. 7 shows traces recorded from a patch expressing the N265-GFP + 672C exchanger. Outward current was activated upon application of 100 mminternal Na+ in the presence of 1 μmcytoplasmic Ca2+. After exposure of the internal side of the patch to chymotrypsin, current increased, and the Na+-dependent inactivation disappeared (n = 4). Subsequently, chymotrypsin-activated current was inhibited by the addition of 1 μm cytoplasmic XIP (n = 2). The result indicates that the sites recognized by chymotrypsin and XIP are not located between residues 266 and 671. The mature Na+-Ca2+ exchanger has nine transmembrane segments. The first five transmembrane segments are separated from the last four by a large intracellular loop (1Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Some functionally important regions of the exchanger protein have been elucidated. The α repeats (including transmembrane segments 2, 3, and 7) are important for ion transport, whereas the large intracellular loop confers secondary regulation by Na+ and Ca2+ ions. Na+ drives a fraction of the exchangers into an inactive state (Na+-dependent inactivation), whereas regulatory Ca2+ stimulates activity. These two processes are not independent since high cytoplasmic Ca2+ removes Na+-dependent inactivation (3Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Binding of regulatory Ca2+ to the loop induces a major change in conformation of the protein (4Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Saba R.I. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Herchuelz A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (Abstr. 2289): 388Google Scholar). In this study, we artificially split the exchanger within the large cytoplasmic loop and examined the consequences for split exchangers with respect to function, trafficking, and regulation. The N domain consisted of the first five transmembrane segments and part of the intracellular loop, whereas the C domain included a portion of the intracellular loop and the last four transmembrane segments. Individual domains were unable to generate any transport activity; activity was restored only after coexpression of paired N and C domains. Analyses of sections of oocytes expressing domains of the exchanger labeled with GFP are consistent with these findings. Oocytes expressing single halves showed a diffuse fluorescence within the cytoplasm, indicating that the proteins were translated but were mainly retained in internal membranes or were largely degraded. An exception is the N265-GFP fragment, which failed to produce any fluorescence when expressed alone. Since the domain N358-GFP did express protein, residues encompassing 265 and 358 could play a role in protein stability. A weak plasma membrane signal on the animal pole of oocytes expressing single domains was occasionally observed. Although a similar signal was sometimes also observed in control oocytes, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that a small amount of individual halves of the exchanger could be stably inserted in the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, when the two domains were coexpressed, markedly different results were observed. The amount of fluorescence in the plasma membrane drastically increased in both the animal and the vegetal poles. The intensity of the signal in the plasma membrane was correlated to the length of the large cytoplasmic loop: split exchangers with large loop truncations generated less plasma membrane fluorescence than split exchangers in which the full length of the exchanger was reconstituted. These findings suggest a role for the cytoplasmic loop in modulating the trafficking and stability of the protein. Our data on the activity of split exchangers, measured as Na+-dependent45Ca2+ uptake, support this hypothesis; the highest levels of activity were measured in oocytes expressing split exchangers containing the full length of the large intracellular loop (Table I). To analyze the consequences of an interruption in the protein backbone and GFP fusions on secondary regulation of the exchanger, we recorded current from split exchangers using the giant excised patch technique. All active split exchangers showed Na+-dependent inactivation. The Na+-dependent inactivation orI 1, describes entry of the exchanger into an inactive state in the presence of high concentrations of cytoplasmic Na+. This process is associated with a region of the protein located at the N-terminal side of the large cytoplasmic loop (endogenous XIP region, amino acids 219–238) (23Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. He Z. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interaction of the endogenous XIP region with another region of the exchanger may produce the inactive state. Our data indicate that Na+-dependent inactivation is not significantly affected by 1) partitioning of the protein into two domains, 2) large deletions of the cytoplasmic loop, or 3) fusion of GFP to the loop. Even the split exchanger N265-GFP + 672C retains Na+-dependent inactivation, although in this case the GFP is in close proximity (within 30 residues) to the XIP region. All split exchangers, including N265-GFP + 672C, with more than 400 loop residues deleted, were blocked by the synthetic peptide with the same sequence as the endogenous XIP region (XIP peptide) (2Li Z.P. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicates that the site with which the endogenous XIP region interacts is not located between amino acids 265 and 672. Hale et al. (21Hale C.C. Bliler S. Quinn T.P. Peletskaya E.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have previously identified the segment between residues 445 and 455 of the exchanger as a XIP binding region. Although this segment may be able to interact with XIP, our data indicate that this cannot be the primary site responsible for XIP inhibition. In addition, in an early report, Matsuoka et al. (24Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) report that a mutant exchanger with a large deletion (amino acids 240–679) in the intracellular loop was insensitive to inhibition by XIP peptide. Subsequently, we have been unable to reproduce this finding, 2S. Matsuoka, and K. D. Philipson, unpublished observation. consistent with the data presented here. Our data do not rule out the possible involvement of the C-terminal region of the cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 672–764) in the binding of XIP peptide. These residues include a highly conserved region previously thought to be a transmembrane segment (former TMS6 (1Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)). More mutagenesis and biophysical studies are needed to elucidate the events that lead to Na+-dependent inactivation and XIP inhibition. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ regulates Na+-Ca2+exchange activity. Regulatory Ca2+ binds to a high affinity binding site, located in the cytoplasmic loop. Increasing intracellular Ca2+ activates transport activity, whereas removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ drives the exchanger into an inactive state referred to as Ca2+-dependent inactivation or I 2 (17Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Levitsky D.O. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In testing the Ca2+ sensitivity of split exchangers, we found that the GFP-tagged split exchangers N265-GFP + 272C, N358-GFP + 272C, N468- GFP + 272C, and the split exchanger N671 + 672C were activated by cytoplasmic Ca2+. However, a complete loss of Ca2+ regulation was sometimes observed (Fig. 1). Possible explanations are that the split exchangers are more susceptible to proteases, causing the loss of Ca2+ regulation, or that alternative conformations exist with split exchangers. The split exchangers N265-GFP + 672C, N368-GFP + 672C, and N549 + GFP-532C lacked secondary Ca2+ regulation. Of particular interest is the lack of Ca2+ regulation in the N549 + GFP-532C construct, since it still retains the Ca2+ binding site (residues 371–508 (4Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The presence of GFP or the location at which the protein was split could possibly interfere with the binding of Ca2+or obstruct conformational changes leading to exchanger activation by Ca2+. In the wild type exchanger, regulatory Ca2+ not only activates exchanger current but also modulates Na+-dependent inactivation. At high internal Ca2+ concentrations (≥10 μm), Na+-dependent inactivation is largely eliminated (17Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Na+-dependent inactivation of N671 + 672C is essentially insensitive to regulatory Ca2+, and substantial inactivation is observed even at 15 μm internal Ca2+ (Fig. 1). Apparently the conformational changes induced by Ca2+ binding that modulate Na+-dependent inactivation are absent in a split exchanger. Exposing the cytoplasmic side of the wild type exchanger to chymotrypsin eliminates both Ca2+ and Na+regulation (18Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), leaving the exchanger in an activated state. The site(s) at which proteolysis induces activation are not known. It is assumed that the chymotrypsin site is located in the large cytoplasmic loop, although there is no evidence to validate this hypothesis. Our data indicate that a GFP-tagged split exchanger with a large portion of the loop deleted (amino acids 266–671) is deregulated after exposure to chymotrypsin. Two considerations arise. First, chymotrypsin can still activate the exchanger with a split loop; second, if the proteolytic site responsible for activation is to be found in the cytoplasmic loop, it is not located between residues 266 and 671. Previous investigations showed activation of the deletion mutant Δ240–679 by chymotrypsin (24Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and in preliminary experiments, we observed chymotrypsin sensitivity in an exchanger with residues 223–265 deleted. These results further constrain the location of the cleavage site. Chymotrypsin treatment of the exchanger protein shifts the apparent molecular mass from 120 to 70 kDa (26Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, after chymotrypsin treatment, 50 kDa of protein is thus unaccounted for. Apparently, in one portion of the protein, chymotrypsin cleaves the exchanger at multiple sites, and the fragments are too small to be detected in the gel system. In two studies, the N terminus of the 70-kDa proteolytic fragment has been identified to coincide with the N terminus of the full-length protein (27Saba R.I. Bollen A. Herchuelz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or to begin within the intracellular loop in the 257–269-residue region (28Iwata T. Galli C. Dainese P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two studies report that expression of truncated forms of the exchanger, comparable with N domains characterized here, induced Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity in transfected cells (29Li X.F. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Gabellini N. Zatti A. Rispoli G. Navangione A. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our results are inconsistent with these reports. We were never able to observe exchange activity with either the N or C domains expressed individually. Likewise, the N or C domains did not induce activity when expressed in human embryonic kidney cells instead of oocytes. 3Z. Qiu, and K. D. Philipson, unpublished observation. In addition, the fluorescent signal in the plasma membrane of oocytes expressing individual GFP-tagged domains was marginally, if at all, above background. Possibly different experimental conditions or different levels of expression of the single domains could account for the discrepancy. In summary, we describe the functional reconstitution of the exchanger after partition into two domains. The two domains were properly delivered to the membrane when coexpressed, and both domains were required for activity. Exchanger activity was maintained after fusion of GFP to individual domains. The fluorescent fusion proteins may be useful monitors of conformational changes in future studies. We thank Dr. R. Olcese for helpful discussions and Dr. Y. Lu and G. Mottino for technical assistance."

As CPT I kinetics are highly dependent on its membrane environment, we have measured the kinetic parameters of CPT I present in rat liver submitochondrial membrane fractions enriched in either outer membrane or contact sites. The Km for palmitoyl-CoA was 2.4-fold higher for CPT I in outer membranes than that for the enzyme in contact sites. In addition, whereas in contact sites malonyl-CoA behaved as a competitive inhibitor of CPT I with respect to palmitoyl-CoA, in outer membranes malonyl-CoA inhibition was non-competitive. As a result of the combination of these changes, the IC50 for malonyl-CoA was severalfold higher for CPT I in contact sites than for the enzyme in bulk outer membrane. The Ki for malonyl-CoA, theKm for carnitine, and the catalytic constant of the enzyme were all unaffected. It is concluded that the different membrane environments in outer membranes and contact sites result in an altered conformation of L-CPT I that specifically affects the long-chain acyl-CoA binding site. The accompanying changes in the kinetics of the enzyme provide an additional potent mechanism for the regulation of L-CPT I activity.

The enzyme is an integral membrane protein with two transmembrane segments that are thought to confer on its kinetics a marked dependence on the physical state of the membrane (1Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Zammit V.A. Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Adv.

CPT I is present within the general outer membrane of mitochondria (5Murthy M.S.R. Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) but is especially concentrated within the contact sites that occur between the outer membrane and the peripheral inner membrane (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The latent form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT II) is also concentrated at the contact sites but on the inner aspect of the inner membrane, suggesting that long-chain acylcarnitine formation, and utilization may be facilitated by this submitochondrial localization of the two proteins (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Contact sites are loci for the extensive trafficking of proteins and phospholipids between the extra- and intramitochondrial compartments. They are the sites of the mitochondrial protein import machinery (7Pfanner N. Rassow J. Wienhaes U. Hergersberg C. Sollner T. Becker K. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) of the binding of hexokinase and creatine kinase on the cytosolic and intermembrane space aspects of the outer membrane, respectively (8Brdiczka D. Bucheler K. Kottke M. Adams V. Nalam V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 291-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and of the attachment of a specialized population of endoplasmic reticular membranes through which phospholipid trafficking occurs (10Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Daum G. Vance J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 103-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). They are also sites of interaction of mitochondria with the cytoskeleton (12Leterrier J.F. Rusakov B.D. Nelson B.D. Linden M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 27: 233-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The property that makes CPT I rate-limiting for long-chain acyl-CoA utilization by mitochondria is its inhibition by malonyl-CoA (13McGarry J. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this inhibition, as studied in intact isolated mitochondria, appears to be competitive with respect to the acyl-CoA substrate. However, it has long been appreciated that its mode of action is unorthodox as malonyl-CoA appears to induce sigmoidicity in the velocity-substrate concentration curves (14Cook G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12030-12033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT I kinetics are very sensitive to changes in the physical properties of the membrane in which it resides (3Zammit V. Corstorphine C. Kolodziej M. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fluidization of membrane lipids in vivo or in vitro results in the desensitization of CPT I to malonyl-CoA and vice versa (3Zammit V. Corstorphine C. Kolodziej M. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Mynatt R.L. Greenshaw J.J. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 248: 727-733Google Scholar, 16Kolodziej M.P. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have reasoned, therefore, that as contact sites have a distinctive lipid (17Ardail D. Lerme F. Louisot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7978-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein (18Pfanner N. Rassow J. Klei I.J.V.D. Neupert W. Cell. 1997; 68: 999-1002Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (109) Google Scholar) composition, it is possible that CPT I molecules in the two membrane microenvironments may have different kinetic properties (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as is already well established for other proteins (e.g. porin; see Refs. 19Adams V. Bosch W. Schlegel J. Wallimann T. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 981: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and 20Ohlendieck K. Riesinger I. Adams V. Krause J. Bridicka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 672-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that exist in both outer membrane and contact site environments. We have tested this hypothesis by studying the kinetics of liver CPT I in submitochondrial fractions enriched in the two membrane populations. We find that the kinetic parameters with respect to one of its substrates, palmitoyl-CoA, are markedly different for the enzyme in the two microenvironments. Moreover, the kinetics of malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT I activity is different for the enzyme resident within the two membrane populations. Liver mitochondria were prepared from male Wistar rats (350–400-g body weight; maintained on a laboratory chow diet) by differential centrifugation followed by Percoll gradient purification. Mitochondrial subfractionation was performed as described previously (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the sonicated mitochondria were fractionated using step, rather than continuous, sucrose gradients. The sucrose concentrations for the step gradient were 1.13 g, 1.15 g, and 1.19 g/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and chosen to yield fractions enriched in outer membrane, contact sites, and inner membrane, respectively (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The volume of each sucrose density step was 3 ml. A step (1.5-ml) of intermediate density was present between the 1.13-g and 1.15 g/ml steps to ensure clean separation between the outer membrane and contact site fractions. The gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 210 min at 4 °C in a 65V13 vertical rotor (Sorvall Instruments). The fractions were recovered by puncturing the polycarbonate tubes with a syringe needle followed by aspiration of each membrane band. They were divided into aliquots and frozen at −20 °C until used for enzyme activity measurements, protein determination, and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The activities of marker enzymes were measured to characterize the purity of the fractions. Rotenone-insensitive NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase (assayed as in Ref. 6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were used as markers for outer and inner membrane fractions, respectively. Porin was used as a marker for both outer membrane and contact sites (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The component proteins of the submitochondrial fractions were separated using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide) followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose and immunodetection of porin with mouse anti-human porin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (see Ref. 6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The band intensity of porin on the Western blots was quantified densitometrically (Molecular Dynamics). In Ref. 6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar we showed that CPT II is also enriched within contact sites and that some contamination of the outer membranes with CPT II is always present. Therefore, samples of the sucrose gradient-purified submitochondrial fractions enriched in outer membranes or contact sites were preincubated for 10 min on ice in the absence and presence of tetradecylglycidyl-CoA at a concentration sufficient to inhibit all CPT I activity. This enabled us to quantify the proportion of total CPT activity in these fractions that was due to CPT II in these fractions. This was then subtracted from the total CPT activity (obtained in fractions not incubated with the inhibitor) so as to obtain that of CPT I. The basic assay medium for CPT I contained 80 mm sucrose, 70 mm KCl, 50 mm imadazole, 1 mmEGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 1% defatted bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glutathione, 4 μg of rotenone/ml, 2 μg of antimycin A/ml, and the indicated concentrations of carnitine (specific radioactivity 770 dpm/nmol) and palmitoyl-CoA. The final pH value was 7.1. For determination of the IC50 for malonyl-CoA (concentration that gives 50% inhibition of CPT I activity) the concentrations of carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA were 520 and 35 μm, respectively. When the concentrations of carnitine or palmitoyl-CoA were varied, the fixed concentrations of the second substrate were 135 and 520 μm for palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine, respectively. The specific activity of3H-carnitine was kept constant at 1077 dpm/nmol. Malonyl-CoA concentrations were either varied up to 200 μm or maintained constant at 20 μm when investigating the dependence of CPT I activity on increasing palmitoyl-CoA concentrations in the absence or presence of malonyl-CoA. Immunodetection of CPT I was performed by Western blotting as described previously, using an anti-peptide antibody (anti-C) raised against a linear epitope from the catalytic domain of rat liver CPT I (1Fraser F.

Palmitoyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and fatty acid-free albumin, co-factors, and substrates for enzyme assays were from Sigma; mouse anti-human porin antibody was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Tetradecylglycidyl-CoA was synthesized starting with the sodium salt of tetradecylglycidic acid (McNeil Pharmaceutical, Spring House, PA) by the method described in Ref. 22Bernert Jr., J.T. Sprecher H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 573: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. Radiolabeled carnitine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and was washed with water-saturatedn-butanol before being used, to reduce radioactive contaminants. Sheep anti-rat L-CPT I anti-peptide L antibody was obtained as described previously (see Ref. 1Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from Merck. The outer membrane- and contact site-enriched fractions were characterized with respect to their content of marker proteins and immunodetectable CPT I (TableI). The sucrose step gradients used for their preparation in the present study gave fractions that had the characteristics of the respective peaks obtained from continuous gradients in our previous studies (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There was minimal cross-contamination between the two fractions, although as expected this was greater for the contamination of contact sites with outer membrane (see Table I).Table ICharacterization of representative outer membrane and contact site fractionsProteinOuter membraneContact sitesInner membranerNCR20.31 ± 3.175.00 ± 0.762.44 ± 0.52Cytochrome coxidase4.30 ± 1.1049.25 ± 21.6172.97 ± 20.70Porin1 ± 0.120.42 ± 0.090.11 ± 0.05CPT I1 ± 0.330.49 ± 0.190.02 ± 0.01Mitochondria were prepared from livers of fed rats, and submitochondrial fractions were isolated on discontinuous sucrose gradients as described in the “Materials and Methods.” The activities of marker enzymes for outer membrane (rotenone-insensitive NADPH cytochrome c reductase; rNCR) and inner membrane (cytochrome c oxidase) were measured and are given as μmol/min per total fraction.

Lineweaver-Burke plots for CPT I activity at a different palmitoyl-CoA concentration for the enzyme in contact site and outer membrane fractions were linear (see Fig. 1, a andb), as were Eadie-Hofstee plots (not shown), which allowed us to use graphical methods to determine the kinetic parameters. As shown in Table II, there was a 2.4-fold difference (p = 0.0002) in the Kmfor palmitoyl-CoA for the enzyme in the two different membrane fractions (60.6 ± 7.5 and 25.6 ± 0.9 μm for outer membrane and contact site fractions, respectively). The maximum palmitoyl-CoA concentration used was 200 μm (in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin) to avoid the detergent properties of this molecule.

In the outer membranes, malonyl-CoA acted exclusively by lowering the Vmax of the enzyme, without affecting the Km for palmitoyl-CoA. By contrast, in contact sites, malonyl-CoA inhibited CPT I activity almost entirely by raising the Km for palmitoyl-CoA without affecting the Vmax of the enzyme (there was a very minor effect on Vmax, but this can be accounted for by unavoidable minor contamination of contact sites with outer membranes flanking the points of physical contact between the outer and inner membranes). Malonyl-CoA (20 μm) increased the Km for palmitoyl-CoA of CPT I in contact sites by 4-fold (p > 0.0001), whereas it had no effect on the Km of the enzyme in outer membranes. By contrast, 20 μm malonyl-CoA reduced theVmax of the enzyme resident in outer membranes by 70% (p = 0.0002) without affecting that for the enzyme in contact sites. In neither fraction did malonyl-CoA induce any non-linearity in double-reciprocal plots. Note that theVmax values refer to activity per mg of membrane protein of each individual membrane fraction and not of whole mitochondria. The IC50 value for malonyl-CoA (the concentration of malonyl-CoA required to inhibit CPT I activity by 50% at a suboptimal concentration of palmitoyl-CoA) is the parameter that is most commonly measured to assess malonyl-CoA sensitivity of CPT I in intact mitochondria (23Mynatt R.L. Lappi M.D. Cook G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Saggerson D. Ghadiminejad I. Awan M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1992; 32: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When this type of experiment was performed, the inhibition curves obtained in the presence of increasing concentrations of malonyl-CoA were different for the enzyme in outer membranes and contact sites, respectively. The enzyme in contact sites was less sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition (Fig.2) i.e it had the higher IC50 value (see Table II). In view of the fact that the Km for palmitoyl-CoA and the mode of inhibition by malonyl-CoA were found to be different between the two fractions, values for the Ki for malonyl-CoA were also obtained from Dixon plots (1/v versus[malonyl-CoA]). As can be seen from Table II, theKi value for malonyl-CoA was the same for CPT I in outer membranes and contact sites suggesting that the difference in IC50 was due solely to the difference inKm for palmitoyl-CoA between the enzyme in outer membranes and contact sites. The catalytic constant of an enzyme is defined as the ratio of Vmax divided by the molar amount of enzyme protein, and is a measure of the intrinsic catalytic activity of the protein molecules. A quantitative estimate of the number of CPT I molecules in outer membrane and contact site fractions was obtained by immunodetection of CPT I on Western blots for paired fractions obtained from individual rat livers. The value of theVmax for CPT I activity (Table II) divided by immunoreactive CPT I band intensity (Table I) was obtained for the two membrane fractions. For five different preparations, the ratio between the parameters for the two membrane fractions was not significantly different from unity (0.92 ± 0.18) indicating that the intrinsic catalytic activity of CPT I is not different in the two membrane microenvironments. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the effect of 20 μm malonyl-CoA on the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) of CPT I in either of the two membrane fractions was identical (a 75% decrease) as can be calculated from the data in Table II. CPT I is an integral membrane protein that adopts a polytopic conformation (1Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Its two hydrophobic transmembrane segments are flanked by the N- and C-terminal domains that both protrude into the cytosol. We have suggested (1Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Zammit V.A. Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that this topology endows the protein with the potential for altering the conformation of its catalytic C-domain in response to changes in the membrane environment. It was previously shown for mitochondria in vitro (15Mynatt R.L. Greenshaw J.J. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 248: 727-733Google Scholar, 16Kolodziej M.P. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and for outer membrane preparations isolated from rats in different physiological conditions (3Zammit V. Corstorphine C. Kolodziej M. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that CPT I kinetics are extremely sensitive to the molecular order of the constituent lipids of the membrane environment in which it resides or into which it is incorporated experimentally (4McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Broadway N.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The observation (6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that CPT I is distributed both within the bulk outer membrane and contact sites (but enriched in the latter; see Ref. 6Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) raised the prospect that the kinetic properties of the enzyme are different in the two microenvironments. The present data provide evidence that this is indeed the case and that the properties of L-CPT I with respect to palmitoyl-CoA are markedly different in the two membrane environments. A possible mechanism for the changes observed could be the altered interaction of CPT I with other (lipid and/or protein) membrane components within outer membranes or contact sites resulting in a conformational change in the protein that affects specifically the acyl-CoA binding site. Previous observations (4McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Jackson, V. N., Zammit, V. A., and Price, N. T. (2000)J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that the kinetics of CPT I are highly dependent on the interaction between its cytosolic N-terminal domain and the rest of the molecule, as shown originally by cell biological studies (1Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Zammit V.A. Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and more recently by domain swapping (28Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and functional mutagenesis experiments (27Jackson, V. N., Zammit, V. A., and Price, N. T. (2000)J. Biol. Chem..Google Scholar,30Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that short or long term changes in the membrane environment, because of either the formation of localized membrane microdomains of distinctive lipid and/or protein composition (i.e. in contact sites) or by changes in overall phospholipid composition (e.g. induced by diet, fasting, and/or insulin-deficiency; see Ref. 3Zammit V. Corstorphine C. Kolodziej M. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) would induce altered kinetic characteristics of CPT I. There are precedents of other proteins that show differences in molecular properties of populations that are partitioned between mitochondrial contact sites and outer membranes. Thus, voltage-dependent anion channel (porin), an integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein that is also enriched in contact sites (19Adams V. Bosch W. Schlegel J. Wallimann T. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 981: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Ohlendieck K. Riesinger I. Adams V. Krause J. Bridicka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 672-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), displays different transport properties depending on its submitochondrial membrane location. For example, porin-rich domains present at contact sites of brain mitochondria bind hexokinase, whereas porin within the bulk outer membrane does not (12Leterrier J.F. Rusakov B.D. Nelson B.D. Linden M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1994; 27: 233-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, contact site porin is more difficult to extract with detergents, suggesting altered protein-lipid and/or protein-protein interactions (29Linden M. Nelson B.D. Loncar D. Leterrier J.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The most striking difference between CPT I in contact sites and outer membrane was observed for the kinetics of malonyl-CoA inhibition with respect to palmitoyl-CoA. They were competitive for the enzyme resident within contact sites but non-competitive within the outer membrane fraction. It is significant that this change was accompanied by a 2.4-fold increase in the Km for palmitoyl-CoA but no change in the intrinsic catalytic activity of the enzyme, itsKi for malonyl-CoA, or its Km for carnitine. Therefore, the change in CPT I appears to be specific to the acyl-CoA binding site. This difference in kinetics is potentially very important for the function of CPT I in the two membrane environmentsin vivo. Thus, not only would CPT I in the outer membranes be more susceptible to inhibition by malonyl-CoA at any given palmitoyl-CoA concentration (lower IC50), but the inhibitor would be able to affect the outer membrane enzyme activity even at high palmitoyl-CoA concentrations because of the non-competitive nature of the inhibition for the enzyme in outer membranes. Consequently, the effect of malonyl-Co would not be able to be over-ridden by high palmitoyl-CoA concentrations unless the CPT I molecules reside within the contact sites. We thank C. Narain for excellent assistance, Dr. S. Brocklehurst (Biomathematics and Statistics, Scotland) for performing the statistical analyses, and Dr. R. R.

Here we tested the hypothesis that PtdIns hydrolysis is mediated by PLCγ1, which is known to be regulated by activation of tyrosine kinases and PtdIns 3-kinase. PtdIns breakdown was more sensitive than that of PtdInsP2 to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Conversely, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, alone promoted PtdIns hydrolysis and acted non-additively with carbachol. Vanadate did not stimulate PtdInsP2 breakdown. Carbachol also stimulated a rapid (maximal at 1–2 min) tyrosine phosphorylation of several islet proteins, although not of PLCγ1 itself. Two structurally unrelated inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase, wortmannin and LY294002, more effectively attenuated the hyrolysis of PtdIns compared with PtdInsP2. Adenovirally mediated overexpression of PLCγ1 significantly increased carbachol-stimulated PtdIns hydrolysis without affecting that of PtdInsP2. Conversely overexpression of PLCβ1 up-regulated the PtdInsP2, but not PtdIns, response. These results indicate that the hydrolysis of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 are independently regulated in pancreatic islets and that PLCγ1 selectively mediates the breakdown of PtdIns. The activation mechanism of PLCγ involves tyrosine phosphorylation (but not of PLCγ directly) and PtdIns 3-kinase. Our findings point to a novel bifurcation of signaling pathways downstream of muscarinic receptors and suggest that hydrolysis of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 might serve different physiological ends.

These pathways are well described in the regulation of insulin secretion following occupation of m3 and m1 muscarinic receptors on the surface of pancreatic β−cells (5Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Mol.

However we have shown that in addition to the classical pathway of PtdInsP2 hydrolysis, exposure of pancreatic islets to the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol also promotes the hydrolysis of PtdIns (9Biden T.J. Prugue M.L. Davison A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter predominates quantitatively over, and is a precursor of, PtdInsP2. Although hydrolysis of either phosphoinositide species results in generation of DAG, only PtdInsP2 gives rise to a Ca2+ signal via Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. Therefore the two hydrolytic events may have different functional consequences. The inositol phosphate, corresponding to Ins(1,4,5)P3, that is derived from PtdIns, is Ins(1)P1. This has no biological function but can be used to quantify PtdIns hydrolysis, at least under the conditions verified in our previous studies (9Biden T.J. Prugue M.L. Davison A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The PLC family is comprised of four major groups (PLCs β, γ, δ, and ε). Members of the PLCβ family are activated by G-proteins in response to occupation of GPCRs (3Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol.

PLCδ is the most sensitive of the PLC family to Ca2+, and a rise in intracellular Ca2+ is thought to underly its activation in vivo (14Banno Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol.

The PLCγ family members (PLCγ 1 and 2) are classically activated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases, but they also couple to muscarinic and other GPCRs in a manner secondary to stimulation of cytosolic tyrosine kinases (3Rhee S.G.

Indeed there is recent evidence that phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, generated by the enzyme PtdIns 3-kinase, binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of PLCγ and thereby stimulates its activity (23Falasca M.

The precise mechanism underlying this mode of activation is obscure, but it does not require tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ. This PLC is also of interest, because compared with the PLCβ and δ family members, which are relatively selective for PtdInsP2, PLCγ is also capable of efficiently using PtdIns as a substrate, at least in vitro (27Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Cho K.S. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6649-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We have previously provided limited evidence that hydrolysis of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 are independently regulated and hence potentially mediated by different PLCs. Thus, in pancreatic β-cells, a rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels is sufficient to cause breakdown of PtdInsP2 but not of PtdIns (10Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current aim was to characterize further the mechanism underlying PtdIns hydrolysis, with particular reference to a potential role for PLCγ. Our results show for the first time that PLCγ mediates PtdIns hydrolysis in vivo and that the underlying mechanism appears to involve activation of PtdIns 3-kinase and alterations in the tyrosine phosphorylation of islet cell proteins although not of PLCγ itself.

Inositol phosphates were extracted and analyzed by HPLC using a Partisphere PAC column (12.5 cm) and ammonium phosphate gradient as previously described (10Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive peaks were quantified with a Radiomatic Flo-1β (Series A-100) on-line detector, using Ultima Flo AP scintillant. Counts were internally corrected by monitoring for recovery of the total free inositol in each sample. Incubations and stimulations were as for inositol phosphate studies except that groups of islets were incubated in modified KRB without BSA. Reactions were terminated by immediate removal of the incubation medium and addition of 50 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylflouride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μm pepstatin A, 2 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and transferred to ice. Islets were sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 250 (20 pulses at 10% duty cycle; setting 1) and mixed with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min prior to carrying out SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 500 mA for 2 h and blocked for 1 h in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, containing 1% BSA for 1 h. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC-20 for 1 h and visualized directly by enhanced chemiluminescence. Islet extracts were prepared from 50 islets by addition of 100 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min prior to carrying out SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 500 mA for 2 h and blocked for 1 h in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, containing 5% milk powder. The membranes were then incubated for 2 h with an anti-PLC antibody before incubating for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detection of immunoreactive proteins using the enhanced chemiluminescence system. In the following experiments breakdown of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 were assessed as increases in Ins(1)P1and Ins(4)P1 levels, respectively. This approach has been previously verified on the basis of time course and inhibitor studies, as well as flux measurements (9Biden T.J. Prugue M.L. Davison A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Changes in steady-state levels of these inositol phosphates at 1 min post-stimulation, as performed here, are not as pronounced as in end point accumulation assays, such as following prolonged stimulation in the presence of LiCl to inhibit inositol phosphate breakdown (30Gasa R. Trinh K.Y., Yu, K. Wilkie T.M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For technical reasons, however, the rationale underlying measurement of PtdIns hydrolysis as an increase in Ins(1)P1 does not necessarily hold at longer time points nor in the presence of LiCl, which precluded use of these alternative protocols (9Biden T.J. Prugue M.L. Davison A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As a first means of addressing whether different PLCs might be involved in mediating hydrolysis of PtdIns and PtdInsP2, we made use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, which has been widely demonstrated to inhibit activation of PLCγ (16Gusovsky F. Leuders J.E. Kohn E.C. Felder C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7768-7772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10935-10939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, genistein reduced carbachol-stimulated PtdIns hydrolysis in a dose-dependent manner, with 70% inhibition occurring at 100 μm genistein. Most importantly this inhibition was significantly greater than that seen with an equivalent dose of daidzein, a genistein analogue that does not affect tyrosine kinase activity. However the effects of genistein and daidzein were identical on PtdInsP2 hydrolysis suggesting that, in contrast to PtdIns hydrolysis, this is not specifically influenced by tyrosine kinase inhibition. Although the results above are suggestive of a selective requirement for tyrosine kinases in the PtdIns response, the high nonspecificity of genistein complicated further analysis. Similar nonspecificity has been seen on other parameters when using a range of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors in islet cells (32Jonas J.-C. Plant T.D. Gilon P. Detimary P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 872-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We therefore turned to the converse approach of using sodium orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor that augments tyrosine phosphorylation of several islet cell proteins (Ref. 33Jonas J.-C. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar and not shown). This potently stimulated PtdIns hydrolysis to ∼75% of the maximal carbachol response (Fig.2). The combination of carbachol plus vanadate exerted no greater effects than those because of carbachol alone. In marked contrast, vanadate alone caused only a very modest increase in PtdInsP2 hydrolysis and actually potentiated the response to carbachol. This is probably explained by the ability of vanadate to stimulate PtdInsP2 hydrolysis in islets secondary to Ca2+ influx (34Zhang A. Gao Z.-Y. Gilon P. Nenquin M. Drews G. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21649-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas we have previously shown that Ca2+ influx is insufficient to promote PtdIns hydrolysis (10Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current experiments therefore suggest that increased tyrosine phosphorylation is sufficient to activate PtdIns hydrolysis that occurs via a mechanism that is non-additive (and thus potentially similar) to that of carbachol. Taken together the findings of the genistein and vanadate experiments implicate tyrosine phosphorylation as a component of the mechanism by which carbachol activates PtdIns hydrolysis. Because there should be no requirement for activation of tyrosine kinases in activation of PLCβ and PLCδ, in contrast to PLCγ (3Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 4Sekiya F. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), our results also suggest that hydrolysis of PtdIns and PtdInsP2 are mediated by different PLCs and that PLCγ is implicated in the PtdIns response. We next analyzed the ability of carbachol to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and other islet cell proteins. Looking first at islet cell lysates, carbachol increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including prominent species at ∼30, 32, 36, 38, 64, and 125 kDa (Fig. 3). These responses were rapid in onset (maximal at 1–2 min) but remained elevated over the 30 min of stimulation. Although these experiments established that carbachol could activate tyrosine kinases, there was no marked increase in phosphorylation in substrates around the 145-kDa region, corresponding to PLCγ. To address this issue directly, PLCγ was immunoprecipitated from lysates of 600 carbachol-treated and untreated islets. Although PLCγ was detectable in the immunoprecipitates, its phosphotyrosine content was extremely low under basal conditions and not increased by prior carbachol stimulation (results not shown). There is now ample evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ itself is not always necessary for its activation. One alternative activation mechanism is via stimulation of PtdIns 3-kinase activity and subsequent generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of PLCγ (23Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessenger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 24Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G.

Chem. 1998; 38: 24314-24321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This mechanism was investigated in experiments examining the effects of well documented, structurally diverse, PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors (35Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3956) Google Scholar) on carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. As shown in Fig.4, 100 nm wortmannin and 50 μm LY294002 inhibited PtdIns hydrolysis by more than 40 and 70%, respectively. Corresponding effects on PtdInsP2hydrolysis were much less pronounced, with wortmannin exerting no significant effect and LY294002 inhibiting by less than 30%. Thus PtdIns hydrolysis exhibits a selective requirement for PtdIns 3-kinase, consistent with a role for that enzyme as an upstream regulator of PLCγ. To examine the involvement of PLCγ more directly we used recombinant adenovirus to overexpress this enzyme in pancreatic islets, as demonstrated in Fig. 5 A. Most importantly this virus caused a 40% increase in carbachol-stimulated PtdIns hydrolysis (Fig. 5 B). In marked contrast it did not affect PtdInsP2 hydrolysis at all. The specificity of these findings were confirmed in control experiments using a PLCβ1 adenovirus previously documented to increase PtdInsP2hydrolysis by ∼50% in pancreatic islets treated for 10 min with carbachol in the presence of LiCl (30Gasa R. Trinh K.Y., Yu, K. Wilkie T.M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of our assay (1-min stimulation, no LiCl) the agonist-stimulated PtdInsP2 response was increased to 119.3 ± 4.7%versus 100 ± 2.3% in carbachol-treated, control virus-infected islets (n = 12, p < 0.005), whereas PtdIns hydrolysis was not significantly affected; 106.5 ± 10.2 versus 100 ± 4.8 (n= 12). Basal responses were not affected by the PLCβ1 virus (not shown). The major finding of the current study is that carbachol-stimulated PtdIns hydrolysis in pancreatic islets is mediated by PLCγ. This conclusion was based partially on the differential sensitivities of the PtdIns and PtdInsP2 responses to genistein, vanadate, wortmannin, and LY294002, which are consistent with the known mechanisms of activation of PLCγ (3Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 4Sekiya F. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This was confirmed directly by the evidence that overexpression of PLCγ1 but not PLCβ1 resulted in a selective increase of agonist-stimulated PtdIns breakdown. Although we have not formally assessed the PLCδ family members in this context, we consider their involvement highly unlikely. As is the case in other cell types (14Banno Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15846-15852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kim Y.-H. Park T.-J. Lee Y.H. Baek K.J. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), PLCδ is known to be activated in β-cells as a direct consequence of a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (36Ishihara H. Wada T. Kizuki N. Asano T. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although this is sufficient to promote PtdInsP2 hydrolysis in pancreatic islets (37Biden T.J. Peter-Riesch B. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3567-3571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have previously shown this was not the case for PtdIns breakdown (10Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current data are also supported by earlier findings that PLCγ efficiently utilizes both PtdInsP2 and PtdIns as substrates in activity assays in vitro, whereas the PLCβ and δ and families show a much higher degree of specificity for PtdInsP2 (20Hwang S.C. Jhon D.-K. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18342-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However our results are the first to demonstrate directly that PLCγ acts on PtdIns in a more physiological setting using intact cells. This might seem surprising, but in practice PtdIns hydrolysis would be difficult to detect unless specifically addressed. There is one earlier study of epidermal growth factor-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in A-431 cells, now known to involve PLCγ, demonstrating a transient rise in inositol trisphosphate but a persistent increase in total inositol monophosphate (38Tilly B.C. Van Paridon P.A. Verlaan I. De Laat S.W. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the latter was interpreted as evidence of PtdIns hydrolysis, it is not clear that this increase actually represented Ins(1)P1 derived from PtdIns. Nevertheless it would now be of interest to re-examine the A-431 cells more closely for direct evidence of PtdIns hydrolysis, using the rigorous analytical criteria we established previously for pancreatic islets (9Biden T.J. Prugue M.L. Davison A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A corollary of our major finding is that PLCγ appeared not to play a role in carbachol-stimulated PtdInsP2 hydrolysis in islet cells. This is consistent with studies demonstrating that PtdInsP2 is targeted in pancreatic islets and β-cell lines by PLCβ1, PLCβ3, and PLCδ1 (30Gasa R. Trinh K.Y., Yu, K. Wilkie T.M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Ishihara H. Wada T. Kizuki N. Asano T. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However it is clearly inconsistent with a host of earlier data from other cell types demonstrating that PLCγ does hydrolyze PtdInsP2 (3Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 4Sekiya F. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The most obvious explanation for this apparent contradiction is tissue differences, especially because the great majority of previous studies were undertaken with transformed cell lines, instead of the terminally differentiated primary tissue used here. An alternative explanation is that under conditions following occupation of GPCRs, where both PLCs are activated, PLCβ might compete more effectively than PLCγ for access to PtdInsP2. On the other hand receptor tyrosine kinases, which would not be expected to couple to PLCβ, could stimulate PtdInsP2 hydrolysis through the activation of PLCγ alone. This proposal would need to be supported by direct evidence but is attractive in that it might help to explain the necessity for PLCγ activation, which is presumably not to stimulate PtdInsP2 hydrolysis, because this would be effectively mediated by PLCβ. Another potential explanation is that the substrate preference of PLCγ might be conditioned by its activation mechanism. For example PtdInsP2 is likely to be sequestered in vivo by binding proteins such as profilin, which have much lower affinities for PtdIns (39Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In principle, therefore, PtdIns should be easier for PLCγ to access than PtdInsP2, and indeed there is some evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ is necessary for displacement of profilin (40Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, our findings would suggest that PLCγ does not need to be tyrosine-phosphorylated to hydrolyze PtdIns, although there was at least a partial requirement for activation of an upstream tyrosine kinase. In addition, PtdIns hydrolysis was dependent on the activation of PtdIns 3-kinase. Although a well documented route for stimulation of PLCγ, this has only been addressed previously in the context of PtdInsP2 hydrolysis (23Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessenger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 24Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.-S. Kim S.-R. Kwon K.-S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 38: 24314-24321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Likewise there is very little information on whether other potential mechanisms for activation of PLCγ, such generation of phosphatidic acid (19Jones G.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20845-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or arachidonic acid (20Hwang S.C. Jhon D.-K. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18342-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), might be also be involved in regulation of PtdIns hydrolysis. Increases in protein phosphotyrosine content in response to carbachol or other GPCRs have not been demonstrated previously using pancreatic islets. In one earlier study (43Konrad R.J. Dean R.M. Young R.A. Billings P.C. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24179-24186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) carbachol increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a single, unidentified protein of 125 kDa in a transformed insulin-secreting cell line, whereas it had been reported previously that 15-min muscarinic stimulation of pancreatic islets was without effect (33Jonas J.-C. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results are clarified and extended by our findings of an early (maximal at 1–2 min) incorporation of phosphate into tyrosine residues of a number of proteins, including one around 125 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation can therefore be added to the other known responses of pancreatic islets to muscarinic receptor occupation. In addition to the hydrolysis of both PtdIns and PtdInsP2 (5Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 70: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Iismaa T.P. Kerr E.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14938-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (8Wollheim C.B. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8314-8319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Na+-dependent membrane depolarization (46Henquin J.-C. Garcia M.-C. Bozem M. Hermans M.P. Nenquin M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and both gating and subsequent inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx (47Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Indeed it is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation might lie upstream of some or other of these events. In conclusion we have mechanistically dissociated the hydrolysis of PtdIns from that of PtdInsP2 in pancreatic β-cells on the basis of requirements for tyrosine phosphorylation, PtdIns 3-kinase, and involvement of different PLC isoforms. The demonstration that PLCγ1 targets PtdIns exclusively, whereas other PLCs acts on PtdInsP2, points to a hitherto unsuspected diversification of signaling pathways downstream of muscarinic receptors. This is apparent from the consideration that although PtdInsP2 breakdown releases the two intracellular messengers Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG, which regulate Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C activation, respectively, the only product of PtdIns hydrolysis possessing known biological function is DAG. Thus different protein kinase cascades of differing Ca2+ dependences could be initiated from the hydrolysis of each phospholipid species. Alternatively, a DAG/protein kinase C readout emanating from PtdIns might lend itself to regulation in a different manner than that of the PtdInsP2 pathway. There is already some evidence for this in that PtdIns hydrolysis seems to predominate over longer stimulation and is therefore perhaps less sensitive to down-regulation than is PtdInsP2 regulation (10Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This might also be consistent with reports of biphasic DAG generation in response to stimulation of a variety of tissues (41Nakashima S. Suganuma A. Matsui A. Nozawa Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 42Tokuwa Y. Takuwa N. Rasmussen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14670-14675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,48Griendling K.K.

In addition, hydrolysis of PtdIns, but not of PtdInsP2, is directly influenced by the prevailing membrane potential (10Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and might therefore serve as a means of integrating signals arising from different external stimuli. Direct experimental support for these proposals will await a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the two processes, especially of the tyrosine kinases and their substrates that control PtdIns hydrolysis. However this would be more conveniently addressed in a model system that is more amenable to molecular intervention and biochemical analysis than are isolated pancreatic islets.

The intrinsic GTPase activity under single turnover conditions varied according to the series: Mn2+ (0.069 min−1) > Mg2+ (0.037 min−1) ∼ no Me2+ (0.034 min−1) > VO2+ (0.014 min−1). The kirromycin-stimulated activity showed a parallel variation. Under multiple turnover conditions (GTP/EF-Tu ratio of 10:1), Mg2+ retarded the rate of hydrolysis in comparison to that in the absence of divalent metal ions, an effect ascribed to kinetics of nucleotide exchange. In the absence of added divalent metal ions, GDP and GTP were bound with equal affinity (K d ∼10−7m). In the presence of added divalent metal ions, GDP affinity increased by up to two orders of magnitude according to the series: no Me2+ < VO2+ < Mn2+ ∼ Mg2+ whereas the binding affinity of GTP increased by one order of magnitude: no Me2+ < Mg2+ < VO2+ < Mn2+. Estimates of equilibrium (dissociation) binding constants for GDP and GTP by EF-Tu on the basis of Scatchard plot analysis, together with thermodynamic data for hydrolysis of triphosphate nucleotides (Phillips, R. C., George, P., and Rutman, R. J. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3330–3342), showed that divalent metal ions stabilize the EF-Tu·Me2+·GDP complex over the protein-free Me2+·GDP complex in solution, with the effect greatest in the presence of Mg2+ by ∼10 kJ/mol. These combined results show that Mg2+ is not a catalytically obligatory cofactor in intrinsic and kirromycin-stimulated GTPase action of EF-Tu in the absence of programmed ribosomes, which highlights the differential role of Mg2+ in EF-Tu function.

In the presence of added divalent metal ions, GDP affinity increased by up to two orders of magnitude according to the series: no Me2+ < VO2+ < Mn2+ ∼ Mg2+ whereas the binding affinity of GTP increased by one order of magnitude: no Me2+ < Mg2+ < VO2+ < Mn2+. Estimates of equilibrium (dissociation) binding constants for GDP and GTP by EF-Tu on the basis of Scatchard plot analysis, together with thermodynamic data for hydrolysis of triphosphate nucleotides (Phillips, R. C., George, P., and Rutman, R. J. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3330–3342), showed that divalent metal ions stabilize the EF-Tu·Me2+·GDP complex over the protein-free Me2+·GDP complex in solution, with the effect greatest in the presence of Mg2+ by ∼10 kJ/mol. These combined results show that Mg2+ is not a catalytically obligatory cofactor in intrinsic and kirromycin-stimulated GTPase action of EF-Tu in the absence of programmed ribosomes, which highlights the differential role of Mg2+ in EF-Tu function. elongation factor Tu elongation factor Ts nucleotide- and magnesium-free EF-Tu designation of a generic divalent metal cation bovine serum albumin The GTPase superfamily of proteins, known more commonly as G-proteins, are ubiquitous in cellular systems and serve as key regulatory molecules catalyzing the hydrolysis of the β,γ-phosphate bond in GTP (1Bourne H.R.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). For most G-proteins this process yields a tightly bound enzyme-product complex requiring the action of a nucleotide exchange factor to kinetically facilitate exchange of the GTP for GDP in the active site. Nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are key to regulating the activity of these enzymes, and both of these steps occur in the presence of the divalent metal ion Mg2+ as the naturally occurring cofactor in the cell. However, in EF-Tu1 function it has not been possible hitherto to establish whether there is a differential role of the divalent metal ion in nucleotide hydrolysis as opposed to nucleotide binding. In all G-proteins defined hitherto by x-ray crystallographic studies, the substrate analog guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)-triphosphate is bound as a complex with Mg2+ in which the divalent metal ion is coordinated to oxygen atoms from the β-phosphate and γ-phosphate groups, and the guanine and divalent metal ion binding sites appear to be tightly coupled (5Berchtold H.

Chem. 1982; 267: 1212-1218Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the dissociation constants for release of protein-bound nucleotide measured in the presence of Mg2+ indicate differential binding affinities for GDP and GTP by at least an order of magnitude. Binding affinities for both nucleotides are often measured kinetically by ligand displacement because G-proteins are less stable when prepared in their nucleotide-free form. Because nucleotide separation is necessary for complete removal of Mg2+ from the protein, the less stable, nucleotide-free form of G-proteins complicates efforts to determine whether the divalent metal ion has differential roles in nucleotide hydrolysis and nucleotide binding. In contrast to the structural instability of elongation factor Tu of mesophiles such as E. coli, the homologous thermostable protein in its nucleotide-free form is less prone to inactivation, and comparison of the kinetics of nucleotide binding shows it to be identical to EF-Tu isolated as the GDP-bound complex from the cytosol (11Zeidler W.

In these studies, however, the question of whether the divalent metal ion is an absolute requirement for GTP hydrolysis has not been addressed. In the present study we report results of kinetic and equilibrium binding studies to compare the influence of divalent metal ions on the intrinsic and kirromycin-stimulated GTPase activity of EF-Tu ofT. thermophilus in the absence of programmed ribosomes. We compared the influence of Mn2+ and VO2+ to that of Mg2+ because they have been employed as paramagnetic probes of Mg2+ function in thermostable EF-Tu (21Banerjee A Chen S Ruetthard H Huang V Jiang F.S Sprinzl M Makinen M.W in Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications.in: Tracey A.S.

Biochem. 1982; 124: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because we have been able to show that EF-Tu when depleted of nucleotide is not associated with protein-bound Mg2+, we have been able to determine not only the influence of different divalent metal ions on the biological activity of EF-Tu without interference from adventitious Mg2+ but also the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Mg2+-free protein. The results lead to the conclusion that Mg2+ is not a catalytically obligatory cofactor in the intrinsic and kirromycin-stimulated GTPase activity in the absence of programmed ribosomes. We also show that the binding of divalent metal ions provides the thermodynamic driving force for stabilization of the EF-Tu·Me2+·GDP complex, the effect being greatest with Mg2+. The differential role of Mg2+ in EF-Tu function is discussed further through analysis of thermodynamic relationships governing the hydrolysis of nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (27George P. Phillips R.C. Rutman R.J. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Phillips R.C. George P. Rutman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3330-3342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the kinetic requirement for a nucleotide-exchange factor in the cell. Guanosine nucleotides and BSA were obtained fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany), [8-3H]GDP and [8-3H]GTP from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [γ-32P]GTP from Hartmann Analytik (Braunschweig, Germany). Vanadyl sulfate hydrate was obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI) and Chelex 100 resin (dry mesh 50–100) was obtained from BioRad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). HEPES was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were of analytical reagent grade. Kirromycin was a gift from Gist-Brocades (Leiden, The Netherlands). EF-Tu was obtained as the EF-Tu·Mg2+·GDP complex from T. thermophilus (17Seidler L. Peter M. Meissner F. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9263-9277Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or from the cell paste of E. coli(JM109) engineered with the tuf1 gene of T. thermophilus (HB8) (29Ahmadian M.R. Kreutzer R. Sprinzl M. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nucleotide- and Mg2+-free EF-Tu (EF-Tuf) was isolated as described by Limmer et al. (16Limmer S. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Grillenbeck N.W. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2970-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), as modified previously (21Banerjee A Chen S Ruetthard H Huang V Jiang F.S Sprinzl M Makinen M.W in Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications.in: Tracey A.S. Crans D.C. ACS Symposium Series. 711. Pergamon Press, Oxford, U. K1998: 104-116Google Scholar). For removal of GDP and Mg2+, EF-Tu was diluted 1:6 into 5 m urea buffered to pH 5.65 with 0.01 m(NH4)2HPO4. The resultant mixture with a protein concentration of ∼1.5 × 10−4m was applied to a 1 × 52 cm column of CM-Sephadex CL-6B (Sigma) and eluted with the same buffer to remove GDP. A second buffer consisting of 0.01 m(NH4)2HPO4 at pH 7.5, 5m urea, and 0.5 m KCl was then applied to elute the protein. Renaturation of the protein was carried out by dialyzing against 0.05 m KCl and 0.15 m NH4Cl or against 0.2 m KCl buffered with 0.05 m HEPES at pH 7.5. An Amicon YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) extensively washed prior to use was employed to concentrate the protein solution. Whereas the original description for chromatography of EF-Tu and removal of Mg2+ includes 0.01 m EDTA in the buffer (16Limmer S. Reiser C.O.A. Schirmer N.K. Grillenbeck N.W. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2970-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we found no difference in the results if EDTA was not present during denaturation and cation exchange chromatography of the protein. Therefore, to compare the influence of metal ions on nucleotide binding and GTPase activity, EDTA was not used during nucleotide removal to avoid the possible influence of low levels of adventitious EDTA. Use of glass containers was also avoided to prevent contamination with trace divalent metal ions. EF-Tufprepared in this manner was stored at −20 °C in the dialysis buffer containing 50% (v/v) glycerol. The Mg2+ content of protein, nucleotide, kirromycin, and of all buffer solutions was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy with a GBC Integra XMP spectrometer (BDC Scientific Equipment, Ltd., Dandenong, Victoria, Australia). The detection limit of this method is 1.0 × 10−4 g Mg2+ per liter or 4.0 × 10−6 moles (g atoms) Mg2+ per liter of solvent. We observed previously that variability in the stoichiometry of nucleotide binding and biphasic character in Scatchard plots (30Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar, 31Scatchard G. Scheinberg I.H. Armstrong S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950; 72: 535-540Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar) are essentially eliminated when BSA is added to the incubation mixture (21Banerjee A Chen S Ruetthard H Huang V Jiang F.S Sprinzl M Makinen M.W in Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications.in: Tracey A.S. Crans D.C. ACS Symposium Series. 711. Pergamon Press, Oxford, U. K1998: 104-116Google Scholar). Because nucleotide binding to BSA alone was not detected under these conditions, we concluded that BSA provided the role of a protectant neutral macromolecule, as is observed in a variety of biochemical assays. 2Proteins are known to rapidly denature when used in dilute solutions and therefore, many enzyme preparations are provided in a mixture with added BSA as a source of neutral protein,e.g., Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) in Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (Nolan, C., ed) pp. 5.1–5.33, Cold Spring, Harbor Laboratory Press, NY. For these reasons, the use of BSA was continued in studies to determine nucleotide binding affinity of EF-Tuf. The dissociation constants and the stoichiometry of GDP and GTP binding to EF-Tuf were determined following the nitrocellulose filter binding method of Araiet al. (9Arai K.I. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Arai K.I. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), as described in previous studies (21Banerjee A Chen S Ruetthard H Huang V Jiang F.S Sprinzl M Makinen M.W in Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications.in: Tracey A.S. Crans D.C. ACS Symposium Series. 711. Pergamon Press, Oxford, U. K1998: 104-116Google Scholar). For binding affinity measurements, all stock solutions of protein, buffer, and nucleotide were treated with Chelex to remove possible trace contaminant divalent metal ions. The reaction mixture (0.0175 ml) containing 0.05 m KCl, 8.8 × 10−9m EF-Tuf, and 1.6 × 10−5 g BSA/ml was buffered to pH 7.5 with 0.05 m HEPES. In the reaction mixture the concentration of guanosine nucleotides varied from 12.5 × 10−9 to 500 × 10−9m with [8-3H]GDP or [8-3H]GTP of specific activity 1.5 × 10−6 Ci/nmol. For nucleotide binding in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, metal ion was added to a final concentration of 0.01m. Variation of the order of addition of Mg2+or Mn2+ with respect to the addition of nucleotide was not observed to influence binding affinity. However, this was not the case for nucleotide binding in the presence of VO2+. To determine nucleotide binding affinity in the presence of VO2+, low concentrations of the metal ion must be used to avoid its precipitation as polymeric VO(OH)2 at neutral pH (32Chasteen N.D. Struct. Bond. (Berlin). 1983; 53: 105-138Crossref Google Scholar). We found the optimal concentration of VO2+ to be ∼1.0 × 10−4m, lower concentrations resulting in greater variability of the results and higher concentrations tending to caused precipitate formation. Because VO2+ may form tight complexes with nucleotides of 1:1 and 1:2 metal/nucleotide stoichiometry (33Mustafi D. Telser J. Makinen M.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6219-6226Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Jiang F.S. Makinen M.W. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1736-1744Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we investigated the influence of the order of addition of reagents to the incubation mixture. For nucleotide binding in the presence of VO2+, it was found that addition of VO2+ had to follow addition of nucleotide to the reaction mixture containing EF-Tuf and BSA to observe reproducibly maximum binding affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry of binding of GDP or GTP. In binding assays with VO2+, BSA dialyzed against 0.05 m KCl containing 0.05 m HEPES at pH 7.5 was presaturated with a 4-fold molar excess of VO2+ to account for the tight binding of this metal ion by BSA (35Albanese N.F. Chasteen N.D. J. Phys. Chem. 1978; 82: 910-914Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also the microcentrifuge tubes were pretreated with VO2+–BSA. Pretreatment of BSA with the other metal ions was not found to be necessary. After addition of the metal ion, the reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature (∼20 °C) according to Arai et al. (9Arai K.I. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Arai K.I. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and aliquots of the reaction mixture for measurements in triplicate were applied to the nitrocellulose membrane (HA 0.54 μm; Millipore Corporation, Belford, MA). The filter was then washed thrice with 1 ml of an ice-cold solution of the reaction buffer containing only 0.05 m KCl and 0.05 m HEPES at pH 7.5. The protein-bound radioactivity retained by the filter was measured after air drying with the aid of a Packard Instruments Minaxβ Tri-Carb 4000 Series Liquid Scintillation Counter (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT 06450). Intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-Tuf was determined by adapting the method of Peteret al. (36Peter M.E. Schirmer N.K. Reiser C.O.A. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2876-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), as previously described (21Banerjee A Chen S Ruetthard H Huang V Jiang F.S Sprinzl M Makinen M.W in Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications.in: Tracey A.S. Crans D.C. ACS Symposium Series. 711. Pergamon Press, Oxford, U. K1998: 104-116Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained either 0.05 m KCl, 0.15 mNH4Cl, and 1.0 × 10−5mEF-Tuf, buffered to pH 7.5 with 0.05 m HEPES or 0.2 m KCl and 1.0 × 10−5mEF-Tuf similarly buffered with HEPES. The latter mixture was used to prevent coordination of the vanadyl ion by the ammonium ion. 3We have confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance experiments that VO2+ is coordinated by NH3 in the presence of NH4Cl under the concentration conditions employed in these studies (A. Banerjee and M. W. Makinen, unpublished observations). In single turnover experiments, GTP was added so that EF-Tuf remained in slight (∼1.05:1.00) excess. For multiple turnover experiments, GTP and divalent metal ion were both added to a final concentration of 1.0 × 10−4m. To determine the kirromycin-stimulated GTPase activity, the reaction mixture additionally contained 5.0 × 10−5mkirromycin. In both single and multiple turnover experiments, the reaction was initiated by addition of [γ-32P]GTP of specific activity 5.0 × 10−7 Ci/nmol. To quench the reaction and to obtain maximum chromatographic resolution, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed with time and added 1:3 (v/v) to ice-cold formic acid. The quenched aliquots were then stored on ice until application for chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose sheets (Machery-Nagel, Dueren, Germany). Electronic autoradiography was carried out as described (21Banerjee A Chen S Ruetthard H Huang V Jiang F.S Sprinzl M Makinen M.W in Vanadium Compounds: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Therapeutic Applications.in: Tracey A.S. Crans D.C. ACS Symposium Series. 711. Pergamon Press, Oxford, U. K1998: 104-116Google Scholar). The data were fitted to a single exponential curve with fixed baseline offset by a nonlinear least-squares method with the aid of the program GRAFIT3.0 (Erithacus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK). In a variety of studies, the influence of divalent metal ions on the intrinsic, kirromycin-stimulated, and physiological GTPase activity of EF-Tu has been examined for EF-Tu of both E. coli (37Ivell R. Sander G. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6852-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 38Wilson Jr., G.E. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2004-2009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thermophilic (19Wittinghofer A. Leberman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 93: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Leupold C.M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1984; 141: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) organisms. Also, the influence of monovalent and divalent metal ions on the intrinsic GTPase activity of p21ras has been compared with that of EF-Tu isolated from E. coli (39Mistou M.Y. Cool R.H. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In these studies, however, the question of whether Mg2+ is a catalytically obligatory cofactor for GTP hydrolysis could not be addressed directly because the purified protein was associated with significant quantities of nucleotide and Mg2+. An important motivation of the investigations reported here was to differentiate the role of Mg2+ in GTP hydrolysis from that in nucleotide binding and to determine whether the divalent metal ion is an absolute requirement for GTPase action. For this reason it was necessary to ensure efficient removal of protein-bound Mg2+. We found that Mg2+ could be consistently removed with high efficiency only under partial denaturation of EF-Tu in 5 murea at pH 5.6 followed by cation exchange chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1, the concentration of Mg2+ bound as the EF-Tu·Mg2+·GDP complex shows a linear dependence on protein concentration. However, the amount of Mg2+ associated with EF-Tuf, when prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was consistently below the detection limit of the atomic emission instrumentation. From Fig. 1 we can conclude that there must be less than 0.026 moles of Mg2+ bound per mole of protein. By similar methods we confirmed that the Mg2+ content of all other solutions, including nucleotides and kirromycin, was also equivalently negligible. Wittinghofer and Leberman (18Wittinghofer A. Leberman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) proposed that Mg2+ is bound to EF-Tu as the Mg2+-nucleotide complex. For this reason we separated Mg2+ from the EF-Tu·Mg2+·GDP complex together with the nucleotide by partial denaturation and cation exchange chromatography. Extensive dialysis of the B. stearothermophilus EF-Tu·Mg2+·GDP complex against nucleotide- and Mg2+-free buffer results in removal of only 55% of the nucleotide (18Wittinghofer A. Leberman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this respect we note that the stoichiometry of protein-bound Mg2+ in Fig. 1 for the EF-Tu·Mg2+·GDP complex is equivalent to about 0.6 moles Mg2+ per mole of EF-Tu despite similar extensive dialysis over a 24 h period. These correlative observations affirm the need to remove nucleotide by denaturation followed by cation exchange chromatography to achieve efficient depletion of protein-bound Mg2+, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whereas the emphasis of our studies was to evaluate whether Mg2+ is a catalytically obligatory cofactor in the intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-Tu, we first summarize results of measurements of nucleotide binding affinity in the absence and presence of divalent metal ions. In this study we compared the influence of the divalent metal ions Mn2+ and VO2+ to that of Mg2+. The former has been employed in studies of EF-Tu of B. stearothermophilus as a paramagnetic substitute for Mg2+ (8Antonsson B. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

This RXR/RAR heterodimer binds to the promoter of retinoic acid target genes and recruits coactivators and corepressors to regulate gene expression.

In the absence of a ligand, several receptors are able to repress basal transcription via functional interactions with the corepressors SMRT1 and N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) (2Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 3Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Ligand binding triggers the release of corepressors and subsequent recruitment of coactivators, which enhance transcription by recruiting chromatin-modifying activities such as histone acetylation and methylation (4Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coactivators directly recruited by liganded receptors include members of the steroid receptor coactivator/p160 family such as SRC-1, transcriptional intermediary factor 2/glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1, and RAC3/activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors/amplified in breast cancer 1 (5Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). These coactivators contain highly conserved α-helical LXXLL motifs, where L is leucine and X is any amino acid (6Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

Previous analyses of these motifs have indicated that motifs i, ii, and iii are critical to ligand-dependent interactions with nuclear receptors. In contrast, motifs iv, v, and vi are important for transcriptional activation likely via direct interaction with CREB-binding protein/p300 (6Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

Our laboratory and others have also uncovered a receptor-specific code of interaction, where different nuclear receptors prefer different LXXLL motifs of the coactivator (9Leo C. Li H. Chen J.D. J.

Further insight into the biochemical basis of these interactions comes from crystal structures of the receptor ligand-binding domain complexed with the LXXLL peptide (13Feng W. Ribeiro R.C.

These studies suggest a ligand-dependent formation of a hydrophobic pocket in the ligand-binding domain consisting of helices 3, 4, 5, and 12. The leucines of the α-helical LXXLL motif make direct contacts with this coactivator pocket, and a single LXXLL peptide interacts with each monomer of the receptor dimer. In addition, a “charge clamp,” consisting of a conserved glutamate in the AF-2 helix (helix 12/H12) and a conserved lysine in helix 3, positions the LXXLL motif into the coactivator pocket of the receptor (15Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the antagonist-bound structure, helix 12 mimics the LXXLL motif and occludes the coactivator site, consistent with the inability of coactivators to bind antagonist-bound receptors (16Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 17Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M.

Recent studies also suggested a similar mechanism of interaction for the corepressors SMRT and N-CoR with unliganded receptors (18Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Both proteins contain LXXLL-like motifs in their respective receptor-interacting domains (ID) (20Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). These motifs share a consensus sequence of LXXI/HIXXXI/L and form α-helices. Mutation of these motifs blocked the interaction with unliganded receptors and abolished transcriptional repression. Furthermore, using mutational analysis and molecular modeling, the corepressor motif seems to contact the receptor at the same surface that accommodates the LXXLL motif of the coactivator (18Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The receptors for retinoic acid (RAR), thyroid hormone (TR), vitamin D3 (VDR), and peroxisome proliferators (PPAR) form heterodimeric complexes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). These RXR heterodimers bind DNA and regulate gene expression. However, the role of each receptor monomer in the context of a receptor dimer in regulating coactivator and corepressor recruitment remains largely unknown. In this study, we have characterized the mechanism of recruitment of the coactivator RAC3 and corepressor SMRT to the RXR/RAR heterodimer. We demonstrate that the multiple LXXLL motifs of RAC3 are differentially required for interactions with RAR and RXR. The coactivator and corepressor binding pockets of RAR overlap extensively. However, differences in contribution from each helix of the pocket are evident. We find that although the coactivator pocket of RXR is essential to coactivator binding and transcriptional activation by the RXR homodimer, this pocket is not sufficient for the RXR/RAR heterodimer. In contrast, the coactivator pocket of RAR is absolutely required and sufficient for the function of the RXR/RAR heterodimer. Consistently, deletion of the AF-2 helix from RXR enhances RAC3 binding to the RXR/RAR heterodimer, whereas deletion of the AF-2 helix from RAR abolishes RAC3 binding and transcriptional activation by the receptor heterodimer. GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Approximately 5 μg of purified GST fusion protein was incubated with 5 μl of 35S-labeled protein with moderate shaking at 4 °C overnight in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The bound protein was washed three times with binding buffer, and the beads were collected by centrifugation. The bound protein was eluted in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by autoradiography. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted by the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequence of the direct-repeat (DR) 5 element is AGCTTAAGAGGTCACCGAAAGGTCACTCGCAT. The sequence of the DR1 element is AGCTTAAGAGGTCAAAGGTCACTCGCAT. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was end-labeled with [32P]dCTP by using the standard Klenow fill-in reaction. The purified probe was incubated with in vitrotranscribed/translated receptors in a binding buffer containing 7.5% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of poly[d(I·C)], and 100 mm KCl. The DNA-protein complex was formed on ice for 1 h and resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, which was subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography. The partial proteolysis assay was conducted as described previously (21Leng X. Blanco J. Tsai S.Y. Ozato K. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type and mutant RXR were transcribed/translated in reticulocyte lysate and incubated with 1 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) for 1 h on ice. After that, trypsin was added to a concentration of 10 μg/ml and incubated for 10, 30, and 50 min. An equal concentration of solvent (80% Ethanol plus 20% Me2SO) was added in control. After digestion, the reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by autoradiography. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated for transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% resin charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum in 12-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected using the standard calcium-phosphate method. Twelve hours after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and re-fed fresh medium containing indicated concentrations of ligand. After 24 h, the cells were harvested for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities as described previously (22Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To determine the LXXLL motif preferences for RAR and RXR, we mutated the two consecutive leucines within each of the three motifs in the RAC3-ID613–752 (Fig.1 A). The mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for their abilities to interact with RAR, RXR, and VDR via a GST pull-down assay (Fig.1 B). Wild-type RAC3-ID pulled down a significant amount of [35S]-RAR in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA). Mutation of the LXXLL motif i reduced this interaction, whereas the mutation of motif ii abolished the binding completely. In contrast, the motif iii mutation had no effect. With RXR, a different pattern was evident. Wild-type RAC3-ID interacted strongly with RXR in the presence of 9-cis-RA. Mutation of the LXXLL motifs i or ii each substantially inhibited this binding, reducing it to near background level, whereas the mutation of motif iii had less effect. In contrast, the LXXLL motif iii mutation significantly affected RAC3 binding to VDR. These data indicate that the LXXLL motif ii is most critical for interaction with RAR, whereas motifs i and ii are equally important for interaction with RXR, contrasting with the motif iii preference for VDR. The above experiments revealed the LXXLL motif preferences for RAR and RXR in solution. To examine this preference in the context of a transcriptionally relevant heterodimer on DNA, we performed gel mobility supershift assays with the RXR/RAR heterodimer at a DR5 element and the RXR homodimer at a DR1 element. The RXR/RAR heterodimer bound the DR5 probe strongly in the presence of atRA (Fig.1 C, lane 1). The addition of GST did not affect the heterodimer, whereas the wild-type RAC3-ID shifted a part of the complex to a slower-migrating form (lane 3). The RAC3-ID with a mutation of LXXLL motif i or iii slightly reduced this interaction. By contrast, the mutation of motif ii abolished the binding completely (lane 5), suggesting that motif ii is most critical to interaction with the RXR/RAR heterodimer on DNA. Similarly, the RXR homodimer bound specifically to the DR1 probe, which was supershifted after the addition of wild-type RAC3-ID in a 9-cis-RA-dependent manner (Fig. 1 D). Consistent with the GST pull-down data, the LXXLL motif i or ii mutation each inhibited RAC3 binding to the RXR homodimer, whereas the motif iii mutation had minimal effects. We next analyzed the contribution of each AF-2 helix of RAR and RXR in recruiting RAC3 to the RXR/RAR heterodimer (Fig. 1 E). Strikingly, when wild-type RAR was heterodimerized with the AF-2 helix-deleted mutant RXR443, this complex interacted with RAC3 much more strongly than did the wild-type heterodimer in the presence of atRA (Fig. 1, compare C, lane 3 withE, lane 2; also see Fig. 3 D,lanes 2 and 4). This suggests that the AF-2 helix of RXR may inhibit the binding of RAC3 to the RXR/RAR heterodimer on DNA. In contrast, when the AF-2 helix-deleted mutant RAR403 was heterodimerized with wild-type RXR, the interaction with RAC3 was completely inhibited (Fig. 1 E, lanes 3–4), suggesting that the AF-2 helix of RAR is absolutely required for interaction with RAC3. The wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed at approximately equal levels as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig.1 F). Also, the mutant receptors can form heterodimers with the partnering receptor and bind DNA efficiently (8Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), suggesting that there were about equal amounts of active protein in each preparation. In addition, the enhancing effect of RXR AF-2 helix deletion on binding of RAC3 to the RXR/RAR heterodimer was also observed with the RARα-selective agonist (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl] benzoic acid (TTNPB), confirming that the inhibition by the RXR AF-2 helix occurs in the absence of ligand binding to RXR. We then used the above stable complex to re-examine the LXXLL motif requirement for RAC3 binding to the RXR/RAR heterodimer (Fig. 1 E, lanes 5–8). Consistently, mutation of motif i reduced RAC3 interaction, whereas mutation of motif ii abolished the binding completely. In contrast, mutation of motif iii had no effect. These results strongly suggest that motif ii is most critical to RAC3 interaction with the RXR/RAR heterodimer, with motif i also contributing but to a lesser extent. A coactivator-binding pocket, consisting of residues from helices 3, 4, 5, and 12, that accommodates the LXXLL motif of coactivators has been identified (13Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H.

Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we decided to characterize the coactivator-binding pockets of RAR and RXR, by creating site-directed mutations, and determine the relative contribution of each coactivator-binding pocket of the RXR/RAR heterodimer to the recruitment of RAC3. We aligned several receptor sequences and identified conserved residues that form direct contacts with the LXXLL motif in the crystal structures of estrogen receptor α, TRβ, and PPARγ (Fig.2 A). These residues were mutated in the context of full-length RARα and RXRα. These mutations are homologous to those made in the TRβ, which retained their ability to bind hormone (13Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Each RAR mutant was expressedin vitro (Fig. 2 B) and tested for interactions with RAC3 in a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 2 C). As expected, GST-RAC3-ID pulled down a significant amount of wild-type RAR in the presence of atRA, compared with only minimal binding to GST alone. However, mutation of any of the conserved pocket residues drastically reduced this interaction. In particular, the V240R, L261R, and E412K mutations each abolished RAC3 binding completely, whereas F249R retained slight interaction with RAC3. Therefore, these residues in the coactivator-binding pocket of RAR are critical for RAC3 binding, suggesting that the coactivator pocket is conserved among different nuclear receptors and for interactions with different SRC coactivators. Similarly, we analyzed the conserved residues in the coactivator pocket of RXRα for their contributions to RAC3 binding. The leucine 276/valine 280 from helix 3 (m1) and valine 298/leucine 301 from helix 5 (m2) were mutated to alanines. A partial proteolysis assay indicated that both mutants still bind to 9-cis-RA efficiently (data not shown). The wild type and mutants were expressed at approximately equal levels in the in vitro translation reaction (Fig.2 D), and the 35S-labeled receptors were tested for interactions with RAC3 in the presence of 9-cis-RA (Fig.2 E). The RAC3-ID interacted specifically with wild-type RXRα as expected. Interestingly, both mutations affected RAC3 binding significantly, with the m1 mutation abolishing the interaction completely and the m2 mutation retaining barely detectable binding. Therefore, we have also identified and disrupted residues in the RXR coactivator pocket that are critical to RAC3 binding. To determine the relative contribution of each of the two coactivator-binding pockets of the RXR/RAR heterodimer to the interaction with RAC3, we conducted a gel mobility shift assay with coactivator pocket-mutated receptors. Consistent with the above experiment, the wild-type RXR/RAR heterodimer bound to the DR5 element was significantly shifted by the wild-type RAC3-ID in the presence of atRA (Fig. 3 A,lane). Interestingly, each of the four coactivator pocket mutations in RARα eliminated the RAC3-dependent supershift despite the presence of an intact coactivator pocket in RXRα (lanes 3–10). It seemed that the F249R mutant retained weak binding to RAC3-ID. We found that the addition of 9-cis-RA to the reactions had no effect on the binding (data not shown), suggesting that the RXR coactivator pocket alone is not sufficient to recruit RAC3 to the RXR/RAR heterodimer in the absence of a functional RAR coactivator pocket. To further investigate the role of the RXR coactivator pocket in the recruitment of RAC3, the effect of each of the two RXR coactivator pocket mutations on binding of RAC3 to the RXR homodimer on DNA was tested (Fig. 3 B). As demonstrated above, the wild-type RXR homodimer strongly bound the DR1 probe, and this complex was shifted by RAC3-ID in the presence of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 3 B,lanes 1 and 2). The RXR coactivator pocket mutants retained the ability to form homodimers and bind DNA, suggesting that these mutations did not disrupt the structure of the receptor. However, we found that the m1 mutation had a weaker DNA binding activity, and the m2 mutation seemed to have an enhanced DNA binding (lanes 3–6). Nonetheless, both RXR mutants showed no evidence of binding RAC3-ID (lanes 4 and 6), indicating that the coactivator pocket of RXR is required for the recruitment of RAC3 to the RXR homodimer on DNA. From the above experiments, it is evident that the RAR coactivator pocket is absolutely required for recruiting RAC3 to the RXR/RAR heterodimer and that the RXR coactivator pocket is required for recruiting RAC3 to the RXR homodimer. However, it is not clear whether the RXR coactivator pocket contributes to RAC3 binding to the RXR/RAR heterodimer. Therefore, we compared the ability of RAC3 to bind the wild-type RXR/RAR heterodimer versus heterodimers in which the coactivator pocket of RXR or RAR was mutated (Fig.3 C). Intriguingly, when wild-type RAR was dimerized with the mutant RXR, RAC3-ID was still capable of binding the complex significantly (lanes 5–8), contrasting to the lack of binding to the complex containing mutant RAR and wild-type RXR. This interaction was abolished when the RAR coactivator site was also mutated (lanes 9 and 10). These data suggest that the RAR coactivator pocket is the primary binding site to RAC3, whereas the RXR coactivator pocket is less critical. To confirm the above observations, we repeated the experiment using RXR443, which dramatically enhances the interaction of the RXR/RAR heterodimer with RAC3-ID (Fig. 3 D). When RXR443 harboring the m2 mutation was dimerized with RAR, a much more enhanced interaction with the RAC3-ID was still evident (lanes 5 and6). In fact, nearly the entire RXR443/RAR complex was again shifted by RAC3-ID. A similar result was obtained with the RXR443-m1 double mutant (data not shown). These results suggest that the RXR coactivator pocket plays a minor role in recruiting RAC3 to the RXR/RAR heterodimer, in contrast to the essential role of the RAR coactivator pocket. To assess the functional significance of mutating the coactivator pockets of RAR and RXR in vivo, we performed reporter gene assays to investigate the transcriptional activity of these coactivator pocket mutants. First, HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant RAR along with a luciferase reporter containing DR5 response elements (Fig.4 A). In the absence of ligand, the wild-type and mutant RAR had little effect on reporter expression, except the wild-type RAR and E412K had a slight repressive activity. In the presence of atRA, the reporter alone was stimulated about 2-fold, whereas transfection of wild-type RAR strongly stimulated the reporter expression about 10-fold. In contrast, all four RAR mutants failed to enhance reporter expression above the endogenous level. These observations correlate well with the above in vitro data in implicating a critical role of the RAR coactivator pocket in mediating transcriptional activation from responsive promoters. We next sought to investigate the role of the RXR coactivator pocket in supporting transcriptional activation by the RXR homodimer or RXR/RAR heterodimer in vivo. HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type or coactivator pocket-mutated RXR and a luciferase reporter driven by a DR1-containing promoter (Fig. 4 B). The wild-type RXR displayed strong 9-cis-RA-dependent transcriptional activation on the DR1 promoter as expected. In contrast, the RXR m1 and m2 mutants were significantly impaired in their abilities to activate reporter gene expression. We noted that the m2 mutant retained some weak ligand-dependent activity; however, this may correlate with its residual binding to RAC3 in vitro (Fig. 2 E) and/or enhanced homodimerization and DNA binding ability (Fig. 3 B). Overall, these data suggest that the coactivator pocket of RXR is critical to transcriptional activation by the RXR homodimer, correlating to the binding of RAC3in vitro. The above data suggest a requirement of the RXR coactivator pocket for RAC3 binding and transcriptional activation by the RXR homodimer. However, our data also suggest that the RXR coactivator pocket is not as important in recruiting RAC3 to the RXR/RAR heterodimer as the RAR pocket or as the recruitment of RAC3 to the RXR homodimer. To investigate the functional significance of this differential requirement of the RXR coactivator pocket in different dimer configurations, we analyzed the effects of the RXR coactivator pocket mutations on transcriptional activation of the RXR/RAR heterodimer from a DR5-driven promoter (Fig. 4 C). Coexpression of wild-type RXR and RAR enhanced reporter expression above the expression of RAR alone. Strikingly, both RXR coactivator pocket mutants were capable still of sustaining transcriptional activation from the DR5 promoter, in contrast to their severely impaired function at the DR1 promoter. Similarly, coexpression of RXR443 with RAR was also capable of sustaining transcriptional activation by RXR/RAR and coactivation by RAC3 (Fig. 4 D). In fact, RXR443 slightly enhanced RAC3-mediated transcriptional coactivation (1.5-fold). Although, this effect is not as dramatic as the enhancement of binding to RAC3in vitro, we have found that RXR443 also enhances recruitment of the SMRT corepressor to the RXR/RAR heterodimer. 2C. Leo, X. Yang and J. D. Chen unpublished data. Furthermore, it has also been shown that RXR443 decreases ligand-dependent dissociation of SMRT (23Lin R.J. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of RXR443 to support transcriptional activation in vivo may be compromised by enhanced corepressor association. These data suggest that the RXR coactivator pocket is critical to the activity of the RXR homodimer but is less important to the RXR/RAR heterodimer. Several recent studies have determined that SMRT and N-CoR contain LXXLL-like motifs that are required for interaction with unliganded TR and RAR (18Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to determine whether the same residues within the RAR coactivator pocket that were required for RAC3 binding were also critical to binding of the corepressor SMRT (Fig.5 A). As expected, GST-SMRT-ID pulled down significant amounts of wild-type RAR in the absence of hormone. Interestingly, the V240R, F249R, and L261R mutations each inhibited the interaction substantially, with F249R and L261R more or less abolishing the binding; V240R had a more modest effect. In contrast, the E412K mutation in helix 12 did not alter the SMRT-RAR interaction, with was opposite of the strong effect on the RAC3-RAR interaction. These results suggest that the RAR coactivator pocket overlaps with a proposed corepressor pocket. However, distinct contributions of individual residues do exist, because V240R had a more modest effect on SMRT binding relative to RAC3 binding, whereas F249R displayed an opposite effect. We then analyzed the recruitment of SMRT to the RXR/RAR heterodimer bound to DNA (Fig. 5 B). As expected, the wild-type heterodimer was significantly shifted to a slower-migrating form by the SMRT-ID (lane 2). Intriguingly, when RAR harboring the V240R, F249R, or L261R point mutations were substituted for the wild-type receptor, recruitment of SMRT was abolished (lanes 3–8). On the other hand, the E412K mutation did not affect SMRT binding (lane 10), which was consistent with the above GST pull-down data. Overall, these data suggest that corepressors bind to a surface of RAR that overlaps with the coactivator-binding site. Finally, we assessed the functional consequences of the RAR corepressor-binding mutations on transcriptional repression by the receptor. We introduced these mutations into the context of RAR403 because RAR403 can strongly repress basal transcription (3Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar), allowing sensitive assay for repression activity. The E412K mutation was not included because it is not contained within RAR403. These mutant receptors were tested for transcriptional repression by transient transfection in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 C). Co-transfection of RAR403 with the DR5-driven reporter resulted in significant repression of basal activity in the absence of hormone, relative to empty vector. However, the expression of RAR403 V240R, F249R, or L261R each abolished this repression activity. These results demonstrate that the corepressor-binding residues are also critical for transcriptional repression by unliganded RAR. We have investigated the mechanisms by which the coactivator RAC3 and corepressor SMRT are recruited by retinoid receptors and how these interactions correlate with transcriptional activities of the receptors. We find that RAC3 preferentially utilizes the LXXLL motifs i and ii to bind RXR and RAR, with highest affinity of motif ii with RAR. We identify specific residues within the coactivator-binding pockets of RAR and RXR that are required for coactivator and corepressor bindings. We demonstrate that mutation of these coactivator pocket residues disrupts recruitment of RAC3 and transcriptional activities of the receptors. Interestingly, we also find that the integrity of the RXR coactivator pocket is not sufficient for the RXR/RAR heterodimer to recruit RAC3 and activate transcription, whereas this RXR pocket is absolutely required for the function of the RXR homodimer. Consistently, deletion of the AF-2 helix from RXR enhances rather than inhibits coactivator binding to the RXR/RAR heterodimer. Additionally, we demonstrate that several coactivator-binding residues in RAR are also involved in the binding of corepressor and regulation of transcriptional repression. The coactivator RAC3 contains three separate LXXLL motifs within its receptor-interacting domain. Based on previous studies of the crystal structure of liganded receptor with LXXLL peptide (15Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), it is likely that each receptor binds one LXXLL motif. Therefore, a receptor dimer may selectively utilize two LXXLL motifs to recruit a coactivator. Accordingly, we find that the RAC3 LXXLL motif ii and motif i, to a lesser degree, are both important for interactions with RAR in solution or as part of the DNA-bound RXR/RAR heterodimer. In contrast, motifs i and ii are equally important to interactions with RXR in solution or when homodimerized and bound to DNA. Therefore, in the RXR/RAR heterodimer, motif ii may bind to RAR first. The subsequent interaction with RXR may be mediated by motif i. In the case of the RXR/VDR heterodimer, motif iii may bind to VDR first, followed by a secondary interaction between RXR and motif ii (9Leo C. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5976-5982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the existence of three LXXLL motifs in RAC3-ID likely provides the coactivator with flexibility to adapt to different structural conformations that each receptor dimer assumes. Recent crystallographic evidence has detailed the formation of a hydrophobic pocket induced by ligand binding to the receptor that serves as the docking surface for the LXXLL motif of coactivators (14Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 15Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 16Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). This pocket consists of helices 3, 4, 5, and 12 of the ligand-binding domain including a charge clamp formed by a conserved glutamate from helix 12 and a lysine from helix 3, which together precisely position the LXXLL motif within the pocket. Based on the interactions observed in the crystal structures of estrogen receptor α, TRβ, and PPARγ complexed with LXXLL peptides, highly conserved amino acids from RAR and RXR were selected for analysis in this study. We find that the mutation of valine 240, phenylalanine 249, or lysine 261, from helices 3, 4, and 5, respectively, each strikingly inhibits RAR interactions with RAC3in vitro and transcriptional activation by the receptorin vivo. Mutation of the charge clamp glutamate, glutamate 412, shows the same effect. These mutations also abolish recruitment of RAC3 to a DNA-bound RXR/RAR heterodimer despite the presence of an intact coactivator-binding site in RXR. While it remains to be demonstrated, these single point mutations are unlikely to affect the overall structure of the receptor because they retain intact DNA-binding and RXR heterodimerization activities. These data suggest that an intact coactivator pocket is essential to RAR interactions with RAC3 and that coactivator interaction is required for the transcriptional activation function of RAR. We also have investigated the ability of RXR, the common heterodimeric partner for nonsteroid receptors, to interact with RAC3 because it is not known what role RXR plays in recruiting coactivators to the RXR/RAR heterodimer on DNA. Although heterodimerization with RXR is essential for DNA binding, RXR has long been considered as a transcriptionally silent partner for partnering receptors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar, 24Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M.

Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the RXR-specific ligand SR11237, when in combination with the RAR antagonist BMS453, can induce differentiation of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemic cells and transcriptional activation (26Chen J.Y. Clifford J. Zusi C. Starrett J. Tortolani D. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Nature. 1996; 382: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated further that the RXR-specific ligand LG268 can synergize with a low dose concentration of RAR-specific ligand TTNPB on recruiting the coactivator SRC-1 (27Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), suggesting that RXR may play a role in coactivator recruitment and transcriptional activation of the RXR/RAR heterodimer. We find that RXR was able to bind RAC3 in solution, and mutation of specific coactivator-pocket residues inhibits this interaction. Intriguingly, however, the RXR pocket contributes differently to coactivator recruitment to DNA-bound nuclear receptors depending on the particular dimer examined. In the case of the RXR/RXR homodimer bound to a DR1 element, the RXR pocket is required to recruit RAC3. This is likely caused by the loss of both pockets in the RXR homodimer. Consistently, mutation of this pocket drastically reduces the ability of RXR to activate transcription in vivo from a DR1-driven reporter. A different pattern is evident upon examining the RXR/RAR heterodimer. Here, the RXR coactivator pocket is not sufficient to recruit RAC3 to a DR5 element, whereas the RAR pocket is absolutely required and seems sufficient under these conditions. In support of these in vitro data, the RXR mutants have only modest effects on RXR/RAR transcriptional activity at a DR5-driven reporterin vivo, in contrast to the strong effect on the RXR homodimer. Our data suggest that RAR may act as a primary docking point for coactivator binding to RXR/RAR heterodimer, whereas RXR may play a secondary role in the recruitment of coactivator. The finding that the AF-2 helix of RXR can interfere with RAC3 binding to a DNA-bound RXR/RAR heterodimer is intriguing and consistent with our previous studies with RXR/VDR (9Leo C. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5976-5982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This inhibition may be the result of competition between the AF-2 helix of RXR and the LXXLL motif for the coactivator-binding pocket on the partnering receptor; Westin et al. (27Westin S. Kurokawa R. Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Milburn M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 395: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) showed previously that deletion of the RXR AF-2 helix slightly enhanced SRC-1 binding to RAR/RXR. Consistently, in the crystal structure of the RXR tetramer, the AF-2 helix of one RXR monomer occupies the coactivator-binding site of the adjacent monomer of the symmetric dimer (28Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We find that this enhancement is dramatic in the gel shift assay. Therefore, coactivators may have to compete with the RXR AF-2 helix for the coactivator site of the partnering receptor. Together, these studies suggest that coactivators, corepressors, and the RXR AF-2 helix all might interact with a similar surface with ligand-inducing conformational changes that serve to dissociate the corepressor and recruit coactivator. The function of the RXR AF-2 helix may serve to adjust the overall loading of coactivators and corepressors to the receptor complex bound to promoter, adding an additional layer of controls to regulate precise levels of target gene expression. Additionally, we have characterized the involvement of the RAR coactivator pocket in the binding of corepressor SMRT. Interestingly, the V240R, F249R, and L261R mutations that affect coactivator binding also significantly affect corepressor binding. Importantly, these mutations also disrupt the transcriptional repression activity of RAR8. Thus, corepressor recruitment correlates well with transcriptional repression by RAR. Furthermore, it seems that structural differences exist between the coactivator- and corepressor-binding surfaces. In addition to the opposite contributions from the AF-2 helix, the F249R mutation retained residual binding to RAC3, but disrupts SMRT binding completely. On the other hand, the V240R mutation disrupts RAC3 binding completely but retained detectable binding to SMRT. These data are consistent with recent studies suggesting that corepressors interact with unliganded nuclear receptors via a similar hydrophobic pocket on the receptor as coactivators (18Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Love J.D. Li C. Banayo E. Gooch J.T. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3209-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). However, unlike coactivators, the charge clamp and AF-2 helix are not involved in the binding of corepressors, because mutation of glutamate 412 from the AF-2 helix has no effect on the RAR-SMRT interaction, but it disrupts RAR-RAC3 interaction completely. The differences between the relative roles of each residue in coactivator versus corepressor binding may also be involved in the mechanism by which the receptor discriminates between these cofactors. In summary, our data suggest that each receptor in a receptor heterodimer is differentially required in the recruitment of coactivators and corepressors. The recruitment of coactivators and corepressors by the RXR/RAR heterodimer involves a complex series of interactions that in turn regulates the transcriptional activity of the receptor to control gene expression. Multiple RAC3 LXXLL motifs mediate the binding of coactivator to the liganded receptor, with different receptors preferring different motifs for interaction. Both coactivators and corepressors interact with a similar hydrophobic pocket of the ligand-binding domain, and the AF-2 helix of RXR seems to be an important regulatory motif in mediating cofactor recruitment. Overall, this study provides several new insights to the understanding of the mechanism by which individual coactivator pockets are utilized in a nuclear receptor dimer to recruit coactivators and corepressors.

In the studies described here, the effect of serum on the expression of the α subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2Rα) was examined. We found that serum was required for maximal and sustained IL-2Rα protein expression and consequent IL-2 signaling in TCR-activated splenocytes. Serum had no effect on IL-2Rα mRNA levels and thus modulates IL-2Rα expression post-transcriptionally. Unlike wild-type splenocytes, splenocytes exhibiting serum-independent cdk2 activation due to loss of p27Kip1 efficiently expressed IL-2Rα in serum-deficient medium. Conversely, serum did not promote IL-2Rα accumulation in conditions in which cdk2 activity was blocked. These findings demonstrate that cdk2 activation is necessary and sufficient for IL-2Rα accumulation in TCR-stimulated splenocytes. On the other hand, IL-2 signaling was required (at least in part) for cdk2 activation in these cells. Thus, cdk2 activation, IL-2Rα expression, and IL-2 signaling are interdependent events, and we suggest that this feed-forward regulatory loop plays a key role in T cell mitogenesis.

Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A key player in this program is interleukin-2 (IL-2), a lymphokine first identified in supernatants of antigen-primed T cells (2Gillis S. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 146: 468-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Gillis S. Smith K.A. Nature. 1977; 268: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar, 4Morgan D.A. Ruscetti F.W. Gallo R. Science. 1976; 193: 1007-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The receptor for IL-2 (IL-2R) is noncatalytic and consists of three subunits termed IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-R2γ (also known as γc) (5Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ are also components of other lymphokine receptors, whereas IL-2Rα is unique to the IL-2R and thus is responsible for substrate specificity. IL-2Rα is also required for high affinity (and presumably biologically relevant) IL-2 binding. In vitro, IL-2Rs lacking IL-2Rα are functional in human T cells (albeit at a lower affinity than trimeric receptors) but not in mouse T cells (6Chastagner P. Moreau J.L. Jacques Y. Tanaka T.

Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IL-2Rα has an extremely short cytoplasmic domain and does not participate in intracellular signaling per se. Instead, signaling is mediated by IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, which interact with a variety of cytoplasmic effector proteins (11Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 147-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include the Janus kinases (JAKs), Jak1 and Jak3, which associate constitutively with IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, respectively. When activated by ligand-induced receptor oligomerization, JAKs phosphorylate IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ on specific tyrosine residues to create docking sites for other effectors. Additional JAK substrates include the JAKs themselves and members of the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) family of transcriptional regulators. Of the three IL-2R subunits, IL-2Rα exhibits the most variable expression. IL-2Rα is not present in resting T cells and is transcriptionally up-regulated by TCR agonists (12Leonard W.J. Kronke M. Peffer N.J. Depper J.M. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6281-6285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Such agonists include cognate antigen, anti-CD3, and concanavalin A (ConA). IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, on the other hand, are expressed constitutively, and TCR-induced changes in their expression are less dramatic (5Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TCR activation increases IL-2 production (13Meuer S.C. Hussey R.E. Cantrell D.A. Hodgdon J.C. Schlossman S.F. Smith K.A. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1509-1513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IL-2 signaling further up-regulates IL-2Rα expression in a STAT-dependent manner (14Bismuth G. Moreau J.L. Somme G.

As a further prelude to IL-2 actions, TCR stimulation induces a variety of metabolic responses that allow quiescent T cells to exit G0 (11Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 61: 147-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 then promotes continued G0/G1 traverse and the initiation of DNA synthesis. T cell proliferation is also influenced by co-stimulatory signals delivered by CD28 (17Linsley P.S. Brady W. Grosmaire L. Aruffo A. Damle N.K. Ledbetter J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) and by mitogens contained in serum, which is indispensable for T cell propagation in vitro (18Herzberg V.L. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of co-stimulatory signals to up-regulate IL-2Rα transcription has been reported (19Cerdan C. Martin Y. Courcoul M. Brailly H. Mawas C. Birg F. Olive D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2255-2261PubMed Google Scholar). As in all cell types, T cell proliferation is governed by the ordered activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar). CDK activity is controlled by cyclins, which are positive regulators, and CDK inhibitors, which repress activity. Cyclins, which are expressed periodically, combine with CDKs to form active complexes at distinct points in the cell cycle. During G0/G1, for example, complexes containing the D cyclins and cdk4 or cdk6, cyclin E and cdk2, and cyclin A and cdk2 are sequentially assembled and activated. Activation of these complexes is required for G0/G1 traverse and S phase entry, and key substrates include the Rb family of transcriptional repressors. The CDK inhibitor family includes the Cip/Kip proteins, which inactivate complexes containing cdk2 and, according to some reports, cdk4 and cdk6 (21Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

Of these inhibitors, p27Kip1 is thought to play a particularly important role in T cell proliferation. p27Kip1 is present at high levels in resting T cells and is down-regulated in response to mitogenic stimulation (24Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 25Kwon T.K. Buchholz M.A. Ponsalle P. Chrest F.J. Nordin A.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5642-5648PubMed Google Scholar). Failure to reduce p27Kip1 levels below a critical threshold precludes cdk2 activation and arrests T cells in G0/G1. Moreover, T cells lacking p27Kip1 exhibit dysregulated cdk2 activation and proliferate in conditions that do not support the growth of wild-type cells (Ref. 26Coats S. Whyte P. Fero M.L. Lacy S.

Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). Previous studies have shown that IL-2 elicits and is required for efficient p27Kip1 down-regulation in primary T cells and T lymphoblasts (24Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 25Kwon T.K. Buchholz M.A. Ponsalle P. Chrest F.J. Nordin A.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5642-5648PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that serum acts with TCR agonists to maximally and persistently reduce p27Kip1levels and, consequently, to activate cdk2 in naive T cells (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Given the pivotal role of IL-2 in T cell mitogenesis, a full understanding of the mechanisms regulating the expression of IL-2 and IL-2R is imperative. IL-2R density is a critical determinant of T cell proliferation (27Cantrell D.A. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1895-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that IL-2R density is dictated by serum concentration (18Herzberg V.L. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar). As monitored by IL-2 binding assays, serum (at 10%) significantly increased the expression of surface-localized IL-2Rs in antigen-treated human T cells (18Herzberg V.L. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Building on this observation, data presented here demonstrate that serum selectively facilitates the post-transcriptional expression of IL-2Rα in primary splenic T cells exposed to TCR agonists. Serum-mediated IL-2Rα accumulation was accompanied by the induction of IL-2 signaling pathways and was dependent on cdk2 activation. Because cdk2 activity both contributed to and resulted from IL-2 signaling, we suggest that these events are interdependent. We propose a model of T cell proliferation in which serum-dependent p27Kip1 down-regulation initiates a feed-forward loop consisting of cdk2 activation, IL-2Rα accumulation, and IL-2R signaling. A single cell suspension of splenocytes was prepared by passage through nylon mesh, and red cells were depleted using a whole blood erythrocyte lysing kit (R&D Systems). For purification, spleen cell suspensions were loaded onto T cell-enrichment columns (R&D Systems), and T cells were isolated by high affinity negative selection as specified by the manufacturer. Splenic and purified T cells were plated at 107 cells/ml and 5 × 106 cells/ml, respectively, in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum. p27–47 fibroblasts were prepared and maintained as described previously (28Zhang X. Wharton W. Donovan M. Coppola D. Croxton R. Cress W.D. Pledger W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The percentage of S phase cells in a population was determined by FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells as detailed previously (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described previously (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For ELISA assays, flat bottom 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 6 μg/ml IL-2Rα monoclonal antibody (PC61, PharMingen) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Coated plates were treated consecutively as follows: serial dilutions of cell lysates, 1 h at 37 °C; 1 μg/ml biotin-conjugated IL-2Rα monoclonal antibody (7D4, PharMingen), 1 h at 4 °C; streptavidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (PharMingen), 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were developed for 30 min with 100 μl/well 3·5′-5·5′ tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Dako) and stopped with 0.5n H2SO4. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on a Titertek ELISA reader. This protocol is a modified version of Osawa et al. (29Osawa H. Josimovic-Alasevic O. Diamantstein T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 92: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For analysis of cell surface markers, T cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% mouse IgG (Dako) and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies (PharMingen) for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C. Corresponding isotype-specific conjugated antibody was used for detection of nonspecific binding. Analysis was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer with Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Total mRNA was isolated using TRIzol, and Northern blots were performed as described previously (30Agrawal D. Hauser P. McPherson F. Dong F. Garcia A. Pledger W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4327-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For RNase protection assays, mRNA (20 μg) was hybridized overnight at 56 °C with 32P-labeled probes (105 cpm) corresponding to the mCR-1 probe set (PharMingen). Samples were then digested with RNase T1 and RNase A for 45 min at 30° C and proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, collected by sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation, denatured at 90 °C for 3 min, and electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Cell extracts were incubated with antibody to cyclin E or cyclin A for 4–12 h at 4 °C and subsequently with protein A-agarose beads. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and once with histone kinase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Washed complexes were incubated in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 0.1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μg/ml histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were separated on SDS gels. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. ConA was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., and anti-CD3, recombinant IL-2, and IL-2Rα blocking antibody were obtained from PharMingen. Antibodies to IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, IL-2Rγ, Jak1, and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. p27Kip1 and cdk2 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, and Jak3 antibody and cyclin A antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology and Neomarker, respectively. p27Kip1-deficient mice were provided by A. Koff. Although the serum dependence of IL-2R expression has been described previously (18Herzberg V.L. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar), the receptor component(s) targeted by serum has yet to be identified. To address this issue, purified splenic T cells derived from Balb/c mice were stimulated for 30 h with mitogenic concentrations of anti-CD3 and either 10% or 0.1% serum, and the cell surface expression of IL-2Rα and IL-2Rγ was determined by FACS analysis. These serum concentrations were chosen because they allow maximal (10% serum) and minimal (0.1% serum) amounts of DNA synthesis in anti-CD3-treated T cell cultures (Fig. 1 A,top panel, and accompanying article (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). As shown in Fig.1 B, resting T cells contained little if any surface-localized IL-2Rα, and a higher percentage of cells expressed this protein when stimulated with anti-CD3 and 10% as compared with 0.1% serum (76% versus 33%, respectively). Moreover, there were significantly more receptors per cell in the population receiving 10% serum as compared with 0.1% serum (Fig. 1 C). On the other hand, one-third of the cells in the quiescent population were IL-2Rγ-positive, and anti-CD3 increased this percentage ∼2-fold irrespective of serum concentration (Fig. 1 B). These data show that serum regulates the overall expression and/or the cell surface localization of IL-2Rα, but not of IL-2Rγ, in TCR-stimulated T cells. Levels of IL-2Rβ detected by this assay were too low to be accurately quantitated. To ensure that T cells remained viable when stimulated in serum-deficient medium, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were performed. When examined 40 h after stimulation, T cells treated with anti-CD3 and 0.1% serum were only slightly less viable than those receiving anti-CD3 and 10% serum (Fig.1 A, bottom panel). This change in viability is not sufficient to account for the low levels of IL-2Rα expression and S phase entry in T cell populations exposed to anti-CD3 and 0.1% serum. We also found that the serum requirement for DNA synthesis and IL-2Rα expression could not be overridden by high levels of IL-2 or by antibody to CD28 (Fig. 1 A, top panel, and data not shown). These results suggest that these signals are not rate-limiting in cells in serum-deficient medium. Although cells receiving anti-CD3 and 0.1% serum did not initiate DNA synthesis, they did exhibit increased expression of the early T cell activation markers, CD69 and CD28 (Fig. 1 B). This finding is consistent with our earlier report showing that TCR-stimulated T cells partially traverse G0/G1 in serum-deficient medium (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine if serum concentration affected total (as well as surface-localized) levels of IL-2Rα, ELISAs and Western blots were performed on whole cell extracts. To expedite these studies, unfractionated splenocyte populations were used. In our previous study, which measured the effects of serum concentration on several cell cycle-related parameters, splenocytes and purified T cells exhibited identical responses (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, A and B(left panel), IL-2Rα was barely detectable in resting splenocytes and was weakly induced by ConA at 10 h regardless of serum concentration. After this time, IL-2Rα continued to accumulate in cells co-stimulated with ConA and 10% serum, with peak expression occurring at 30–40 h. In contrast, IL-2Rα essentially disappeared from cells receiving ConA and 0.1% serum. The capacity of serum to enhance IL-2Rα expression was also evident in splenocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 (Fig. 2 B, right panel). These findings indicate that serum increases the cell surface expression of IL-2Rα, at least in part, by increasing total cellular levels of IL-2Rα. On the other hand, serum did not affect the expression of IL-2Rβ or IL-2Rγ (Fig. 2, B andC). To assess the functional consequences of serum-dependent IL-2Rα up-regulation, we assayed the activity of the IL-2 signaling intermediate, Jak3, in splenocytes treated with ConA and either 10% or 0.1% serum. To detect active Jak3, Jak3 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibody to phosphotyrosine. As presented in Fig.3 A, increases in IL-2Rα expression were paralleled by increases in Jak3 phosphorylation. Quiescent cells contained little if any IL-2Rα or phosphorylated Jak3. Cells receiving ConA and 0.1% serum exhibited minor increases in IL-2Rα expression and Jak3 phosphorylation, whereas both responses were substantially elevated in cells exposed to ConA and 10% serum. Serum (at 10%) also increased IL-2Rα levels and activated Jak3 when added to cells 20 h after addition of ConA and 0.1% serum. This result shows that cells incubated with ConA in serum-deficient medium remain viable and retain the capacity to initiate IL-2-dependent events when subsequently exposed to 10% serum. To determine if serum regulated IL-2Rα mRNA expression, RNase protection assays were done on splenocytes stimulated with ConA and 10% versus 0.1% serum. As shown in Fig. 3 B, IL-2Rα mRNA levels rose within 5 h of addition of ConA to cells and remained elevated for up to 25 h regardless of serum concentration. This finding demonstrates that maximal increases in IL-2Rα mRNA levels are not sufficient for maximal expression of IL-2Rα protein and, consequently, that serum controls IL-2Rα expression at a post-transcriptional level. Similar to protein levels, mRNA levels of IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ were unaffected by serum concentration. The data presented above show that T cells do not appreciably express IL-2Rα, activate JAKs, or enter S phase when stimulated with medium containing ConA or anti-CD3 and 0.1% serum. On the other hand, we have found that splenocytes derived from p27Kip1-null C57b1/6 mice are capable of initiating DNA synthesis when exposed to a TCR agonist and either 10% or 0.1% serum (Fig. 4 and accompanying article (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). This finding implies that cells lacking p27Kip1 either efficiently express IL-2Rα in serum-deficient medium or no longer require IL-2 signaling for proliferation. To distinguish between these alternatives, we examined IL-2Rα expression and Jak1 and Jak3 activity in p27−/− splenocytes exposed to ConA and either 10% or 0.1% serum. IL-2Rα was not detectable in quiescent p27−/− splenocytes but was present at high levels in ConA-treated p27−/− splenocytes regardless of serum concentration (Fig. 4). Moreover, both Jak1 and Jak3 were active in p27−/− splenocytes receiving ConA and either 10% or 0.1% serum. Similar to Balb/c splenocytes, wild-type C57b1/6 splenocytes required 10% serum for both IL-2Rα accumulation and JAK activation. These data indicate that the capacity of p27−/− splenocytes to proliferate in serum-deficient medium results (at least in part) from the capacity of these cells to optimally express IL-2Rα in a serum-independent manner. In wild-type splenocytes, cdk2 activation requires a pronounced and persistent decrease in p27Kip1 levels, and both ConA and 10% serum are needed to achieve this effect (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, in p27Kip1-null splenocytes, cyclin E-cdk2 activation is constitutive and cyclin A-cdk2 activation is serum- (although not ConA-) independent (26Coats S. Whyte P. Fero M.L. Lacy S. Chung G. Randel E. Firpo E. Roberts J.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31Fero M.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E. Polyak K. Tsai L.H. Broudy V. Perlmutter R.M. Kaushansky K. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, conditions that promote cdk2 activation are the same as those that promote IL-2Rα expression, and it is possible, therefore, that cdk2 activity contributes to IL-2Rα expression. In support of this hypothesis, we found that IL-2Rα did not accumulate in Balb/c splenocytes treated with ConA and 10% serum in the presence of roscovitine, a potent and selective inhibitor of cdk2 activity (Fig. 5 A and Ref. 32Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Roscovitine did not inhibit the expression of cyclin E and thus does not nonspecifically block protein synthesis. Similar to naive splenocytes, roscovitine also precluded IL-2Rα expression, as well as cdk2 activity, in quiescent T lymphoblasts restimulated with ConA and 10% serum (Fig. 5 B). The necessity of cdk2 activity for IL-2Rα accumulation was further demonstrable in experiments in which IL-2Rα was transiently expressed in a fibroblast cell line (termed p27–47) that inducibly expresses p27Kip1 in response to isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Fig.5 C and Ref. 28Zhang X. Wharton W. Donovan M. Coppola D. Croxton R. Cress W.D. Pledger W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As we reported previously, induction of p27Kip1 in sparse p27–47 cells represses cdk4 and cdk2 activity but does not result in growth inhibition (28Zhang X. Wharton W. Donovan M. Coppola D. Croxton R. Cress W.D. Pledger W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 C, IL-2Rα mRNA and protein were apparent in p27–47 cells transfected with a plasmid containing IL-2Rα cDNA but not with vector alone. Although IL-2Rα mRNA levels were approximately equal in cells treated with or without IPTG, IL-2Rα protein levels were substantially lower in IPTG-treated as compared with untreated cultures. On the other hand, levels of ectopically expressed β-galactosidase were similar in both IPTG-treated and untreated cultures, thus indicating that p27Kip1overexpression does not globally inhibit protein expression. Collectively, the data in Fig. 5 show that cdk2 activity is required for IL-2Rα expression. Our studies, therefore, establish a series of events in which serum facilitates cdk2 activation, which in turn modulates IL-2Rα expression at a post-transcriptional level. Previous studies have shown that IL-2 stimulates cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 activity in activated T cells (33Appleman L.J. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Boussiotis V.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 34Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Taylor P.A. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Blazar B.R. Nadler L.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 35Firpo E.J. Koff A. Solomon M.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Because these investigations place cdk2 activation downstream of IL-2R activation, the need for cdk2 activity for IL-2Rα accumulation seems paradoxical. It is possible, however, that these processes are interdependent; i.e. cdk2 activity enhances IL-2Rα expression and consequent IL-2 signaling promotes cdk2 activation. To assess the dependence of cdk2 activation on IL-2 signaling in our system, we assayed cdk2 activity in splenocytes treated with ConA and 10% serum in the presence or absence of an IL-2Rα blocking antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 A, cdk2 activity was substantially lower in antibody-treated cultures, as was IL-2Rα expression. AG490, a selective inhibitor of Jak activity (36Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), also blocked cdk2 activation and IL-2Rα expression when presented to cells 12 h after stimulation with ConA and 10% serum (Fig.6 B). AG490 also repressed the expression of cyclin A and cdk2; we have shown previously that the expression of these proteins in T cells requires cdk2 activity (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AG490 had no effect on cyclin E levels and thus does not inhibit protein expression in general. Together, the above findings show that cdk2 activation both results from and contributes to IL-2Rα expression and that cdk2 activity, IL-2Rα expression, and IL-2 signaling comprise a regulatory loop. Engagement of the TCR results in the transcriptional up-regulation of IL-2Rα, and numerous studies have focused on the pathways and promoter elements involved in this response (5Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data presented here show that IL-2Rα expression is also regulated post-transcriptionally and that serum and cdk2 play prominent roles in this process. In splenocytes exposed to ConA and 0.1% serum, IL-2Rα was only weakly and transiently expressed. In contrast, in splenocytes receiving ConA and 10% serum, IL-2Rα expression was robust and sustained. Serum also elevated the cell surface expression of IL-2Rα in purified T cells, and IL-2Rα accumulation was accompanied by activation of the IL-2 signaling intermediates, Jak1 and Jak3. On the other hand, serum had no effect on IL-2Rα mRNA levels or on the expression of IL-2Rβ or IL-2Rγ at either the protein or message level. These findings clearly show that serum selectively modulates the expression of the α subunit of the IL-2R at a post-transcriptional level and that serum-induced increases in IL-2Rα levels are biologically relevant. The requirement for cdk2 activity for IL-2Rα accumulation was established using two different experimental approaches. First, endogenous IL-2Rα levels were determined in T cells stimulated in the presence of the pharmacological cdk2 inhibitor, roscovitine. We found that roscovitine abolished the capacity of serum to increase IL-2Rα levels in both ConA-treated splenocytes and ConA-treated T lymphoblasts. Second, levels of ectopically expressed IL-2Rα were measured in p27–47 fibroblasts treated with or without IPTG. As reported previously, these cells are stably transfected with a plasmid that expresses p27Kip1 under the control of the lac repressor (28Zhang X. Wharton W. Donovan M. Coppola D. Croxton R. Cress W.D. Pledger W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When exposed to IPTG, which alleviates lac repression, these cells produce high amounts of p27Kip1, and consequently, cdk2 activity is inhibited. As shown here, IPTG-induced cdk2 inactivation also markedly repressed the expression of IL-2Rα protein. In contrast, IL-2Rα mRNA levels were similar in IPTG-treated and untreated cells. These findings complement those obtained in the roscovitine experiments and show that cdk2 activity, like serum, modulates IL-2Rα expression at a post-transcriptional level. Because IL-2 signaling is thought to be a cause rather than an effect of cdk2 activation in T cells (24Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 25Kwon T.K. Buchholz M.A. Ponsalle P. Chrest F.J. Nordin A.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5642-5648PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that these processes were interdependent. In support of this hypothesis, we found that abrogation of IL-2 signaling repressed both cdk2 expression and cdk2 activity in splenocytes stimulated with ConA and 10% serum. Two methods were used to inhibit IL-2 signaling: an IL-2Rα blocking antibody and the JAK inhibitor, AG490. On the basis of these data and those discussed above, we propose the following regulatory loop (Fig. 7). We suggest that this loop begins with cyclin E-cdk2 activation, which results from persistent serum-dependent p27Kip1down-regulation. As described by others (37Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar, 38DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 39Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), cyclin E-cdk2 complexes, together with cyclin D-containing complexes, phosphorylate Rb, and thus allow the E2F-mediated transcription of cyclin A and the consequent formation of cyclin A-cdk2 complexes. As shown here, activation of cyclin E-cdk2 also leads to the post-transcriptional accumulation of IL-2Rα and the subsequent induction of IL-2-mediated events, as exemplified by JAK activation. IL-2 signaling pathways, in turn, further optimize and sustain cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 activity. At this point in the cycle, it is likely that both of these activities promote the continued expression of IL-2Rα. The capacity of serum to facilitate splenocyte proliferation by initiating the regulatory loop outlined in Fig. 7 is clearly demonstrated by our studies on p27Kip1-deficient splenocytes. In these cells, cdk2 activation, IL-2Rα accumulation, and JAK activation were serum-independent, as was S phase entry (Fig. 4and accompanying article (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). In p27−/− cells, ConA was still required for transcriptional up-regulation of IL-2Rα and for activation of D cyclin complexes and consequent expression of cyclin A (43Mohapatra S. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21976-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that the more proximal target of serum is IL-2Rα expression (and consequent IL-2 signaling) rather than p27Kip1 down-regulation (and consequent cdk2 activation). However, in support of our model, it is noted that submaximal increases in cdk2 activity have been observed in T cells treated with TCR agonists (and 10% serum) in conditions in which IL-2 is not produced (40Modiano J.F.

Gelfand E.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 134-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that ConA activates cyclin E-cdk2 to a small extent in a serum-dependent but IL-2-independent manner and that this limited increase in activity is sufficient to set the cycle in motion. Although translational regulation of IL-2Rα has been reported previously (42Weinberg A.D. Swain S.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4712-4720PubMed Google Scholar), our studies at present do not distinguish between an effect of cdk2 activity on the synthesis versus the stability of IL-2Rα. Our transfection data indicate that the information required for maximal IL-2Rα expression is contained within the IL-2Rα coding region and a 123-bp upstream sequence. As described previously (42Weinberg A.D. Swain S.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4712-4720PubMed Google Scholar), this upstream sequence contains a translational start codon and an in-frame stop codon that are thought to reduce translational efficiency by causing leaky scanning. Whether this process is influenced by cdk2 activity remains to be determined. As a final point, we note that many of the effects described here have also been observed in splenocytes receiving ConA and (rather than serum) a serum substitute consisting of insulin, selenium, and transferrin. 2S.

We used this property to identify plasmids encoding peptide additions to the AraC DNA binding domain that could dimerize the domain. We generated a high diversity library of plasmids by inserting 90-base oligonucleotides of random sequence ahead of DNA coding for the AraC DNA binding domain in an expression vector, transforming, and selecting colonies containing functional oligomeric peptide-AraC DNA binding domain chimeric proteins by their growth on minimal arabinose medium. Six of seven Ara+candidates were partially characterized, and one was purified. Equilibrium analytical centrifugation experiments showed that it dimerizes with a dissociation constant of ∼2 μm.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Coiled-coils about 40 residues long seem to be the smallest naturally occurring oligomerization domains yet found in proteins. Does the absence of smaller oligomerization elements mean that none are possible or that natural selective pressures for such elements have not existed? If very strong selective pressures were exerted, might new and unique structural motifs be found? And if they were, would the resulting information prove useful in understanding protein structure and for protein engineering?The identification and genetic selection of oligomerizing elements is possible with systems where the monomeric form of a protein or domain of a protein is inactive but the dimeric or oligomeric form is active. Transcription regulators are particularly attractive for this application. Often, binding of their monomeric form to DNA is weak, and their binding at physiological concentrations of the protein requires dimeric protein and corresponding repeated DNA sites. These systems also have the virtue that they can be adjusted to select for strong or weak dimerizing abilities of the monomers. If the affinity of the monomeric form of the protein for its DNA site is relatively high, active protein need not be a dimer in solution; i.e.occasionally, monomers independently bind to the DNA and dimerize there, utilizing the additional interaction energy between the two protein monomers. The lifetime on the DNA of the dimer thus formed is significantly longer than the lifetimes of individual monomers on the DNA. On the other hand, if the DNA binding affinity of the monomers is relatively low, then the interaction energy between the monomers of the active protein must be higher, and the protein may well exist in solution at physiological concentrations as a dimer.We have utilized the arabinose system of Escherichia colifor the selection of dimerizing peptides (Fig.1). Monomers of the DNA binding domain of AraC are inactive in stimulating transcription of the genes required for the catabolism of l-arabinose, but attaching a 49-amino acid coiled-coil from C/EBP1converts the AraC DNA binding domain to a fully active form (1Bustos S.A. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5638-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We sought to isolate 30 amino acid peptides that dimerize at physiological concentrations. Therefore, in the C/EBP coiled-coil-AraC DNA binding domain construct, we replaced the region coding for the coiled-coil with 90 bases of DNA of random sequence and selected for products capable of activating transcription of the arabinose genes. While this work was in progress, three reports of similar selections have appeared. Two of these utilized λ phage repressor (2Zhang Z. Murphy A. Hu J.C. Kodadek T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 417-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3Japelli R. Brenner S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and report the genetic characterization of candidate elements encoded by fragments of cloned DNA. A third (4Wang B.S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9568-9573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) fused random sequence DNA coding for 15 amino acids to DNA coding for zinc finger domains, selected, and after further improvement in dimerization, examined dimerization with centrifugation experiments. In our work, candidate peptides with lengths from 6 to 32 residues were identified. We purified the chimeric peptide-AraC DNA binding domain product from a candidate with a 22-amino acid dimerizing peptide and found that it dimerized with a dissociation constant in the micromolar range.DISCUSSIONWe replaced the dimerization domain of AraC with peptides of random sequence, and from the resulting library of randomized peptide-AraC DNA binding domain fusions we identified seven peptides of 32 residues or shorter that can confer activation frompBAD. One peptide could not be studied, but the remaining six appear to oligomerize.In principle, the selection technique requiring growth on minimal arabinose could yield five different classes of peptides: 1) peptides that themselves self-associate to form homodimers or other higher order structures; 2) peptides that bind to the DNA binding domains, but for steric reasons the arms cannot bind cis, and thus cross-binding between two chimeric molecules generates a dimer; 3) peptides that bind other cellular structures that provide an oligomeric framework; 4) peptides that bind nonspecifically to DNA; and 5) peptides that stabilize the normally rather unstable DNA binding domain of AraC. Structurally, the existence of class two candidates appears to be incompatible with binding to direct repeat DNA half-sites. None of the candidates seems to be in class three, since the migration retardation assays showed no evidence of anomalously high retardation, and two of the candidates, candidates 1 and 5, were shown not to be in class four or five, since the possibility of monomeric binding was eliminated by titration experiments. Except for one candidate, the peptide-AraC chimeras found in this work all bound stably in vitro to DNA containing the AraC binding site consisting of theI1 half-site, to which AraC binds tightly, and theI2 half-site, to which AraC binds weakly. Comparisons of the DNA migration retardation rates with other control proteins confirmed that no higher order oligomeric structures other than the dimeric species were formed.We purified one of our dimerizing domain-AraC domain proteins. Although it was only sparingly soluble, it was possible to obtain equilibrium sedimentation data that showed it to dimerize rather tightly, with a Kd of 1.8 μm. In the selection experiments reported by Wang and Pabo (4Wang B.S. Pabo C.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9568-9573Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), 15-mer dimerizing peptides were isolated. The fusion proteins exist as monomers at solution concentrations up to 50–100 μm in the absence of DNA but dimerize at a concentration of 2.5 nm in the presence of DNA. Probably, our selection for dimerization was more stringent than that used by Wang and Pabo, because we used the relatively weak binding site I1 -I2 for the in vivo selections, and hence the candidates were required to dimerize tightly.The natural interdomain linker of AraC was retained in our constructs. It is thus possible that these 8 amino acids interact with the 22 amino acids of the added peptide and contribute to the dimerization of the chimeric protein. Direct experiments with peptide should resolve this issue. The occurrences of Ala, Phe, Met, Asn, Pro, and Thr in the collection of oligomerizing peptides we found were greater than random. The probabilities that these particular amino acids would individually have deviated as much or more than what we found were 3.5, 1.02, 0.37, 5.6, 0.27, and 3%, respectively. These numbers are derived by noting that since there were 151 total amino acids, excluding the initiating methionines, in the peptides, and 31 possible codons, the probability that the set contains n or more alanines, for which there are two possible codons in the 31, is as follows.∑n151151!n!(151−n)!(29/31)151−n(2/31)nEquation 1 Since the abnormal distribution extends across most of the peptides and because a number of amino acids are involved, the distribution probably reflects some general principles relevant to the association of short amino acid sequences. The actual sequences do not obviously reveal their secondary or tertiary structures. None looks like a leucine zipper coiled-coil, although the program PredictProtein (14Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) does predict that 16 contiguous residues out of 22 in the peptide of candidate 1 form an α-helix.
