https://openalex.org/W1485123151,"Abstract NADPH-sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.2), an enzyme which catalyzes the 6-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide, has been purified to homogeneity, according to electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal criteria, from Escherichia coli B. The enzyme, molecular weight 670,000, contains four FMN, four FAD, 20 to 21 atoms of iron, 14 to 15 labile sulfides, and 3 to 4 molecules of a novel type of heme per enzyme molecule. The absorption spectrum of sulfite reductase shows maxima at 278, 386, 455, 587, and 714 nm, the latter three bands being partially bleached by NADPH or dithionite. The enzyme exhibits electron paramagnetic resonance signals with g values of 6.7, 5.25, and 2.0, characteristic of 3 to 4 moles of a high spin Fe3+-heme per mole of enzyme, and this signal is reduced in intensity by addition of NADPH. The hemetype chromophore, which appears to be characteristic of assimilatory sulfite-reducing enzymes in a wide variety of organisms, is extractable with acetone-0.015 n HCI and is highly polar; its chromatographic behavior is clearly different from that of protohemin. Both the enzyme and the extracted heme-type chromophore form spectrally distinct complexes with typical heme ligands (CO, cyanide, hydroxide, and pyridine) in which the Soret band maxima are at unusually short wave lengths with low Soret to α-band absorbance ratios. Formation and decay of the enzyme-CO complex is slow in comparison to other hemoproteins. These data indicate that E. coli sulfite reductase is a self-contained complex of electron transport carriers including a heme-type component which, by virtue of its spectrophotometric, solubility, and chromatographic properties, is clearly distinguishable from previously described hemes."

The oxidized protein has absorption maxima at 270, 377, and 450 nm with an A270:A450 ratio of 8.6 and a molar extinction coefficient of 10.9 x 10-3 cm-1 m-1 at 450 nm. The oxidation-reduction potential for the coupled oxidized reductase-fully reduced reductase is -0.274 volts at pH 7.0. The fluorescence due to the native enzyme is comparable to that of free FAD. The amino acid composition shows a high content of hydrophobic residues; the molecular weight determined by both sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis and gel filtration is approximately 54,000. Michaelis constants for NADPH and NADH are 1.82 µm and 5.56 mm, respectively. NADP+ has an inhibitory effect on NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity, with an inhibition constant of 5.32 µm."
https://openalex.org/W2079991384,Lewis rats depleted of thymus-derived cells (B rats) failed to develop either experimental allergic encephalomyelitis or antibody against myelin basic protein. Lewis B rats reconstituted with 690 x 10(6) thymocytes developed experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and levels of antibody against myelin basic protein comparable to those of controls. The Lewis B rat model should be useful in the analysis of the role of thymus-derived cell populations and antibody in the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.
https://openalex.org/W1506736401,"Abstract The 78,000 x g subcellular fraction of canine cardiac tissue has been shown to bind norepinephrine specifically. β-Adrenergic drugs compete with norepinephrine in a potency series parallel to their potency in causing an increase in the force of cardiac muscle contraction. d and l isomers of the catecholamines competed equally well. These subcellular particles also contain adenylate cyclase which may be stimulated by catecholamines with a similar specificity. [3H]Norepinephrine is concentrated 1000-fold in the particles at 10-9m and may be fully dissociated in 1 m HC1 without evidence of structural alteration. Two different binding constants, K = 1.04 x 107 m-1 and 1.33 x 106 m-1, as well as two different dissociation rates for norepinephrine, were observed. The pH optimum for binding was 7.5, with substantial decrease at more acidic pH and little change at more alkaline pH. Divalent cations at 1 to 5 mm diminished binding as did chelating agents, reagents reacting with sulfhydryl groups, urea, temperatures above 50°, and proteolytic enzymes. The monovalent cations, Na+ and K+, and the enzymes ribonuclease, desoxyribonuclease, and phospholipase were without effect. Tris and trimethylamine and increases in temperature up to 50° enhanced binding. Binding of norepinephrine to this subcellular fraction was differentiated from binding to neural vesicles by virtue of a different specificity, a lack of sensitivity to reserpine, the absence of an ATP requirement, and the preservation of norepinephrine binding after chemical sympathectomy."

https://openalex.org/W1587032440,"Abstract Microsomes from the mucosa of hamster small intestine contain an enzyme system capable of catalyzing the desaturation of [3H]alkylacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine to form [3H]alk-1-enylacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine (ethanolamine plasmalogen). The enzyme is specific for 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine; it does not act on the enantiomeric 3-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphorylethanolamine; 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine is utilized only after acylation in position 2 of the glycerol moiety; 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl-(N-dimethyl)ethanolamine is not converted to the corresponding plasmalogen; degradation products of alkyl- and alkylacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine, i.e. octadecylglycerol, octadecanal, octadecanol, or stearic acid are not utilized for plasmalogen biosynthesis by the in vitro system. The broad pH optimum of the reaction lies at pH 7 to 8. The alkylacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine desaturase requires as essential cofactors molecular oxygen, NADH, or NADPH and a heat-labile factor of high molecular weight contained in the 100,000 x g supernatant. Inhibition by cyanide indicates that a cyanide-sensitive factor is involved. The reaction is further inhibited by EDTA, NaN3, o-phenanthroline, p-chloromercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, menadione, and detergents, but not by carbon monoxide. As far as the type of reaction (cis-olefination), cofactor requirement, and susceptibility to the various inhibitors are concerned, alkylacylglycerophosphorylethanolamine desaturase resembles fatty acyl coenzyme A desaturase."
https://openalex.org/W1493628530,"The response of T7-specific RNA polymerase to a variety of inhibitors of transcription has been studied. T7 RNA synthesis by T7 RNA polymerase is inhibited by actinomycin D, heparin, elevated concentrations of salt and poly[r(U)]. All of these inhibitors block transcription immediately, even after the initiation of RNA synthesis, and hence appear to inhibit T7 RNA polymerase even during RNA chain growth. This is in contrast to transcription by the bacterial RNA polymerase for which RNA chain growth is not sensitive to heparin, elevated salt concentrations, or polyuridylic acid. T7 RNA synthesis by T7 RNA polymerase is not affected by the drugs rifampicin, streptolydigin, and streptovarivin, and is not greatly affected by preincubation of the enzyme with poly[r(C)], poly[r(I)], or a variety of heterologous DNAs. Ultraviolet irradiation of T7 DNA blocks its template activity. Such ultraviolet-irradiated T7 DNA serves as an inhibitor of T7 RNA polymerase which appears to inactivate free T7 RNA polymerase, but not T7 RNA polymerase involved in RNA chain growth."
https://openalex.org/W1511801414,"Abstract d-Amino acid oxidase catalyzes the nonoxidative conversion of α-amino-β-chlorobutyrate to α-ketobutyrate, but does not catalyze its oxidation to β-chloroketobutyrate. The elimination reaction requires the oxidized flavoprotein, i.e. it does not occur with the apoenzyme or when the enzyme-bound flavin is reduced. The occurrence of this elimination reaction supports the proposal that removal of the substrate α proton is an early step in reactions catalyzed by d-amino acid oxidase. Addition of α-amino-β-chlorobutyrate to d-amino acid oxidase leads to the sequential formation of three spectroscopically recognizable complexes (I, II, and III). All of these complexes have the spectra of oxidized flavin and in addition have long wave length absorbance extending to 800 nm. They are formed with the following rate constants: ki, 2000 min-1; kii, 40; and kiii, ∼1. (ki is dependent on substrate concentration. The value given is the limiting value at infinite substrate concentration.) When an α deuterated substrate is used, ki shows a deuterium isotope effect of about 5. Therefore, formation of Complex I must involve breaking of the substrate α C—H bond. Complex I could be a complex between flavin and a substrate-derived carbanion, or, if the elimination of HCl is complete at this stage, a complex between substrate-derived enamine and flavin. Formation of Complex I cannot be rate-determining, since the turnover number for the catalytic process is 6 to 9.5 min-1. From experiments carried out with α-amino-β-chloro[α-2H]butyrate and in 2H2O, it is concluded that the action of d-amino acid oxidase on the substrate results in the formation of an enzyme-bound enamine which then undergoes two competing reactions: (a) It is released to the medium and spontaneously ketonizes to form ketobutyrate. (b) The β position of the enamine is protonated on the enzyme to form α-iminobutyric acid, which is then released and hydrolyzes to α-ketobutyrate. The proton which is added to the β position is originally derived from the α position of the substrate. The enzyme thus has the capability of sequestering the α proton of the substrate so that it does not exchange with the solvent. The relative extent to which these two processes (enamine reprotonation versus release) occur is temperature-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W1588360759,"The activities of nine enzymes (hexokinase, P-fructokinase, glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, 6-P-gluconic dehydrogenase, TPN-linked isocitric dehydrogenase, malic dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, glutamic dehydrogenase, and ATP: NMN adenylyltransferase) and the concentration of DPN+ were determined in nuclei, cytoplasm, and cell bodies (nucleus + cytoplasm) of single dorsal root ganglion cells of the rabbit. The structures were dissected from 8- to 10-µ frozen dried tissue sections. In each case, the nucleus (0.2 to 1.2 ng) and two or three pieces of cytoplasm were obtained from the same cell body. The samples were weighed on quartz fiber balances sensitive to as little as 1.2 pg. The specific enzyme reactions were carried out in small volumes (1 nl to 5 µl) under mineral oil (oil well technique), and the DPN+, DPNH, or TPNH formed was amplified 800- to 1,000,000-fold by enzymatic cycling or double enzymatic cycling. Of the seven enzymes from major energy-yielding systems, three were higher in concentration in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (hexokinase, 6-P-gluconic dehydrogenase, TPN-linked isocitric dehydrogenase) and two were higher in the cytoplasm (P-fructokinase, glucose-6-P dehydrogenase). Unexpectedly, glutamic dehydrogenase was found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm (at 60% of the cytoplasmic level). ATP:NMN adenylyltransferase was found to be localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm, in complete contrast to findings of others who examined nucleiisolated in bulk."
https://openalex.org/W1499066230,"Abstract Previous studies indicated that allosteric regulation of bacterial glycogen synthesis occurs at the level of ADP-glucose synthase (reviewed by Preiss, J. (1969) in Current Topics in Cellular Regulation (Horecker, B. L., and Stadtman, E. R., eds) Vol. 1, pp. 125–160, Academic Press, New York). The physiological significance of the allosteric effects observed in vitro is demonstrated by kinetic characterization of an altered ADP-glucose synthase from a glycogen-excess mutant of Escherichia coli B. The mutant enzyme is specifically altered in its responses to allosteric effectors, having a higher apparent affinity for activators (fructose-P2, TPNH, and pyridoxal-P) and a lower apparent affinity for inhibitor (AMP) than the wild type enzyme. These changes make the mutant enzyme more active at physiological energy charge values and are sufficient to account for the increased rate of glycogen accumulation in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that allosteric activators increase the activity of the E. coli B ADP-glucose synthase by increasing its maximum velocity (4- to 8-fold) and increasing its affinity for substrates and metal ion (2- to 15-fold) (Priess, J., ibid). Activators also change the shape of the saturation curve for the substrate glucose 1-phosphate. The curves suggest that glucose-1-P binding sites are negatively cooperative in the absence of activators but noninteracting in their presence. A comparison of the concentrations of activators required to stimulate ADP-glucose synthase with their intracellular concentrations suggests that fructose-P2 is the physiological activator of the enzyme in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W1544415700,"Abstract The metabolism of [3H]estrone sulfate as well as the intranuclear binding of estrone sulfate and its metabolites, estrone and estradiol, was studied in tissue minces of anterior pituitary, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex of female sheep. Estrone sulfate was converted to unconjugated estrogens to approximately the same degree in all three tissues. Nuclei were prepared by sucrose density gradient plus Triton X-100 treatment. Following incubation of tissue minces with [3H]estrone sulfate, no [3H]estrone sulfate was found associated with nuclei. Only in anterior pituitary was specific intranuclear association of estrone or estradiol demonstrated. Ovariectomy resulted in large increases in the intranuclear association of both these estrogens in anterior pituitary. On the basis of 0.6 m KCl extraction of purified nuclei from the three tissues and subjection of the extracts to gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, steroid-macromolecular complexes could be demonstrated only in anterior pituitary. Analysis of these complexes indicated that 70% of the radioactivity associated with the nuclear macromolecular receptor complexes was estradiol and 30% estrone."

https://openalex.org/W1484432552,"Abstract Cycloheximide was found to inhibit rat and guinea pig liver mitochondrial respiration in State 3 and after uncoupling by carbonyl cyanide p - trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, although no effect was observed during State 4 respiration. This inhibition was dependent upon the nature of the mitochondrial substrate since oxygen consumption, pyridine nucleotide oxidation, and ADP phosphorylation were inhibited with all NAD+-linked substrates tested whereas no significant effects were noted with flavin-linked substrates such as succinate. Reversed electron transport was estimated directly by pyridine nucleotide fluorescence or by the formation of β-hydroxybutyrate following succinate addition. In both instances, cycloheximide caused a significant inhibition. No direct effect of this inhibitor on a variety of purified NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases could be shown. Unlike rotenone, but similar to Amytal, cycloheximide significantly depressed the activity of the uncoupler-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase in isolated mitochondria. Taken together, these findings indicate that cycloheximide inhibits the mechanism of energy transfer specifically at Site I, but not at Sites II and III of the electron transport chain. Similar results were obtained with the isolated mitochondria of both rat and guinea pig liver. However, cycloheximide, in guinea pig liver mitochondria, produced a profound inhibition of P-enolpyruvate formation which was out of proportion to the observed inhibition of both substrate oxidation and ADP phosphorylation. The implications of this finding for the regulation of intramitochondrial guanine nucleotide balance are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516522009,"Abstract 1. An injection of d-galactosamine at the same time as an injection of dexamethasone inhibits the increase of rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase activity normally observed following injection of dexamethasone alone. The galactosamine-mediated inhibition is dose dependent: a 50% inhibition of the increase of enzyme activity is observed at 10 mg of galactosamine·HCl per 100 g of body weight, and a total inhibition is observed at 15 mg per 100 g of body weight. Following a single injection of 37.5 mg of galactosamine·HCl per 100 g of body weight, the basal level of tyrosine aminotransferase activity does not change for at least 16 hours. 2. Induction of the enzyme by glucagon or dibutyryl cyclic AMP is only partially inhibited by a dose of 37.5 mg of galactosamine·HCl per 100 g of body weight. 3. The total inhibition of the dexamethasone-induced enzyme increase is specific for galactosamine. A high dose of d-glucose or d-galactose has no inhibitory effect, and a high dose of d-glucosamine or 2-deoxy-d-galactose has only a partially inhibitory effect. 4. The inhibition by galactosamine of the dexamethasone-induced enzyme increase can be prevented by simultaneous injection of uridine. Determination of the uridine phosphate levels following injection of different doses of galactosamine reveals a partial inhibition of the enzyme induction below 100 nmoles of UTP+UDP per g of liver and a total inhibition of enzyme induction below 40 to 50 nmoles of UTP+UDP per g of liver. 5. There is little or no relationship between levels of galactosamine metabolites in the liver and inhibition of enzyme induction. 6. Unlike actinomycin D, injection of galactosamine at various times after injection of dexamethasone does not result in a superinduction of tyrosine aminotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1535743200,"Abstract The synthesis of DNA complementary to rabbit globin mRNA by the enzyme RNA-directed DNA polymerase (from avian myeloblastosis virus) has been studied. The reaction is dependent on mRNA as template, oligo(dT) as primer, and the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates as substrates. The 28 S, 18 S, and 4 S RNA are not effective templates; oligo(dG), oligo(dC), and oligo(dA) are not effective primers. The product of the reaction is a DNA-RNA hybrid, the DNA of which has an electrophoretic mobility of 7 to 10 S. The DNA hybridizes with globin 10 S mRNA but not with 28 S, 18 S, or 4 S RNA, nor does it hybridize with an 8 to 12 S RNA fraction isolated from rabbit liver polysomes. Thus, the RNA-directed DNA polymerase is capable of synthesizing a DNA molecule complementary to globin mRNA; however, based on its size the product does not appear to be a complete copy of the RNA template. Using rabbit reticulocyte 10 S globin mRNA or rabbit liver mRNA as template the RNA-directed DNA polymerase can synthesize poly(dT) when dTTP is the only substrate present; no reaction occurs in the presence of any other single deoxynucleoside triphosphate. A high molecular weight poly(dT) polymer is formed, presumably transcribed from the poly(A) region of the mRNA. Thus, under some conditions, the enzyme may slip during transcription so that parts of the RNA are transcribed more than once in the synthesis of a single DNA molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1593683258,"Abstract Extracts of Acetobacter xylinum cells grown on glucose or succinate, oxidized glucose 6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate in the presence of either NAD or NADP. NAD-linked glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the corresponding NADP enzyme were completely separated and partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The NAD enzyme was optimally active at pH 5.6, and the NADP enzyme at pH 8.2. Each enzyme exhibited strict specificity for its respective coenzyme. The interaction of glucose 6-phosphate and the corresponding coenzyme was that of a typical two-substrate system. The reaction rates with both enzymes were hyperbolic functions of coenzyme and substrate concentrations. The Km values for glucose 6-phosphate and the corresponding coenzyme were 2.5 mm and 0.08 mm for the NAD enzyme and 1.64 mm and 0.04 mm for the NADP enzyme. Magnesium ions did not affect the activity of the enzymes. The NAD enzyme was competitively inhibited by NADH with respect to NAD (Ki = 0.035 mm) and was not affected by NADPH. The NADP enzyme was competitively inhibited by NADPH with respect to NADP (Ki = 0.028 mm) and was insensitive to NADH. ATP inhibited the activity of the NAD glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The inhibition, which followed classical kinetic patterns, was competitive with respect to glucose 6-phosphate (Ki) = 1.3 mm) and noncompetitive with respect to NAD. The NADP-linked enzyme was insensitive to ATP. It is suggested that the NAD and NADP glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenases have distinctly different functional roles. The possible relationship between the properties of the two enzymes and regulatory mechanisms in the control of hexose metabolism in A. xylinum is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2082051012,"Abstract This is the first demonstration that the poly(A)-containing RNA from mammalian mitochondria behaves like messenger RNA in mitochondrial specific protein synthesis. The mitochondrial RNA in HeLa cells is selectively labeled in the presence of camptothecin, the mitochondria isolated, lysed with weak detergents, and the mitochondrial contents sedimented in sucrose gradients. Much of the poly(A)-containing RNA sediments rapidly with polyribosome-like structures. Most important, the association of the poly(A) + RNA with heavy structures is disrupted quantitatively by puromycin, which should be selective for RNA engaged in protein synthesis. The disaggregation by puromycin is largely prevented by the simultaneous addition of chloramphenicol, which demonstrates association with mitochondrial protein synthesis. A minimum lifetime is estimated for mitochondrial RNA of from 112–2 hr. This decay rate is observed after the block of new synthesis with either actinomycin or cordycepin. The decay of the poly(A) + RNA is faster than that of mitochondrial poly(A) − . The decay in ethidium bromide is much more rapid and constitutes additional evidence that ethidium has an overall deleterious effect on mitochondrial integrity. The lifetimes observed are long compared to the transcription time. In this sense, the mitochondrial messenger-like RNA more closely resembles eucaryotic rather than procaryotic mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1999435217,"Abstract A 12,000 molecular weight type C viral polypeptide, p12, has been isolated from BALB/c mouse cells. This polypeptide is shown to be immunologically distinct from the p12 antigens of two previously described endogenous viruses of BALB/c cells. It is, however, indistinguishable from a viral antigen expressed in NIH Swiss mouse cells and present in type C viruses isolated from NIH Swiss mice. The expression of endogenous viruses containing each of the three distinguishable p12 antigens is shown to be differentially affected by two classes of chemical inducers, halogenated pyrimidines and inhibitors of protein synthesis. The present findings thus provide evidence for the existence of genetic information of three distinguishable endogenous viruses within cells of the BALB/c strain."

https://openalex.org/W1541813252,"Abstract The metabolism of malate was investigated in liver mitochondria from both the rat and the guinea pig. The oxidation of this intermediate was found to proceed in an inhibited and nonlinear manner in guinea pig liver mitochondria and to a lesser extent this situation held also for rat liver mitochondria. This inhibition was reversed by glutamate and partially by pyruvate addition. Analyses of the mitochondrial suspensions throughout an ADP-induced respiratory cycle showed increasing levels of oxalacetate during the transition from State 4 to State 3, with further increases occurring throughout State 3. Inhibition of malate oxidation was associated with markedly elevated levels of oxalacetate. In guinea pig liver mitochondria with malate as substrate, a large amplitude oxidation of the respiratory chain-linked pyridine nucleotides was observed during State 3 which persisted beyond the apparent transition into State 4. A significant release of protons to the medium was noted in State 4, whereas in State 3, lower H+ to ADP and ADP to oxygen ratios were obtained with guinea pig as compared to rat liver mitochondria. Factors increasing the rate of oxalacetate removal in mitochondria were noted to also increase the rate of malate oxidation and the formation of reduced pyridine nucleotides during the transition from State 3 to State 4. These same factors also decreased the rate of proton release in State 4, and increased the ratios of H+ to ADP and ADP to oxygen. P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase was found to function in a reversible manner in guinea pig liver mitochondria. Significant amounts of intramitochondrial oxalacetate could be formed from added P-enolpyruvate, provided that the ratio of ATP:ADP was low. Using this technique to vary the level of oxalacetate within the matrix space, marked inhibition of malate oxidation was produced by increasing the concentration of oxalacetate. In addition, the mechanisms of oxalacetate removal appear different in liver mitochondria from the guinea pig as compared to the rat. The flow of carbon from oxalacetate to P-enolpyruvate limits, in part, the State 3 rate of respiration from malate in guinea pig liver mitochondria. Such a limitation arising from P-enolpyruvate synthesis is observed despite the markedly elevated levels of oxalacetate which thereby result. Other factors such as the availability of ATP to form GTP by transphosphorylation also appear to control the rate and direction of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction. Decreased rates of P-enolpyruvate formation inhibit the rate of malate oxidation in either State 3 or State 4. The metabolic consequences of mitochondrial P-enolpyruvate formation results in significantly altered kinetic parameters of malate metabolism in mitochondria from these two species. It is concluded that NAD+-malate dehydrogenase functions in an equilibrium manner in the intact liver mitochondria of both rat and guinea pig, and that the intramitochondrial pools of malate, oxalacetate, and the nicotinamide coenzymes freely interact in such a system. Alterations of any one factor produce direct and reciprocal changes in the other intermediates. Additionally, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase although reversible, appears to function primarily as an oxalacetate-removing system. In guinea pig liver mitochondria, the presence of this enzyme results in altered control mechanisms of oxalacetate metabolism and in marked differences in the regulation of the citric acid cycle. These observations have important implications for the mechanisms of hepatic gluconeogenesis in both the rat and the guinea pig."

https://openalex.org/W1577510718,"Abstract The experiments described in this paper were designed to elucidate the mechanism of the GTP-mediated regulation of the oxidation of NAD-linked substrates in rat liver mitochondria. A possible GTP effect on the electron transport or oxidative phosphorylation sequences at or near the first phosphorylation site was eliminated by the observation that the GTP-mediated inhibition of NAD-linked substrate oxidation occurred in rotenone plus menadione-treated mitochondria in which electrons were shunted around Site I. Furthermore, it was shown that the intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides, NADH and NADPH, become greatly oxidized upon initiation of the inhibitory state. Cytochromes b, c, and a also become oxidized under these conditions. These observations indicate that reducing equivalents from the NAD-linked dehydrogenase reactions were not available to the electron transport chain at the NADH level during the GTP-mediated inhibitory state. It was shown that GTP exerted its effect on this system by causing an inhibition of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. Three other well documented inhibitors of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction, i.e. sodium arsenite, parapyruvate, and 5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid exactly mimicked the effects of elevated GTP levels on the oxidation of NAD-linked substrates. All four of these inhibitors of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase caused an inhibition of the oxidation of NAD-linked substrates, a drastic oxidation of intramitochondrial pyridine nucleotides and a reduction of the flavoprotein, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. It is proposed that the entry of reducing equivalents into the electron transport chain in intact rat liver mitochondria must occur via the flavoprotein, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, portion of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. This flavin-linked transfer of reducing equivalents produced in the primary NAD-linked dehydrogenases of the mitochondrion to the NADH level of the respiratory chain is strongly controlled by the GTP level of the mitochondrion."
