https://openalex.org/W1997005484,"Release of cytochrome c is important in many forms of apoptosis. Recent studies of CD95 (Fas/APO-1)-induced apoptosis have implicated caspase-8 cleavage of Bid, a BH3 domain-containing proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, in this release. We now demonstrate that both receptor-induced (CD95 and tumor necrosis factor) and chemical-induced apoptosis result in a similar time-dependent activation of caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 in Jurkat T cells and human leukemic U937 cells. In receptor-mediated apoptosis, the caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.FMK), inhibits apoptosis prior to commitment to cell death by inhibiting the upstream activator caspase-8, cleavage of Bid, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, processing of effector caspases, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and externalization of phosphatidylserine. However, Z-VAD.FMK inhibits chemical-induced apoptosis at a stage after commitment to cell death by inhibiting the initiator caspase-9 and the resultant postmitochondrial activation of effector caspases. Cleavage of Bid but not release of cytochromec is blocked by Z-VAD.FMK demonstrating that in chemical-induced apoptosis cytochrome c release is caspase-independent and is not mediated by activation of Bid. We propose that caspases form an integral part of the cell death-inducing mechanism in receptor-mediated apoptosis, whereas in chemical-induced apoptosis they act solely as executioners of apoptosis.

We propose that caspases form an integral part of the cell death-inducing mechanism in receptor-mediated apoptosis, whereas in chemical-induced apoptosis they act solely as executioners of apoptosis. Apoptosis is a major form of cell death characterized by a series of stereotypic morphological features. It occurs in two phases, an initial commitment phase followed by an execution phase involving the condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin, dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum, and alterations to the cell membrane resulting in recognition and subsequent phagocytosis of the cell (1Arends M.J.

Gene & Dev. 1996; 6: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play a critical role in the execution phase of apoptosis and are responsible for many of the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis (3Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar, 4Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that “initiator” caspases with long prodomains, such as caspase-8 (MACH/FLICE/Mch5), either directly or indirectly activate “effector” caspases, such as caspases-3, -6, and -7 (3Cohen G.M.

These effector caspases then cleave intracellular substrates, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations PARPpoly(ADP-ribose)polymeraseZ-VAD.FMKbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe) fluoromethyl ketoneZ-IETD.CHObenzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp aldehydeZ-DEVD.AFCbenzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aminofluoromethyl coumarinTNFtumor necrosis factorPSphosphatidylserineDiOC6(3)3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodideDEDdeath effector domain and lamins, during the execution phase of apoptosis. Caspase-8 is the most apical caspase in CD95 (Fas/APO-1)-induced apoptosis (7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Triggering of the CD95 receptor with its cognate ligand or agonistic antibody results in receptor trimerization and recruitment of CD95 receptor-associated protein with death domains (FADD/MORT1), which in turn binds to the death effector domains in the N-terminal region of caspase-8, resulting in its activation. As caspase-8 can activate all known caspasesin vitro (6Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), it is a prime candidate for an initiator caspase in many forms of apoptosis in addition to CD95-induced apoptosis. Procaspase-9 has also been proposed as an initiator caspase; in the presence of dATP and cytochrome c, its long N-terminal domain interacts with Apaf-1 resulting in the activation of caspase-9 (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 10Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). Active caspase-9 can then activate the effector caspases-3, -6, and -7 (10Zou H.

Thus there are at least two major mechanisms by which a caspase cascade resulting in the activation of effector caspases may be initiated as follows: one involving caspase-8 and the other involving caspase-9 as the most apical caspase. poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp aldehyde benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aminofluoromethyl coumarin tumor necrosis factor phosphatidylserine 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide death effector domain Cytochrome c, which is usually present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, is released into the cytosol following the induction of apoptosis by many different stimuli including CD95, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemotherapeutic and DNA-damaging agents (12Liu X.

Mitochondria have been proposed to act as an amplifier in CD95-induced apoptosis when activation of caspase-8 cleaves a cytosolic substrate leading to release of cytochrome c (15Kuwana T. Smith J.J.

Release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3 is blocked by anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and promoted by proapoptotic members, such as Bax and Bak (13Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar, 17Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P.

A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). In chemical- or irradiation-induced apoptosis, cytochrome c release appears to be caspase-independent as it is not inhibited by the broad spectrum cell-permeable caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD.FMK (13Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar, 17Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P.

Mechanisms for the release of mitochondrial cytochrome cinclude opening of a mitochondrial permeability transition pore, the presence of a specific channel for cytochrome c in the outer membrane, or mitochondrial swelling and rupture of the outer membrane but without loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (14Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). None of these mechanisms appears generally applicable, as release of cytochromec occurs in cells with normal mitochondrial membrane potential (13Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar, 17Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar) and by a mechanism independent of rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane (20Zhuang J. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have highlighted another possible mechanism of mitochondrial cytochrome crelease, involving Bid, a BH3 domain-containing proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 results in translocation of the cleaved Bid to the mitochondria where it induces the release of cytochrome c, being 500-fold more potent than Bax (21Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 22Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain of Bid is essential both for its proapoptotic activity and its ability to induce the release of cytochrome c (22Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar,23Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In this study we address the order in which caspases are activated in receptor-mediated and chemical-induced apoptosis. Our data support the hypothesis that caspase-8 and caspase-9 are the most apical caspases in receptor-mediated and chemical-induced apoptosis, respectively. In chemical-induced apoptosis, cytochrome c release is caspase-independent and is not mediated by cleavage of Bid in contrast to receptor-mediated apoptosis. We propose that caspases act solely as executioners of apoptosis in chemical-induced apoptosis, whereas in receptor-mediated apoptosis they also form an integral part of the cell death-inducing mechanism.

All other chemicals and human recombinant TNF-α were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1) were obtained from ECACC and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Glutamax. Apoptosis in U937 cells was induced with etoposide (25 μm) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (0.9 μm) (24Zhuang J. Ren Y. Snowden R.T. Zhu H. Gogvadze V. Savill J.S. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

Apoptosis was quantified by PS exposure or by loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, assessed with DiOC6(3) (20Zhuang J. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on 12–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose (Hybond-C extra, Amersham, Bucks, UK). Caspases-3 and -7 were detected as described previously (26MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to caspase-8 was raised against the large subunit of caspase-8 (amino acids 210–374). The antibody obtained was characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis, which verified that the antibody recognized intact procaspase-8 and the p43 and p18 subunits. An antibody to caspase-9 was also raised, which recognized both the inactive proform and the activated ∼37- and 35-kDa processed forms. Cytochrome cantibody was purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The Bid antibody was kindly provided by Dr. X. Wang (22Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Cells were collected at the indicated times and washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in cytosol extraction buffer, and cytosolic extracts were prepared by the method described previously (19Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Jurkat cell lysates were prepared as described previously (26MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and activated by addition of dATP (2 mm), cytochrome c (0.25 mg/ml), and MgCl2 (2 mm) (12Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity (cleavage of Z-DEVD.AFC) of the lysate was measured as described previously (26MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.-M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of capsase-8 or -9 from Jurkat cell lysate was performed as described previously (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Both CD95 antibody and etoposide caused a time-dependent induction of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, as assessed both by an increase in externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) or by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (Figs.1 and 2). This was accompanied by a similar time-dependent processing of caspase-3, -7, -8, and -9 (Figs. 1 and 2). In Jurkat T cells, caspase-3 was present primarily as its intact 32-kDa proform (Fig.1 A, lane 1). Induction of both chemical- and receptor-mediated apoptosis resulted in loss of the proform of caspase-3 and appearance of three immunoreactive fragments of ∼20 kDa (p20), ∼19 kDa (p19), and ∼17 kDa (p17), following initial cleavage at Asp-175 and then at Asp-9 and Asp-28 (27Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Processing was first detected after 2–3 h treatment with either stimulus (Figs.1 A and 2 A, lanes 2–7).Figure 2Etoposide-induced time-dependent processing of caspases in Jurkat T cells. Jurkat T cells were incubated for the indicated times with etoposide (50 μm) either alone or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Z-VAD.FMK. Cells were then analyzed by Western blot analysis for the processing of caspase-3 (A), caspase-7 (B), caspase-8 (C), and caspase-9 (D), as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Caspase-7 was present in control Jurkat T cells primarily as a ∼35-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Treatment with both anti-CD95 antibody and etoposide resulted in a time-dependent processing of caspase-7 accompanied by the formation of two major products. These were a ∼32-kDa fragment, which probably represents the loss of the prodomain at DSVD23↓A, and a ∼19-kDa (p19) fragment, which corresponds to the catalytically active large subunit (Figs.1 B and 2 B, lanes 2–7) formed following cleavage at IQAD198↓S (27Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Processing of caspase-7 was first observed 2 h after treatment with either stimulus. In untreated Jurkat T cells, caspase-8 was present primarily as two isoforms of ∼55 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane 1), possibly corresponding to caspase-8a and -8b (7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 28Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Exposure to both anti-CD95 antibody and etoposide resulted in a time-dependent processing of caspase-8 initially to two fragments of ∼43 and 41 kDa (p43 and p41, respectively), corresponding to cleavage of both caspase-8a and -8b between the large and small subunits. This was followed by the appearance of a p18 subunit resulting from removal of the death effector domains from the 43- and 41-kDa fragments (Figs.1 C and 2C, lanes 2–7) (6Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 28Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). An increase in the processing of caspase-8 was first observed 2 and 2.5 h after CD95 and etoposide treatment, respectively. Untreated Jurkat cells contained the 46-kDa proform of caspase-9 (Fig.1 D, lane 1), which on induction of apoptosis was processed in a time-dependent manner to yield fragments of ∼37 and 35 kDa (p37 and p35) (Figs. 1 D and 2D, lanes 2–7), resulting from cleavage at both Asp-315 and Asp-330 (6Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The first detectable processing of caspase-9 was evident at 2 h (Figs. 1 D and 2 D). Thus, induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of both the activator caspases -8 and -9 and the effector caspases-3 and-7, which all appeared to occur simultaneously making it extremely difficult to distinguish the order in which they were activated. In order to further address this problem, we used the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.FMK, which inhibits apoptosis in many but not all systems (3Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). Slight inhibition of CD95-induced caspase processing was observed at Z-VAD.FMK (0.1 μm), with marked and almost total inhibition at 1.0 and 10 μm,respectively (Fig. 1, A–D, lanes 8–10). Higher concentrations of Z-VAD.FMK were required to inhibit etoposide-induced processing of these caspases (Fig. 2, A—D, lanes 8–10). Z-VAD.FMK (10 and 25 μm) largely but not completely inhibited the processing of caspases-3, -7, and -9 (Fig. 2, A—D, lanes 8 and 9). As caspase-9 processes caspases-3 and -7 (10Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar, 29Srinivasan A. Li F. Wong A. Kodandapani L. Smidt Jr., R. Krebs J.F. Fritz L.C. Wu J.C. Tomaselli K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4523-4529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), these data support the suggestion that one of the important targets of Z-VAD.FMK in etoposide-induced apoptosis may be either the processing or the activity of caspase-9. However Z-VAD.FMK (10 μm) completely inhibited the processing of caspase-8, which suggested that caspase-8 was activated downstream of caspases-3 and -7. Most importantly these data strongly suggested that the order of caspase activation and the Z-VAD.FMK target(s) were different in etoposide- and CD95-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. The different cellular effects of Z-VAD.FMK on etoposide- and CD95-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells provided further support for this hypothesis. Both CD95 and etoposide induced apoptosis, as assessed either by an increase in externalization of PS (Fig.3, B and D) or by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3, G andI). Z-VAD.FMK (10 μm) completely inhibited CD95-induced apoptosis assessed by both these criteria (Fig. 3,C and H). However, Z-VAD.FMK (25 μm) did not inhibit etoposide-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3 J) but did inhibit PS exposure (Fig. 3 E). Z-VAD.FMK (25 μm) also did not inhibit etoposide-induced decrease in cell size as measured by forward light scatter (Fig. 3, E and J). Taken together, these data suggest that in CD95-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells the intracellular target of Z-VAD.FMK is most likely the activator caspase-8 acting upstream of mitochondria, whereas in etoposide-induced apoptosis the target(s) is the activation/processing of caspase-9, which is activated downstream of perturbation of mitochondria. In order to substantiate this hypothesis, we examined the effects of Z-VAD.FMK on the release of mitochondrial cytochromec. In agreement with other studies, CD95 induced a time-dependent increase of cytochromec in the cytosol, most probably due to an increased release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (Fig.4 A). Z-VAD.FMK (10 μm) inhibited this increase (Fig. 4 A), further demonstrating that it inhibited a caspase upstream of the mitochondrial changes. Etoposide also induced a time-dependent increase in cytosolic cytochrome c; however, Z-VAD.FMK (25 μm) did not inhibit this increase (Fig. 4 B) further supporting the hypothesis that the target of Z-VAD.FMK in etoposide-induced apoptosis is downstream of mitochondria. In order to determine if such differences between receptor-mediated and chemically induced apoptosis also occurred in other cells, we examined a human lymphoid tumor cell line, U937, which is sensitive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Both TNF/cycloheximide and etoposide caused an induction of apoptosis in U937 cells, assessed by PS externalization, which was accompanied by an increase in cytosolic cytochrome c, processing of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP, a commonly used measure of caspase-3-like enzymic activity (Fig.5, A–C). Z-VAD.FMK completely inhibited TNF/cycloheximide-induced apoptosis assessed by all these criteria. In contrast, in etoposide-induced apoptosis Z-VAD.FMK completely inhibited PS externalization and the cleavage of PARP but only partially inhibited processing of caspase-3 and did not inhibit the increase in cytosolic cytochrome c. Thus Z-VAD.FMK was more effective at blocking the activity rather than the processing of caspase-3. Taken together, the data from both Jurkat and U937 cells support the hypothesis that Z-VAD.FMK inhibits a target upstream of mitochondria in receptor (CD95 or TNF)-mediated apoptosis, whereas in etoposide-induced apoptosis the Z-VAD.FMK target is downstream of mitochondria. In order to gain further insight into the order of caspase activation in chemical-mediated apoptosis, the processing of various caspases was studied in Jurkat cell lysates, a well established model for understanding postmitochondrial caspase cascades (12Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). Activation of lysates, which resulted in an increased caspase-3-like DEVDase activity, was accompanied by a time-dependent processing of caspases (Fig. 6). Processing of the effector caspases-3 and -7 was first observed after 5 min, and these caspases were almost completely processed after 60 min (Fig. 6, lanes 1–7). Caspase-9 was very rapidly and extensively processed to both its p37 and p35 fragments, initial processing being observed by 1 min and virtually complete processing noted at 30 min (Fig. 6, lanes 1–7). In marked contrast, processing of caspase-8 was first observed at 30 min, when a small amount was processed only to its ∼41- and 43-kDa fragments (Fig. 6,lanes 1–7). Co-incubation of lysates with two different caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD.FMK or benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-aldehyde (IETD.CHO), resulted in a marked inhibition of the processing of all the caspases with caspase-9 being somewhat less sensitive to inhibition than the other caspases (Fig. 6, lanes 8 and 9). Thus caspase inhibitors may also block the processing of caspases activated by a caspase cascade downstream of mitochondria. To elucidate further the role of caspases-8 and -9 in the postmitochondrial caspase cascade, they were immunodepleted from lysates, and the subsequent ability of the lysate to be activated was assessed. In the presence of dATP/cytochrome c, lysates from control Jurkat cells exhibited a marked DEVDase activity (TableI). Immunodepletion of caspase-8 caused only a very slight decrease in DEVDase activity demonstrating that caspase-8 contributed little to this activity (Table I). Western blot analysis demonstrated that immunodepletion of caspase-8 resulted only in loss of this caspase but not of other caspases (data not shown). In contrast, immunodepletion of caspase-9 resulted in complete inhibition of DEVDase activity (Table I) without loss of caspases-3, -7, and -8 (data not shown) demonstrating the key role of caspase-9 in the postmitochondrial processing of caspases. Taken together these results lend strong support to the hypothesis that caspase-9 is the first caspase activated in a caspase cascade following perturbation of mitochondria and release of cytochrome c.Table IImmunodepletion of caspase-9 but not caspase-8 inhibits cytochrome c/dATP-dependent activationLysate treatmentDEVDasenmol/mg/minControl14.2Preimmune rabbit serum12.2Caspase-8 antibody10.1Caspase-9 antibody0.07Jurkat lysate was prepared and immunodepleted with either preimmune serum, caspase-8, or caspase-9 antibody, and the proteolytic activity (DEVDase) of the control lysate and the immunodepleted lysates was then measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Jurkat lysate was prepared and immunodepleted with either preimmune serum, caspase-8, or caspase-9 antibody, and the proteolytic activity (DEVDase) of the control lysate and the immunodepleted lysates was then measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cleavage of Bid is important for the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in CD95-induced apoptosis (21Li H.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 are activated by oxidative stress in cardiac myocytes and protect cardiac myocytes from apoptosis. Prostaglandins (PG) also protect cells from injury in a number of tissues, including the cardiomyocyte. Cyclooxygenase (COX) the rate-limiting enzyme in PG biosynthesis has two isoforms, the constitutive COX-1 and an inducible COX-2. Here, we examined the effects of two oxidative stresses, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the anthracycline doxorubicin on the activity of ERK1/2 and the expression of COX isoforms and PG formation in neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes. These cells expressed COX-1 at rest and both COX isoforms on treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Exposure to 50 μmH2O2 for 10 min or doxorubicin at 10 and 100 μg/ml caused expression of COX-2 that was prevented by free radical scavengers. COX-2 induction was associated with activation of ERK1/2 and the specific ERK-inhibitor PD098059 abolished COX-2 expression. Treatment of cells with decoy oligonucleotides corresponding to COX-2 promoter elements implicated the AP-1 and NF-κB-2 but not the NF-κB-1 in the transcription of COX-2. Induction of COX-2 mRNA and protein was accompanied by increased prostacyclin formation, which was abolished by the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, and PD098059. H2O2 and doxorubicin enhanced the release of lactate dehydrogenase and free radical scavengers prevented this. NS-398 enhanced the release of lactate dehydrogenase in response to H2O2 and doxorubicin, whereas the injury was prevented by iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue. In cardiomyocytes cell injury by H2O2 and doxorubicin is limited by an increase in prostacyclin formation that reflects induction of COX-2 mediated by ERK1/2 activation.

Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in an abrupt aggravation of cardiomyocyte injury, demonstrated experimentally by the re-introduction of oxygen into hypoxic myocardium (1Hearse D.J. Humphrey S.M. Nayler W.G. Slade A. Border D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1975; 7: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).

Biol. 1977; 78: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The O·̄2 produced is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutase, a weak free radical that reacts with O·̄2 to generate the highly active hydroxyl radical (⋅OH). Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin induce cardiac injury in a similar manner, in that they are metabolized to the corresponding semiquinone free radical by broadly distributed enzymes, flavin reductases (7Boveris A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 78: 67-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 8Bachur N.R. Gordon S.C. Gee M.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 901-910PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to causing tissue injury, free radicals induce genes that are protective, such as hemoxygenase-1, which generates the antioxidant, biliverdin (9Doroshow J.H. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4543-4551PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase is likewise cytoprotective in several tissues (10Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J. Clin.

The mechanism of the protective role played by ERK1/2 activation is unknown. We investigated a possible link between ERK1/2 activation and COX-2 expression in cardiomyocytes injured by oxygen-free radicals and used a transcription factor decoy approach to decipher the role of the promoter elements NF-κB and AP-1 in COX-2 induction.

Iloprost was from Schering AG, Berlin, Germany. ERK1/2 inhibitor PD098059 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared by a modification of the method originally described by Simpson et al. (26Simpson P. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts from 1 to 3-day-old Wistar rats were minced and dissociated with approximately 80 units/ml type II collagenase and 0.06% pancreatin. Dispersed cells were incubated in 25-cm2 flasks for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Nonattached viable cells were collected and seeded into fresh flasks at a density of 1.5 × 105cells/ml. To obtain a near-pure cardiomyocyte preparation, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Ham's F-12 supplemented with 1.2 g/liter sodium hydrogen carbonate, 10% (v/v) NBS containing 1 mm pyruvic acid, 1 μg/ml transferrin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml sodium selenite, 250 μm vitamin C, 100 μm 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. This medium was replaced with medium containing no NBS at 48 h. The cells were incubated for 24 h before addition of the test compounds. On day 4 following the isolation, cardiomyocytes grown in 25-cm2 flasks were rinsed twice with PBS. PMA was added to medium without NBS and incubated with cells for 6 h. For negative controls, cardiomyocytes were incubated with medium alone. Following treatment the medium was removed and cells were washed with PBS and medium containing COX inhibitors were then added: 200 μm aspirin for 30 min or 1 μm NS-398 for 45 min. All cells were then washed twice with PBS and 2 ml of HBSS was added containing 50 μm arachidonic acid (peroxide free) for 10 min to measure the maximum amount of prostaglandin formed. The supernatants were stored at −70 °C for PG analysis. On day 4 following isolation, the cardiomyocytes were rinsed twice with PBS. H2O2, 50 μm and 0.5 mm, or 100 μg/ml DX (172 μm) was added to medium without NBS and incubated with cells for 10 or 80 min, respectively. For negative controls cardiomyocytes were incubated with medium alone for equivalent amounts of time. Oxygen-free radical scavengers PEG-CAT (200 units/ml) and PEG-superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml) were added to cells 1 h before treating with DX. The medium was then removed, the cells washed with PBS and fresh medium added to allow cells recover for 10 min, 3 h, and 10 h. At these time points medium was removed and stored at −70 °C for LDH analysis. The cells were then washed with PBS and medium containing COX inhibitors were added: 200 μm aspirin for 30 min or 1 μm NS-398 for 45 min. All cells were then washed twice with PBS and 2 ml of HBSS was added containing 50 μm arachidonic acid (peroxide-free) for 10 min to measure the maximum amount of PG formed. This HBSS was stored at −70 °C for analysis. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and either lysed in protein 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and stored at −20 °C for Western blot analysis or scraped into Tri-Reagent and stored at −70 °C for RNA isolation. In further experiments cells were treated with 1 μm NS-398 alone, or 10 μg/ml DX (17.2 μm) with or without 1 μm NS-398, or with 10 μg/ml DX in the presence of 200 units/ml PEG-CAT and 200 units/ml PEG-superoxide dismutase for 24 h. As above the medium was removed and stored at −70 °C for LDH analysis, the cells washed with PBS and 2 ml of HBSS was added containing 50 μm arachidonic acid for 10 min. The HBSS was stored at −70 °C for PG analysis. The cells were washed and scraped into Tri-Reagent and stored at −70 °C for mRNA analysis. Cells were treated with 30 nm iloprost alone, or with 1–100 nm iloprost, or medium alone (positive control) for 24 h, before treating with 0.5 mm H2O2 or 100 μg/ml DX, and LDH released into medium was measured. Cells were also treated both with the PGF2α analog, 30 μm fluprostenol alone, or 30 μm fluprostenol with 0.5 mmH2O2 or 100 μg/ml DX, and LDH released into medium was measured. The cells were subsequently scraped into Tri-Reagent for COX-2 mRNA analysis. Cells were pretreated with 50 μm PD098059 or 20 μm SB203580 for 1 h, before being exposed to 50 μm H2O2 or 100 μg/ml DX with PD098059 or SB203580 for 10 or 80 min, respectively. Following exposure cells were allowed to recover in serum-free medium with 50 μm PD098059 or 20 μm SB203580 for 3 h. As a positive control cardiomyocytes were incubated with 50 μm H2O2 or 100 μg/ml DX alone, for 10 or 80 min, respectively, followed by a 3-h incubation of cells in serum-free medium. As discussed above, all cells were washed with PBS and 2 ml of HBSS was added containing 50 μmarachidonic acid for 10 min. The HBSS was stored at −70 °C for PG analysis. The cells were washed and either lysed in protein lysis buffer or scraped into Tri-Reagent for mRNA analysis. Cells were treated with 50 μmH2O2 or 100 μg/ml DX and 50 μmPD098059 or 20 μm SB203580 with the same positive and negative controls. All cells were then washed with PBS and ERK1/2 activity was measured using p44/p42 MAP kinase assay kit. Transcription factor decoy oligomers were synthesized by a method previously described by Schmedtje et al. (27Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.-S. Liu W.L. Dubois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar)in vitro by annealing the complementary strands in 1 × annealing buffer (20 μm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 μm MgCl2, and 50 μm NaCl). The mixture was heated to 80 °C and allowed to cool to room temperature slowly over 3 h. The oligomers were designed from two NF-κB binding regions and one AP-1-like binding region on the rat COX-2 promoter. The NF-κB sequences used were, the distal site to the COX-2 promoter, (NF-κB-1) −413 5′-GAGAGGCAAGGGGATTCCCTTAGTTAG-3′ −386 and the proximal site to the COX-2 promoter, (NF-κB-2) −98 5′-GGGGGTGGGGAAAGCCGAGGCGGAAA-3′ −72. The AP-1-like sequence was −173 5′-TCATTTGCGTGAGTAAAGCCTGCC-3′ −149. A double-stranded DNA with a scrambled sequence (5′-CAGGAGAGTATCCTGCGATGCATCTGCT-3′) in the place of the NF-κB and AP-1-like elements was used as a control in the decoy experiments. Decoy naked double-stranded DNA was placed in the medium at a concentration of 20 μm 1 h before exposing cells to 50 μm H2O2 for 10 min, or 100 μg/ml DX for 80 min. For the 3-h recovery fresh decoy naked double-stranded DNA was added to medium at 20 μm, enabling sequestration of the transcription factor in the cytoplasm. As discussed under “Treatment of Cells with Hydrogen Peroxide and Doxorubicin,” all cells were washed with PBS and 2 ml of HBSS was added containing 50 μm arachidonic acid for 10 min. The HBSS was stored at −70 °C for PG analysis. The cells were washed and either lysed in protein lysis buffer or scraped into Tri-Reagent for mRNA analysis. This procedure was used to compare the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNAs between untreated and treated cells. Each pair of sense and antisense primers were designed to span at least one intron of the gene to exclude contaminating genomic DNA. Primers used were: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 5′-AACCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGAT-3′ (antisense); COX-1 5′-TCACAAGAGTACAGCTATGAGCAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGGCTGGCACTTCTCCAGCATCAG-3′ (antisense); COX-2 5′-CCCTGCTGGTGGAAAAGCCTCGTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACTGTAGGGTTAATGTCATCTAG-3′ (antisense). Total RNA isolated from Tri-Reagent was reverse transcribed into cDNA and this was used as template for the PCR. RNA samples of 1 μg were denatured at 65 °C for 10 min. 100 ng of random hexamers, 1 × reverse transcription buffer, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 25 μm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were added and incubated at 37 °C overnight in a reaction volume of 20 μl. The reverse transcription reaction was stopped by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. A 1:10 volume of the generated cDNA reaction was used in the subsequent amplification reaction. PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume with 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mmdeoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.5 μm of each sense and antisense primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The reaction cycles were denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 56 °C for GAPDH and COX-2 for 1 min, annealing at 52 °C for COX-1 for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR cycle profiles for GAPDH, COX-1, and COX-2 were performed. Products were run on agarose gels (1.2%) with PGEM DNA markers. Polaroid instant photographs were taken of the gels with a Polaroid DS34 direct screen instant camera. Expression of COX-1 and COX-2 were normalized with respect to GAPDH from parallel samples. In order to verify that the band produced at the correct size was rat COX-2 cDNA, this band was excised from gel, purified, cloned into PCR 2.1 vector, and sequenced (ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer, Perkin-Elmer). Lysates were prepared by treating cells with lysis buffer. Protein concentration was measured using a protein Bio-Rad assay, according to the manufacturer's procedure. Lysate samples (20 μg of protein/lane) were applied to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 40 V constant voltage at 4 °C with use of a Western blot transfer apparatus. Immunostaining for COX expression was performed with a goat polyclonal anti-COX-1 antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-COX-2 antibody, (R6), raised against the recombinant full-length mouse (m) COX-2 expressed by baculovirus. R6 antibody is pre-absorbed with COX-2 (21 μm) but not COX-1 (25 μm) (28Kaufmann W.E. Worley P. Pegg F.J. Bremer M. Isakson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2317-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Immunostaining for ERK1/2 was performed with mouse monoclonal antibodies and developed with a horseradish peroxidase Western blot detection kit. Cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring LDH in the culture medium spectrophotometrically. The LDH release was standardized with a cell injury index defined at (A-B)/(C-B) × 100, where A = LDH activity in the test sample; B = LDH activity measured in media with no cells (0% control), and C = LDH activity in samples from wells in which cells were lysed with Triton X-100 (100% control). GC/MS was used to examine the range of PG formed by resting and PMA-stimulated cardiomyocytes. For each sample, 200 μl of supernatant was removed and spiked with deuterated internal standards. Following 15 min of equilibration, the pH was lowered to pH 3 with 10% formic acid and the samples were extracted with ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum. The methoxylamine derivative was formed by adding 50 μl of a solution containing 0.5% methoxylamine in pyridine and incubating overnight at room temperature. The sample was then dried under vacuum. Derivitization to the pentafluorobenzyl ester was accomplished by adding 10 μl of diidopropylethylamine and 20 μl of 10% pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetronitrile to the methoxylamine derivative of the sample which was then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The sample was again dried under vacuum before being resuspended in 20 μl ofN′-O′-bis(trimethylsilyl)- acetamide and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were redried under vacuum and brought up in 15 μl of dodecane. GC/MS was performed on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph (GC) linked to a Finnigan Incos XL mass spectrometer (MS) operated in the negative ion, chemical ionization mode, using methane as the reagent gas. Source and interface temperatures were 150 and 310 °C, respectively. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a 30-m MS5 capillary column and operated in splitless mode, with an injector temperature of 250 °C. Following sample injection (3 μl), the GC temperature was ramped from 190 to 310 °C at 20 °C/min. Analytes were monitored by selected monitoring of the mass ion, using INCOS data system. GC/MS demonstrated that 6-keto-PGF1α was the main PG metabolite generated in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Thereafter 6-keto-PGF1α was measured by enzyme immunoassay (Assay Design, Ann Arbor, MI). All quantitative data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The data were analyzed by parametric unpaired Student's t test. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Morphological examination on the third day following isolation showed a synchronous and rhythmically contracting monolayer of cardiomyocytes. GC/MS analysis showed that the primary prostaglandin product in cardiomyocytes is prostacyclin ≫ PGE2 >PGF2α > TXB2 (TableI). Similar levels of PG formation by cardiomyocytes have been reported (29Church D.J. Van der Bent V. Vallotton M.B. Lang U. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Formation of both 6-keto-PGF1α and PGE2 was significantly enhanced in response to PMA but neither PGF2α nor TXB2 were altered (Table I). Selective inhibition of COX-2 activity by 1 μm NS-398 specifically abolished the PMA-induced increase in 6-keto-PGF1α and PGE2, demonstrating that the increase in these PGs was COX-2-dependent. Inhibition of COX activity by 200 μm aspirin prevented TXB2generation, showing that its generation was COX-1-dependent. PGF2α appears to be generated non-enzymatically.Table IProstaglandin generation (pg/mg of protein/10 min) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytesProstaglandinsNon-treatedPMA-treatedPMA-treated + NS398PMA-treated + ASA6-Keto-PGF1α1,872 (±201)16,582 (±2002)1,892 (±192)592 (±69)PGE2679 (±80)3,998 (±467)569 (±73)152 (±21)PGF2α258 (±31)248 (±51)261 (±29)259 (±38)TXB2108 (±33)142 (±21)92 (±12)42 (±8)The main prostaglandins generated by cardiomyocytes were 6-keto-PGF1α and PGE2, which were PMA-induced. This induction was blocked by NS-398, a specific COX-2 inhibitor. PGF2α or TXB2 formation was not significantly enhanced by PMA stimulation. Cells that were PMA-treated with aspirin show that PGF2α is nonenzymatically generated and TXB2 production was mostly COX-1-dependent. Open table in a new tab The main prostaglandins generated by cardiomyocytes were 6-keto-PGF1α and PGE2, which were PMA-induced. This induction was blocked by NS-398, a specific COX-2 inhibitor. PGF2α or TXB2 formation was not significantly enhanced by PMA stimulation. Cells that were PMA-treated with aspirin show that PGF2α is nonenzymatically generated and TXB2 production was mostly COX-1-dependent. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to 50 μmH2O2 for 10 min which did not effect cell viability. RT-PCR analysis (Fig.1 A) showed that H2O2-induced COX-2 expression at 3 h did not affect mRNA levels of COX-1 or the housekeeping gene, GAPDH. There was a corresponding increase in COX-2 protein, whereas the expression of COX-1 did not change (Fig. 1 B). H2O2 also induced 6-keto-PGF1αproduction at 3 h, with levels returning to baseline by 10 h (Fig. 1 C), as did the expression of COX-2 protein and mRNA. 1 μm NS-398 had no effect on product formation at baseline or at 10 min of recovery, but abolished the increase in 6-keto-PGF1α at 3 h, demonstrating that this increase was COX-2-dependent. NS-398 did not effect the expression of COX-2 message and was therefore only inhibiting product activity (data not shown). Aspirin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, reduced the amount of 6-keto-PGF1α formed at all time points. Addition of 10 or 100 μg/ml doxorubicin to cells resulted in a marked and rapid reduction in their rate of contraction. Once doxorubicin was removed, however, and cells were allowed to recover for 20 min, a normal rate of contraction was restored. Addition of 100 μg/ml doxorubicin to cells for 80 min, followed by a 3-h recovery, did not cause cells to apoptose appreciably. However, 10 μg/ml doxorubicin over 24 h induced cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and blebs in the cell membrane in about 10% of cells. 100 μg/ml doxorubicin induced a time-dependent change in COX-2 mRNA levels (Fig.2 A), detectable after 10 min and peaking after 3 h recovery, without any change in COX-1 or GAPDH mRNA levels. 200 units/ml PEG-superoxide dismutase and PEG-CAT prevented COX-2 expression, demonstrating a role for free radicals in doxorubicin-mediated COX-2 induction. Doxorubicin (100 μg/ml) also caused an increase in 6-keto-PGF1αformation after 3 h (Fi"

The L-form contains a leader sequence that is required for transport to mitochondria, whereas the S-form lacks the leader sequence. A construct encoding the leader sequence of PHGPx tagged with green fluorescent protein was used to transfect RBL-2H3 cells, and the fusion protein was transported to mitochondria. The L-form of PHGPx was identified as the mitochondrial form of PHGPx and the S-form as the non-mitochondrial form of PHGPx since preferential enrichment of mitochondria for PHGPx was detected in M15 cells that overexpressed theL-form of PHGPx, whereas no similar enrichment was detected in L9 cells that overexpressed the S-form. Cell death caused by mitochondrial injury due to potassium cyanide (KCN) or rotenone (chemical hypoxia) was considerably suppressed in the M15 cells, whereas the L9 cells and control RBL-2H3 cells (S1 cells, transfected with the vector alone) succumbed to the cytotoxic effects of KCN. Flow cytometric analysis showed that mitochondrial PHGPx suppressed the generation of hydroperoxide, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the loss of plasma membrane integrity that are induced by KCN. Mitochondrial PHGPx might prevent changes in mitochondrial functions and cell death by reducing intracellular hydroperoxides. Mitochondrial PHGPx failed to protect M15 cells from mitochondrial injury by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, which directly reduces membrane potential without the generation of hydroperoxides. M15 cells were more resistant than L9 cells to cell death caused by direct damage to mitochondria and to extracellular oxidative stress. L9 cells were more resistant totert-butylhydroperoxide than S1 cells, whereas resistance to t-butylhydroperoxide was even more pronounced in M15 cells than in L9 cells. These results suggest that mitochondria might be a target for intracellular and extracellular oxidative stress and that mitochondrial PHGPx, as distinct form non-mitochondrial PHGPx, might play a primary role in protecting cells from oxidative stress.

Mitochondria are a major physiological source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations ROSreactive oxygen speciesBSObuthionine sulfoximineCCCPcarbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazonecGPxcytosolic glutathione peroxidaseDCFH-DA5,6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetateGFPgreen fluorescent proteinLDHlactate dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePHGPxphospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidasePIpropidium iodideRBLrat basophile leukemia cellsRh123rhodamine 123t-BuOOHtert-butylhydroperoxideTNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αSODsuperoxide dismutaseBSAbovine serum albumin which can be generated during mitochondrial respiration (1Guarnieri C. Muscari C. Caldarera C.M. Emerit I. Chance B. Free Radicals and Aging. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1992: 73-77Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Superoxide radicals, formed by minor side reactions of the mitochondrial electron transport chain or by an NADH-independent enzyme, can be converted to H2O2 and to the powerful oxidant, the hydroxyl radical (2Nohl H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondria are continually exposed to ROS that cause peroxidation of membrane lipids, cleavage of mitochondrial DNA, and impairment of ATP generation, with resultant irreversible damage to mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction might contribute to the pathogenesis of various human neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy, aging, and the AIDS dementia complex (3Shigenaga M.K.

However, ROS don't have exclusively toxic effects; low levels of ROS generated in mitochondria can act as signaling molecules under physiological conditions. ROS produced in mitochondria can activate transcription factors, such as NFκB and AP-1 (6Rao G.N. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27760-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and can function as signals in apoptosis that is induced by TNF-α (7Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol.

The importance of antioxidant enzymes in mitochondria is indicated by the fact that knock-out mice without a gene for Mn-SOD suffer from catastrophic effects (10Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). By contrast, knock-out mice without a gene for cGPx are quite vigorous. Some of these tissues remain very resistant to oxidative stress even though GPx is the only antioxidant enzyme that is known to reduce the H2O2 produced by Mn-SOD in mitochondria since mitochondria in most mammalian cells lack catalase activity (11Esworthy R.S. Ho Y.S. Chu F.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Two types of GPx, namely cGPx and PHGPx, are located in mitochondria. PHGPx is the only known intracellular antioxidant enzyme that can directly reduce peroxidized phospholipids (12Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and cholesterol (13Thomas J.P. Maiorino M. Ursini F. Girotti A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 454-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in membranes. Therefore, PHGPx that can reduce H2O2, rather than cGPx, is thought to contribute to the enzymatic defenses against oxidative damage to mitochondria (14Flohé L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 643-731Google Scholar). However, the PHGPx in mitochondria has not been fully characterized. We previously cloned a cDNA for PHGPx from the rat (15Imai H. Sumi D. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Sugiyama A. Chiba N. Kuchino Y. Nakagawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that a short 20-kDa (S-form) and a long 23-kDa (L-form) form of PHGPx were translated from the cDNA, which included two potential sites for the initiation of translation in vitro(16Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We showed that the L-form included a leader sequence and was selectively imported into the mitochondria of rat liver by an import system in vitro (16Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Stable transformants of rat basophile leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells, in which the S-form of PHGPx was overexpressed, were resistant to the cell death caused by a radical initiator or oxidized lipids (17Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The S-form of PHGPx markedly inhibited the production of leukotrienes by 5-lipoxygenase by preventing production of intracellular hydroperoxides around the nucleus (18Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study, RBL-2H3 cells that overexpressed theL-form of PHGPx were established and compared with those that overexpressed the S-form in an attempt to estimate the functional roles of the two types of PHGPx in protection against intracellular and extracellular oxidative stress. The L-form of PHGPx was more effective than the S-form in preventing cell death that was caused by ROS generated in mitochondria and by exogenously added hydroperoxides. Antibodies against PHGPx and cGPx were prepared as described previously (17Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against histone H1 and125I-protein A (2.60–3.70 TBq/g) were purchased from Cosmobio Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and ICN Biochemicals Inc. (Irvine, CA), respectively. Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), 5,6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA), andcis-parinaric acid were obtained from Funakoshi Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Ammonium 7-fluoroben-2-oxa-1,3-diazo-4-sulfonate (SBD-F) and tri-n-butyl phosphine were obtained from Wako Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Propidium iodide (PI) and monoclonal antibodies against cytochrome oxidase subunit IV was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). KCN, rotenone, CCCP, oligomycin, and BSO were purchased from Sigma. A BamHI fragment of pRPHGPx4 (16Arai M. Imai H. Sumi D. Imanaka T. Takano T. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pSRα, as the expression vector, to construct pSRα-L-form PHGPx that encoded theL-form of PHGPx (19Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S-probe and L-probe were made from pRPHGPx4 by polymerase chain reactions for construction of S-GFP and L-GFP. The primers for construction of the S-probe, in which the cDNA encoded the 42 amino acids from the first residue of the S-form of PHGPx, were 5′-ACATAAGCTTGCTGGCACCATGTGTGCA-3′ and 5′-ATTAGGTACCGGCCACGTTGGTGACGAT-3′. The primers for construction of the L-probe, in which the cDNA encoded the 32 amino acids from the first residue of the L-form of PHGPx, were 5′-ATTTAAGCTTCCGGCCGCCGAGATGAGC-3′ and 5′-ATTAGGTACCGCGGGATGCACACATGGT-3′. The BamHI andKpnI fragments of S-probe and L-probe were inserted between the BamHI and KpnI sites of the GFP expression vector (pCMX-SAP/Y145 F) that had been constructed by Ogawa et al. (20Ogawa H.

We used the previously established control line of cells (S1 cells) and L9 cells that overexpressed the S-form (non-mitochondrial) of PHGPx (17Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). M15 cells, which overexpressed the L-form (mitochondrial) of PHGPx, were established by the transfection of RBL-2H3 cells with pSRα-L-form PHGPx and pSV2neo by electroporation, as described previously (17Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A suspension of RBL-2H3 cells (1 × 107 cells/0.25 ml) was transferred to an electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm gap; Bio-Rad) with a total of 20 μg of linearized DNA, which consisted of 18 μg of each expression vector and 2 μg of pSV2neo, used to confer resistance to G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.) (21Southen P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). A potential difference of 250 V at 500 microfarads was applied at room temperature with a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad), and cell culture was reinitiated after a 10-min recovery period. Selection for resistance G418 (1 mg/ml) was initiated after 24 h, and cells were subsequently exposed to G418 at 0.5 mg/ml for 2 weeks. Individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders. Levels of expression of PHGPx were determined by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against PHGPx, and cells that overexpressed the L-form of PHGPx were isolated. Control cells and cells that overexpressed the L-form or the S-form of PHGPx were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 5% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Cells were labeled with 140 nCi/ml [75Se]sodium selenite (3126 Ci/g; MURR) for 96 h to determine the distribution of PHGPx and cGPx in cells. Confluent cells in 225-cm2 culture flasks were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by treatment with trypsin. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 700 ×g for 5 min at room temperature and then [75Se]sodium selenite-labeled cells were fractionated as described previously (18Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was suspended in sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm imidazole, and 0.1% (v/v) ethanol, with leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin A added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml each and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, pH 7.2) and centrifuged at 700 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in the same buffer at approximately 1.5 × 107 cells/ml and homogenized with a Teflon/glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. A nuclear fraction (pellet) and a postnuclear fraction (supernatant) were prepared by centrifugation at 700 × g for 10 min. The nuclear fraction was suspended in 200 μl of the sucrose buffer. Mitochondrial, microsomal, and cytosolic fractions from the postnuclear fraction were obtained by differential centrifugation as described by de Duve et al. (22de Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1995; 60: 604-617Crossref Scopus (2573) Google Scholar). Each subcellular fraction was examined by standard enzymatic assays for activities of cytochrome coxidase (a mitochondrial marker), NADPH-cytochrome creductase (a microsomal marker), and lactate dehydrogenase (a cytosolic marker) as reported previously (23Roderick A.C. Michael F.M. Jan-Willem T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol.

The distribution of histone H1, as a nuclear marker, was determined by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against histone H1 (25Lawrence J.J. Daure M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3301-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purity of each subcellular fraction of M15 cells was determined according to our previous paper in which the the purity of each organelle of control cells and non-mitochondrial PHGPx overexpressing cells including S1 and L9 cells has been determined (18Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The purity of each subfractionation in M15 cells was the same as those in S1 and L9 cells. Cytochromec oxidase was distributed in nuclear (7.9%),mitochondrial (75.6%), microsomal (3.5%), and cytosolic (12.9%) fractions of M15 cells. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activities were found in nuclear (5.9%), mitochondrial (16.7%), microsomal (68.3%), and cytosolic (9.1%) fractions of M15 cells. The nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions were solublized in 200 μl of 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C, and each solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were supplemented into 400 μl each of PBS and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against PHGPx and cGPx, as described previously (17Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% polyacrylamide) under non-reducing conditions. Gels were stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Total levels of PHGPx and cGPx were calculated from results of scanning densitometry after autoradiography with a Bio-Imaging Analyzer (BAS2000; Fuji Film, Tokyo). Activities of PHGPx and cGPx were measured after the fractionation of cytosol and mitochondria from each cell line (1.5 × 108 cells). Mitochondrial fraction was sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants obtained from mitochondrial fraction and cytosolic fraction were used for assays of PHGPx and cGPx activities. PHGPx activity was determined by using phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH) as the substrate according to the previous paper (18Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Activity of cGPx was determined by using hydrogen peroxide as the substrate (18Imai H. Narashima K. Arai M. Sakamoto H. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1990-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The total activity of SOD was measured in terms of the percentage inhibition of the formation of superoxide by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system (26Crapo J.D. Mccord J.M. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Mn-SOD activity was measured in the presence of 5 mm KCN, and Cu,Zn-SOD activity was calculated by subtraction of the activity of Mn-SOD from the total SOD activity. RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with plasmids that encoded GFP, L-GFP, or S-GFP by electroporation, as described above. Transfected cells were cultured on coverslips in 35-mm dishes in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After 24 h, cells were fixed for 20 min on coverslips with 4% formaldehyde and washed with Hanks' balanced salts solution. The fluorescence of cells was monitored and photographed with an Axiovert 135M inverted microscope (Carl Zwiss, Germany) equipped with a Planapochromat 63 × objective and a filter pack appropriate for GFP fluorescence. GFP and mitochondria were simultaneously detected in the same cells by the double staining with GFP fluorescence and a monoclonal antibody of Cy3-conjugated anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV that was a specific probe for the mitochondrial staining (27Capaldi R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 569-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Fixed cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA at 25 °C for 30 min. The cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml mouse anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV monoclonal antibodies diluted with 2% BSA-PBS at 25 °C for 2 h. Then the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted to 10 μg/ml with PBS containing 2% BSA at 25 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence of GFP and Cy3 in the same cells was monitored and photographed with an appropriate filter pack. S1, L9, and M15 cells were plated at 0.5 × 105 cells/well in flat-bottomed 96-well culture plates and cultured for 24 h. Individual transformants were exposed to indicated doses of KCN, rotenone, CCCP, oligomycin, ort-BuOOH for appropriate periods. The LDH release assay was used for the determination of the cell viability, as described elsewhere (17Imai H. Sumi D. Sakamoto H. Hanamoto A. Arai M. Chiba N. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In one series of experiments, cells were incubated for 12 h prior to exposure to KCN with 0.5 mm buthionine sulfoxamine (BSO) for depletion of GSH. Changes in the integrity of plasma membrane and in the mitochondrial membrane potential were examined by monitoring staining with propidium iodide (PI) and Rh123, respectively. After treatment with KCN, cells were stained with PI (5 mg/ml) and Rh123 (1 mg/ml) for 10 min. We also used an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe, 5,6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA), to assess levels of intracellular peroxides, as follows. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 2.5 μm DCFH-DA in PBS for 15 min. DCFH-loaded cells were incubated with or without 25 mm KCN for the times indicated. The intensity fluorescence from PI, Rh123, and dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in cells was analyzed with a flow cytometer (EPICS® Elite Flow cytometer; Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Cellular levels of ATP were determined by the luciferin-luciferase method using a kit from Sigma (29Naderi S. Melchior D.L Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 106 cells) were loaded with 20 mm cis-parinaric acid for 1.5 h at 37 °C and then washed with PBS. The loaded cells were treated with 25 mmKCN for the times indicated. After incubation, total lipids were extracted as described by Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.D. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of total lipids was monitored with a spectrofluorometric detector (RF-550; Shimazu Co. Ltd., Tokyo) with excitation at 303 nm and emission at 416 nm. Amounts of GSH in mitochondria and cytosol were measured according to the previous paper with a slight modification (28Imai K. Toyo'oka T. Watanabe Y. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In brief, S1, L9, and M15 cells (each 2 × 107 cell) were fractionated into cytosol and mitochondria. Cytosol and mitochondria dispersed with the sonication were precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 5%. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, GSH in the supernatant was converted to fluorescent derivative. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.02% ammonium 7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate (SBD-F) in 0.25m borate buffer, pH 10.5, which contained 5 mmEDTA and 1% tri-n-butyl phosphine. The reaction mixture kept at 60 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 4 n HCl, and fluorescent thiol derivatives were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (TSK-gel ODS; TOSOH Co. Ltd., Japan). The mobile phase was 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.0, tetrahydrofuran/acetonitrile (94.8:0.2:5). The fluorescent thiol derivatives were monitored with emission at 516 nm and excitation at 384 nm during elution at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Concentrations of protein were determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. All data from assays in which the number of replicates was three or more are expressed as mean values ± S.D. The L-form of PHGPx contains a leader sequence, but the S-form does not (Fig. 1). Chimeric proteins that included green fluorescent protein (GFP) were expressed in RBL-2H3 cells in order to determine whether the leader sequence of the L-form could serve to target GFP to the mitochondria of living cells. One fusion protein consisted of GFP with the leader sequence of 32 amino acids from the first residue of L-form (L-GFP) (Fig.1 B). The other was a fusion protein of GFP with 42 amino acids from the first residue of S-form (S-GFP) (Fig. 1 B). Expression vectors containing cDNA that encoded GFP,L-GFP, or S-GFP were used to transfect RBL-2H3 cells by electroporation and then the intracellular localization of fluorescence due to GFP was monitored with a fluorescence microscope 24 h later (Fig. 2). Fluorescence was diffusely distributed in cells that expressed S-GFP or GFP (Fig. 2, Aand B). By contrast, discrete regions with strong fluorescence were observed in cells that expressed L-GFP (Fig. 2 C). GFP and mitochondria in theL-GFP-transfected cells were simultaneously visualized by the double staining with GFP fluorescence and a monoclonal antibody of Cy3-conjugated anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (Fig. 2,C and D). The profile of fluorescence due to L-GFP was identical to that of mitochondrial cytochrome coxidase. Efficient import of GFP with the leader sequence of L-form into mitochondria indicates that the leader sequence at the amino terminus of mitochondrial PHGPx is the signal for targeting to mitochondria.Figure 2Targeting of L-GFP to the mitochondria of RBL-2H3 cells. Expression vectors encoding GFP (A), S-GFP (B), and L-GFP (C and D) were used to transfect RBL-2H3 cells. After the incubation for 24 h, fluorescent images of cells were photographed at higher magnification under a fluorescence microscope. RBL-2H3 cells that transfected with expression vector encoding L-GFP were double-stained with GFP fluorescence (C) and Cy3-conjugated anti-cytochromec oxidase monoclonal antibodies, which is a mitochondrion-specific probe (D). The black barhas a length of 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) RBL-2H3 cells were transfected by electroporation with cDNAs that encoded theL-form and the S-form of PHGPx (Fig. 1 A). Two types of transformant that stably expressed substantial levels of PHGPx were isolated after appropriate selection. M15 cells strongly expressed the L-form of PHGPx with the leader sequence and L9 cells expressed the S-form of PHGPx. The control line of cells (S1) had been transfected with the expression vector without an insert. The three kinds of transformants were labeled with [75Se]sodium selenite for 4 days for determination of the amounts of PHGPx and cGPx (TableI). The total amounts of PHGPx in L9 and M15 cells were 4 and 3.5 times higher than that in S1 cells, respectively. No significant differences in total respective amounts of cGPx, Cu,Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD were detected among L9, M15, and S1 cells.Table IThe levels of selenium-labeled PHGPx and cGPx and of Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD in S1, L9, and M15 cellsStrain75Se-PHGPx75Se-cGPxMn-SODCu,Zn-SODControl line of cellsS14.62 ± 0.13 × 10421.4 ± 0.8 × 1040.21 ± 0.029.66 ± 0.61Non-mitochondrial PHGPx-overexpressing cellsL918.0 ± 0.7 × 10420.6 ± 0.9 × 1040.18 ± 0.0310.70 ± 2.73Mitochondrial PHGPx-overexpressing cellsM1516.1 ± 0.6 × 10420.8 ± 0.8 × 1040.24 ± 0.0110.00 ± 1.52The amounts of PHGPx and cGPx were determined by measurements o"
https://openalex.org/W1969887954,"Two distinct signaling pathways, involving Wnt signaling and polycystin, have been found to be critical for normal kidney development. Renal tubulogenesis requires the presence of certain Wnt proteins, whereas mutations in polycystin impede the terminal differentiation of renal tubular epithelial cells, causing the development of large cystic kidneys that characterize autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Polycystin is an integral membrane protein, consisting of several extracellular motifs indicative of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, coupled through multiple transmembrane domains to a functionally active cytoplasmic domain. We report here that expression of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of polycystin stabilizes soluble endogenous β-catenin and stimulates TCF-dependent gene transcription in human embryonic kidney cells. Microinjection of the polycystin C-terminal cytoplasmic domain induces dorsalization in zebrafish. Our findings suggest that polycystin has the capacity to modulate Wnt signaling during renal development.

The kidney is widely used as a model system to study the intricacies of tissue induction underlying vertebrate organogenesis. Kidney development begins with the condensation of mesenchyme around the ureteric bud in response to a signal from the ureter. Through reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the mesenchyme, the metanephric mesenchyme evolves into the tubular epithelium that, together with a glomerulus, constitutes the mature nephron of the mammalian kidney (reviewed in Ref. 1Lechner M.S. Bressler G.R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Embryonic kidney induction is thought to require the presence of Wnts, a highly conserved family of developmentally important secreted signaling molecules involved in embryonic induction, generation of cell polarity, and the specification of cell fate (reviewed in Refs. 2Moon R.T.

Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with members of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression (4Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar,5Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). Certain Wnt family members appear to mediate renal morphogenesis. Wnt-1, a Wnt family member not expressed in the kidney, nevertheless induces metanephric mesenchyme to differentiate into glomerular and renal tubular epithelia (6Herzlinger D. Qiao J. Cohen D. Ramakrishna N. Brown A.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), whereas contact with the metanephric mesenchyme maintains Wnt-11 expression at the tip of the ureteric bud (7Pepicelli C.V. Kispert A. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal expression of Wnt-4 is required for kidney tubulogenesis; Wnt-4 −/− mice fail to form pretubular cell aggregates, a requisite stage of early tubule formation (8Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Thus, in the developing kidney, Wnts appear to be involved in the reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and surrounding mesenchyme that enable the latter to differentiate into epithelial tubule cells.Polycystin, the gene product of PKD1, is an integral membrane protein with 11 putative transmembrane helixes, an N-terminal extracellular region that contains motifs characteristic of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 226 amino acids (9The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium Cell. 1995; 81: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 10Hughes J. Ward C.J. Peral B. Aspinwall R. Clark K. San Millan J.L. Gamble V. Harris P.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Mutations of polycystin account for the majority of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, a common hereditary disease (1:1,000) of slowly progressive epithelial cyst formation. Mice lacking polycystin die perinatally with massively enlarged cystic kidneys. Analysis of PKD1 −/− mice indicates that polycystin is required during renal development for the elongation and maturation of tubular structures (11Lu W. Peissel B. Babakhanlou H. Pavlova A. Geng L. Fan X. Larson C. Brent G. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Further functional characterization of polycystin and the genetic manipulation of full-length polycystin has been hindered by its complexity. To gain insight into the function of polycystin, we have begun to characterize the signaling pathways that are activated by the C-terminal domain of polycystin, and have recently demonstrated that the C-terminal 226 amino acids of polycystin trigger activation of the transcription factor AP-1 (12Arnould T. Kim E. Tsiokas L. Jochimsen F. Grüning W. Chang J.D. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6013-6018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of polycystin activates Wnt signaling.DISCUSSIONAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the leading genetic cause of renal failure, is primarily caused by mutations in polycystin. Polycystin is required for normal tubulogenesis during renal development, but its precise physiologic function is not yet defined. Studies of PKD1−/− mutant mice indicate that early stages of tubule morphogenesis, such as nephrogenic condensation and epithelialization, remain intact (11Lu W. Peissel B. Babakhanlou H. Pavlova A. Geng L. Fan X. Larson C. Brent G. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Expression of polycystin can be detected at E14 in the ureteric bud, and subsequently in the S- and Comma-shapes of the condensing mesenchyme (31Burrow C.R. Thornton K. Hyink D. Wilson P.D. J. Am.

D'Agati V. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F602-F609PubMed Google Scholar). Cyst formation begins at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) in proximal tubules and progresses rapidly to replace the entire renal parenchyma. Wnt-4 is also required for renal tubulogenesis during this time; at E15.5 the mesenchyme ofWnt-4 −/− mice fails to aggregate and differentiate, lacking pretubular aggregates and more developed tubules (8Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Kidneys of Wnt-4 −/− mice are growth retarded at E15.5 and agenic at E18.5, consisting of undifferentiated mesenchyme interspersed with branches of collecting duct epithelium. In the developing kidney, the expression pattern of polycystin appears to overlap with at least two known Wnt family members, Wnt-11, expressed in the ureteric bud (38Kispert A. Vainio S. Shen L. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 3627-3637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Wnt-4, expressed in mesenchymal aggregates undergoing epithelial transition (8Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Both spatially and temporally, Wnt and polycystin localization and signaling events coincide, supporting the hypothesis that polycystin may modulate Wnt signaling. Polycystin augmented the transcriptional activity of XWnt8, XDsh, rFz2, and β-catenin, indicating that polycystin may serve to reinforce or maintain Wnt signaling during critical stages of renal tubulogenesis. The combinatorial interaction of Wnt signaling with other signaling pathways promotes functions that are different from the function of Wnt molecules alone (reviewed in Ref. 2Moon R.T. Brown J.D. Torres M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Although Wnt family members induce mesenchymal-epithelial conversion, cross-talk with polycystin may be required at a later stage to maintain tubular structure, polarity, and integrity. It is particularly interesting that β-catenin, a transcriptional mediator of Wnt signaling, recently has been reported to regulate the reorganization of renal epithelial cell aggregates into long tubules (39Pollack A.L. Barth A.I.M. Altschuler Y. Nelson W.J. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Ectopic expression of many Wnt pathway components upstream of β-catenin can be mimicked by the overexpression of β-catenin in a variety of systems, suggesting that the role of certain Wnt family members is to increase levels of soluble β-catenin (40Guger K.A. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that secreted Wnts, through the family of frizzled receptors, activate disheveled and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase, to stabilize β-catenin and facilitate transcription of certain target genes (reviewed in Refs. 2Moon R.T. Brown J.D. Torres M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar and 3Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signaling, cytoplasmic β-catenin is rapidly degraded in mammalian cells by a process involving the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein, ubiquitination, and proteasome (19Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 41Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway or overexpression of β-catenin results in cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus (42Salomon D. Sacco P.A. Roy S.G. Simcha I. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A modest inhibition of GSK-3β activity appears sufficient to transduce Wnt signaling, raising the possibility that only a Wnt-sensitive subcellular GSK-3β pool is able to regulate the stability of β-catenin (reviewed in Ref. 3Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Our data suggests that expression of the C-terminal domain of polycystin stabilizes soluble β-catenin and increases the amount of transcriptionally active β-catenin. Although GSK-3β activity was reduced in the presence of polycystin, we were unable to detect a direct interaction of the C terminus of polycystin with GSK-3βin vitro or in vivo, indicating that polycystin does not directly inhibit GSK-3β kinase activity through a physical interaction.A critical role for GSK-3β in early vertebrate pattern formation has been clearly established in dorsoventral axis formation (43Dominguez I.

Biol. 1995; 172: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and some upstream components of the Wnt-signaling pathway induce an ectopic embryonic axis in Xenopus (reviewed in Ref. 3Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). A marked dorsalizing effect of the terminal 112 amino acids of polycystin was observed in zebrafish embryos. The polycystin phenotype strikingly resembles the exaggerated dorsoanterior structures resulting from lithium treatment, indicating that polycystin may similarly inhibit GSK-3β during zebrafish development (30Stachel S.E. Grunwald D.J. Myers P.Z. Development. 1993; 117: 1261-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The ligand of polycystin remains unidentified; hence, it is still unknown how extracellular events may influence the capacity of polycystin to modulate Wnt signaling. We speculate that ligand-receptor interactions governing the activity of the C-terminal portion of polycystin will be found to influence cytoplasmic-signaling cascades during critical stages of renal tubular development.

Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with members of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression (4Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R.

Wnt-1, a Wnt family member not expressed in the kidney, nevertheless induces metanephric mesenchyme to differentiate into glomerular and renal tubular epithelia (6Herzlinger D. Qiao J. Cohen D. Ramakrishna N. Brown A.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), whereas contact with the metanephric mesenchyme maintains Wnt-11 expression at the tip of the ureteric bud (7Pepicelli C.V. Kispert A. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal expression of Wnt-4 is required for kidney tubulogenesis; Wnt-4 −/− mice fail to form pretubular cell aggregates, a requisite stage of early tubule formation (8Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Thus, in the developing kidney, Wnts appear to be involved in the reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and surrounding mesenchyme that enable the latter to differentiate into epithelial tubule cells. glycogen synthase kinase polycystic kidney disease human embryonic kidney cells polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis activation protein-1 glutathione S-transferase Flag-tagged green fluorescent protein epidermal growth factor hemagglutinin hours post-fertilization glycogen synthase kinase polycystic kidney disease human embryonic kidney cells polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis activation protein-1 glutathione S-transferase Flag-tagged green fluorescent protein epidermal growth factor hemagglutinin hours post-fertilization Polycystin, the gene product of PKD1, is an integral membrane protein with 11 putative transmembrane helixes, an N-terminal extracellular region that contains motifs characteristic of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 226 amino acids (9The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium Cell. 1995; 81: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 10Hughes J.

Mutations of polycystin account for the majority of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, a common hereditary disease (1:1,000) of slowly progressive epithelial cyst formation. Mice lacking polycystin die perinatally with massively enlarged cystic kidneys. Analysis of PKD1 −/− mice indicates that polycystin is required during renal development for the elongation and maturation of tubular structures (11Lu W. Peissel B. Babakhanlou H. Pavlova A. Geng L. Fan X. Larson C. Brent G. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Further functional characterization of polycystin and the genetic manipulation of full-length polycystin has been hindered by its complexity. To gain insight into the function of polycystin, we have begun to characterize the signaling pathways that are activated by the C-terminal domain of polycystin, and have recently demonstrated that the C-terminal 226 amino acids of polycystin trigger activation of the transcription factor AP-1 (12Arnould T.

This study demonstrates that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of polycystin activates Wnt signaling. DISCUSSIONAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, the leading genetic cause of renal failure, is primarily caused by mutations in polycystin. Polycystin is required for normal tubulogenesis during renal development, but its precise physiologic function is not yet defined. Studies of PKD1−/− mutant mice indicate that early stages of tubule morphogenesis, such as nephrogenic condensation and epithelialization, remain intact (11Lu W. Peissel B. Babakhanlou H. Pavlova A. Geng L. Fan X. Larson C. Brent G. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Expression of polycystin can be detected at E14 in the ureteric bud, and subsequently in the S- and Comma-shapes of the condensing mesenchyme (31Burrow C.R. Thornton K. Hyink D. Wilson P.D. J. Am.

Cyst formation begins at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) in proximal tubules and progresses rapidly to replace the entire renal parenchyma. Wnt-4 is also required for renal tubulogenesis during this time; at E15.5 the mesenchyme ofWnt-4 −/− mice fails to aggregate and differentiate, lacking pretubular aggregates and more developed tubules (8Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Kidneys of Wnt-4 −/− mice are growth retarded at E15.5 and agenic at E18.5, consisting of undifferentiated mesenchyme interspersed with branches of collecting duct epithelium. In the developing kidney, the expression pattern of polycystin appears to overlap with at least two known Wnt family members, Wnt-11, expressed in the ureteric bud (38Kispert A. Vainio S. Shen L. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 3627-3637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Wnt-4, expressed in mesenchymal aggregates undergoing epithelial transition (8Stark K. Vainio S. Vassileva G. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1994; 372: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Both spatially and temporally, Wnt and polycystin localization and signaling events coincide, supporting the hypothesis that polycystin may modulate Wnt signaling. Polycystin augmented the transcriptional activity of XWnt8, XDsh, rFz2, and β-catenin, indicating that polycystin may serve to reinforce or maintain Wnt signaling during critical stages of renal tubulogenesis. The combinatorial interaction of Wnt signaling with other signaling pathways promotes functions that are different from the function of Wnt molecules alone (reviewed in Ref. 2Moon R.T. Brown J.D. Torres M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Although Wnt family members induce mesenchymal-epithelial conversion, cross-talk with polycystin may be required at a later stage to maintain tubular structure, polarity, and integrity. It is particularly interesting that β-catenin, a transcriptional mediator of Wnt signaling, recently has been reported to regulate the reorganization of renal epithelial cell aggregates into long tubules (39Pollack A.L. Barth A.I.M. Altschuler Y. Nelson W.J. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Ectopic expression of many Wnt pathway components upstream of β-catenin can be mimicked by the overexpression of β-catenin in a variety of systems, suggesting that the role of certain Wnt family members is to increase levels of soluble β-catenin (40Guger K.A. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that secreted Wnts, through the family of frizzled receptors, activate disheveled and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase, to stabilize β-catenin and facilitate transcription of certain target genes (reviewed in Refs. 2Moon R.T. Brown J.D. Torres M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar and 3Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt signaling, cytoplasmic β-catenin is rapidly degraded in mammalian cells by a process involving the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein, ubiquitination, and proteasome (19Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 41Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway or overexpression of β-catenin results in cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus (42Salomon D. Sacco P.A. Roy S.G. Simcha I. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A modest inhibition of GSK-3β activity appears sufficient to transduce Wnt signaling, raising the possibility that only a Wnt-sensitive subcellular GSK-3β pool is able to regulate the stability of β-catenin (reviewed in Ref. 3Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Our data suggests that expression of the C-terminal domain of polycystin stabilizes soluble β-catenin and increases the amount of transcriptionally active β-catenin. Although GSK-3β activity was reduced in the presence of polycystin, we were unable to detect a direct interaction of the C terminus of polycystin with GSK-3βin vitro or in vivo, indicating that polycystin does not directly inhibit GSK-3β kinase activity through a physical interaction.A critical role for GSK-3β in early vertebrate pattern formation has been clearly established in dorsoventral axis formation (43Dominguez I.

Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). A marked dorsalizing effect of the terminal 112 amino acids of polycystin was observed in zebrafish embryos. The polycystin phenotype strikingly resembles the exaggerated dorsoanterior structures resulting from lithium treatment, indicating that polycystin may similarly inhibit GSK-3β during zebrafish development (30Stachel S.E. Grunwald D.J. Myers P.Z. Development. 1993; 117: 1261-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The ligand of polycystin remains unidentified; hence, it is still unknown how extracellular events may influence the capacity of polycystin to modulate Wnt signaling. We speculate that ligand-receptor interactions governing the activity of the C-terminal portion of polycystin will be found to influence cytoplasmic-signaling cascades during critical stages of renal tubular development.

Xanthine oxidase-cell binding was not inhibited by serum or albumin and was partially inhibited by the addition of heparin. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with chondroitinase, but not heparinase or heparitinase, diminished endothelial binding by ∼50%, suggesting association with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Analysis of rates of superoxide production by soluble and cell-bound XO revealed that endothelial binding did not alter the percentage of univalent reduction of oxygen to superoxide. Comparison of the extent of CuZn-SOD inhibition of native and succinoylated cytochrome creduction by cell-bound XO indicated that XO-dependent superoxide production was occurring in a cell compartment inaccessible to CuZn-SOD. This was further supported by the observation of a shift of exogenously added XO from extracellular binding sites to intracellular compartments, as indicated by both protease-reversible cell binding and immunocytochemical localization studies. Endothelium-bound XO also inhibited nitric oxide-dependent cGMP production by smooth muscle cell co-cultures in an SOD-resistant manner. This data supports the concept that circulating XO can bind to vascular cells, impairing cell function via oxidative mechanisms, and explains how vascular XO activity diminishes vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and atherosclerotic humans.

Allopurinol, or pretreatment of animals with the molybdopterin enzyme inhibitor tungsten to inactivate XO, decreases injury to lung vascular barrier function secondary to splanchnic ischemia-reperfusion (4Terada L.S.

Also, allopurinol, which exhibits no direct antioxidant properties at pharmacologic concentrations, displays tissue-protective actions in organ systems low in or devoid of detectable endogenous XOR activity (6Zimmerman B.J. Parks D.A. Grisham M.B. Granger D.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: H202-H206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, both rabbit and clinical myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury was significantly attenuated by allopurinol, despite several reports revealing that rabbit and human heart have low to undetectable amounts of XO (7Terada L.S.

It therefore becomes critical to understand the tissue distribution of XO and underlying mechanisms of cell injury that are mediated by a source of reactive species that is widely implicated in various pathological processes. xanthine oxidoreductase superoxide, ⋅NO, nitric oxide peroxynitrite hydrogen peroxide superoxide dismutase extracellular superoxide dismutase xanthine oxidase xanthine dehydrogenase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate bovine serum albumin Hanks' balanced salt solution medium 199 phosphate-buffered saline The ability of circulating XO to bind to vascular cells of remote organs may explain the efficacy of XO inhibitors in protecting organs having low XOR activity. Plasma levels of XO rise following ischemia-reperfusion injury to the splanchnic system or following hypovolemic shock, with further increases in plasma XO observed upon perfusion with high concentrations (1000 units/h) of intravenous heparin (4Terada L.S.

Nielsen V.G. Tan S. Gelman S. Matalon S. Skinner K.A. Bradley Jr., E. Parks D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G988-G996PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, during diverse pathologic processes, XO released into plasma from tissues replete in XO specific activity (e.g. the splanchnic system) can circulate to remote sites and bind to target tissues low in or devoid of XO activity. Cell-bound XO may then be concentrated several thousand-fold at the cell surface or interstitial matrix, where its oxidant products could more readily react with cellular target molecules and disrupt vascular functional and barrier properties. High concentrations of XO associate with endothelium and bind to heparin-Sepharose 6B complexes in vitro, but this phenomenon has not been well characterized (11Tan S. Yokoyama Y. Dickens E. Cash T.G. Freeman B.A. Parks D.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Adachi T. Fukushima T. Usami Y. Hirano K. Biochem.

Herein, we show that endothelial-bound XO retains similar catalytic properties as XO in solution, is initially associated with sulfated cell surface proteoglycans, migrates to intracellular compartments via endocytosis, generates reactive species not readily accessible to CuZn-SOD, and finally, impairs vascular cell signal transduction. Materials—Sephadex G-25 PD-10 columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fetal bovine serum and defined iron-supplemented calf serum were from Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. (Logan, UT). All other cell culture media, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), and trypsin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Xanthine oxidase (bovine cream) and CHAPS were obtained from Calbiochem. CuZn-SOD was from Oxis, Inc. (Portland, OR). Recombinant human EC-SOD was prepared as described previously (16Sandstrom J. Carlsson L. Marklund S.L. Edlund T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18205-18209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyethylene glycol-derivatized CuZn-SOD was from Sterling Drug, Inc. (Malvern, PA). cGMP EIA kits were from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Glycosaminoglycan lyases were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa) was obtained from Polysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. The carboxyl terminus of the human XO sequence (17Wright R.M. Vaitaitis G.M. Wilson C.M. Repine T.B. Terada L.S. Repine J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10690-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was selected for antigen production to ensure that the resultant polyclonal rabbit antiserum would recognize xanthine oxidase generated by proteolytic cleavage of the amino terminus of XDH. Polyclonal antibodies against this recombinant human XOR fragment were developed (18Parks D. Gilbert D.L. Colton C. Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Systems. Plenum Press, New York1998: 397-420Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of human XOR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction corresponding to the 358 carboxyl-terminal codons common to both XDH and XO. The XOR polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into an expression vector, induced for expression of the XOR 42-kDa fusion product. The fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity and injected into rabbits for production of polyclonal antibodies. A unique specific signal corresponding to the recombinant XOR fusion product was observed by Western analysis for all dilutions of anti-XOR sera. Preimmune serum was not immunoreactive for XOR. This antiserum does not cross-react with human, rat, bovine, or rabbit IgG or lactoferrin, previously noted to be a problem for other antisera to XOR (19Clare D.A. Lecce J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Bovine aortic and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated as described previously (20Ryan U.S. Maxwell G. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1986; 10: 7-8Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Primary cell culture preparations, subcultures, and cell removal from flasks were conducted in the absence of proteases using scraping techniques. Collagenase (0.1% in HBSS) was used only for preparing primary cell isolates from human umbilical veins. Cells were propagated by subculturing in a 1:4 ratio in medium 199 containing 5% fetal calf serum, 5% iron-supplemented and defined calf serum, and 10 μm thymidine in 75-cm2 flasks. Cells exhibited typical endothelial cobblestone morphology by phase contrast microscopy and positive immunostaining for factor VIII antigen. For XO-cell binding studies, cells between passages 5 and 8 were seeded at a 1:4 split ratio in 12-well plates (4 cm2) or 25-cm2 flasks and used within 30 h of reaching confluency. Primary cultures of fetal rat lung fibroblasts and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells were prepared as before (21Gutierrez H.H. Chumley P. Rivera A. Freeman B.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Xanthine oxidase was further purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography to remove ammonium sulfate and possible contaminating proteases. Xanthine oxidase was monitored for protease contamination and, prior to its addition to cell systems, activity was determined spectrophotometrically by the rate of uric acid formation in 0.1 mm xanthine, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 295 nm (ε = 1.1 × 104m−1·cm−1), revealing a specific activity of typically ∼1.4 units/mg of protein. For some experiments, XO was inactivated by 10 mm KCN for 15 min. The enzyme was then dialyzed extensively against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and assayed for residual activity. Xanthine oxidase was labeled with 125I using IODO-GEN from Pierce. Briefly, 1 mg of XO in 1 ml of 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mCi of [125I]NaI, and 0.3 μm KI were incubated with 0.1 mg of IODO-GEN for 10 min at 4 °C. The free 125I was separated from the125I-XO by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex G-25 PD10 column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, followed by dialysis at 4 °C with four changes of 1 liter of 50 mm potassium phosphate, 25 μmpotassium iodide, pH 7.4, and dialysis with four changes of 1 liter of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Greater than 95% of the counts were precipitable with 10% trichloroacetic acid. For some enzymatic analyses of XO-dependent reduction of oxygen, succinoylated cytochrome c was synthesized as previously described (22Kuthan H. Ullrich V. Estabrook R.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To assay cell-bound XO activity, cells in 75-cm2 flasks were rinsed twice with HBSS and incubated at 37 °C with 15 ml of 0–10 milliunits/ml XO for 3 h in M199(−), defined as medium 199 without hypoxanthine or xanthine and supplemented with 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Cells were then washed three times with HBSS and solubilized immediately in 3 ml of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 (lysis buffer). To measure extents of XO inactivation and/or release, cell monolayers were incubated with XO, washed three times, and further incubated at 37 °C for 0–6 h with 15 ml of M199(−). At intervals, the medium was collected, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer, and both cell-bound and medium-associated XO activity were measured fluorometrically at 37 °C via oxidation of pterin to isoxanthopterin, using methylene blue as an electron acceptor rather than NAD+ (23Beckman J.S. Parks D.A. Pearson J.D. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). One unit of XO activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 nmol of isoxanthopterin/min, while total XOR activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 nmol of isoxanthopterin/min in the presence of 10 μm methylene blue. For determining XO binding affinity and specificity, cell-XO incubations were conducted at 4 °C to minimize endocytosis. It was initially determined by treating cells for various times with 1 μg/ml125I-XO that maximal binding occurred at 5 h. Parallel incubations with additional catalytically inactivated, nonradioactive XO (1 mg/ml) allowed correction for nonspecific binding. Cell binding association constants were analyzed with a nonlinear regression curve fitting program for a single ligand binding model (Enzfitter, Elsevier-BIOSOFT, UK). The influence of BSA, heparin, and pH on XO binding to cells was assessed using cells treated with125I-XO in M199(−) at 4 °C in 12-well plates. Cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of 10 μg/ml 125I-XO in the absence or presence of 1% BSA or 15 units/ml heparin for 6 h, after which the cells were washed three times in cold HBSS and solubilized in lysis buffer. The pH profile of XO binding to cells at pH 6.8–8.0 was examined by adding 2 μg/ml 125I-XO to cells at 4 °C as above, except PBS was used for all steps to optimize pH control. To ascertain reversibility of XO binding and time-dependent incorporation of XO into a trypsin-resistant compartment, 1 μg/ml125I-XO in 0.7 ml of M199(−) was added to cells in 2.2-cm2 12-well plates for 0–70 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed at intervals with cold Ca2+-, Mg2+-free HBSS prior to treatment with 0.5% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. It was previously determined, from analysis of the release of [14C]adenine from prelabeled cells, that trypsin incubations of 15 min or less did not lyse cells. Trypsinized cells were then centrifuged, and the 125I-XO-associated radioactivity of cell pellets and the supernatants collected from trypsinized cell pellets was measured by γ-counting. To ensure that the radioactivity measured was not free 125I dissociated from XO, both cell lysates and media were made 1% with BSA, and total protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) to determine proportions of acid-soluble and insoluble 125I. To ascertain the latency of cell-bound XO release or degradation, cells were incubated with 5 milliunits/ml XO for 1.5 h at 37 °C or 1 μg/ml 125I-XO at 4 °C in M199. Cells were then washed and postincubated with M199 at 37 °C for up to 6 h, and both cells and media were obtained at intervals for XO activity assay or125I-XO protein content determination. The ability of various compounds to displace cell-bound XO was determined by incubating cells grown in 12-well plates with 1 μg/ml125I-XO for 3 h at 4 °C, after which cells were washed twice with 4 °C HBSS and postincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking in 0.7 ml of M199(−) containing no additions (control cells), 50 units/ml EC-SOD, 1 or 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine, 15–100 units/ml heparin (176 units/mg), 2.5% BSA, or 2.5% bovine calf serum. Cells were then washed with cold HBSS and solubilized with lysis buffer, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined. Cells were also pretreated for 3 h at 37 °C with 4 milliunits/ml heparinase, heparitinase, or chondroitinase AC in M199 prior to the addition of 125I-XO. The activity of endoglycosidases under these conditions was determined spectrophotometrically (ε232 = 3800m−1 cm−1) using 100 μg/ml heparin, heparan sulfate, or chondroitin sulfate as substrate (24Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After endoglycosidase treatment, cells were washed with HBSS and incubated with 1 μg/ml 125I-XO in M199(−) for 3 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times with cold HBSS and solubilized with lysis buffer. Cell-associated 125I-XO was then compared with that of parallel control cells not treated with endoglycosidases. Potential protease contamination of chondroitinase AC was ruled out using azocasein and fluorescamine-casein as substrates, with the assay having a lower limit of detection of 10−5% contamination. Polyclonal rabbit anti-XOR was used for immunolocalization studies. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were grown to confluency on two-well chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc International, Milwaukee, WI) and incubated for 1 or 3 h with 5 milliunits/ml XO in M199 at 37 °C. Primaquine (10 mm) was added in some cases to inhibit endocytosis. Cells were washed with 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4 (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 25 °C. Fixed cells were blocked for 15 min with 50 mmlysine in PBS followed by the addition of 10% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at 25 °C. Permeabilized cell groups had 0.1% Triton X-100 added to both lysine and goat serum-containing blocking buffers. Cells were then incubated 12–15 h at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit anti-XOR antibody in PBS containing 10% goat serum, followed by 30-min incubation at 22 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove PA). Incubation with the secondary antibody was terminated by extensive washing and 5-min postfixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Nuclei were counterstained by incubation for 15 min with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole in deionized H2O. Stained cells were mounted with Prolong mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Immunolocalization of added XO and endogenous XOR was performed using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope with an Olympix digital cooled camera, and images were analyzed using Esprit software (Life Sciences Resources, Cambridge, UK). The same exposure times and sensitivity settings were used in the capture and processing of all digital images. Antibody specificity was determined by incubating the primary antiserum with 3.6 μg/ml bovine XO overnight at 4 °C before addition to fixed cell monolayers. Superoxide production by cell monolayers was measured spectroscopically in HBSS supplemented with 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm horse heart ferricytochrome c, 100 μm xanthine, pH 7.4 (HBSS-cyt c) at 550 nm (ε = 21 mm−1 cm−1). Xanthine oxidase was bound to cells in 25-cm2 flasks by incubation with 5 ml of 0–10 milliunits/ml XO in M199(−) for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by extensive washing with HBSS. Cell monolayers were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in 3 ml of HBSS-cytc with or without other additions. A 1-ml aliquot of medium was removed every 10 min for absorbance measurement and then returned to flasks. The rate of xanthine or pterin consumption by bound XO was similarly determined by measuring production of uric acid or isoxanthopterin. Xanthine or pterin-containing HBSS was added to cells, and a 1-ml aliquot of medium was removed every 10 min for spectrophotometric determination of xanthine oxidation to urate (ε295 = 1.1 × 104m−1 cm−1) or fluorometric analysis of rates of isoxanthopterin oxidation to pterin (isoxanthopterin; λex = 340 nm, λem = 395 nm). Cells grown in 12-well plates were incubated with 4 μm (0.2 μCi/ml) [14C]adenine for 3 h in HBSS at 37 °C. During the last 2 h of [14C]adenine labeling, XO was added, followed by extensive washing with HBSS. Following an 8-h postincubation of washed and radiolabeled cells in HBSS supplemented with 0.1 mm xanthine, aliquots of media were removed, and cell lysis was determined by [14C]adenine and [14C]adenine-labeled metabolite release into the medium. The extent of [14C]adenine release from cells solubilized with 1% CHAPS indicated 100% lysis. Endothelial cells grown to confluence on 2.2-cm2 Transwell micropore filters were incubated with 10 milliunits/ml XO in M199(−) for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by extensive washing with HBSS. Endothelial cell-containing filters were then placed in six-well plates containing confluent rat aortic smooth muscle cells and equilibrated for 10 min with Dulbecco's PBS. Dulbecco's PBS supplemented with 100 μm xanthine, 50 units/ml CuZn-SOD, and 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine with or without 100 μm allopurinol was then added to smooth muscle cells, while Dulbecco's PBS with 100 μm xanthine, 50 units/ml SOD, 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 6.7 μm ionomycin with or without 100 μm allopurinol was added to overlaid endothelial cell-containing Transwell filter wells for 15 min. A low concentration of CuZn-SOD (5 units/ml) was added to all groups to scavenge variable rates of light-induced O·̄2 production in the medium induced by intermittent exposure to dimmed laboratory lighting conditions and autoxidation of medium constituents. The basal generation of O·̄2 by medium under these conditions was confirmed via chemiluminescent assay of accelerated rates of ⋅NO decay when medium was exposed to laboratory lighting conditions, as opposed to slower rates of ⋅NO decay in darkness or in the presence of 5 units/ml SOD. Sodium nitroprusside (10 μm) was added to preparations of smooth muscle cells not exposed to endothelium-derived mediators to determine maximal smooth muscle cell cGMP production. In some cases, heparin-binding EC-SOD (50 units/ml) or higher concentrations of CuZn-SOD (1000 units/ml) was added to the media of both the effector (endothelial) and target (smooth muscle) cells during the the 15-min exposure period. Endothelial cell-containing Transwell inserts were then removed from smooth muscle cell-containing wells, and 0.5 ml of cold 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4, was added to smooth muscle cells for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then removed by scraping and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was assayed for cGMP by EIA. Smooth muscle cells were not morphologically affected by any of the above manipulations. For all experiments, protein concentrations were measured at 550 nm by a modified Bradford assay using Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted with water to 5–20 μg/ml to which an equal volume of Coomassie Plus reagent was added. Data were analyzed with a nonlinear regression curve-fitting program (Enzfitter, Elsevier-Biosoft, UK) using a Michaelis-Menten equation to determine kinetic constants. Unless otherwise noted, data represent mean ± S.D. for experiments repeated at least two times, all giving similar results. Statistical significance of p < 0.05 was determined by one-way analysis of variance with Duncan's post hoc analysis. Initial endothelial cell 125I-XO binding studies were conducted at 4 °C to minimize possible endocytosis and proteolysis. Maximum binding occurred by 5 h (mean k on = 0.39 ± 0.21 μg h−1) and was resistant to removal by extensive washing. Xanthine oxidase binding was saturable, exhibiting an average K d of 0.9 μg/ml (6 nm XO, Fig. 1), with experiment to experiment K d values ranging from 0.3 to 2.2 μg/ml (2–15 nm XO) for different bovine endothelial cell lines. Saturable binding was 80–90% inhibitable by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled XO. The addition of 15 units/ml (85 μg/ml) heparin during XO-cell incubation (2 μg/ml XO) inhibited binding 43%, while BSA (100 μg/ml) had no effect (not shown). Pretreatment of cells with heparitinase or heparinase did not affect subsequent XO binding, while pretreatment with chondroitinase AC (determined to have no detectable contaminating protease activity) inhibited XO binding 47% (Table I). Alkaline pH enhanced binding of XO to cells 4.3-fold at pH 8, compared with pH 7.4 (Table II). Poly-d-lysine and heparin, added for 1 h at 4 °C, following binding of XO to cells, displaced XO 45 and 26%, respectively, compared with buffer-treated controls (TableIII). Heparin-binding EC-SOD, BSA, and fetal bovine serum did not displace cell-bound XO.Table IThe role of endoglycosidases in endothelial cell-xanthine oxidase bindingTreatmentControl%4 milliunits/ml heparinase102 ± 54 milliunits/ml heparitinase103 ± 34 milliunits/ml chondroitinase AC72 ± 3ap < 0.05 from control.40 milliunits/ml chondroitinase AC53 ± 13ap < 0.05 from control.Cells were treated with glycosaminoglycan lyases at 37 °C for 3 h prior to incubation with 1 μg/ml 125I-XO at 4 °C for 3 h.

In contrast, only hsp27 can protect dorsal root ganglion neurons from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal, and hsp27 also protects the ND7 neuronal cell line from retinoic acid-induced apoptosis. However, hsp70 showed no protective effect against apoptosis in contrast to its anti-apoptotic effect in non-neuronal cell types. These results thus identify hsp27 as a novel neuroprotective factor and show that it can mediate this effect when delivered via a high efficiency viral vector.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Such induction of the hsps has been shown to have a protective effect against exposure to a subsequent stress in a variety of cell types. Thus, for example, exposure of primary neuronal cultures to a mild heat stress or ischemic stress sufficient to induce the hsps has been shown to be protective against subsequent exposure to the excitotoxin glutamate or to severe heat or ischemic stress (6Lowenstein D.H.

Thus, for example, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons can be protected against thermal or ischemic stress by overexpression of either the 70-kDa hsp (hsp70) or the 90-kDa hsp (hsp90) (12Uney J.B. Kew C.N.N. Staley K. Tyers P. Sofroniew M.V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Amin V. Cumming D.V.E. Latchman D.S. Neurosci.

Brain Res. 1996; 39: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and a similar protective effect of hsp70 and hsp90 has also been observed in the ND7 immortalized cell line derived from sensory neurons (15Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fink et al. (16Fink S.L. Chang L.K. Ho D.Y. Sapolsky R.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were able to protect cultured hippocampal neurons against subsequent heat shock using a herpes simplex virus (HSV)-derived amplicon vector expressing hsp70 indicating that this effect applies to neurons derived from both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Moreover, the use of an HSV-based vector opens up the possibility of testing the protective effect of the hsps in vivo and of their ultimate therapeutic use in man. Such vectors can effectively deliver genes to neuronal cells following in vivo injection and may be useful for gene therapy procedures (for review see Refs. 17Coffin R.S. Latchman D.S. Latchman D.S. Genetic Manipulation of the Nervous System. Academic Press, Lndon1995: 99-114Crossref Google Scholar and 18Fink D.J. DeLuca N.A. Goins W.F. Glorioso J.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 265-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Such a possibility is of particular interest in view of the finding that a prior mild heat shock can protect neonatal DRG neurons against apoptosis induced by withdrawal of nerve growth factor (15Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and similarly protects ND7 cells against apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and addition of retinoic acid (19Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus the ability to manipulate the rate of apoptosis would be of use in neurological diseases such as muscular dysgenesis (20Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar) or spinal muscular atrophy (21Gamstrop I. Sarnet H.B. Progressive Spinal Muscular Atrophies. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1984Google Scholar) which involve changes in the normal level of neuronal cell apoptosis during development as well as in later onset diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases where the excessive neuronal cell death may be apoptotic in nature (20Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 453-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2759) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, however, it has not proved possible thus far to identify a single hsp whose overexpression in neuronal cells can protect them from apoptosis. Thus, overexpression of hsp70 can protect several different non-neuronal cell types from apoptosis including fibrosarcoma cells (22Samali A. Cotter T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), normal fibroblasts (23Li W.X. Chen C.H. Ling C.C. Li G.C. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and T cell leukemia cell lines (24Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 25Wei Y.-Q. Zhao X. Kariya Y. Teshigawara K. Uchida A. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1995; 40: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, overexpression of hsp70 or hsp90 in ND7 cells (15Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or DRG neurons (14Wyatt S. Mailhos C. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 39: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) does not reproduce the protective effect of mild heat shock against subsequent apoptotic stimuli. Similarly, in the experiments of Fink et al. (16Fink S.L. Chang L.K. Ho D.Y. Sapolsky R.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) overexpression of hsp70 with an HSV vector did not protect hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity which may act by inducing apoptosis (26Kure S. Tuminaga T. Yoshimoto T. Tada K. Narisawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It is clear therefore that the protective effect of heat shock against apoptosis in neuronal cells cannot be reproduced by hsp70 alone despite its protective effect in other cell types. The protective effect could involve another hsp such as hsp27 which has also been shown to protect non-neuronal cell types against apoptosis (22Samali A. Cotter T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 27Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) but has not been artificially overexpressed in neuronal cells. Alternatively, it could require a combination of several hsps or some other effect of heat shock not involving hsp synthesis. Such protective effects not involving hsp synthesis are likely to account for cases in non-neuronal cells where tolerance to stress can be enhanced in the absence of hsp synthesis (28Watson K. Dunlop G. Caviccholi R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Wiedlitz R.B. Magun B.E. Gerner E.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or where cells with the same hsp levels exhibit different levels of thermotolerance (30Ferrini U. Falcioni R. Delpino A. Cavaliere R. Zupi G. Natali P.G. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 34: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this case it would evidently not be possible to produce an effective anti-apoptotic effect using gene therapy procedures involving the overexpression of one or more hsp genes. To resolve these possibilities and attempt to identify the hsp involved in the protective effect against apoptosis, we have constructed HSV-based vectors expressing individual hsps and used these to investigate their protective effects in vitro. These viruses offer a high efficiency means of delivering specific genes to primary neuronal cells and could be used, for example, to overexpress several different hsps in the same neuronal cell. Moreover, they could also ultimately be used to direct similar overexpression of hsps in vivo, in gene therapy procedures. Hsp cDNAs or a control β-galactosidase gene (from pCH110; Pharmacia) under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (from pJ7; Ref. 54Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) were inserted into a plasmid containing the region of the HSV-1 genome encoding the latency associated transcript, between the twoBstXI sites immediately downstream of the latency-associated transcript promoter region (HSV-1 strain 17+; GenBankTMaccession number HE1CG). Hsp cDNAs were Chinese hamster hsp27 (from Jacques Landry (31Lavoie J. Chretien P. Landry J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)), rabbit hsp56 (from Marie-Claire Lebeau), inducible human hsp70 (32Wu B. Hunt C. Morimoto R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and human hsp90 (33Twomey B.M. Dhillon V.B. McCallum S. Isenberg D.A. Latchman D.S. J. Autoimm. 1993; 6: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Twomey B.M. McCallum S. Isenberg D.A. Latchman D.S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 93: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hsps were introduced into the latency-associated transcript region of an HSV vector deleted for ICP27 (34Coffin R.S. Maclean A. Latchman D.S. Brown S.M. Gene Ther. 1995; 3: 886-891Google Scholar, 49Howard M.K. Kershaw T. Gibb B. Storey W. Maclean A.R. Zeng B.-W. Jenner P. Brown S.M. Woolf C.J. Anderson P.N. Coffin R.S.

Here a blue/white selection for recombinant plaques was performed after 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside staining, white Hsp-expressing plaques being picked and plaque-purified five times followed by Western blotting to confirm expression of the appropriate Hsp from each virus. ICP27 deleted viruses were grown in B130/2 BHK cells that have been stably transfected to express ICP27 (49Howard M.K. Kershaw T. Gibb B. Storey W. Maclean A.R. Zeng B.-W. Jenner P. Brown S.M. Woolf C.J. Anderson P.N. Coffin R.S. Latchman D.S. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) allowing lytic growth of the virus. There is no overlap between sequences inserted into the cell line to complement ICP27 and the ICP27-deleted virus in this virus cell line combination, and thus homologous recombination and repair of the ICP27 deletion is undetectable (reversion frequency <1 in 109 plaque-forming units (49Howard M.K. Kershaw T. Gibb B. Storey W. Maclean A.R. Zeng B.-W. Jenner P. Brown S.M. Woolf C.J. Anderson P.N. Coffin R.S. Latchman D.S. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). B130/2 cells, parental BHK cells (35Macpherson I. Stoker M. Virology. 1962; 16: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), ND7 cells (36Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and neonatal rat primary dorsal root ganglion cells were infected in each case at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 in serum-free media for 1 h. Virus containing media was then replaced with full growth media and incubation continued for a further 16 h prior to the induction of cell stress or harvesting of the cells for Western blotting. Cultures were prepared from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Spinal ganglia were removed aseptically, digested with 0.3% collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 90 min, and then mechanically dissociated through a 1-ml Gilson tip. Routinely cultures contain approximately 90% neurons and 10% glial cells as assayed by morphology and staining with appropriate antibodies. Cells were plated and grown overnight in defined media (37Davies A.M. Cohen J. Wilkin G.P. Neural Cell Culture: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 153-175Google Scholar) on sterile glass coverslips and subsequently transferred to 24-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Cells were infected/mock-infected over 1 h in defined media in the absence of bovine serum albumin. After overnight incubation the cells were either exposed to heat shock (see below), simulated ischemia (see below), or stimulated to undergo apoptosis by prolonged incubation in defined media in the absence of nerve growth factor (NGF). Viable neurons were assessed at 12 and 24 h recovery after insult (heat shock and ischemia) and at 24 and 48 h after prolonged NGF withdrawal by visualization at 400 × magnification under light microscopy. The parameters used to define viable neurons were phase bright bodies, agranular appearance, and non-ruffled membranes. Non-viable neurons were defined by phase dark bodies, lack of neurites, granular/vacuolated appearance, and ruffled membranes (14Wyatt S. Mailhos C. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 39: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ND7 cells were originally generated as a fusion of primary sensory DRG neurons and neuroblastoma cells and display many of the characteristics of sensory neurons (36Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). ND7 cells were grown in Leibovitz L15 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and infected as above before exposure to either lethal heat shock (see below) or simulated ischemia (see below) prior to assay of cell viability by trypan blue exclusion (see below). To induce the cells to cease dividing and undergo morphological differentiation or apoptosis, they were transferred to serum-free medium consisting of a 1:1 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and nutrient mix Ham's F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with human transferrin (5 μg/ml), bovine insulin (250 ng/ml), and sodium selenite (30 nm). All-trans- retinoic acid was added to a final concentration of 1 μm to increase the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis. This procedure has previously been shown to induce cell death by apoptosis in these cells (43Howard M.K. Burke L.C. Mailhos C. Pizzey A. Gilbert C.S. Lawson W.D. Collins M.K.L. Thomas N.S.B. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ND7 cells were seeded into 8-well chamber slides and infected at an m.o.i. of 10 with each of the HSV vectors expressing lacZ (control) or each of the Hsps individually. After serum withdrawal/addition of retinoic acid, the cultures were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Media were removed, and the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Slides were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C and TUNEL reactions (Boehringer Mannheim) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were visualized using fluorescein optics, and the numbers of positive staining, apoptotic cells were counted in three confluent fields of view for each sample. Growth media was pre-warmed to 48 °C and 1 ml/well added to ND7 cells or primary rat DRG cells in vitro. The plates were wrapped in parafilm and incubated in a water bath at 48 °C (lethal heat shock) for 20 (ND7 cells) or 30 min (rat primary DRG cultures) (16Fink S.L. Chang L.K. Ho D.Y. Sapolsky R.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) followed by transfer to a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for recovery for a period of 1 (ND7 cells) or 24 h (primary neurons) as in our previous experiments (15Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,19Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The ND7 cells were gently harvested and gently resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before trypan blue exclusion assay for cell viability (see below). Primary DRG neurons were assessedin situ at 0, 12, and 24 h time points, similar to work reported previously (14Wyatt S. Mailhos C. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 39: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ischemia can be simulated in vitro by incubating the cells in a physiological buffer containing raised levels of lactic acid, high potassium, and decreased pH and inhibitors of electron transport and glycolysis (38Esumi K. Nishida M. Shaw D. Smith T.W. Marsh J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1743-H1752PubMed Google Scholar). ND7 and rat DRG cells were cultured in a 24-well plate and mock-infected or infected with the viruses 24 h prior to ischemia. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in either control buffer (pH 7.4) or ischemic buffer (38Esumi K. Nishida M. Shaw D. Smith T.W. Marsh J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1743-H1752PubMed Google Scholar). Viable ND7 cells were harvested as above and counted immediately after insult. Viable primary DRG neurons were visualized and counted after 12 and 24 h recovery in defined media at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The extent of cell death was quantitated by measuring the percentage of viable cells able to exclude trypan blue by adding an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline to cells that had been gently harvested by centrifugation (ND7s) or by direct addition to the cell culture (DRGs). Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and the proportion of cells able to exclude trypan blue was assessed. Protein samples were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described previously (19Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Dhillon V.B. McCallum S. Norton P.M. Twomey B.M. Eskeller-Yuksel F. Lydyard P. Isenberg D.A. Latchman D.S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1993; 52: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and probed with either an anti-hsp90 antibody (AC88; see Ref. 40Riehl R.M. Sullivan W.P. Vroman B.T. Bauer V.J. Pearson G.R. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6586-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), or antibodies to the other hsps purchased from StressGen Ltd. Cells were harvested 16 h after infection as described above, and in each case the degree of hsp induction was determined in comparison to cells infected with the lacZexpressing control virus. Equal loading of protein samples was confirmed by Coomassie staining of duplicate gels, in each case protein extracted from ∼1 × 105 cells run/lane. Previously an HSV-based amplicon vector overexpressing hsp70 has been reported (16Fink S.L. Chang L.K. Ho D.Y. Sapolsky R.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here a plasmid containing an HSV origin of replication and packaging sequence is propagated by transfection into susceptible cells and co-infection with a helper virus (for review of HSV vectors see Refs. 17Coffin R.S. Latchman D.S. Latchman D.S. Genetic Manipulation of the Nervous System. Academic Press, Lndon1995: 99-114Crossref Google Scholar and 18Fink D.J. DeLuca N.A. Goins W.F. Glorioso J.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 265-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Progeny virions consist of a mixture of helper virus and packaged amplicon vector. This system suffers from the disadvantage that it produces a mixed viral population consisting of packaged amplicon and helper virus whose ratio varies between different stocks, although more recently a technique allowing low efficiency helper virus-free amplicon growth has been reported (55Fraefel C. Song S. Lim F. Lang P. Yu L. Wang Y. Wild P. Geller A.I. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7190-7197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used the alternative system in which hsps are recombined directly into a disabled virus vector thus allowing reproducible stocks to be prepared for quantitive experiments. Here cDNAs for hsp90, hsp70, hsp56, and hsp27 were introduced into a disabled HSV strain lacking the viral gene encoding ICP27. ICP27 is essential for HSV replication (42Sacks W.R. Greene C.C. Aschmann D.P. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 796-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus ICP27 deletion results in an efficient gene transfer vector (34Coffin R.S. Maclean A. Latchman D.S. Brown S.M. Gene Ther. 1995; 3: 886-891Google Scholar, 49Howard M.K. Kershaw T. Gibb B. Storey W. Maclean A.R. Zeng B.-W. Jenner P. Brown S.M. Woolf C.J. Anderson P.N. Coffin R.S. Latchman D.S. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Following plaque purification, viruses were tested for their ability to express the appropriate hsp following infection of B130/2 cells (49Howard M.K. Kershaw T. Gibb B. Storey W. Maclean A.R.

Clear overexpression of hsp70, hsp56, and hsp27 was seen with the appropriate virus (Fig.1) at levels comparable to those observed in stressed cells (data not shown). In contrast, the hsp90 virus did not show significant overexpression of hsp90 above endogenous levels. Similar results were also seen in parental BHK cells (data not shown) and in ND7 cells which are of neuronal origin (Fig.2), confirming that hsps were also overexpressed without virus replication, and in particular in cells of neuronal origin.Figure 2Hsp expression in recombinant HSV infected ND7 cells. Western blotting was carried out with antibody to hsp27 (a), hsp56 (b), or hsp70 (c) using extracts from uninfected cells (control, C), cells infected with virus expressing β-galactosidase (lac), or virus expressing the appropriate hsp as indicated. RM, molecular mass in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As the hsp90 virus did not direct expression of hsp90 significantly above endogenous levels, it was not used further for these experiments. However, the other viruses were used to infect initially ND7 cells and subsequently primary DRG cultures. ND7 cells provide a convenient cell type of neuronal origin to initially assess the protective effect of the viruses against various insults. In these experiments, cells infected with the control virus expressing β-galactosidase showed comparable survival either before or after stress to that observed in uninfected ND7 cells (Figs. 3 and4), showing that the virus itself did not have any significant cytopathic effect in these cells. Moreover, the hsp70-expressing virus was able to protect ND7 cells from subsequent exposure to both a severe thermal (Fig. 3) or ischemic (Fig. 4) stress, confirming our previous results obtained with ND7 cells stably transfected with a plasmid-expressing hsp70 (15Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A similar protective effect was also observed with the virus expressing hsp27, but not with the virus expressing hsp56 (Figs. 3 and 4), providing for the first time data on the protective effect of overexpressing these proteins in neuronal cells.Figure 4ND7 cell survival following simulated ischemia when infected with HSV vectors expressing hsps.

We have previously shown this treatment to induce apoptosis in ND7 cells on the basis of a number of criteria such as the morphology of cells under light and electron microscopy and DNA fragmentation (43Howard M.K. Burke L.C. Mailhos C. Pizzey A. Gilbert C.S. Lawson W.D. Collins M.K.L. Thomas N.S.B. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In these experiments (Fig.5) cells infected with viruses expressing β-galactosidase or hsp56 showed comparable rates of survival to untreated cells, whereas cells infected with the hsp70 virus showed a marginally protective effect, but only at the 48-h time point (p < 0.05). In contrast, cells infected with the hsp27-expressing virus showed a highly statistically significant protection at both 24 and 48 h after the onset of treatment (p < 0.001 at both time points). Hence the hsp27-expressing virus had a protective effect that was specific to this virus and not observed with the other viruses. This indicates that protection was not due to a nonspecific effect of viral infection, such as an alteration in the rate of cell division. To confirm that the"

A mammalian sialidase located in plasma membranes is unique in specifically hydrolyzing gangliosides, suggesting crucial roles in regulation of cell surface functions. Here we describe the cloning and expression of a cDNA for the ganglioside sialidase, isolated from a bovine brain cDNA library based on the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme from bovine brain. This cDNA encodes a 428-amino acid protein containing a putative transmembrane domain and the three Asp boxes characteristic of sialidases and sharing 19–38% sequence identity with other sialidases. Northern blot and polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed a general distribution of the gene in mammalian species, including man, and the mouse. In COS-7 cells transiently expressing the sialidase, the activity was found to be 40-fold that of the control level with ganglioside substrates in the presence of Triton X-100, and the hydrolysis was almost specific to gangliosides other than GM1 and GM2, both α2→3 and α2→8 sialyl linkages being susceptible. The major subcellular localization of the expressed sialidase was assessed to be plasma membrane by Percoll density gradient centrifugation of cell homogenates and by immunofluorescence staining of the transfected COS-7 cells. Analysis of the membrane topology by protease protection assay suggested that this sialidase has a type I membrane orientation with its amino terminus facing to the extracytoplasmic side and lacking a signal sequence.

Analysis of the membrane topology by protease protection assay suggested that this sialidase has a type I membrane orientation with its amino terminus facing to the extracytoplasmic side and lacking a signal sequence. The sialidase reaction is an initial step of the degradation of glycoproteins and gangliosides. Sialidases of mammalian origin have been implicated not only in lysosomal catabolism but also in modulation of functional molecules involved in many biological processes (1Schauer R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 2Pilatte Y. Bignon J. Lambré C.R. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance and the regulation mechanisms of desialylation remain obscure because the structure and function of mammalian sialidases are not fully understood. Our previous studies aimed at the biochemical characterization of mammalian sialidases demonstrated four types in rat tissues differing in subcellular location as well as catalytic and immunological properties: intralysosomal (3Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. Eur. J Biochem. 1984; 141: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), cytosolic (4Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1990; 107: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The multiple nature of mammalian sialidases suggests that each form may play a unique role depending on its particular subcellular location and catalytic properties. To elucidate the structure and function of these low abundance proteins, cloning of the individual genes is required. We previously cloned a rat cytosolic sialidase gene (6Miyagi T. Konno K. Emori Y.

Gangliosides are thought to play crucial roles in cell surface events, including cell differentiation, cell-cell interactions, and transmembrane signaling (19Zeller C.B. Marchase R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1341-C1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hakomori S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Tettamanti G. Riboni L. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 235-267PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membrane sialidases, therefore, have been considered to participate in these phenomena through modulation of gangliosides. In fact, there are observations suggesting important biological roles of ganglioside sialidases, although information as to what types of ganglioside sialidase involved is not available enough. The activity levels fluctuate consistently with cell differentiation, cell growth, and malignant transformation. For example, a sialidase inhibitor, 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid, abolishes increase of a differentiation marker enzyme in human neuroblastoma cells (22Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Muhl C. Cantz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Kopitz J. Muhl C. Ehemann V. Lehmann C. Cantz M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), and the observations by Usuki et al. (24Usuki S. Lyu S.-C. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6847-6853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Usuki S. Hoops P. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10595-10599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led them to propose the participation of ganglioside sialidase in cell growth regulation. In addition, alterations of the levels of ganglioside sialidase expression associated with malignant transformation have been described: loss of cell density-dependent suppression in 3T3-transformed cells (26Yogeeswaran G. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2151-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and appearance of ganglioside sialidase activity in transformed cell lines of baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (27Schengrund C.-L. Lausch R.N. Rosenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4424-4428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported an increase of plasma membrane sialidase activity associated with induction of anchorage-independent growth in mouse epidermal JB6 cells exposed to phorbol esters (28Miyagi T. Sagawa J. Kuroki T. Matsuya Y. Tsuiki S. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1990; 81: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying such sialidase alterations. To provide tools for their elucidation, we have focused on cloning a cDNA of the sialidase. We recently were able to purify a ganglioside sialidase extensively from bovine brain, which is the major ganglioside-hydrolyzing sialidase of the tissue and is located mainly in synaptosomes (18Hata K. Wada T. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Miyagi T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using the purified enzyme protein, we have now succeeded in cloning a membrane-associated ganglioside sialidase. Membrane-associated sialidase was purified extensively from 5 kg of frozen bovine brain as described previously (18Hata K. Wada T. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Miyagi T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The concentrated enzyme at the step of thiol-activated Sepharose column chromatography was electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride-immobilized enzyme protein was subjected successively to reduction, S-carboxymethylation and in situdigestion with lysylendopeptidase and endoproteinase Asp-N (29Iwamatsu A. Yoshida-Kubomura N. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The digested peptides were fractionated on a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography column, and amino acid sequencing was performed. Based on the amino acid sequences of the four peptides derived from the purified sialidase (see Fig. 1 a), nine degenerate oligonucleotides for both sense and antisense strands were synthesized with deoxyinosine substitution as shown in Fig. 1 b. First strand cDNAs were synthesized from the poly(A)-rich RNA of bovine brain using random primers and murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript RNase H−, Life Technologies, Inc.) and used as templates for PCR reactions. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, elongation at 72 °C for 2 min; 30 ∼ 40 cycles. A fragment (482 base pairs) amplified with Ap3S and DN2A primers was judged to be appropriate by sequencing, randomly labeled with [32P]dCTP, and used as a probe to screen a bovine brain λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH). Ten positive clones were isolated by high stringency washing and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method in both directions using an AutoRead Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two overlapping clones (1.5 and 2.8 kilobases) containing full-length open reading frames were subcloned into Bluescript (pBB121 and pBB321). For 5′- and 3′-end amplification, the procedure described by Frohman et al. (30Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) was employed using specific primers synthesized based on the sequence of the positive clones. To obtain sialidase cDNA fragments of mouse and human tissues, cDNAs were amplified under the same conditions described above with the primers 5′-GGACACCGGACCATGAACCCCTGTCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTGGCCCCACAGC AAAAGTGGCCCA-3′ (antisense) for a region in which the amino acid sequence of the bovine sialidase is identical to that of cytosolic sialidase. Total RNA was prepared from bovine brain by the acid guanidium-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar), and poly(A)-rich RNA was isolated by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography. Poly(A)-rich RNAs from human brain and skeletal muscle were obtained from CLONTECH. Total RNA (15 μg) and Poly(A)-rich RNA (5 μg) were denatured at 65 °C in a solution of 50% (v/v) formamide, 6% (v/v) formaldehyde, and 20 mmMOPS (pH 7.0), electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 6% (v/v) formaldehyde, and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane. The membrane was hybridized with labeled cDNA probe at 42 °C in a solution containing 5 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 50% (v/v) formamide and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and then washed in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and finally in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. A sialidase expression plasmid (pMEmSD) was constructed by subcloning the sequence containing the open reading frame, amplified by PCR at an annealing temperature at 60 °C using pBB121 as template, into the EcoRI site of pME18S bearing the SRα promotor. The tag-epitoped sialidase expression vector, pMEmSD-HSVTag, was constructed by incorporating the nucleotides coding for HSV tag (SQPQLAPQDPQD, Novagen) into the 3′ end of the full-length sialidase cDNA in the pME18S vector. The expression plasmid was transfected into COS-7 cells by electroporation. After 48 h of growth in cell culture, cells (5 × 107) were collected, disrupted by sonication in 9 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 10 min, and additionally at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting pellet was used for sialidase activity assay. The reaction mixture contained 50 nmol of substrate as bound sialic acid, 0.2 mg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μmol of sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 0.2 mg of Triton X-100. After incubation at 37 °C for 10–30 min, the sialic acid released was determined by the thiobarbituric acid method as described elsewhere (4Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6710-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sialidase activity toward 4-methylumbelliferyl-neuraminic acid (4MU-Neu5Ac) was assayed by spectro-fluorometrical measurement of 4MU released (4Miyagi T. Tsuiki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6710-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of sialidase was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 nmol of sialic acid/h. Percoll density gradient centrifugation of the sialidase in transfected cells was conducted as follows: 1 ml of cell homogenate (1,000 × g supernatant) was applied on top of 16 ml of 40% Percoll (in 0.25 m sucrose) underlaid with 1 ml of 2.5m sucrose and centrifuged at 48,000 × gfor 45 min. Fractions of 300 μl were collected and assayed for sialidase, N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase and 5′-nucleotidase activities (5Miyagi T. Sagawa J. Konno K. Handa S. Tsuiki S. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence staining, transfected cells expressing HSV epitope-tagged sialidase were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min, and immunostained with HSV tag anti-monoclonal antibody (Novagen). As a control, cells transfected with pMEcSD-HSVtag, in which the open reading frame of membrane sialidase was replaced by that of cytosolic sialidase (6Miyagi T. Konno K. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Tsuiki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26435-26440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were stained in the same manner. To test antibody binding to the cell surface, non-permeabilized cells transfected with pMEmSD-HSVTag or pMEmSD were stained with HSV tag monoclonal or anti-sialidase peptide antibodies, respectively. The anti-peptide antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled oligopeptides corresponding to amino acid residues 109–128, according to standard procedures. The specific antibody was affinity purified from the sera of immunized animals using immobilized peptides. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (Tago) and anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) IgG Fab fragments were used as secondary antibodies. To determine the membrane topology of the sialidase, a proteinase K protection assay was performed. Transfected cells (5 × 107) harboring pMEmSD-HSVTag or pMEmSD were suspended in 9 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose containing 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by 10 passages through a 22-gauge needle. The vesicles obtained were subjected to proteolysis with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) for 3 h at 0 °C in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. After stopping the reaction with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellets were dissolved in 300 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Expressed sialidase proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting using HSV tag monoclonal or anti-sialidase peptide antibodies followed by exposure to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG Fab fragments, respectively. The presence ofN-linked glycosylation in the expressed sialidase was assessed by tunicamycin and N-glycosidase treatments. Tunicamycin was added into the culture medium at 2.5 μg/ml at 28 h prior to harvesting. For N-glycosidase sensitivity test, homogenates (30 μg of protein) of the transfected cells were incubated with 1 milliunit of N-glycosidase F (Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Takara, Japan) at 37 °C overnight under denaturation conditions as recommended by the supplier. Fetuin (25 μg) was treated simultaneously as a control glycoprotein. The PVDF-immobilized enzyme protein was digested with lysylendopeptidase followed by endoproteinase and microsequenced. Based on the four peptides thus obtained (Fig.1, top), degenerate oligonucleotides for sense and antisense primers were prepared (Fig. 1,bottom) and used in the PCR reaction with bovine brain random-primed cDNA as template. An amplified cDNA fragment (482 base pairs) produced with Ap3S and DN2A primers was identified as a candidate because the deduced amino acid sequence contained two Asp boxes (32Roggentin P. Rothe B. Kaper J.B. Galen J. Lawrisuk L. Vimir E.R. Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 1989; 6: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and demonstrated 30% identity with cytosolic sialidase unexpectedly. With this cDNA as a probe, we screened a bovine brain λgt10 library (2 × 106 plaques) and obtained ten positive clones. Two overlapping clones were found to contain the entire open reading frame, and the 5′-end amplification by PCR resulted in further extension at the 5′-end of 83 nucleotides. The longest positive clone (pBB321) and the amplified cDNA with an extended 5′-end were used to generate a cDNA (Fig.2 a) of 2898 nucleotides having an extended 5′-end of 258 nucleotides with a putative initiating methionine in perfect agreement with the consensus for eukaryotic genes. We predict that the methionine codon at nucleotides 259–261 is the initiation site rather than the residue at nucleotides 229–231 because of the existence of a clone different in the 5′-portion upstream of nucleotide 249. None of the positive clones were found to possess a polyadenylation signal but ATTTA motifs were present in the 3′-untranslated region, thought to be involved in destabilization of mRNAs coding for proto-oncogenes and cytokines and therefore in the regulation of gene expression during cell growth and differentiation (33Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). Despite repeated attempts, amplification of the 3′-end portion of the gene by PCR was unsuccessful. The deduced protein has 428 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 47,916 Da, that includes the four sequenced peptides, three Asp boxes, and one potential glycosylation site. Comparison of the primary sequence with those of other mammalian and bacterial sialidases revealed 19–38% sequence identities: the highest degree of homology (38%) was found with rat (6Miyagi T. Konno K. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Tsuiki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26435-26440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hamster (34Ferrari J. Harris R. Warner T.G. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) cytosolic sialidases, and 24, 21, and 19% with human MHC-related (8Bonten E. van der Spoel A. Fornerod M.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) sialidases, respectively. Searches for primary sequence homology in protein data bases showed no significant similarities to other proteins, but interestingly, one region of the sialidase (59–103 aa) contained 35.6% identity to a region (291–335 aa) of the mouse embryonic growth factor (GDF1) (37Lee S.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4250-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a member of the TGF-β superfamily. A hydropathy plot generated by the method of Hopp and Wood (38Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar) suggested that the sialidase has a hydrophobic segment of 21 amino acids (174–194 aa) and no signal sequence as shown in Fig.2 b. The hydrophobic stretch divides the sialidase sequence into two parts and can be assumed to be a transmembrane segment flanked by a positively charged residue on the carboxyl-terminal side. Like viral and bacterial sialidases, this enzyme has a high content of cysteine residues (21 cysteines) and β-sheet structures. S. typhimurium sialidase, whose three-dimensional structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography (39Crennell S.J. Garman E.F. Laver W.G. Vimir E.R. Taylor G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9852-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was used to investigate active site residues of our bovine sialidase. Alignment of the two sequences using the mode described by Milner et al. (9Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) revealed a strikingly similar spatial arrangement of the catalytic residues: 8 of the 13 active site residues are conserved in the bovine sialidase. Two of the three active residues involved in binding the acetyl group of sialic acid (Asp-62 and Asp-100) and three of the four residues forming the hydrophobic pocket (Trp-121, Trp-128, and Leu-175 in the bacterial sialidase) demonstrated replacement by Glu-51, Asn-88, Val-107, Arg-114, and Gly-162, respectively, in the bovine enzyme. The three active site residues in the hydrophobic pocket are identical to the corresponding residues in the rat cytosolic sialidase, and all four residues differ from those of human MHC-sialidase, probably reflecting differences in substrate specificity. Northern blot analysis of bovine brain revealed an approximate 7.5-kb length of the mRNA using a cDNA covering the entire coding sequence as a probe (Fig. 3 a), indicating a long stretch (5.8 kilobases) of the gene at the 3′-untranslated region. The same size transcripts were found to be present in human skeletal muscle and brain. Analysis of the partial sequences obtained by PCR reaction for the human and mouse sialidase genes, as shown in Fig. 3 b, demonstrated extensive sequence identity to the bovine gene. In this region, the four active site residues forming the hydrophobic pocket, as aligned with S.typhimurium sialidase, were found, and their sequences were all identical. In fact, the primary sequence of the corresponding human gene displayed an 83% overall identity (data not shown). To confirm that the isolated cDNA clone encodes the ganglioside-hydrolyzing sialidase, plasmids (pMEmSD) were constructed by introduction of the cDNA into a eukaryotic expression vector, pME18S, containing the SRα promotor. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pMEmSD showed an over 40-fold increase in sialidase activity toward gangliosides in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 using cell homogenates and particulates as enzyme sources in comparison with untransfected cells or with vector-transfected cells, while the activity level toward 4MU-NeuAc, a synthetic substrate, was not changed (Fig. 4 a). The sialidase acted preferentially on gangliosides other than GM1 and GM2 and thus on both sialyl linkages of α2→3 and α2→8, but hardly on sialo-glycoproteins and -oligosaccharides, as demonstrated previously (5Miyagi T. Sagawa J. Konno K. Handa S. Tsuiki S. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Kopitz J. Muhl C. Ehemann V. Lehmann C. Cantz M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar) with the purified enzyme from bovine brain (Fig.4 b). When the transfected cell homogenates were subjected to Percoll density gradient centrifugation, most sialidase activity toward gangliosides in the presence of Triton X-100 co-migrated with 5′-nucleotidase, a plasma membrane marker enzyme, but little was detected in the fractions corresponding to lysosomes (Fig.5 a). To confirm the association with the plasma membrane, transfected cells with HSV epitope-tagged sialidase genes were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-HSV antibody (Novagen) and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 5 b). Strong surface staining was detected in cells expressing the sialidase, whereas transfection of the tagged cytosolic sialidase gene resulted in cytosolic and nuclear expression, as demonstrated previously in skeletal muscle cells by electron microscopy (40Akita H. Miyagi T. Hata K. Kagayama M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), indicating no interference of the HSV tag with the sialidase expression. We then investigated whether the sialidase is a transmembrane protein and how it is oriented using an antibody to the HSV peptide fused at the carboxyl terminus and an anti-peptide antibody to the oligopeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 109–129 upstream of the putative transmembrane domain. Cells expressing pMEmSD-HSV exhibited the same degree of sialidase activity as pMEmSD-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 5 c, the overexpressed sialidase was recognized specifically as a diffuse band of 48–54 kDa on Western blotting with anti-HSV (Fig. 5 c, lanes 1 and 4) and anti-peptide (lane 6) antibodies. The presence of tunicamycin in cell medium gave a little change in mobility of the recombinant protein on Western blots (lane 2), but incubation of the homogenates with N-glycosidase resulted in no change under the condition where a control glycoprotein enhanced sufficiently its mobility (lane 3), indicating little possibility of the presence of N-glycosylation. Prepared membrane vesicles were digested with proteinase K, and the products were analyzed by Western blotting. An approximately 22-kDa fragment (lower arrow) with its degradated forms and an unprocessed form (upper arrow) was detected with the anti-peptide antibody (lanes 7 and 8), which recognizes the peptide on the amino-terminal side of the sialidase, but no protection was apparent with the HSV epitope-tagged sialidase (lane 5). The fragment unaffected by proteinase K treatment corresponds to the amino terminus and a part of the membrane-spanning domain region, being completely degradated with proteinase K in the presence of Triton X-100 (lane 9). This expressed sialidase, therefore, appears to be a transmembrane protein with an extracytoplasmic amino terminus. Support for this conclusion was provided by immunostaining of non-permeabilized transfected cells. The anti-sialidase peptide antibody gave rise to a cell surface staining, even if low staining intensity (data not shown), whereas staining was hardly observed without permeablization using anti-HSV antibody. The prediction for transmembrane proteins by the Phdtopology (41Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and Tmpred (42Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) programs is consistent with these results. Fusion protein expression plasmids at the amino terminus demonstrated decreased sialidase activity, and introduction of the constructs with prokaryote expression vectors intoE. coli gave no sialidase activity. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the ganglioside sialidase is associated with plasma membrane and suggest that it is an atypical type I membrane protein lacking a signal sequence and exposing the amino terminus to the extracytoplasmic side. Two types of mammalian sialidase, whose major locations are the cytosol (6Miyagi T. Konno K. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Tsuiki S. J. Biol.

Their primary sequences are not very similar but contain several conserved sequences including ASP boxes characteristic of sialidases. The plasma membrane-associated sialidase has been found to be clearly distinct from cytosolic and lysosomal sialidases in enzymatic properties, especially in its strict substrate specificity with hydrolysis of gangliosides but not glycoproteins or oligosaccharides to any great extent (5Miyagi T. Sagawa J. Konno K. Handa S. Tsuiki S. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Kopitz J. Sinz K. Brossmer R. Cantz M. Eur. J.

In the present study, we have cloned a bovine cDNA encoding a ganglioside sialidase associated mainly with the plasma membrane, which is considered to be the major sialidase for ganglioside hydrolysis in bovine brain. Like other sialidases, the primary sequence contained several consensus amino acid sequences, including some putative active site amino acid residues and ASP boxes that are conserved in bacterial sialidases, suggesting a structure related to microbial counterparts and supporting the idea that mammalian and microbial sialidases have a common phylogenic origin (43Roggentin P. Schauer R. Hoyer L.L. Vimir E.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the sialidase gene showed the highest homology (38%) to rat and hamster cytosolic sialidases among sialidases so far cloned and less similarity (18%) to human and mouse lysosomal sialidases. This is in line with the differences in substrate specificity of these three types because the former two can efficiently hydrolyze gangliosides to be poor substrates for MHC-related lysosomal sialidase (9Milner C.M. Smith S.V. Carrillo M.B. Taylor G.L. Hollinshead M. Campbell R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4549-4558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the similarities in partial sequence and structure indicate that the three mammalian sialidases share a common ancestor with bacterial sialidases, there must be some sequences responsible for the substrate specificities, active site residues in the hydrophobic pocket presumably being involved because of their difference from those of MHC-related sialidase as well as bacterial sialidases. Interestingly, the region containing these residues was predicted to be on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane by protease protection assays. Sequences for subcellular location are characteristic for each sialidase: the ganglioside sialidase possesses a putative transmembrane domain, whereas no such sequences exist for cytosolic and lysosomal sialidases, which, respectively, have a nuclear translocation signal and a lysosomal targeting sequence. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA showed increased sialidase activity toward ganglioside substrate in the presence of Triton X-100 in the assays. This is consistent with observations using cell homogenates as the enzyme source by Lieser et al. (44Lieser M. Harms E. Kern H. Bach G. Cantz M. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that plasma membrane sialidase is stimulated by non-ionic detergents, suggesting that the increased activity was because of plasma membrane sialidase. The fact that the substrate specificity of the expressed sialidase toward gangliosides was similar to that of the purified enzyme from bovine brain provides further support that the cDNA encodes the sialidase protein. The subcellular localization of this sialidase was determined to be the plasma membrane by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of cell homogenates and by immunofluorescence staining of the transfected cells. Immunostaining was able to demonstrate differences in subcellular localization between the ganglioside sialidase and rat cytosolic sialidase used as a control, precluding an effect of the HSV peptide on expression of these genes because of the consistency with our previous data for anti-peptide antibody specific to the cytosolic sialidase (40Akita H. Miyagi T. Hata K. Kagayama M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Examination of the transmembrane topology of the sialidase by protease protection assays provided evidence for an extracytoplasmic side at the amino terminus, implying that a single putative N-glycosylation site resides unusually in the cytoplasm. This raised a question whether theN-glycosylation site is functional on the sialidase protein expressed in COS-7 cells because our previous data, that RCA120-lectin binds the sialidase fraction at a purification step from bovine brain particulates, have suggested that the sialidase may be an N-glycosylated protein (18Hata K. Wada T. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Miyagi T. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).N-glycosidase treatment, however, resulted in no change in the size of the protein under appropriate conditions, indicating that this protein does not undergo N-glycosylation although it seems to be inconsistent with the tunicamycin results. Tunicamycin treatment in this case may result in changes in other post-translational modification. If it can be concluded that the sialidase is not N-glycosylated, it raises a question about the RCA-lectin binding ability of the brain enzyme. One explanation for this may be that the enzyme is bound to the lectin indirectly through the mediation of a/some protein(s) having the ability, which COS-7 cells do not express. As the alignment of the sequence suggested that possible active site residues are distributed all over the molecule, it is not clear whether this sialidase is catalytic in the membrane-anchored state. Rather, it is likely that the catalysis would occur in the cytoplasmic site of the membrane. There are two possibilities. First, like lectins, the sialidase could bind ganglioside substrates at the cell surface by its extracytoplasmic region covering 7 of 13 active site residues, become internalized into some intracellular compartment such as endosomes, and then catalyze desialylation reaction. Alternatively, it may encounter ganglioside substrates on the cytoplasmic site of the membrane where an appropriate conformation necessary for catalytic activity is maintained, as suggested by the reports on gangliosides present in cytoplasmic site such as cryptic GM3 hidden from the cell surface (45Macala L.J. Yohe H.C. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 46Tatewaki K. Yamaki T. Maeda Y. Tobioka H. Piao H. Yu H. Ibayashi Y. Sawada N. Hashi K. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is quite possible that the above two possibilities could occur concurrently. These hypotheses may explain why the sialidase possesses an acidic optimum pH. In any case, the functional site of the sialidase is probably not only the plasma membrane but also some intracellular components. Because gangliosides are known to influence signal transduction processes (19Zeller C.B. Marchase R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1341-C1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hakomori S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), this sialidase may be involved by their modulation (47Palestini P. Pitto M. Ferraretto A. Tettamanti G. Masserini M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3143-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The sialidase may itself be regulated by phosphorylation of sites in its cytoplasmic portion which could be targeted by kinases, including tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C. The sialidase might be a modulator of diverse phenomena such as cell differentiation, cell growth, and malignant transformation as described above. The presently described cDNA should find application as a useful tool for elucidation of the underlying mechanisms.

The bZIP transcription factor c-Jun, which is part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, is also important for monocytic differentiation, but the monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter has no AP-1 consensus binding sites. We asked the question of whether c-Jun could promote the induction of the M-CSF receptor by collaborating with PU.1. We demonstrate that c-Jun enhances the ability of PU.1 to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter as well as a minimal thymidine kinase promoter containing only PU.1 DNA binding sites. c-Jun does not directly bind to the M-CSF receptor promoter but associates via its basic domain with the ETS domain of PU.1. Consistent with our observation that AP-1 binding does not contribute to c-Jun coactivation is the observation that the activation of PU.1 by c-Jun is blocked by overexpression of c-Fos. Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase on Ser-63 and -73 does not alter the ability of c-Jun to enhance PU.1 transactivation. Activated Ras enhances the transcriptional activity of PU.1 by up-regulating c-Jun expression without changing the phosphorylation pattern of PU.1. The activation of PU.1 by Ras is blocked by a mutant c-Jun protein lacking the basic domain. The expression of this mutant form of c-Jun also completely blocks 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced M-CSF receptor promoter activity during monocytic differentiation. We propose therefore that c-Jun acts as a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-independent coactivator of PU.1, resulting in M-CSF receptor expression and development of the monocytic lineage.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).

Although the important role of the M-CSF receptor for the development of monocytes has been clearly demonstrated, little is known about the signaling molecules or protein-protein interactions that modulate the effect of PU.1 to regulate the M-CSF receptor promoter activity (3Tenen D.G.

In particular, there is evidence that c-Jun plays a role in monocytic differentiation. c-Jun mRNA is up-regulated upon monocyte differentiation of bipotential myeloid cell lines (20Lord K.A.

Blood. 1991; 77: 2618-2623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while stable transfection of c-Jun into myeloid cell lines results in partial differentiation (23Szabo E. Preis L.H. Birrer M.J.

Although c-Jun and PU.1 are both pivotal for monocytic development, it is still unclear whether c-Jun is involved in the regulation of the M-CSF receptor, which is critical for monocyte survival, proliferation, and differentiation. It has been shown that during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced monocytic differentiation of U937 cells, c-Jun and M-CSF receptor mRNA expression increases (25Hass R. Prudovsky I. Kruhoffer M. Leuk. Res. 1997; 21: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter (9Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol.

As c-Jun and the regulation of the M-CSF receptor by PU.1 play important roles in monocytic differentiation, we hypothesized that c-Jun might be involved in the regulation of the M-CSF receptor, not by binding to AP-1 sites, but possibly via a novel mechanism. Therefore, we asked the question of whether c-Jun modulates the ability of PU.1 to transactivate the human monocyte specific M-CSF receptor promoter.

Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the Renilla luciferase values of pRL-null. Results are given as means ± S.E. of at least six independent experiments. The following DNA concentrations of the reporter constructs and expression plasmids were used for LipofectAMINE Plus transfections: 0.3 μg of the human monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter in pXP2, pXP2, the TK promoter with PU.1 sites, and the TK promoter with mutated PU.1 sites; 0.05 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-null; 0.5 μg of pEBG-PU.1; 0.2 μg of the other expression plasmids for PU.1 and PU.1 mutants; 0.25 μg of Ras(L61), Ras(N17), and MEKK1; 0.1 μg of c-Jun, c-Jun mutants, and c-Fos; and the same concentrations of the empty expression vectors as controls, respectively. For electroporation, 10 μg of the firefly luciferase reporter constructs, 5 μg of expression plasmids, and 1 μg of the internal control plasmid were used. pRL-null was chosen as internal control plasmid, because it was not transactivated by Ras (30Behre G.

In some experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of specific unlabeled competitor was added: an oligonucleotide with the PU.1 DNA binding site in the CD11b promoter (41Pahl H.L. Scheibe R.J. Zhang D.-E.

GST-PU.1 was recovered using glutathione-agarose beads, washed seven times with NETN buffer, and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Prior to autoradiography, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) to verify that the protein concentrations of GST-PU.1 and GST were the same in all lanes. To detect changes in the phosphorylation pattern of PU.1 upon stimulation with activated Ras in vivo, 0.5 μg of pEBG-PU.1 either with 0.25 μg of activated Ras(L61) or with inactive Ras(N17) was transfected into 293T cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies). 3 h after transfection, cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 18 h, cells were placed into serum-free and phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) for 30 min before they were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (2.5 mCi/ml). After 4 h, cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and supplemented with aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin as protease inhibitors (Sigma) and sodium pyrophosphate, sodium fluoride, and sodium vanadate as phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). In parallel plates, 0.3 μg of the M-CSF receptor promoter was co-transfected in 293T cells, and luciferase activities were determined to ensure that Ras enhances the transactivation function of PU.1 in the particular experiment used inin vivo labeling and subsequent phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping. GST-PU.1 was isolated from the radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysates using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for phosphoamino acid analysis or nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) for phosphopeptide mapping. After transfer, the 69-kDa GST-PU.1 protein bands were excised. For phosphoamino acid analysis, the samples were boiled at 100 °C for 1 h with 6n HCl (Pierce), and the presence of serine, threonine, or tyrosine phosphorylation was determined as described (43Boyle W.J. van D.G. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). To determine the phosphorylated protein residues of PU.1, GST-PU.1 protein bands were digested with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated chymotrypsin (Worthington) and endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease) (Boehringer Mannheim) and processed for phosphopeptide mapping as described previously (43Boyle W.J. van D.G. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). 24 h after the start of transfection, cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Equal amounts of total protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with anti-c-Jun antibody (catalog no. SC-45; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PU.1 antibody (catalog no. SC-352; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-β-tubulin antibody as an internal control (catalog no. 1111876; Boehringer Mannheim) for 60 min and then with Protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) for 45 min. For U937 cells, an anti-M-CSF receptor antibody (catalog no. SC-692, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Signals were detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham). In parallel plates, the M-CSF receptor promoter construct was co-transfected, and luciferase activities were determined to ensure that Ras enhances the transactivation function of PU.1 in the particular experiment used for Western blot analysis of c-Jun expression or PU.1 expression and that the transfection efficacy was the same (less than 10% difference between plates) in the particular experiment. Differences in protein expression were quantitated by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Since c-Jun and the regulation of the M-CSF receptor by PU.1 are both important for monocytic development, we asked the question of whether c-Jun enhances the ability of PU.1 to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter. CV-1 cells, which contain c-Jun (Fig.4 B), were transfected with a plasmid containing the human monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter (9Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Zhang D.-E. Fujioka K.I. Hetherington C.J. Shapiro L.H. Chen H.M. Look A.T. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8085-8095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene along with expression plasmids for PU.1 and c-Jun, and reporter gene expression was determined 24 h post-transfection. Transfection of a c-Jun expression construct significantly enhanced the ability of PU.1 to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, in c-Jun-deficient F9 cells, PU.1 weakly transactivated the M-CSF receptor promoter (2 fold), while co-expression of c-Jun with PU.1 led to robust transactivation (33-fold) (Fig. 1 B). The cooperation of c-Jun with PU.1 is therefore important for M-CSF receptor promoter activity.Figure 1Effect of c-Jun on the ability of PU.1 to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter and a minimal TK promoter containing only PU.1 DNA binding sites. A, CV-1 cells were transfected with the human monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter or the promoterless vector pXP2 and with the expression plasmids pECE-PU.1 and pSV-SPORT1-c-Jun. Luciferase activities were determined 24 h after transient transfection with LipofectAMINE Plus and normalized to the activities of the internal control plasmid pRL-null. B, c-Jun-deficient F9 cells were transfected as described for Fig. 1 A. C, F9 cells were transfected with a minimal TK promoter with PU.1 sites or a minimal TK promoter with mutated PU.1 sites and with the expression plasmids for PU.1 and c-Jun.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next asked the following questions: (a) whether the binding of PU.1 to DNA was necessary for its activation by c-Jun and (b) whether a PU.1 binding site alone was sufficient for the c-Jun-enhanced PU.1 activation. We observed enhanced PU.1 transactivation mediated by c-Jun using a reporter construct containing four PU.1 binding sites cloned upstream of a minimal TK promoter (Fig.1 C). In control experiments, no effect of c-Jun on PU.1 activity was observed when the PU.1 binding sites were mutated (Fig.1 C). These data indicate that PU.1 binding to DNA is necessary for its activation by c-Jun and that PU.1 binding sites are sufficient to mediate this effect. To elucidate the mechanism by which c-Jun augments the transcriptional activity of PU.1, we performed experiments to determine whether the activation of PU.1 by c-Jun required the binding of c-Jun·AP-1 complexes to the M-CSF receptor promoter. Since there are no AP-1 consensus sites in the human monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter from bp −88 to +71 with respect to the major monocytic transcription start site (9Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Zhang D.-E. Fujioka K.I. Hetherington C.J. Shapiro L.H. Chen H.M. Look A.T.

Preincubation of the cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 prior to forskolin stimulation abolished AQP-2 translocation. In contrast to H89, S-Ht31 did not affect the catalytic activity of PKA.

In the present work it was investigated whether the compartmentalization of PKA by AKAPs is obligatory for AQP-2 translocation. A recently described primary cell culture model of rat IMCD cells (20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar) was utilized to address this question. The synthetic peptide Ht31, derived from the human AKAP Ht31 (residues 493–515; Ref. 21Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

This inhibits binding of regulatory PKA subunits to AKAPs and consequently the tethering of PKA to subcellular compartments. The inactive control peptide Ht31-P, containing prolines at positions 502 and 507, does not assume the amphipathic helix structure and therefore cannot prevent binding of PKA regulatory subunits to AKAPs. For detection of AKAPs with radioactive regulatory RII subunits of PKA in RII overlay experiments, Ht31 and Ht31-P were used without stearate. S-Ht31 and S-Ht31-P are coupled to stearate residues and thus rendered membrane-permeable (22Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); these peptides were used in experiments with intact IMCD cells. All peptides, including AVP, were synthesized on a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) on Rapp resin columns (Rapp Polymere, Tuebingen, Germany) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Stearic acid was added to the free N terminus of the protected peptides before cleavage from the resin. The peptides were purified and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on Polyencap A300 columns (Bischoff, Leonberg, Germany) and electrospray mass spectrometry (TSQ 700, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). IMCD cells were cultured in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP as described (20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Dibutyryl cAMP was removed 16 h before experimental analyses, which were performed 6 days after seeding. The cells were incubated with synthetic peptides (S-Ht31 and S-Ht31-P) or the PKA inhibitor H89 (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) as indicated. AQP-2 was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy as described (20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar, 23Oksche A. Dehe M. Schülein R. Wiesner B. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals (xy images) were detected by confocal microscopy with a laser scanning microscope (LSM 410; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For quantification the immunofluorescence and transmission images of each cell were scanned with the confocal microscope. These two images were used for determination of the intracellular and cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities with an image analysis software (KS400, Kontron Electronic). Cytosol, cell membranes, and nuclei of each cell were marked on the transmission image. The masks obtained were transferred to the immunofluorescence images and immunofluorescence signal intensities were measured in the marked areas. Intracellular and cell membrane signal intensities were related to the signal intensity of the nucleus (subtraction of unspecific immunofluorescence signals derived from the secondary antibody). Then the intracellular:cell membrane signal intensity ratios were calculated. For all groups mean and S.E. values were calculated. Statistically significant differences were determined using the Student's t test and one way analysis of variance. In addition to xy scans, z scans were carried out to investigate the fluorescence at different levels in z direction. IMCD cells were either untreated or stimulated with AVP (1 μm). Fractions enriched for cell membranes (low speed pellet (LS), 17,000 × g) or intracellular vesicles (high speed pellet (HS), 200,000 × g) were prepared as described (24Mandon B. Chou C.-L. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Marples D. Knepper M.A. Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C655-C664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AQP-2 was detected by Western blot with the antiserum H27 (1:5,000; Ref. 20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Catalytic PKA subunits were detected with a specific antiserum kindly provided by Dr. G. Schwoch (1:4,000; University of Göttingen, Germany; Refs. 20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar and 26Schwoch G. Hamann A. Hilz H. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was used as secondary antibody (1:2,500). AKAPs were detected by the RII overlay procedure described previously (27Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overlays were carried out in the presence of either the active peptide Ht31 (10 μm) or the control peptide Ht31-P (10 μm; see above). HS pellets (25 μg; see above) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 mm, 10 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products, Köln, Germany) and exogenous catalytic PKA subunits (20 units/ml; Promega, Mannheim, Germany; Ref. 13Lande M.B. Jo I. Zeidel M.L. Somers M. Harris H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5552-5557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). H89, Me2SO, or synthetic peptides were added as indicated. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography. Rat IMCD cells were cultured for 6 days as described (20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to stimulation with AVP (1 μm, 30 min) or forskolin (100 μm, 15 min), they were incubated with the membrane-permeable peptide S-Ht31 (100 μm, 30 min), which inhibits the binding of PKA to AKAPs, or with the corresponding (inactive) control peptide S-Ht31-P (100 μm, 30 min). Subsequently, the distribution of AQP-2 was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig.1 A shows a mainly intracellular distribution of AQP-2 in nonstimulated control cells. After stimulation of the cells with forskolin (Fig. 1 B), the AQP-2 staining was mainly present at the basolateral cell membranes as shown by both xy and z scans (20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of the cells with S-Ht31 prior to forskolin stimulation strongly inhibited this redistribution (Fig. 1 C), whereas preincubation with the control peptide S-Ht31-P inhibited the redistribution of AQP-2 only weakly (Fig. 1 D). Preincubation with the PKA inhibitor H89 abolished AQP-2 redistribution (Fig. 1 E). To quantify the effect of the synthetic peptides and of H89, intracellular and cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities were related to nuclear fluorescence signal intensities by laser scanning microscopy (Fig.2 A), and the ratios of intracellular/cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities were determined (Fig. 2 B; see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 B shows two groups of ratios: ratios > 1 were determined for nonstimulated control cells (1.77 ± 0.08; mean ± S.E.) and for forskolin-stimulated cells preincubated with H89 (1.75 ± 0.05) or S-Ht31 (1.58 ± 0.06), indicating a primarily intracellular location of AQP-2. Ratios < 1 were determined for forskolin-stimulated cells (0.31 ± 0.02) and for cells preincubated with S-Ht31-P (0.60 ± 0.05) prior to forskolin stimulation, indicating a predominant localization of AQP-2 at the cell membrane. The ratios obtained for nonstimulated cells and forskolin-stimulated cells preincubated with H89 or S-Ht31 were significantly higher than those for forskolin-stimulated cells with or without S-Ht31-P preincubation. Preincubation with the control peptide S-Ht31-P partially inhibited AQP-2 translocation, probably due to inhibition of PKA (see below). These results demonstrate that not only the catalytic activity of PKA, but also its tethering to subcellular compartments via anchoring by AKAPs, are prerequisites for the AQP-2 translocation.Figure 2Quantitative analysis of the effects of the synthetic peptides S-Ht31 and S-Ht31-P and the PKA inhibitor H89 on forskolin-induced AQP-2 translocation in IMCD cells. Cells were treated as indicated in Fig. 1, A–E. Immunofluorescence staining of AQP-2 was visualized and quantitatively analyzed by laser scanning microscopy (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”).A, intracellular and cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities were related to the nuclear fluorescence signal intensities for 44 cells under each set of conditions (8-bit scale; mean ± S.E.; three independent experiments). B, the ratios of intracellular/cell membrane fluorescence signal intensities were calculated. Ratios > 1 indicate a predominantly intracellular localization of AQP-2, and ratios < 1 a predominant localization at the cell membrane. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the ratios are given. Differences between the ratios obtained for nonstimulated cells and forskolin-stimulated cells preincubated with H89 or S-Ht31 were not significantly different.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the influence of the synthetic peptides and of H89 on the catalytic activity of PKA,in vitro phosphorylation assays were performed (Fig.3). Endogenous protein kinase activity of the HS fraction was very low (not shown). Addition of exogenous catalytic subunits of PKA led to the phosphorylation of various proteins. This effect was abolished by H89 (30 μm), but appeared to be slightly enhanced in the presence of Me2SO (1%), in which the peptides were dissolved. Incubations with the peptides S-Ht31, Ht31 and Ht31-P in 10 or 100 μmconcentrations did not inhibit phosphorylation. S-Ht31-P did not inhibit phosphorylation at a concentration of 10 μm, but, similarly to H89, abolished phosphorylation at a concentration of 100 μm. The inhibitory effect of S-Ht31-P on PKA activity may explain the partial inhibition of AQP-2 redistribution by this peptide (Figs. 1 and 2). Western blotting was used to demonstrate the presence of AQP-2 and catalytic PKA subunits in fractions from IMCD cells enriched for either cell membranes (LS) or intracellular vesicles (HS; Fig. 4). Catalytic PKA subunits were detected in both fractions, and no change in distribution between the two fractions was observed after stimulation with AVP (− and + AVP in Fig. 4) or forskolin (not shown). In contrast, the amount of AQP-2 decreased in the intracellular vesicle fraction after stimulation, indicating a shift to the cell membrane as described previously (20Maric K. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F796-F801PubMed Google Scholar). RII overlay assays of total IMCD cell homogenate and subcellular fractions enriched for cell membranes (LS) or intracellular vesicles (HS) with radioactively labeled RII subunits were carried out (see “Experimental Procedures”). The overlay in Fig. 5 A was performed in the presence of the control peptide Ht31-P (or in the absence of peptide, not shown), and that in Fig. 5 B in the presence of Ht31. The remaining bands (55 kDa) in Fig. 5 B probably represent regulatory RII subunits. The peptide Ht31 inhibits all binding of the radioactive RII subunits to the membrane-bound proteins, excepting the 55-kDa protein. Thus the bands visible in Fig. 5 A represent AKAPs. One AKAP (35 kDa) was found only in the fraction enriched for cell membranes (LS) and several others (70–80, 95, and >120 kDa) only in the fraction enriched for intracellular vesicles (HS). No change in distribution of AKAPs between the two fractions was observed after stimulation with AVP (− and + AVP in Fig. 5) or forskolin (not shown). AKAPs are targeting proteins, which anchor PKA in close proximity to its substrates (15Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 16Faux M.C. Scott J.D.

Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Membrane-permeable peptides (myristylated or stearated) comprising the amphipathic helix region of Ht31 (21Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) effectively compete for PKA-AKAP interaction (17Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides have been shown to relieve cAMP-dependent inhibition of interleukin-2 transcription (17Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430PubMed Google Scholar) and to arrest sperm motility (22Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this study, synthetic Ht31-derived peptides coupled to stearic acid (S-Ht31) were used to demonstrate that the targeting of PKA to subcellular compartments via AKAPs is a prerequisite for cAMP-mediated AQP-2 translocation (Figs. 1 and 2). Incubation of primary cultured IMCD cells with S-Ht31 strongly inhibited AQP-2 translocation, although less efficiently than incubation with the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 2). The peptide, in contrast to H89, did not inhibit PKA activity in an in vitrophosphorylation assay (Fig. 3). It is therefore highly unlikely that S-Ht31 inhibits PKA activity in IMCD cells. A minor fraction of intracellular AQP-2 may be phosphorylated by the nontethered, cytosolic PKA which may explain why S-Ht31 inhibits translocation not completely, in contrast to H89. The control peptide S-Ht31-P did not inhibit PKA activity at a low concentration (10 μm) in the in vitro phosphorylation assay, but abolished the activity at the concentration used for incubation of IMCD cells (100 μm, Fig. 3). The apparent discrepancy between complete inhibition of PKA activity in vitro and the small inhibitory effect of S-Ht31-P on AQP-2 translocation in IMCD cells (Figs. 1 and 2) may arise because the intracellular peptide concentration is most probably lower than that of the growth medium. Therefore, inhibition of PKA appears dependent on the amount of S-Ht31-P that actually enters the cell. The finding that several different AKAPs and catalytic PKA subunits are present in IMCD cell fractions enriched for intracellular vesicles (HS) that contain AQP-2 is consistent with these proteins residing on the same vesicles (Figs. 4 and 5). Since additional AKAPs were, however, also found in the fraction enriched for cell membranes (LS; Fig. 5), it is also possible that the AKAPs required for AQP-2 translocation are present on other cellular compartments, like cell membranes or the cytoskeleton. There was no decrease in the amount of catalytic PKA subunits or AKAPs in the HS fraction after AVP stimulation, in contrast to AQP-2, which redistributed to the cell membrane (Figs. 4 and 5). Furthermore, the distribution of proteins of about 55 kDa, probably representing regulatory PKA subunits, did not change after stimulation (Fig. 5). The HS fractions may contain minor amounts of cytosol or particulate subcellular compartments other than AQP-2-bearing vesicles, veiling small differences in the distribution of PKA or AKAPs after stimulation (for example in HEK293 cells 90% of PKA RII α- and β-subunits are cytosolic (28Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). On the other hand, no redistribution of other proteins than AQP-2 to the cell membrane after stimulation of IMCD cells with AVP or forskolin has been described to date, although a co-enrichment of AQP-2-bearing vesicles and Rab3 proteins (29Liebenhoff U. Rosenthal W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the colocalization of AQP-2, synaptobrevin II, dynein, and dynactin on vesicles have been demonstrated (30Jo I.

Physiol. 1998; 274: F384-F394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, delivery of AQP-2 to the apical cell membrane may possibly be followed by immediate recycling of other vesicle-associated proteins. Recently it was shown that PKA anchoring to AKAPs facilitates glucagon like peptide-1-mediated insulin secretion in primary islets and RINm5F cells (33Lester L.B. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14942-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), underlining the significance of PKA compartmentalization in exocytosis. Members of the cytoskeleton-associated ERM family (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) of proteins (34Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) have been identified as AKAPs (35Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Ezrin seems to be directly involved in the control of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells (35Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), a cAMP-dependent exocytosis analogous to the translocation of AQP-2 in kidney principal cells. The expression of ezrin in kidney collecting duct epithelium has been demonstrated (36Bretscher A. Reczek D. Berryman M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3011-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we recently showed the presence of moesin in principal cells (37Klussmann E. Maric K. Krause E. Eichhorst J. Beziat P. Rosenthal W. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76 (abstr.): B58Google Scholar). Ezrin and/or moesin might play a similar role in AQP-2 translocation to that of ezrin in acid secretion. This possibility is being investigated at present. Furthermore, we are attempting to identify the AKAPs detected by the overlay technique in the IMCD cell fraction enriched for intracellular vesicles. Vesicle-associated AKAPs may play a general role in cAMP-dependent exocytotic events, including those mentioned above, and also mast cell degranulation or thyroglobulin secretion. We thank Dr. E. Krause (Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany) for performing mass spectrometric analysis of the synthetic peptides used in this study and Dr. G.

Peanut allergy is one of the most severe food allergies due to its persistency and the life-threatening character (1Sampson H.A. McCaskill C.C. J. Pediatr. 1985; 107: 669-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The prevalence of peanut allergy in the Western world has been estimated at 1 in 10,000 up to 1 in 200 (2Tariq S.M. Stevens M. Matthews S. Ridout S. Twiselton R. Hide D.W. Br. Med. J. 1996; 313: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and seems to be increasing during the last decades. An explanation for this increased prevalence is controversial. The fact that sensitization routes are not always obvious (3van Reijsen F.C. Felius A. Wauters E.A. Bruijnzeel-Koomen C.A. Koppelman S.J. J. Allergy Clin.

Petersen A. Schlaak M. Becker W.M. Monogr. Allergy. 1996; 32: 92-98PubMed Google Scholar). Peanuts are widely used in the food industry owing to their nutritive value and to their taste. Consumer product diversification led to an increase in recipes containing peanuts, resulting in an increased risk for inadvertent ingestion of peanuts by allergic individuals. Additionally, contamination of intended peanut-free products with traces of peanuts led to several fatal and near-fatal allergic reactions. Test kits to establish the presence of peanut protein in finished foods are currently commercially available (18Koppelman S.J. Bleeker Marcelis H. van Duijn G. Hessing M. World Ingredients. 1996; 12: 35-38Google Scholar, 19Yeung J.M. Collins P.G. J. AOAC Int. 1996; 79: 1411-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the lack of legislation concerning labeling of food allergens hampers a systematic control of suspected products (20Smith J. Int. Food Ingredients. 1997; : 13-14Google Scholar). The origin of peanut proteins in foods is not always obvious. In most cases, roasted or fried peanuts are used because of their improved flavor and taste compared with their raw counterparts. Foods containing vegetable oil, however, may contain peanut proteins (10Hourihane J.O. Bedwani S.J. Dean T.P. Warner J.O. Br. Med. J. 1997; 314: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Phillips R.D. Beuchat L.R. ACS Symp. Ser. 1981; 147: 275-298Crossref Google Scholar) that are not heated during processing. Therefore, peanut allergic individuals are exposed to both native and heat-treated peanut proteins and both can provoke allergic reactions. It is generally accepted that peanuts preserve their allergenic character upon heating, as binding properties of IgE and IgG to a crude peanut extract are neither diminished nor enhanced by heating (22Nordlee J.A. Taylor S.L. Jones R.T. Yunginger J.W. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1981; 68: 376-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Burks A.W. Williams L.W. Thresher W. Connaughton C. Cockrell G. Helm R.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 90: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether in these complex systems heat treatment leads to denaturation of the peanut allergens on a molecular level; consequently, the effect of heat denaturation on the allergenic properties of the peanut allergens is not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the heat-induced conformational changes of Ara h 1, and to study the coinciding effects on its allergenic properties. We found that native Ara h 1 is a highly structured protein, on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary folding levels. Both heat-treated purified Ara h 1 and Ara h 1 isolated from heated peanuts show conformational changes, whereas the in vitro allergenic potential is hardly affected. This study clearly shows that the allergenic character ofAra h 1 is heat-stable, although the structural organization of this major peanut allergen is changed significantly upon heating. Peanuts (Arachis hypogea) from the Runner cultivar (Cargill, Dawson, GA) were generously provided by Imko Gelria (Doetinchem, The Netherlands) and were stored at 10 °C until use. Peanuts were ground and heat-treated at 50, 80, 90, 110, 140, 155, 170, or 200 °C for 15 min in a thermostated prewarmed hot air oven. Heat treatment at 140 °C and 150 °C resulted in a light brown coloration of the ground peanuts and the release of a typical roasted peanut flavor. At higher temperatures, ground peanuts appeared brown (170 °C) or dark brown (200 °C) under the release of a burning smell. Heat treatment up to 110 °C did not give rise to coloration or scent. After heat treatment, the ground peanuts were stored at 4 °C until use. Peanut protein extracts were made by mixing 20 g of ground peanut with 100 ml of 20 mmbis-Tris-propane 1The abbreviations bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryFTIRFourier transform infraredATRattenuated total reflection buffer (pH 7.2). After 2 h of stirring at room temperature, the aqueous fraction was collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g at room temperature for 30 min). The aqueous phase was subsequently centrifuged (10,000 × g at room temperature for 30 min) to remove residual traces of fat and insoluble particles. The clear extracts were extensively dialyzed against 20 mmbis-Tris-propane buffer (pH 7.2) at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford analysis with BSA as a standard. Reducing SDS-PAGE from extracts from ground peanuts heated up to 140 °C showed similar patterns where Ara h 1 migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa, making up approximately 10% of the total extracted protein based on densitometer analysis of the gel. In extracts from ground peanuts heated at 155 °C and higher temperatures some high molecular mass protein bands were absent. Extracts were stored at −20 °C. 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline differential scanning calorimetry Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflection Ara h 1 was purified generally as described previously (7Burks A.W.

Spanhaak S. Koppelman S.J. Pellegrom H. Penninks A.H. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1998; 28: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In short, dialyzed extracts from heat-treated and non-heat-treated ground peanuts were applied on an 8-ml Source Q column (FPLC protein purification system, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) previously equilibrated with 20 mmbis-Tris-propane of pH 7.2 (loading buffer) at room temperature. The column was washed with loading buffer until theA 280 of the effluent was less than 0.02. Proteins were eluted using a linear sodium chloride gradient in loading buffer (up to 1 m in 200 ml at a flow of 4 ml/min). Fractions were collected and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Ara h 1eluted from 290 to 310 mm sodium chloride and appeared to be essentially pure (>95%) as judged from a densitometer scan of an SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Comparison of non-reduced and reduced SDS-PAGE gels showed that approximately 10% ofAra h 1 was present as di- and trimers. Further purification steps were omitted in order to maintain the native character ofAra h 1. The N-terminal sequence was determined according to the Edman degradation procedure on an Applied Biosystems Protein sequencing system (SeCU, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and appeared to be identical to the earlier published sequence of Ara h 1 (8de Jong E.C. van Zijverden M. Spanhaak S. Koppelman S.J. Pellegrom H. Penninks A.H. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1998; 28: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Purified Ara h 1 was stored at −80 °C until use. If not mentioned otherwise, samples were desalted on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), previously equilibrated with a 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) containing 50 mmsodium chloride. Concentrations of Ara h 1 were determined by absorbance measurement at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 36130 m−1 cm−1(A 280 0.1% (1 mg/ml) = 0.59) calculated based on the amino acid composition of Ara h 1 (16Burks A.W. Cockrell G. Stanley J.S. Helm R.M. Bannon G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1715-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Serum from 8 adult patients with a documented peanut allergy was used for studying the interaction of Ara h 1 with IgE. Each of these individuals had a positive skin prick test to peanuts and a convincing history of peanut anaphylaxis. The presence of IgE in the serum specific for Ara h 1 was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. Both a non-allergic and an allergic, but not peanut-allergic, individual were used as controls. Venous blood was withdrawn from the individuals and allowed to clot. Serum was collected by centrifugation and stored in aliquots at −20 °C until use. All studies were approved by the Medical and Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center of Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands). Far-UV CD spectra of 0.10 mg/ml Ara h 1 in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were recorded as averages of 10 spectra on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp.) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 90 ± 0.5 °C with intervals of 10 °C. Quartz cells with an optical path length of 0.1 cm were used. The temperature in these cells was measured using a thermocouple wire. The scan range was 260–185 nm, the scan speed 50 nm/min, the spectral resolution 0.2 nm, bandwidth 1.0 nm, and the response time 0.125 s. Spectra were corrected for a protein-free spectrum obtained under identical conditions, and subsequent noise reduction was applied according to the Jasco software. The spectra were analyzed from 240 to 190 nm with a 1-nm resolution to estimate the secondary structure content of the proteins. Spectra were fitted using a non-linear regression procedure with reference spectra of polylysine in the α-helix, β-strand, and random coil conformation (24Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar) and the spectrum of β-turn structures, extracted from spectra of 24 proteins with known x-ray structure (25Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang Y.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Such a fitting procedure gives the relative contributions of the reference spectra that make up the best fit of the measured spectrum and from which the secondary structure can be calculated. A problem with the interpretation of the far-UV CD data at different temperatures could be the unknown effect of elevated temperatures on the spectra used as reference in the analysis. However, far-UV CD measurements of polylysine in the random coil conformation showed no spectral changes at elevated temperatures and the root-mean-square of the fits remained below 8 over the whole temperature range. 2S. J. Koppelman and H. H. J. de Jongh, unpublished results. Near-UV CD spectra of 1.0 mg/ml Ara h 1 in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were recorded as averages of 25 spectra at temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 90 ± 0.5 °C at intervals of 10 °C. Quartz cells with an optical path length of 0.1 cm were used. The temperature in these cells was measured using a thermocouple wire. The scan range was 350–250 nm, the scan speed 50 nm/min, the data interval 0.5 nm, bandwidth 1.0 nm, and the response time 0.25 s. Temperature resolved experiments were performed monitoring the ellipticity at defined wavelengths both in the far- and near-UV region by heating samples with a rate of 0.5 °C/min and averaging the CD signal over 16 s. Fluorescence spectra of 0.1 mg/mlAra h 1 in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were recorded as averages of three spectra on a Perkin Elmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50 B with pulsed xenon source. Spectra were recorded at temperatures ranging from 20 to 70 ± 0.5 °C at intervals of 10 °C. Excitation was at 295 nm, and the resulting emission was measured from 305 to 405 nm with a scan speed of 120 nm/min. Both the excitation and emission slit were 3.5 nm. Spectra were corrected for a protein-free spectrum obtained under identical conditions, and the spectra were subsequently smoothed using the software supplied by Perkin Elmer. FTIR measurements were performed on an ATR ZnSe crystal after evaporation of the solvent of a 70-μl sample of 1 mg/mlAra h 1 to such an extent that the peptide backbone remained at least fully hydrated, based on the shape of the H2O/amide A band at 3400–3100 cm−1. Spectra were recorded as averages of 16 scans on a Bio-Rad FTS 6000 Spectrometer equipped with a KBr beamsplitter, a deuterated triglycin sulfate detector with an Eurotherm automatic temperature controller. Spectra were recorded from 400 to 6000 cm−1 and stored from 1200 to 2000−1, with a nominal resolution of 2 cm−1. The spectral resolution was enhanced to 1 cm−1 by zero filling prior to Fourier transformation. The interferograms were symmetrized, and the contribution of atmospheric water was eliminated by subtraction of the appropriate spectrum. A stock solution of 5 mg/ml Ara h 1 in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) in the presence of 50 mm sodium chloride was heated to 60 °C. Aliquots of this prewarmed stock solution were added to the same buffer in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length, equilibrated at 85 °C making final protein-concentrations from 0.05 to 1.0 mg/ml. Next, the absorbance at 400 nm of the sample was monitored on a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer at 85 °C for 1 h under continuous stirring of the sample. To determine sedimentation coefficients of the Ara h 1 samples 5–20% sucrose step gradients (12 ml total volume) were prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffers (pH 6.7). Prior to the experiments, the gradients were allowed to diffuse to linearity during 24 h at 4 °C, and 0.3-ml aliquots of 4 mg/ml Ara h 1were loaded on top of the gradient. Next, the tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman L60 centrifuge at 186,000 × g for 16 h at 20 °C. After centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated in 0.5-ml aliquots, of which the absorbance at 280 nm was determined. Sedimentation coefficients were estimated after calibration of the gradient in a separate experiment using proteins with known S values (γ-globulin (11.2 S), catalase (7 S), BSA (4.4 S), trypsin (2.5 S), and ribonuclease (1.78 S)). Chromatographic analysis of samples containing 0.1 mg/mlAra h 1 was performed using a Pharmacia Smart System on a Superdex 200 column (3.2 × 300 mm; Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), equilibrated and run at 20 °C at 80 μl/min in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) filtered through 0.2-μm filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Prior to analysis, the Superdex 200 column was calibrated using blue dextran (2.000 kDa), thyroglobulin (667 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), and sodium ascorbate (176 Da). Samples were loaded onto the column using a 50-μl loop. DSC was performed on a Micro-DSC III (Setaram, Caluire, France) using 0.9-ml vessels and a detection limit for transitions of minimal 84 μJ g−1 °C−1. A 4 mg/ml Ara h 1 solution in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was heated from 20 °C to 100 °C with a scan rate of 0.5 °C/min, cooled to 20 °C with 3 °C/min, and subsequently reheated to 100 °C with 0.5 °C/min. Affinities of Ara h 1 for IgE were measured using IgE binding experiments generally according to Burks et al.(23Burks A.W. Williams L.W. Thresher W. Connaughton C. Cockrell G. Helm R.M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1992; 90: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dilutions of Ara h 1 purified from peanuts treated at different temperatures (final concentrations: 0.003–100 μg/ml, calculated based on the A 280 and the molar extinction coefficient) were incubated with a 1:30 dilution of patient serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. In this fluid phase, Ara h 1 was allowed to bind to IgE for 1 h at room temperature under gently shaking conditions. In order to determine the non-bound IgE fraction, the incubation mixtures were transferred to the 96-well plates pretreated as follows. 96-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml Ara h 1 purified from non-heat-treated peanuts in PBS and subsequently blocked with BSA (1% in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) to diminish the nonspecific binding. IgE bound to the Ara h 1-coated wells was detected using an anti-human IgE antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Between each step, plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The inhibition of IgE binding as a function of the amount of Ara h 1 present in the preincubation sample reflects the affinity of Ara h 1 for IgE. The concentrations needed for half-maximal inhibition were calculated using a semi-logarithmic equation and were used to compare the affinities of the different forms of Ara h 1 for IgE. Fig.1A displays the far-UV CD spectrum ofAra h 1 at 20 °C. The spectrum has a negative extreme around 209 nm, with a small shoulder around 222 nm, and crosses zero ellipticity at 199 nm. Such a spectrum is characteristic for a protein with a high degree of structures at a secondary level (25Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang Y.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Spectral analysis to obtain an estimation of the secondary structure content using non-linear least square regression procedures reveals 31% α-helices, 36% β-structures, and 33% random coil. This secondary structure content is qualitatively confirmed by the shape of the amide I band in the IR spectrum of Ara h 1 (Fig.2 A, solid line) where a maximum is observed at 1638 cm−1, indicative for a high degree of β-structures (26Kalnin N.N. Baikalov I.A. Venyaminov S.Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 30: 1273-1280Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Vuilleumier S. Sancho J. Loewenthal R. Fersht A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10303-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Also, a clear shoulder around 1660 cm−1 is apparent, indicating a comparable amount of helical structures (28de Jongh H.H.J. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Figure 2A, amide I regions of ATR-FTIR spectra of Ara h 1 at 20 °C prior to (solid line) and after (dashed line) heating a 1 mg/ml Ara h 1 solution in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 60 min at 90 °C.

Two major spectral bands with a positive ellipticity can be observed, one centered around 280 nm, and one around 312 nm. Ara h 1 contains 22 phenylalanines, 6 tyrosines, and 5 tryptophans, which generally absorb in the 260–290 nm, 280–300 nm, and 300–320 nm region, respectively, when these residues are involved in a tertiary interaction network (27Vuilleumier S. Sancho J. Loewenthal R. Fersht A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10303-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). From this spectrum, a distinct tertiary fold can be ascribed to the protein, based on the CD intensities observed, comparable to those found for other plant storage proteins like patatin (29Pots A.M. de Jongh H.H.J. Gruppen H. Hamer R.J. Voragen A.G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar) or glycinin. 3Lakemond, C. M. M., de Jongh, H. H.-J., Hessing, M., Gruppen, H., and Voragen, A. G. J., submitted for publication. An alternative for studying tertiary interactions is by monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence of Ara h 1 (spectrum not shown). The observed fluorescence maximum of 348 nm, however, is close to that of free tryptophan in an aqueous environment (353 nm), whereas a solvent-buried local environment of the tryptophans would have maxima around 330–335 nm (31Berkhout T.A. Rietveld A. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This indicates that the tryptophans of Ara h 1 are relatively on the outside of the protein. To investigate the conformational state of Ara h 1 at a quaternary level, ultracentrifugation experiments have been performed to determine the S value. Fig.4 A shows the sucrose-gradient profile, where it can be seen that the protein distribution displays a symmetric band of approximately 8 S, based on calibration of the gradient with various proteins with known S values. 8 S would correspond to a protein-complex of 180–200 kDa, indicative for a trimer form of Ara h 1. Another indication for a trimer organization of this protein is provided by size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superose 6 column, which elution profile is displayed in Fig. 4 B. The peak observed at 1.25 ml corresponds to a mass of 180 kDa (for globular proteins). To study the heat denaturation of Ara h 1, DSC experiments have been performed as presented in Fig.5. A clear endothermic transition can be observed with an onset temperature of 83 °C and a maximum at 87 °C. The energy content of this transition is 30 kcal/mol. Lowering the heating rate did not affect the position of the transition, indicating that the sample was always in thermodynamic equilibrium under the conditions used (results not shown). Upon cooling of the sample, no transition was observed, demonstrating that the denaturation was not reversible, and complete, as indicated by the second heating scan. These latter two traces are also displayed in Fig.5, but are shifted vertically to improve the clarity of the figure. To get insight in what the effects are of heat treatment on the conformation of the protein at the distinct folding levels, we monitored on-line the changes in CD ellipt"

Infection of eukaryotic cells with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) resulted in stimulation of both JNK/SAPK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase after 3 h of infection, and activation reached a maximum of 4-fold by 9 h post-infection. By using a series of mutant viruses, we showed that the virion transactivator protein VP16 stimulates p38/JNK, whereas no immediate-early, early, or late viral expressed gene is involved. We identified the stress-activated protein kinase kinase 1 as an upstream activator of p38/JNK, and we demonstrated that activation of AP-1 binding proceeded p38/JNK stimulation. During infection, the activated AP-1 consisted mainly of JunB and JunD with a simultaneous decrease in the cellular levels of Jun protein. We suggest that activation of the stress pathways by HSV-1 infection either represents a cascade triggered by the virus to facilitate the lytic cycle or a defense mechanism of the host cell against virus invasion.

Active Ras recruits to the plasma membrane and activates the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf-1. Active Raf-1 phosphorylates the MAP/ERK kinases (MEKs) 1 and 2, which in turn stimulate the respective ERKs (3Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. Depinho R.A.

Herpes viruses are ubiquitous eukaryotic pathogens that possess a common basic structure consisting of an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a linear, double-stranded DNA genome, surrounded by a proteinaceous tegument and a membranous envelope. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the best characterized member of the family, and during the lytic cycle, viral gene expression can be divided into three temporal stages, based upon the appearance of the gene products (for review see Ref. 19Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2231-2295Google Scholar). Immediate-early (IE) genes are transcribed in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, and their products act to orchestrate the expression of the early and late genes. Transcription of the five viral IE genes is initiated by the virion tegument protein VP16 (Vmw65) through formation of a multiprotein-DNA complex on viral promoters that includes the pre-existing cellular proteins Oct-1 and host cell factor (HCF) (Ref.20Wilson A.C. Freiman R.N. Goto H. Nishimoto T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6139-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and for review see Ref. 21O'Hare P. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 145-155Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Four of the five IE gene products (Vmw175, Vmw63, Vmw110, and Vmw68) are phosphorylated nucleoproteins with regulatory activities that prime the cell for efficient HSV-1 infection and control the expression of viral early and late genes. Proteins Vmw175 and Vmw63 are absolutely essential for lytic virus replication, whereas Vmw110 is not essential but it is important for the efficient entry into the lytic phase of infection and interacts with a number of cellular components (22Stow N.D. Stow E.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 23Sacks W.R. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 829-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Everett R.D. J. Gen.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Vmw68 plays roles in the efficient late gene expression and phosphorylation of the cellular RNA polymerase II (26Sears A.E.

Virol. 1995; 69: 5550-5559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fifth IE gene product (Vmw12) is a cytoplasmic protein postulated to assist virus in avoiding immune detection (28York I.A. Roop C. Andrews D.W. Riddell S.R. Graham F.L. Johnson D.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 525-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). An additional HSV gene,UL39, that encodes the large subunit (R1) of the viral ribonucleotide reductase is expressed during IE times, but its function at this stage of infection is not yet understood (29Conner J. Murray J. Cross A. Clements J.B. Marsden H. Virology. 1995; 213: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Conner J. Cooper J. Furlong J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of early gene products occurs approximately 4–5 h postinfection, and they are mostly virally encoded enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and replication. Efficient expression of late genes that encode mostly structural proteins commences approximately 6–7 h postinfection, and their full expression requires viral DNA synthesis. Recently, much attention has focused on the potential use of HSV-1 as a gene delivery vector for the nervous system and other tissues (31Fink D.J. DeLuca N.A. Goins W.F. Glorioso J.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 265-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Production of effective vectors requires a full understanding of the biological mechanisms activated by viral infection and a detailed analysis of the host cell response during the immediate-early and early phases of viral invasion. Our study shows stimulation of the JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK stress pathways by viral protein VP16 during virus immediate-early and early times, with a concomitant rise in AP-1 binding activity. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown in BHK medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. Chinese hamster ovary and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

A nonradioactive kit for detection of p38 MAPK activity was used as directed by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK). Plasmids pMCI, expressing full-length VP16 and pMCI del, encoding a truncated form lacking the transactivation domain, were kindly provided by Dr. C. M. Preston. Subconfluent cell monolayers were infected with either wild-type HSV-1 (strain 17+) or mutant HSV-1 viruses at multiplicity of infection of 10 pfu per cell, unless stated otherwise. Infected cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, before harvesting. In experiments with the tsk virus, infected cells were grown at 38.5 °C (non-permissive temperature) or at 32 °C (permissive temperature) before harvesting. For UV irradiation of BHK cells, the medium was removed and the cell monolayer was exposed to 80 J/m2 in a UV cross-linker. The medium was replaced, and the cells were returned to the incubator for 30 min before harvesting. BHK cells were grown in 30-mm dishes and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), as indicated by the manufacturer. Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection, and pull down kinase assays were peformed. For immunocomplex and pull down kinase assays, harvested cells from a 60-mm plate were incubated on ice, for 30 min, in 250 μl of lysis buffer J (25 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNaVO3, 25 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in buffer W (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 0.4 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaVO3, 5 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml okadaic acid) and treated as described above. For DNA binding assays, nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (41Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Induction of GST fusion protein expression in E. coli was achieved by treating cultures with 150 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Harvested bacteria were resuspended in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and lysed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g. Bacterial extracts were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) previously swollen and washed extensively in NETN buffer. The glutathione-agarose with bound GST fusion protein was washed 4 times with 10 volumes of NETN buffer, and the gel was resuspended in an equal volume of NETN buffer to give a 50% slurry. Kinase activity in the cell extracts was analyzed by using the glutathione-agarose with bound GST/Jun or GST/ATF-2 to pull down the associating kinases and then determining incorporation of32PO4 into the fusion proteins. Briefly, 60 μl of the 50% matrix slurry were added to 250 μl of cell extract and incubated overnight, at 4 °C, with constant agitation. The matrix was washed 4 times in wash buffer comprising 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm NaVO3, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 μg/ml okadaic acid, 0.125 mm[γ-32P]ATP). The phosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min, at 25 °C, and samples were electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 32PO4incorporation was observed by autoradiography and quantified by scintillation counting. 10 μl of a JNK/SAPK-specific antiserum were added to 250 μl of cell extract, and the volume was adjusted to 500 μl with buffer P (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, with constant agitation. 60 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), previously swollen and extensively washed in buffer P, were used to bind the immunocomplexed JNK/SAPK. 20 μl of GST/Jun bound to glutathione-agarose were added to the matrix and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase assay buffer, at 25 °C, for 30 min. Samples were electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 32PO4 incorporation was observed by autoradiography and quantitated by scintillation counting. SKK 1 and SKK 4 activities were measured in cell extracts as described previously (9Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, SKK 1 or SKK 4 were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of the relevant antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma), washed extensively with 0.5 m NaCl, and incubated with 1 μl of 20 μm 6-his-SAPK/JNK and 2.5 μl of 40 mmmagnesium acetate and 0.4 mm unlabeled ATP for 30 min, at 25 °C. Activated JNK/SAPK was then assayed in 40 μl of a solution containing 31.25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.125 mmEDTA, 1.25 mm NaVO3, 1 mm DTT, 12.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.125 mm[γ-32P]ATP, and 0.25 mg/ml purified GST/ATF-2 as substrate. Samples were incubated at 25 °C, for 30 min, electrophoresed, and visualized by autoradiography. Antibodies against Jun, JunB, JunD, Fos, and ATF-2 were used at dilution of 1:300. Antibodies for R1 and Vmw63 were used at dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:100, respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibodies for detection of Vmw110 and Vmw175 were used at dilutions of 1:5000. The AP-1 probe, encompassing binding sites for the AP-1 complex, and the CRE probe, encompassing a binding site for the ATF/CREB transcription factor, were as described previously (18Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Radioactive end labeling was performed using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (42Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA-binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl, in binding buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 50 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). The appropriate oligonucleotide probe (0.5 ng, 50,000 cpm/ng) was incubated with 10–20 μg of nuclear extract for 12 h, at 4 °C, and after electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gel, binding was visualized by autoradiography. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 0.5 μg of antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction subsequent to addition of radiolabeled probes. BHK cells were infected with wild-type HSV-1 virus, and pull down kinase assays using GST/Jun fusion protein as substrate were performed, at various time points, to measure JNK/SAPK activity (Fig.1 A, lanes 7–12). Untreated cells harvested at the corresponding time points were used as control (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–6). Band quantification identified a marginal increase in the phosphorylation of GST/Jun by 3 h postinfection (compare lanes 7 and 8 tolanes 1 and 2), a 2-fold increase, indicating activation of the JNK/SAPK kinases, at 6 h post-infection (comparelanes 9 and 10 to lanes 3 and4), and activation reached a maximum of 4-fold by 9 h (compare lanes 11 and 12 to lanes 5and 6). No further increase in stimulation of JNK/SAPK kinases was detected at 12, 16, and 24 h postinfection (data not shown). A 4-fold increase in JNK/SAPK activity in control UV-irradiated cells, compared with untreated cells, was also found (lanes 15 and 16, and 13 and 14, respectively). Conditioned media transferred from infected to uninfected cells failed to activate JNK/SAPK, ruling out any autocrine mechanism (data not shown). Similar increase in JNK/SAPK activity was observed in Chinese hamster ovary and in HeLa cells infected with HSV-1 (data not shown). Immunocomplex kinase assays using GST/Jun as substrate confirmed stimulation of JNK/SAPK (Fig. 1 B). We observed a 3–4-fold stimulation of JNK/SAPK in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1, harvested at 9 h postinfection (lanes 3 and4), and in control UV-treated cells (lane 2), compared with untreated cells (lane 1). Western blotting experiments for Vmw63, Vmw110, Vmw175, and R1 immediate-early expressed proteins were also performed (Fig.1 C). By using extracts from untreated cells (lane 1) and from cells infected with HSV-1, harvested at 3, 6, and 9 h postinfection (lanes 2–4, respectively), we observed that the kinetics of the JNK/SAPK activation apparently coincided with the accumulation of virus IE proteins between 3 and 9 hours postinfection, thus raising the question whether a viral IE gene is implicated in this phenomenon. The effects of wild-type HSV-1 infection of BHK cells on p38 MAPK activity were determined by immunocomplex assays, using ATF-2 as a substrate (Fig.2 A). Immunocomplexed p38 MAPK activity was determined in samples harvested at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h postinfection (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–6, respectively) and in untreated cells (lane 1); Western blots were probed with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of ATF-2 and demonstrated an increase in phosphorylation by 6 h, with a maximum activity detected at 10 h. ATF-2 phosphorylation by p38 MAPK was also stimulated in UV-irradiated cells (lanes 7 and8). Additionally, a GST/ATF-2 fusion protein was used as a substrate to detect ATF-2 phosphorylation by both p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK pathways (Fig. 2 B). Compared with untreated cells (lanes 3and 4), a marginal increase in ATF-2 phosphorylation was detected by 3 h postinfection (lanes 5 and6), a 3-fold increase was observed by 6 h (lanes 7 and 8), with a further increase to 5-fold by 9 h (lanes 9 and 10). A 5-fold activation was also observed in control UV-irradiated cells (lanes 1 and2). These results indicate that both p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK are stimulated by wild-type HSV-1 infection, and we considered the possibility that a viral protein was implicated in this phenomenon. We examined whether some component of the virion tegument is responsible for activating JNK/SAPK. Virus in1814 has an intact capsid structure and expresses an inactive form of virion protein VP16. It possesses an intact transactivation domain but has a 12-base pair insertion in the VP16 coding sequences, disrupting the domain required for interaction with Oct-1 and HCF. This virus expresses low levels of IE proteins after infection of cells at a multiplicity of 10 pfu per cell; however, when used at a multiplicity of 100 pfu/cell, the virus replicates normally, and the kinetics and levels of the IE genes expression correspond to those detected after infection with wild-type HSV-1 at a multiplicity of 10 pfu/cell (36Ace C.I. McKee T.A Ryan J.M. Cameron J.M. Preston C.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2260-2269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST/Jun pull down kinase assays were performed after cells were infected with in1814 virus at a multiplicity of 100 pfu/cell (Fig.3 A). No activation of JNK/SAPK was detected at 6 (lanes 3 and 4) and at 9 h postinfection (lanes 5 and 6); activities were similar to those of untreated cells (lanes 1 and2). Similar results were obtained after infecting cells with in1814 virus at 10 pfu/cell (data not shown). Importantly, during infection with the in1814 revertant virus at 10 pfu/cell (Fig.3 B), activation of JNK/SAPK at 6 (lanes 3 and4) and 9 h postinfection (lanes 5 and6), compared with the untreated cells (lanes 1and 2), was restored. Expression of the VP16 protein in transient transfection assays in a virus-free environment using different amounts of the pMCI plasmid (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3–8) was sufficient for activating JNK/SAPK, compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (lanes 1 and 2). Induction of JNK/SAPK by UV irradiation is shown in lanes 9 and 10. Furthermore, expression of a truncated VP16 protein lacking the transactivation domain but still capable of interacting with the cellular factors retained the ability to activate JNK (Fig.3 D, lanes 3 and 4, compared withlanes 1 and 2). Thus, VP16 activates JNK/SAPK through the domain required for interaction with cellular factors. The primary function of VP16 is to activate transcription of the IE genes. We therefore investigated the possible contribution of IE genes in stimulating JNK. BHK cells were infected with mutant viruses ICP6delta, 27lacZ, dI403, and E30DBA that fail to express functional forms of R1, Vmw63, Vmw110, and Vmw175 proteins, respectively. Pull down kinase assays in extracts of cells harvested 9 h postinfection were performed using GST/Jun as substrate. All mutant viruses stimulated JNK/SAPK to approximately the same levels as those obtained with extracts from cells infected with wild-type virus (data not shown). In addition, similar kinetics of JNK/SAPK stimulation were observed with the different mutant viruses and wild-type HSV-1 (data not shown). Overall, our results indicate that immediate-early proteins Vmw63, Vmw110, Vmw175, and R1 are not directly responsible for the induction of JNK/SAPK activity. The role of IE gene products in JNK/SAPK activation was further studied in cells infected with the temperature-sensitive mutant tsk. The tsk virus has a mutation in the gene encoding Vmw175 such that the protein fails to transactivate e"
https://openalex.org/W2054603061,"Iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) are RNA-binding proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of mRNAs that code for proteins involved in the maintenance of iron and energy homeostasis. Here we show that hypoxia differentially regulates the RNA binding activities of IRP1 and IRP2 in human 293 and in mouse Hepa-1 cells. In contrast to IRP1, where hypoxic exposure decreases IRP1 RNA binding activity, hypoxia increases IRP2 RNA binding activity. The hypoxic increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity results from increased IRP2 protein levels. Cobalt, which mimics hypoxia by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), also increases IRP2 protein levels; however, cobalt-induced IRP2 lacks RNA binding activity. Addition of a reductant to cobalt-treated extracts restored IRP2 RNA binding activity. Hypoxic activation of IRP2 is not because of an increase in transcriptional activation by HIF-1, because IRP2 accumulates in Hepa-1 cells lacking a functional HIF-1β subunit, nor is it because of an increase in IRP2 mRNA stability. Rather, our data indicate that hypoxia increases IRP2 levels by a post-translational mechanism involving protein stability. Differential regulation of IRP1 and IRP2 during hypoxia may regulate specific IRP target mRNAs whose expression is required for hypoxic adaptation. Furthermore, these data imply mechanistic parallels between the hypoxia-induced post-transcriptional regulation of IRP2 and HIF-1α. Iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) are RNA-binding proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of mRNAs that code for proteins involved in the maintenance of iron and energy homeostasis. Here we show that hypoxia differentially regulates the RNA binding activities of IRP1 and IRP2 in human 293 and in mouse Hepa-1 cells. In contrast to IRP1, where hypoxic exposure decreases IRP1 RNA binding activity, hypoxia increases IRP2 RNA binding activity. The hypoxic increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity results from increased IRP2 protein levels. Cobalt, which mimics hypoxia by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), also increases IRP2 protein levels; however, cobalt-induced IRP2 lacks RNA binding activity. Addition of a reductant to cobalt-treated extracts restored IRP2 RNA binding activity. Hypoxic activation of IRP2 is not because of an increase in transcriptional activation by HIF-1, because IRP2 accumulates in Hepa-1 cells lacking a functional HIF-1β subunit, nor is it because of an increase in IRP2 mRNA stability. Rather, our data indicate that hypoxia increases IRP2 levels by a post-translational mechanism involving protein stability. Differential regulation of IRP1 and IRP2 during hypoxia may regulate specific IRP target mRNAs whose expression is required for hypoxic adaptation. Furthermore, these data imply mechanistic parallels between the hypoxia-induced post-transcriptional regulation of IRP2 and HIF-1α. Cellular hypoxia is an important component of several pathophysiological conditions, including tumorigenesis and ischemia-related disorders. In these and other hypoxic situations mammalian cells alter gene expression to counter the effects of limited O2. Hypoxia induces the transcriptional activation of a variety of genes, including erthyropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, transferrin, tyrosine hydroxylase, and various glycolytic enzymes, all of whose products are involved in cellular adaptation to decreased O2 (reviewed in Ref. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Increased expression of these genes is mediated primarily by the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), 1The abbreviations HIF-1hypoxia-inducible factor-1IRPiron-regulatory proteinIREiron-responsive elementUTRuntranslated regionDTTdithiothreitolProApronasterone A which is composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits (1Bunn H.F.

Hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α is blocked in the presence of H2O2, suggesting that hypoxia-induced changes in the level of this reactive oxygen species may be involved in HIF-1 activation (7Huang E.L. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Stabilization of HIF-1α allows for heterodimerization with constitutive levels of HIF-1β, also known as aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator or ARNT. In turn HIF-1 binds to specific enhancer elements resulting in transcriptional activation. hypoxia-inducible factor-1 iron-regulatory protein iron-responsive element untranslated region dithiothreitol pronasterone A The current understanding of the regulation of gene expression during hypoxia is primarily at the level of transcriptional activation by HIF-1. However, it is clear that post-transcriptional mechanisms are also employed. These mechanisms involve the induction of mRNA-binding proteins that interact with elements in 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) as seen for the vascular endothelial growth factor (8Levy A.P. Levy N.S.

For example, hypoxia induces the binding of the HuR protein to adenylate-uridylate rich elements in the vascular endothelial growth factor 3′-UTR, stabilizing this mRNA (14Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation post-transcriptionally regulates the activity of IRP1 (15Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). IRP1 and a second family member, IRP2, are iron-sensor proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of genes whose products are involved in regulating cellular iron homeostasis (reviewed in Ref.16Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). IRP1 and IRP2 bind specific RNA stem-loop structures termed iron-responsive elements (IREs), which are found in either the 5′- or 3′-UTRs of specific mRNAs, including ferritin (iron storage), mitochondrial aconitase (energy metabolism), erythroid-aminolevulinate synthase (heme biosynthesis), and transferrin receptor (iron transport). IRP binding to a 5′-IRE inhibits translation of the mRNA by inhibiting the 43 S small ribosomal complex from binding to mRNA, whereas binding to a 3′-IRE protects the mRNA from degradation. The RNA binding activity of the IRPs is regulated by cellular iron: RNA binding activity decreases in iron-replete cells and increases in iron-deplete cells. In addition to iron, IRP1 activity increases in cells producing nitric oxide and in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (17Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of IRPs by iron and oxidative stress controls the expression of proteins involved in iron sequestration, uptake, and utilization, thus maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. IRP1 is a dual-function protein, because iron converts it from its apo-RNA binding form to its [4Fe-4S] cytosolic aconitase form (18Kaptain S. Downey W.E. Tang C. Philpott C. Haile D. Orloff D.G. Harford J.B. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Unlike IRP1, IRP2 does not have detectable aconitase activity. Rather, in iron-replete conditions, IRP2 is targeted for rapid degradation by the proteasome (19Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Degradation of IRP2 is mediated by an iron-dependent oxidation mechanism that requires a unique 73 amino acid domain containing three essential cysteine residues (19Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Our continuing studies on IRP regulation during changing O2tension revealed an overall increase in total IRP RNA binding activity when human 293 cells and mouse Hepa-1 cells were exposed to hypoxia. Because human IRPs co-migrate during bandshift analysis, it was not readily apparent whether IRP1 or IRP2 was responsible for the increase in total activity. We report here that in human 293 and mouse Hepa-1 cells, IRP2 RNA binding activity is increased as a result of hypoxia. The hypoxia-induced increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity was found to be caused by increased protein levels resulting from protein stabilization. Furthermore, IRP2 protein levels were elevated during normoxia in the presence of cobalt, a known activator of HIF-1α (6Kallio P. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar,22Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). However, hypoxic activation of IRP2 was not dependent on HIF-1, suggesting a similar, but divergent, signaling pathway in the hypoxic activation of these two proteins. Consistent with our previous studies (15Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), IRP1 activity decreased during hypoxia. The differential regulation of IRP1 and IRP2 during hypoxia may have implications for the regulation specific IRE-mRNAs required for hypoxic adaptation. Rat FTO2B hepatoma, human 293 embryonic kidney, and human HeLa cervical cancer cells were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). EcR-293 cells were grown in the same medium containing 400 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Hepa-1 c1c7 (wildtype HIF-1β) and Hepa-1 c4 (mutant HIF-1β) (kindly provided by Dr. Oliver Hankinson, UCLA) were grown similarly except in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.). All cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Cells were plated at a density of 1.2 × 106 (FTO2B) and 2.5 × 105 (293, HeLa, and Hepa-1) respectively, in 35-mm culture plates 1 day before normoxic or hypoxic exposure. Hypoxia was achieved by flushing a Modular Incubator (Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA) for 20 min at a flow of 2 p.s.i with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and a balance of nitrogen. 1 h before normoxia/hypoxia, the medium was replaced with 1.2 ml of fresh medium. Normoxic control cells were treated identically except with 21% O2. The experiment shown in Fig. 1 A was the only experiment in which 3% O2was used for hypoxia. Expression of recombinant IRP2 was done by transiently transfecting EcR-293 cells with 10 μg of the pIND(sp1)IRP2myc vector using Superfect (Qiagen), and 24 h later inducing with 10 μm pronasterone A (ProA) for 20 h (Invitrogen). The ecdysone analog ProA induces the heterodimerization of a modified ecdysone receptor with the retinoid X receptor, both constitutively expressed in the EcR-293 cell line, in turn activating transcription from the ecdysone response element found on pIND(sp1). The pIND(sp1)IRP2myc vector was generated by subcloning the 3.0-kilobase EcoRV fragment from pXS.IRP2 (23Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) intoEcoRV linearized pIND(sp1) (Invitrogen). Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and cytosolic extracts were prepared by addition of 125 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to the 35-mm dish and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie assay method (Pierce). RNA bandshifts were performed as described previously (24Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Quantification of IRP-RNA complexes was determined by PhosphorImager analysis. When “supershift” assays were performed, antiserum that specifically recognizes the unique 73 amino acid insert of IRP2 was added for 20 min before electrophoresis (25Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was used at 10 mm where shown. Cytosolic extracts were resolved on 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween and 5% dried milk, the blot was probed with rabbit anit-IRP2 antiserum or chicken anti-IRP1 antiserum (both at 10,000-fold dilution) (25Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) were used for detection by chemiluminescence (New England Nuclear). Human 293 cells were plated at 2 × 106 on a 10-cm plate ∼24 h before use. Fresh medium (8 ml) was added 1 h before an 18 h normoxia or hypoxic exposure. Total RNA was harvested using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20 μg were resolved on a formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. A 900-base pair fragment corresponding to the immediate 5′-end of rat IRP2 (26Guo B. Brown F. Phillips J. Yu Y. Leibold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16529-16535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was random-primed labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to probe for IRP2 mRNA. Cultures of rat FTO2B and human 293 cells were exposed in parallel to 6 h of normoxia or hypoxia, and IRP RNA binding activity was measured by RNA bandshift analysis. Fig.1 A shows that total IRP (IRP1 and IRP2) RNA binding activity in human 293 cells is elevated following hypoxic exposure. Hypoxia decreased IRP1 RNA binding activity in rat FTO2B hepatoma cells as previously reported (15Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rodent IRP1 and IRP2 separate during bandshift analysis unlike human IRPs. The hypoxia-induced increase in total IRP activity from 293 cells was more notable after 18 h of hypoxia (Fig. 1 B). Addition of hemin decreased total IRP RNA binding activity in both normoxic and hypoxic cells, demonstrating that the IRP1 and IRP2 response to iron is not impaired during hypoxia. To determine whether IRP1 and/or IRP2 was responsible for the increase in total RNA binding activity in 293 cells during hypoxia, RNA “supershift” analysis was performed. Different amounts of IRP2-specific antibodies were added to the binding reactions containing cytoplasmic extracts derived from 293 cells subjected to normoxia or hypoxia for 18 h, and the complexes were analyzed by bandshift analysis. Fig. 2 A shows that there was an increase in supershifted IRP2-RNA complexes from hypoxically treated cells compared with normoxic controls (comparelanes 6 and 7 with lanes 10and 11 in Fig. 2 A). FTO2B extracts were run in parallel with increasing amounts of IRP2 antibody to verify that the IRP2 antiserum did not nonspecifically supershift IRP1, and that a sufficient amount of antiserum was added to shift all of the IRP2 (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4). Because the nonshifted complexes represent IRP1, it can be seen that IRP1 RNA binding activity decreased as a result of hypoxia (compare lanes 6–8 with10–12 in Fig. 2 A), which is similar to what is seen in FTO2B cells (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, consistent with our earlier studies, the hypoxic decrease in IRP1 RNA binding activity was not because of decreased protein levels because IRP1 protein levels did not change following a 20 h hypoxic exposure (Fig.2 B) (15Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These data indicate that IRP1 and IRP2 are both regulated during hypoxia but in opposite directions. The hypoxic increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity could result from activation of IRP2 or from increasing IRP2 protein levels. Therefore, we measured IRP2 protein levels following 4, 7, and 19 h of hypoxic exposures. The immunoblot in Fig. 2 C demonstrates that hypoxia increases IRP2 protein levels. Quantification of the bands in Fig. 2 C revealed a 1.5-, 2.9- and 3.9-fold increase in IRP2 protein levels at 4, 7, and 19 h of hypoxia, respectively. The increase in IRP2 protein levels reflected a similar fold increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity as determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 2 D). Therefore, we conclude that the increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity during hypoxia is because of an increase in IRP2 protein levels. To determine whether the hypoxic increase in IRP2 protein is the result of increased IRP2 mRNA, mRNA levels were measured by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from 18-h normoxic and hypoxic human 293 cells and hybridized with a radiolabeled IRP2 probe. Fig. 3 A shows that IRP2 mRNA levels are not elevated during hypoxia. In fact, IRP2 mRNA is slightly decreased, perhaps because of a general hypoxic down-regulation of RNA synthesis (27Eckardt K. Pugh C. Ratcliffe P. A K. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 423: 356-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the increase in IRP2 protein during hypoxia is not because of increased transcription of the IRP2 gene nor to increased stability of the IRP2 mRNA. Although we could eliminate the direct transcriptional activation of the IRP2 gene during hypoxia, it was possible that an HIF-1 target gene was required for hypoxic induction of IRP2. To analyze this possibility, a mouse hepatoma cell line harboring a mutated HIF-1β subunit that is nonfunctional (28Wood S.M. Gleadle J.M. Pugh C.W. Hankinson O. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 29Hankinson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was used to determine whether hypoxic induction of IRP2 was dependent on HIF-1 activation. Hepa-1 c4 cells, which contain a mutated HIF-1β and wild-type Hepa-1 c1c7 were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 18 h, and IRP1 and IRP2 RNA binding activities were measured. Fig. 3 B shows that IRP2 RNA binding activity increased in both cell lines to a similar extend as seen for 293 cells. Furthermore, IRP1 RNA binding activity decreased in Hepa-1 c4c7 cells similar to hypoxic rat FTO2B and human 293 cells. These data indicate that hypoxic activation of IRP2 is not downstream of HIF-1. Because hypoxic induction of IRP2 does not result from increased mRNA levels, we next examined whether IRP2 is stabilized during hypoxia. EcR-293 cells were transiently transfected with the pIND(sp1)IRP2 vector and allowed to recover for 24 h before IRP2 expression was induced with ProA. Following 20 h of induction, the cells were then either harvested or the medium was replaced with medium lacking ProA and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 12 h. Immunoblot analysis demonstrates that recombinant IRP2 is induced in the presence of ProA (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 2). When expression of IRP2 is shut off by removal of ProA, the levels of IRP2 decay after 12 h of normoxia, but remain elevated following 12 h of hypoxia (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). These data demonstrate that the increase in IRP2 protein during hypoxia is because of protein stabilization. Furthermore, stabilization of IRP2 appears specific, because IRP1 protein levels were not significantly altered following 20 h of hypoxia (Fig. 2 B) (15Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Addition of cobalt to normoxic cells mimics hypoxia by the activation of expression of several HIF-1 target genes. This is because of the cobalt-induced increase in the HIF-1α protein and subsequent HIF-1 DNA binding (6Kallio P. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar,22Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). HIF-1α protein stabilization has been suggested to be downstream of a heme protein that functions as an O2 sensor (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 3Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It is thought that cobalt, by displacing the heme iron, inactivates the O2 sensor. A more recent report suggests that the mitochondria may be the upstream O2 sensor for HIF-1 activation (42Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Treatment of 293 cells with cobalt increased IRP2 protein levels in both a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A and B). Although 100 μm CoCl2 increased IRP2 protein levels, maximum stimulation was achieved at 1 mm, which is ∼10-fold greater than that required for inducing HIF-1 activation in HeLa cells (22Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The requirement for a higher dose of cobalt in 293 cells is presumably because of differences in cobalt uptake, because IRP2 was induced in HeLa cells treated with 100 μmCoCl2 for 8 h (Fig. 5 C). To determine whether the cobalt-induced increase in IRP2 protein levels reflects an increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity, 293 cells were subjected to normoxia, 1 mm CoCl2, hypoxia, or hypoxia in the presence of 1 mm CoCl2 for 8 h followed by supershift and immunoblot analyses. Fig.6 A shows that in contrast to hypoxia where IRP2 RNA binding activity increased, cobalt treatment resulted in an inhibition of IRP2 activity (Fig. 6 A, comparelanes 5 and 6), even though both conditions increased IRP2 protein levels (Fig. 6 C). Furthermore, cobalt treatment also inhibited the increase in IRP2 RNA binding activity during hypoxia (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 7 and8). To determine whether inactivation of IRP2 RNA binding activity by cobalt could be reversed by a reductant, 10 mmDTT was added to the binding reactions before supershift analysis. DTT restored IRP2 RNA binding activity in both hypoxia- and hypoxia/CoCl2-treated extracts (Fig. 6 B). Treatment with DTT also increased IRP1 RNA binding activity in all extracts as previously shown (30Hentze M. Rouault T. Harford J. Klausner R. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Because cobalt, hypoxia, and a combination of both increased IRP2 protein levels to a similar extent (Fig. 6 C), their modes of action are not synergistic. These results suggest that cobalt affects IRP2 by two distinct mechanisms: first, by mimicking hypoxia, cobalt increases IRP2 protein levels, and second, through a mechanism unrelated to hypoxia whereby cobalt inhibits IRP2 RNA binding activity. Mammalian cells employ adaptive responses when exposed to hypoxia (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 3Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). One such response is the regulated and specific alteration in gene expression imposed by hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation. To date HIF-1 is the most thoroughly characterized transcriptional regulator of gene expression during hypoxia (reviewed in Refs. 31Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar and32Semenza G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), whereas considerably less is known about post-transcriptional mechanisms (9Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In this study we report that IRP2, in addition to IRP1, is post-translationally regulated by hypoxia. These data suggest that both proteins are components of a hypoxic-regulatory pathway involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Previously we demonstrated that hypoxia decreased IRP1 RNA binding activity in rat hepatoma cells and primary cardiac myocytes (15Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In that study, IRP2 RNA binding activity increased slightly after prolonged hypoxic exposure (18 to 21 h). We also observed an increase in IRP2 activity in FTO2B cells during anoxia. 2E. S. Hanson and E. A. Leibold, unpublished observation. These results prompted us to carry out the experiments reported here, which investigated IRP2 regulation during hypoxia in other cell types, including 293, Hepa-1, and HeLa cells. Both 293 and Hepa-1 cells displayed significant hypoxia-inducible activation of IRP2 RNA binding activity. The regulation of IRP2 by hypoxia appears to be characteristic of many cell types with different cells varying in their magnitude of IRP2 response. IRP1 and IRP2 RNA binding activities responded to hypoxia differently: hypoxia decreased IRP1 and increased IRP2 RNA binding activities. The decrease in IRP1 RNA binding activity was paralleled by a ∼35% increase in its cytosolic aconitase activity with no change in IRP1 protein levels (data not shown). These results suggest hypoxia stabilizes the [4Fe-4S] aconitase active form of IRP1 at the expense of its RNA binding activity (15Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unlike IRP1, IRP2 regulation by hypoxia occurs by accumulation of the IRP2 protein. Therefore, hypoxic regulation of IRP1 and IRP2 RNA binding activities occurs by different mechanisms. What are the functional consequences of the differential regulation of IRP1 and IRP2 during hypoxia? One notion is that IRP1 and IRP2 regulate different cellular IRE-mRNAs. Studies using in vitrosynthesized IREs (33Butt J. Kim H.-Y. Basilion J. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Henderson B. Menotti E. Kühn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showed that IRP1 and IRP2 can preferentially bind to specific IRE-like structures. In addition, a recent study showed that the range of IRE binding of IRP1 is more extensive than IRP2. IRP1 binds with high affinity to different IREs, including those of the ferritin, transferrin receptor, and erythroid-aminolevulinate synthase mRNAs, whereas high affinity IRP2 binding is restricted to ferritin IREs (35Ke Y. Wu J. Leibold E. Walden W. Theil E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23637-23640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The regulation of IRP1 and IRP2 activities in an opposing manner during hypoxia may lead to the specific regulation of different IRE-mRNAs whose expression/repression may be required for adaptation during the hypoxia. Hypoxic activation of IRP2 is not a result of an increase in mRNA levels because of increased transcription or increased mRNA stability. Activation is also not dependent on HIF-1, because full IRP2 activation occurs in Hepa-1 c4 cells that do not contain a functional HIF-1β. Furthermore, hypoxic accumulation of IRP2 is not because of impaired proteasomal function, because hemin-treated cells resulted in IRP2 degradation during hypoxia. Rather, our data suggest a model in which the IRP2 protein is stabilized during hypoxia. This model is consistent with the mechanism of iron-dependent regulation of IRP2 (19Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Guo B. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRP2 is regulated by iron by a mechanism involving metal-catalyzed oxidation of the protein followed by ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (21Iwai K. Drake S.K. Wehr N.B. Weissman A.M. LaVaute T. Minato N. Klausner R.D. Levine R.L. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4924-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This process requires the 73-amino acid degradation domain that potentially coordinates iron via three conserved cysteines, which are required for iron-mediated degradation (20Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Iron coordination may provide a “localized” Fenton reaction leading to IRP2 oxidation. Any model for the regulation of IRPs during hypoxia must depart from one that relies solely on changes in iron levels, because during hypoxia RNA binding activity of IRP1 decreased, whereas IRP2 activity increased. One possible mechanism for hypoxic regulation of IRP2 is that the generation of H2O2, possibly from a heme-containing O2 sensor, acts as an IRP2 degradation signal. A decrease in H2O2 output from such a sensor during hypoxia would lead to a decrease in IRP2 oxidation and consequently an increase in IRP2 stability. In this scenario, hypoxic regulation of IRP2 would be dependent on the relative cytosolic levels of both H2O2 and Fe2+. A similar mechanism could potentially be involved in hypoxic HIF-1α protein stabilization. Several important parallels can be drawn between hypoxic activation of IRP2 and HIF-1α. First, both IRP2 and HIF-1α (5Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 6Kallio P. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc.

Chem. 1997; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) proteins accumulate during hypoxia by a post-translational mechanism involving increased protein stability. Second, cobalt, which mimics hypoxia, stimulated the accumulation of both IRP2 and HIF-1α (6Kallio P. Pongratz I. Gradin K. McGuire J. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 22Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps by inactivating a heme-containing O2 sensor (38Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Third, iron chelation elevates the protein levels of both IRP2 (19Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HIF-1α (37Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wang W.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). Fourth, the activation of IRP2 and HIF-1α by hypoxia and cobalt occurs in different cell types, suggesting that both proteins are part of a global mechanism of gene regulation during hypoxia. Collectively, these data suggest that the regulation of IRP2 and HIF-1α during hypoxia occurs, at least in part, by similar mechanisms. An unexpected finding was that cobalt, in addition to increasing IRP2 protein levels, inactivated IRP2 RNA binding activity. Because IRP1 activity was not decreased, this suggested that the effect of cobalt was specific for IRP2. IRP2 RNA binding activity could be restored by the addition of DTT, suggesting that cobalt either directly or indirectly resulted in the oxidation of critical cysteines required for IRP2 RNA binding. Cobalt has been shown to cause a reduction of cellular glutathione and oxidize thiols in lung cells (40Lewis C. Demedts M. Nemery B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our previous studies showing that inactivation of IRP2 RNA binding activity by oxidants in vitro could be reversed by treatment with high concentrations of reductants (41Phillips J. Guo B. Yu Y. Brown F. Leibold E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar redox control of DNA binding activity of HIF-1 has also been reported (7Huang E.L. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Whether IRP2 RNA binding activity can be modulated by redox in vivo remains to be determined.

The Gi-coupled serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) 5-HT1A receptor, heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary or human embryonic kidney 293 cells, mediated rapid activation of Erk1/2 via a mechanism dependent upon both Ras activation and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This activation was attenuated by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ and Ca2+/calmodulin (CAM) inhibitors or the CAM sequestrant protein calspermin. The CAM-dependent step in the Erk1/2 activation cascade is downstream of Ras activation, because inhibitors of CAM antagonize Erk1/2 activation induced by constitutively activated mutants of Ras and c-Src but not by constitutively activated mutants of Raf and MEK (mitogen and extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Inhibitors of the classical CAM effectors myosin light chain kinase, CAM-dependent protein kinases II and IV, PP2B, and CAM-sensitive phosphodiesterase had no effect upon 5-HT1A receptor-mediated Erk1/2 activation.

Erk1/2 activity is regulated by threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation, which is controlled by a highly conserved phosphorylation cascade. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 is catalyzed by the MAP/Erk kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1 and MEK2) that are themselves phosphorylated and activated by MEK kinases such as raf-1 oncogene family proteins. Activation of Raf-1 occurs as a consequence of membrane translocation, which can be mediated by the GTP-bound form of the small G protein, Ras.Like the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases, many G protein-coupled receptors regulate Ras function via tyrosine phosphorylation. Several Gi-coupled receptors stimulate pertussis toxin-sensitive, Ras-dependent Erk activation through tyrosine phosphorylation of adapter proteins, such as Shc and Gab1, and membrane recruitment of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, mSos (2van Biesen T.

https://openalex.org/W2038142268,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SMF1gene encodes a member of the well conserved family of Nramp metal transport proteins. Previously, we determined that heavy metal uptake by Smf1p was down-regulated by the product of the S. cerevisiae BSD2 gene. We now demonstrate that this regulation occurs at the level of protein stability. In wild type strains, the bulk of Smf1p is normally directed to the vacuole and is rapidly degraded by vacuolar proteases in a PEP4-dependent manner. Inbsd2Δ mutants, Smf1p fails to enter the vacuole, and the Nramp protein is stabilized. Metal ions themselves play an important role in the post-translational regulation of Smf1p. The depletion of heavy metals from the growth medium effects stabilization of Smf1p and additionally results in accumulation of this transporter at the cell surface. Supplementation of manganese alone is sufficient to trigger rapid degradation of Smf1p in a Bsd2p-dependent manner. Together the action of Bsd2p and metal ions provide a rapid and effective means for controlling Nramp metal transport in response to environmental changes.

The Nramp family of polypeptides (for naturalresistance associated macrophageprotein) consists of a group of highly conserved integral membrane proteins thought to play an important role in heavy metal transport. Homologues to Nramp have been identified in animals, plants, and fungi, as well as in certain bacteria (1Cellier M. Belouchi A. Gros P.

Nramp1 is believed to control the phagosomal accumulation of redox active iron or manganese ions, thereby contributing to an oxygen radical defense against parasitic infection (3Vidal S.M. Malo D.

In rats, the Nramp2 isoform (DCT1) is induced following iron starvation and exhibits a broad substrate range including essential metals such as zinc, iron, manganese, and copper, as well as the nonessential metals cadmium and lead (10Gunshin H.

Transporters such as DCT1/Nramp that act on both essential and toxic metals are expected to fall under tight cellular control. The bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides an excellent model system in which to study the function and regulation of eukaryotic metal transporters. The high affinity uptake of copper, iron, and zinc in yeast is accomplished by the action of theCTR1, FTR1, and ZTR1 gene products, respectively (11Dancis A. Yuan S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D.

Each of these transport systems is induced under metal-starvation conditions and correspondingly repressed at physiological metal concentrations, and this regulation occurs at the level of CTR1, FTR1, or ZTR1 gene transcription (13Zhao H.

Raymond M. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28933-28938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Smf1p was identified by Supek et al. (6Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) as a manganese transporter, and our subsequent studies demonstrated that Smf1p and Smf2p additionally participate in the transport of other heavy metals including copper, cobalt, and cadmium (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hence like mammalian Nramp transporters, yeast Smf proteins exhibit a broad specificity for both essential and nonessential toxic metals. We have previously shown that metal transport by Smf1p is suppressed in yeast by a process involving the product of the BSD2 gene (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). When BSD2 is inactivated by mutation, the transport of copper and cadmium by Smf1p greatly increases, and cells accumulate toxic levels of the metals (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Bsd2p exhibits an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations ERendoplasmic reticulumMDMmetal-depleted minimal defined mediumPCRpolymerase chain reactionSDsynthetic minimal medium containing dextroseFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleHAhemagglutinin localization (22Liu X.F.

In the present study, we demonstrate that Bsd2p and metal ions act together to facilitate the rapid turnover of Smf1p. This post-translation control of Smf1p effectively minimizes the hyper-accumulation of toxic metals and also provides a rapid switch for inducing metal uptake under conditions of metal starvation. endoplasmic reticulum metal-depleted minimal defined medium polymerase chain reaction synthetic minimal medium containing dextrose fluorescein isothiocyanate 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hemagglutinin Most of these studies employed the isogenic wild type (AA255) andbsd2Δ::HIS3 mutant (XL115) strains as described previously (22Liu X.F.

XL118 and XL119 are ubc7Δ::HIS3mutants derived from AA255 and XL120, respectively. The isogenic wild type (L3852) and pep4Δ::URA3 (ACY17) strains were kind gifts of A. Chang. XL121 and XL125 were obtained by replacing the chromosomal BSD2 gene with HIS3 as described (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) in strains L3852 and ACY17, respectively. XL126 and XL124 are pep4::HIS3 mutants derived from AA255 and XL101, respectively. Stocks of strains were maintained on standard yeast extract/peptone/dextrose media, and cultures for experimental analysis were obtained by growth in a synthetic minimal medium containing dextrose (SD) (23Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 177-180Google Scholar). All yeast transformations were carried out by electroporation (24Becker D. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). A metal-depleted minimal defined medium (MDM) was prepared through use of an ion exchange resin as described (25Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). MDM was supplemented with 2.4 mm MgSO4, 30 mm KCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2 and 0.86 mm NaCl. As needed, MDM also contained 10 μmZnCl2, 10 μmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1.0 μm CuSO4, 10 μmMnSO4, 1.0 μm CoSO4, or a combination of these metals. Construction of the Smf1-HA expressing plasmid pSF4 involved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification ofSMF1 sequences −230 to the stop codon using a primer that changed the termination sequence to an NdeI site (CAT ATG in frame with SMF1). The product was ligated to the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), and following digestion with NdeI andApaI, the SMF1-containing fragment was used to replace the BSD2 sequences of a CEN LEU2 plasmid expressing Bsd2-HA (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Smf1-HA URA3 CEN plasmid pSF10 was obtained by inserting the Smf1-HA containing insert of pSF4 into the XhoI and SacI sites of pRS416 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ubc7Δ mutation was introduced in yeast strains by the PCR-mediated gene disruption method as described (27Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Aubc7Δ::HIS3 cassette was amplified by PCR using the HIS3 plasmid pRS403 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template, and primers that spanned UBC7 sequences −140 to −100 and +533 to +494, with respect to the start codon, both fused at their 3′ ends to the sequence designated by Brachmann et al. (27Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar) for amplification of yeast auxotrophic markers. Proper deletion ofUBC7 was confirmed by colony PCR. The pep4Δ mutation was similarly introduced using primers that spannedPEP4 sequences +24 to +64 and +1230 to +1270. RNA blot analysis of SMF1 expression followed standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar) and employed a probe spanning SMF1 sequences −86 to +1833 amplified by PCR and radiolabeled with32P. For Western blot analysis, yeast cells expressing the Smf1-HA fusion protein were grown to a mid-logarithmic phase (A 600 = 1.0) in SD medium or MDM as needed. Extracts were prepared either by glass bead homogenization (29Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), or by an alkaline lysis procedure (30Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using a mouse anti-HA antibody (BABCO) as described previously (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis was conducted essentially as described (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, strains transformed with a CENSmf1-HA plasmid were grown to a mid-logarithmic stage in SD medium, fixed with formaldehyde, digested with zymolyase, and probed with a mouse anti-HA antibody and a secondary antibody consisting of a goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to FITC (Boehringer Mannheim) as described (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nucleic acids were stained by DAPI (Sigma). FITC and DAPI staining were monitored by fluorescence microscopy, whereas visualization of yeast vacuoles used Nomarski optics. Sucrose gradient fraction was conducted with cells grown to anA 600 of 0.5–1.0. For examination of Golgi, ER, and vacuolar markers, cell lysates were prepared as described (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and were fractionated over linear or step gradients of 18–54% sucrose. Assays for GDPase and NADPH cytochrome c reductase were carried out by standard procedures (29Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Assays for the vacuolar α-mannosidase involved monitoring fractions for absorbance at 400 nm as described (32.Kolling, R., and Hollenberg, C. P. (1994).Google Scholar). We previously reported that the S. cerevisiae BSD2 gene negatively regulates the accumulation of metal ions by the Smf1p metal transporter (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the present study, we monitored the accumulation and localization of this transporter using an epitope-tagged version of the protein. Two copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were fused in frame to Smf1p at the stop codon, creating a protein fusion that was fully functional in complementing smf1Δ mutations when expressed from its native promoter and present on a single copyCEN vector (not shown). To monitor the effects ofbsd2 mutations on Smf1p levels, total extracts from cells expressing the fusion protein were analyzed by immunoblot. As seen in Fig. 1 A, Smf1-HA expressed from the CEN vector was increased by approximately 10–20-fold in a bsd2 null mutant compared with aBSD2 wild type strain. To investigate whether bsd2Δ mutations result in a transcriptional induction of the SMF1 gene, total RNA from isogenic wild type and bsd2Δ mutants was subjected to Northern blot analysis. We observed that mutations in BSD2did not increase the expression of SMF1 at the mRNA level (Fig. 1 B). We next addressed whether bsd2 mutations affect Smf1 protein stability. Through the use of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis, we observed that Smf1-HA is normally a very unstable protein and exhibits an apparent half-life between 10 and 20 min (Fig.2). In comparison, Smf1-HA was greatly stabilized in the bsd2Δ mutant (Fig. 2). These results demonstrated that the BSD2 gene product is involved in controlling stability of the Smf1p polypeptide. Two major protein degradation pathways predominate in yeast, a ubiquitin-mediated pathway and a pathway involving proteolytic breakdown in the vacuole. In the ubiquitin-mediated pathway, proteins destined for degradation by the 26 S proteosome are tagged with ubiquitin via the action of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme such as Ubc7p (33Jungmann J. Reins H.A. Schobert C. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 361: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of this pathway in the degradation of Smf1p was examined through use of an ubc7Δ mutant. As seen in Fig.3 A, the steady state levels of Smf1-HA were increased in the ubc7Δ null strain, suggesting that the proteosome participates to some degree in Smf1p degradation. However, inactivation of BSD2 still caused a rise in Smf1-HA protein levels in the ubc7 mutant (Fig.3 A). The strong additive effects of bsd2 andubc7 mutations indicated that BSD2 does not work through the ubiquitin pathway to control Smf1p stability. To examine if Smf1p degradation involves the vacuole, we measured the steady state level of Smf1-HA in strains containing mutations inPEP4 necessary for vacuolar proteolysis (34Jones E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, Smf1-HA accumulated to a high level in thepep4Δ mutant. Furthermore, an additional mutation inBSD2 did not increase this high level of Smf1-HA. We next compared the turnover rates of Smf1-HA in these strains. Apep4 mutation was seen to increase Smf1-HA stability, and there was no additive effect of double mutations in BSD2 andPEP4 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, BSD2 works through vacuolar protein degradation to control Smf1p stability. The stabilization of Smf1p in a bsd2 mutant results in hyper-accumulation of copper and cadmium (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because pep4mutations also cause stabilization of Smf1p, we tested whether the accumulated Smf1p in the pep4 mutant results in elevated metal uptake. Unlike bsd2Δ mutations, mutations inPEP4 did not effect a rise in metal accumulation (not shown). Thus the hyper-accumulated Smf1p in a pep4 mutant appears nonfunctional for metal transport. The subcellular localization of Smf1-HA was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a secondary antibody coupled to FITC. As seen in Fig.4 A, Smf1-HA expressed in a wild type strain exhibited rimming surrounding the nucleus (defined by DAPI) and a light punctate staining pattern that was absent in control cells not expressing Smf1-HA (not shown). This staining pattern suggested localization to the ER and Golgi, and this was confirmed by biochemical fractionation studies: Smf1-HA co-migrated with markers for the Golgi and ER in sucrose gradient fractionation (Fig.4 B). It is noteworthy that our immunofluorescence studies failed to reveal the anticipated plasma membrane localization for Smf1p. To ascertain if the intracellular localization of Smf1-HA represented rapid internalization of a cell surface protein, we tested Smf1-HA localization in an end4 mutant defective for endocytosis (35Raths S. Rohrer J. Crausaz F. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We observed that Smf1-HA staining was not affected by the end4 mutation (not shown), demonstrating that the bulk of Smf1p is not normally present on the cell surface. In absd2 mutant, Smf1-HA exhibited a much brighter staining pattern because of elevated levels of this polypeptide, but the perinuclear and punctate staining pattern was still evident (Fig.4 A). A fraction of Smf1p appeared to be surface-localized in some bsd2 cells, although this represented a minor component (Fig. 4 A). Smf1-HA localization was additionally examined in a pep4Δ mutant defective for vacuolar degradation. In this mutant, very intense staining of Smf1-HA was found within the vacuole identified by Nomarski optics (Fig. 5 A), and in sucrose gradient fractionation, the bulk of Smf1-HA co-migrated with the vacuolar α-mannosidase marker (Fig.6 A). A quite distinct pattern of Smf1-HA localization was achieved in an isogenic pep4Δbsd2Δ double mutant. By immunofluorescence microscopy, Smf1-HA was absent from the vacuole, and the protein exhibited a punctate staining pattern (Fig. 5 B). Smf1-HA expressed in these cells failed to co-migrate with the vacuolar marker during sucrose gradient centrifugation and, instead, superimposed the markers for Golgi and ER (Fig. 6 B). Together, these studies demonstrate that Smf1p is normally targeted to the vacuole for degradation by PEP4-dependent proteases. Furthermore, this delivery of Smf1p to the vacuole is dependent upon the product of theBSD2 gene.Figure 6Subcellular fractionation of pep4mutants expressing Smf1-HA. Cell lysates prepared from the isogenic pep4Δ XL126 strain transformed with pSF4 (A) or the pep4Δ bsd2Δ strain XL124 transformed with pSF10 (B) were subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation as in Fig. 4 B. Fractions were assayed for α-mannosidase (■) in absorption units at 400 nm (a vacuolar marker (V)); for GDPase activity (▪), a Golgi marker (G); for NADPH cytochrome c reductase (◍), an endoplasmic reticulum marker (ER); and for Smf1-HA (•) as described in Fig. 4 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We addressed whether metal ions can influence the stability of Smf1p. Treating the growth medium with elevated concentrations of heavy metals such as copper and manganese did not change the steady state levels of Smf1-HA (not shown). However, depletion of the heavy metals zinc, cobalt, copper, manganese and iron from the growth medium mimicked the effects of a bsd2 mutation and resulted in high accumulation of Smf1-HA (Fig. 7 A). The addition of manganese back to the growth medium was sufficient to down-regulate Smf1-HA protein levels in the wild type strain (Fig. 7,A and B), but not in the isogenic strain containing a bsd2 mutation (Fig. 7 B). Down-regulation of Smf1-HA was also observed upon supplementation of iron to the metal-depleted medium, although to a lesser extent than was observed with manganese (Fig. 7 A). The individual addition of zinc, copper or cobalt to the metal-depleted medium had no effect on Smf1-HA levels (Fig. 7 A). We next tested whether the down-regulation of Smf1p by manganese ions occurs at the level of gene transcription or protein stability. As seen in Fig. 7 C, manganese depletion had no effect onSMF1 mRNA levels, and the same was seen with iron depletion (not shown). To test for protein stability effects, the time course of Smf1-HA degradation was monitored in strains grown under manganese deplete or replete conditions. As seen in Fig. 7 D, Smf1-HA expressed in the wild type strain was stabilized in the metal-depleted medium, and supplementation of manganese to the growth medium resulted in instability of Smf1-HA in the wild type strain but not in the bsd2 mutant (Fig. 7 D). These findings demonstrate that metal ions can induce degradation of Smf1p through a mechanism dependent upon the BSD2 gene product. To examine further the effect of metal ions on Smf1p, the localization of Smf1-HA was examined in cells grown in metal-starvedversus metal-replete conditions. These studies were conducted with a pep4 mutant such that vacuolar Smf1-HA could be readily discerned. Under metal-starvation conditions, intense staining of Smf1-HA was observed at the cell surface (Fig.8). Supplementation of metals back to this metal-depleted medium resulted in a dramatic shift in Smf1-HA localization where the bulk of this transporter was now found in the vacuole and was absent from the cell surface (Fig. 8). Therefore, the cellular localization of Smf1-HA is strongly influenced by the metal ion status of the cell. When metal ions are ample, Smf1p is targeted to the vacuole in a manner dependent on Bsd2p (Fig. 6, A andB). Yet Bsd2p is not required for the recruitment of Smf1p to the plasma membrane upon metal depletion as metal starvation still triggered the cell surface localization of Smf1-HA in cells lacking Bsd2p (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, factors other than Bsd2p are involved in the trafficking of Smf1-HA to the cell surface under metal-starvation conditions. These studies have addressed the regulation of metal transport by the yeast Nramp protein Smf1p. This transporter was previously shown to fall under negative control by the S. cerevisiae BSD2 gene (22Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and we now demonstrate that this repression occurs at the level of Smf1p stability. The bulk of Smf1p is normally targeted to the vacuole for degradation by vacuolar proteases, yet in bsd2mutants, the transporter fails to arrive at the vacuole and the bulk of the protein remains within the secretory pathway. Metal ions also play an important role in Smf1p regulation. Exposure of cells to physiological concentrations of metals such as manganese induces the degradation of Smf1p in a Bsd2p-dependent manner. Under conditions of metal starvation, the yeast Nramp protein fails to arrive at the vacuole and accumulates at the cell surface. This switch in localization to the cell surface occurs independent of Bsd2p. Regulation of other metal transporters in yeast (e.g. the Ctr1p (copper), Ftr1p (iron), and Zrt1p/Zrt2p (zinc) transporters) occurs predominantly at the level of gene transcription (13Zhao H. Eide D.

Ctr1p and Zrt1p additionally exhibit protein stability effects, but turnover of these transporters is induced only at relatively high copper and zinc concentrations, whereas the degradation of Smf1p occurs at physiological concentrations of metals (30Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 36Gitan R.S. Lou H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have found no evidence of transcriptional control of SMF1 by metals. The strong regulation of Smf1p at the protein stability level may be particularly important for a transporter that acts on both essential (e.g. manganese) and nonessential toxic (e.g.cadmium) metals. Targeting Smf1p to the vacuole ensures cessation of harmful metal uptake, yet when cells are starved for essential metals, Nramp activity can be rapidly induced by protein stabilization and redistribution to the plasma membrane, bypassing the need for new Smf1p synthesis. How is Smf1p directed to the vacuole? When metals are abundant, the transporter appears to move directly through the secretory pathway to the vacuole without plasma membrane routing since a block in endocytosis fails to effect a plasma membrane localization for Smf1p under these conditions. Furthermore, Smf1p targeting to the vacuole is completely dependent on Bsd2p in the ER. Bsd2p does not appear to be a general receptor for the transport of polypeptides to the vacuole because bsd2 mutations do not impact on the delivery of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) to the vacuole (37Luo W. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, Chang and co-workers have noted that a mutant allele of the plasma membrane proton ATPase, Pma1p (Pma1–7p), is targeted to the vacuole in a Bsd2-dependent manner (37Luo W. Chang A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Presumably mutant Pma1–7p adopts a specific conformation that is recognized by the Bsd2p-dependent machinery for vacuole targeting. We therefore propose that Bsd2p (or an auxiliary factor dependent on Bsd2p) recognizes a specific conformation of a subset of ion transporters as they pass through the secretory pathway and triggers the trafficking of these transporters to the vacuole for degradation. Our studies are consistent with a model in which the metal bound or active form of Smf1p adopts a conformation that is recognized by Bsd2p for targeting to the vacuole. First, the trafficking of Smf1p to the vacuole is absolutely dependent on the presence of metals. Second, our recent studies indicate that vacuolar targeting requires a Smf1 polypeptide that is functional for metal transport. 2X. F. Liu and V. C. Culotta, manuscript submitted. It is conceivable that the apo form of Smf1p adopts an alternative conformation that fails to be recognized by Bsd2p and additionally favors trafficking to the plasma membrane independent of Bsd2p. Although the mechanism underlying the switch for Smf1p trafficking is unknown, it may involve the unmasking of putative signal sequences on the Smf1 polypeptide for plasma membrane localization. We are indebted to Amy Chang, Scott Emr, Susan Michaelis, Cecile Pickard, and David Levin for invaluable discussions."

We studied the regulation of GSH synthesis in response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). TNF-α (10 ng/ml) exposure increased GSH levels, concomitant with a significant increase in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) activity and the expression of γ-GCS heavy subunit (γ-GCS-HS) mRNA at 24 h. Treatment with TNF-α also increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity of a γ-GCS-HS 5′-flanking region reporter construct, transfected into alveolar epithelial cells. Mutation of the putative proximal AP-1-binding site (−269 to −263 base pairs), abolished TNF-α-mediated activation of the promoter. Gel shift and supershift analysis showed that TNF-α increased AP-1 DNA binding which was predominantly formed by dimers of c-Jun. Dexamethasone (3 μm) produced a significant decrease in the levels of GSH, decreased γ-GCS activity and γ-GCS-HS mRNA expression at 24 h. The increase in GSH levels, γ-GCS-HS mRNA, γ-GCS-HS promoter activity, and AP-1 DNA binding produced by TNF-α were abrogated by co-treating the cells with dexamethasone. Thus these data demonstrate that TNF-α and dexamethasone modulate GSH levels and γ-GCS-HS mRNA expression by their effects on AP-1 (c-Jun homodimer).

These data have implications for the oxidant/antioxidant balance in inflammatory lung diseases. The tripeptide,l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine, or glutathione (GSH), is a ubiquitous cellular non-protein sulfhydryl, which plays an important role in maintaining intracellular redox balance and in cellular defenses against oxidative stress (1Rahman I.

It also has an important role in maintaining the integrity of the airspace epithelium, in both type II alveolar cells in vitro, and in lungs in vivo (4Li X.Y. Donaldson K. Rahman I. MacNee W. Am. J.

Depletion of lung epithelial lining fluid GSH has been described in conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus infection (7Staal F.J.T. Ela S.W. Roederer M. Anderson M.T. Herzenberg L,A.

The γ-GCS holoenzyme exists as a dimer composed of heavy (γ-GCS-HS; 73 kDa) and light (γ-GCS-LS; 28 kDa) subunits (13Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol.

We have recently demonstrated that a putative AP-1 transcription factor-binding site is necessary for oxidant-mediated regulation of the catalytic γ-GCS-HS gene promoter (15Rahman I. Smith C.A.D.

Anti-inflammatory drugs might also influence this balance. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a ubiquitous pro-inflammatory cytokine and is recognized as an important mediator of multiple inflammatory events in the lungs. It induces chronic inflammatory changes associated with the increase in a variety of defense mechanisms, through the up-regulation of mRNA for various inflammatory mediators (16Arai K.I. Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Regulation of mRNA expression by TNF-α is mediated by activation of transcription factors c-Fos/c-Jun (activator protein-1, AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) (17Rahman I. MacNee W. Thorax. 1998; 53: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It has been reported that prior exposure to a sublethal dose of TNF-α renders cells resistant to a subsequent TNF-α challenge. The mechanism by which this TNF-α-mediated cellular resistance occurs is related to the enhancement of the intracellular antioxidant capacity (18Zimmerman R.J. Marafino Jr., B.J. Chan A. Landre P. Winkelhake J.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1405-1409PubMed Google Scholar). Examples of this are increased activity of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (19Wong G.H. Goeddel D,V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), and other protective proteins, including plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2, the zinc finger protein A20, and the Bcl-2-related family member A1 (20Dickison J.L.

However, the molecular basis of the TNF-α-induced cellular tolerance is not fully understood at present. One possible mechanism may involve TNF-α-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by leakage from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (23Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 267: 5317-5323Google Scholar, 24Richter C. Cogvadze V. Laffranchi R. Schlapbach R. Schweizer M. Suter M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 127: 67-74Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Such intracellular ROS could induce glutathione synthesis in response to this oxidant stress by a mechanism involving the up-regulation of the γ-GCS-HS mRNA. Corticosteriods are widely used as anti-inflammatory agents in various inflammatory lung diseases (17Rahman I. MacNee W. Thorax. 1998; 53: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Corticosteroids act to reduce inflammation and cellular damage by two different mechanisms as follows: by direct binding of glucocorticoids to their consensus glucocorticoid response element site, which activates transcription processes, and by an indirect mechanism involving nuclear protein interactions (25Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2682) Google Scholar). These latter effects may be mediated by an interaction between the glucocorticoid-receptor complex and transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1, which regulate transcription for inflammatory mediators such as cytokines (17Rahman I. MacNee W. Thorax. 1998; 53: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 25Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2682) Google Scholar). We have shown that AP-1 plays a critical role in enhancing γ-GCS-HS mRNA expression, and therefore regulation of GSH synthesis (15Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W.

Commun. 1996; 229: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus corticosteroids may have an effect on intracellular GSH through a mechanism involving AP-1 (28Rahman I. Bel A. Mulier B. Donaldson K. MacNee W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L80-L86PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of corticosteroids on GSH synthesis at the molecular level have not been studied so far. Thus the aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanisms for GSH synthesis in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) in response to TNF-α and dexamethasone, important pro- and anti-inflammatory agents, respectively. GSH, GSSG, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), sulfosalicylic acid, glutathione reductase, NADPH, triethanolamine, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, l-glutamate,l-α-aminobutyrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, dexamethasone, dl-buthionine-(SR)-sulfoximine, and ATP were obtained from the Sigma (Poole, UK) and 2-vinylpyridine from Aldrich Chemical Co., (Dorset, UK). Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from R & D Systems, (Abingdon, Oxford, UK). Cell culture media/reagents and the TRIZOL reagent were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). The human type II alveolar epithelial cell line, A549 (ECACC number 86012804), which was mycoplasma-free, was maintained in continuous culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM), sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). When required for the assays, confluent monolayers of A549 epithelial cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Thereafter, trypsin EDTA solution was added to detach the cells. The cells were then washed with DMEM, containing 10% FBS at 250 ×g for 10 min, to neutralize the trypsin, and were resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained in 162-cm2cell culture flasks (Corning Costar, High Wycombe, UK). Monolayers of confluent A549 epithelial cells were prepared by seeding 0.8 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well or 3 × 106 cells/100-mm plates in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C, 5% CO2, until 70–80% confluency was reached. Confluent monolayers were rinsed twice with DMEM and were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and/or dexamethasone (3 μm) for time intervals between 4 and 24 h in 2 ml or 5 ml of full media, incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Thereafter, the monolayers were washed twice with cold PBS, and the cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA solution and resuspended in cold PBS (pH 7.4). An aliquot of cells was diluted with trypan blue, counted, and the cell viability determined. This cell suspension was thereafter used in the GSH and GSSG assays. For γ-GCS activity, mRNA assays, and transfection experiments, monolayers were scraped using a Teflon scraper (Corning Costar, High Wycombe, UK). The epithelial cells were centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of cold 0.6% sulfosalicylic acid, sonicated on ice, homogenized with a Teflon pestle, and vortexed vigorously. The cell homogenates were then centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was immediately used in the GSH assay by the 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-glutathione reductase recycling method described by Tietze (29Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5517) Google Scholar). For the GSSG assay, supernatant was treated with 2-vinylpyridine and triethanolamine as described previously (30Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4001) Google Scholar) and thereafter was used in the assay for GSH as described above. Cell extracts for γ-GCS activity were prepared 4 or 24 h after each treatment. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped into PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After two additional washes with PBS, the cells were resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), sonicated, and homogenized using a Teflon pestle on ice with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). The extracts were spun at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered and dialyzed at 4 °C against four changes of 500 ml each of the Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) and then stored at 0 °C. The protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent assay (Pierce, Chester, UK) (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar). γ-GCS activity was assayed by the method described by Seelig and Meister (12Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3534-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a coupled assay with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed at 37 °C. Enzyme-specific activity was measured as micromoles of NADH oxidized per min/mg protein, which is equal to 1 international unit (IU). For each experimental assay, BSO (50 μm) was added to the cell homogenate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to check the specificity of the γ-GCS assay. RNA was isolated from A549 cells using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog number 8025SA). The resultant cDNA was stored at −20 °C until required. Oligonucleotide primers were chosen using the published sequence of human γ-GCS-HS cDNA (32Gipp J.J. Chang C. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (33Maier J.A.M. Voulalas P. Roeder D. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1570-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). The primers for γ-GCS-HS were synthesized by Oswel DNA Services, University of Southampton, UK (25Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2682) Google Scholar, 34Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 393-395Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used in the PCR were as follows: γ-GCS-HS (sense 5′-GTG GTA CTG CTC ACC AGA GTG ATC CT-3′) and (antisense 5′-TGA TCC AAG TAA CTC TGG ACA TTC ACA-3′); GAPDH (sense 5′-CC ACC CAT GGC AAA TTC CAT GGC A-3′) and (antisense 5′-TC TAG ACG GCA GGT CAG GTC AAC C-3′). Five microliters of the reverse-transcribed mRNA mixture was added directly to the PCR mixture and used for the PCR reactions, which we have previously described (26Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Rahman I. Bel A. Mulier B. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W. Smith C.A.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Bands were visualized by a UV transilluminator, and photograph negatives were scanned using a white/ultraviolet transilluminator, UVP (Orme Technologies, Cambridge, UK). The intensity of the γ-GCS-HS mRNA (531 bp) bands were expressed as a percentage of the intensity of the GAPDH bands (600 bp). The pKS-hGCS plasmid (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, catalog number 79023) was used as a positive control for γ-GCS-HS. Fifty femtograms was used for each experiment to check the specificity of the PCR (data not shown). The γ-GCS-HS promoter was isolated by PCR from human genomic DNA using the upstream oligonucleotide 5′-(−1050) GGCGACATCCAATATGAAGGCTGTG-3′ and downstream oligonucleotide 5′-(+82) TTCCTACTTGTGACCAAAACCTGCG-3′. The resulting promoter fragment (−1050 to +82 bp) was sequenced and cloned into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen). A HindIII and SphI fragment (1138 bp) containing the promoter was isolated and subcloned into the polylinker of the promoterless plasmid pCAT Basic Vector (Promega). This construct was denoted pCBGCS and has been described previously (15Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Antonicelli F. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Rahman I. Smith C.A.D. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W.

Commun. 1996; 229: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A selective mutation in the proximal AP-1-binding site (−269 to −263 bp) was introduced by PCR amplification with the mutated upstream primers. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the PCR were as follows: upstream 5′-ATGGTGAGTTCGTCATGTTATCAA-3′ and downstream 5′-GCAGGCATGCCCAGTCTTTGCG-3′ and were synthesized by MWG-BIOTECH GmbH, (Ebersberg, Germany). The mutated consensus sequence of AP-1 is denoted by the underlined letters, and the italic letters on the downstream oligonucleotide indicates additional bases from the cloning site of the pCAT Basic vector. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 10 min and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 120 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min with 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK). The resulting PCR-amplified DNA fragment (−285 to +47 bp) was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated PCR fragment was isolated and subcloned into pCBGCS usingHpaII and SphI restriction sites. This construct was denoted pCBmGCS. Multiple restriction sites within the γ-GCS-HS promoter were utilized to create a γ-GCS-HS construct containing a putative proximal AP-1 construct. Digestion of the γ-GCS-HS promoter using KpnI produced a short (−1050 to −818 bp) and a large fragment (−817 to +82 bp). Further digestion of the large fragment by BalI andDraII generated a proximal fragment (−305 to +82 bp). This fragment contains a putative AP-1 at −269 to −263 bp, CAAT and TATA boxes, which was subcloned into the pCAT Basic vector (pCBGCΔD). Restriction enzyme analyses were performed to confirm the orientation and validity of all constructs. A549 cells (0.8 × 106 per well) were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates and cultured at 37 °C until they were 70–80% confluent. Plasmid DNA transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following treatment with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and/or dexamethasone (3 μm), cell extracts were prepared and assayed for protein content using the BCA reagent (Pierce, Chester, UK) (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was quantified by a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid (PSVgal, Promega) was co-transfected as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. In all of the transfection experiments, pCAT-Basic and pCAT-Control were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Staal et al. (35Staal F.J.T. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used were commercial AP-1 (5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′, 3′-CGC AAC TAC TCA GTC GGC CTT-5′) and NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C'-3, 3′-TCA ACT CCC CTG AAA GGG TCC G-5′), which were obtained from Promega. The oligonucleotides for the AP-1 site (−269 to −263 bp) present in native γ-GCS-HS-AP-1 (5′-GAG TTC GTC ATT GAT TCA AAT AAT-3′ and 3′-CTC AAG CAG TAA CTA AGT TTA TTA-5′) were synthesized by MWG-BIOTECH GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany. The consensus sequence of AP-1 is indicated by bold letters. Both the oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Promega). Binding reactions were carried out using 5 μg of nuclear extract protein for AP-1 and NF-κB and 25 μg for γ-GCS-HS AP-1, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly (dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech, St. Albans, United Kingdom), in a 20-μl binding buffer (Promega). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gels at 100 V for 3–4 h. The gels were then vacuum-dried and autoradiographed overnight with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. The gel was scanned on a white/ultraviolet transilluminator UVP (Orme Technologies, Cambridge, UK). The nuclear extracts were preincubated with 3 μl of antiserum (1 mg/ml), at 4 °C for overnight, before analysis by EMSA as described above. Human anti-c-Jun and anti-c-Fos sera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. These sera specifically detect the presence of the corresponding transcription factor and do not interfere with nuclear factor binding. Rabbit preimmune sera (SAPU, Edinburgh, Scotland) were incubated with the nuclear extracts as described above and used as a control. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between values were compared by Duncan's multiple range test. TNF-α (10 ng/ml) significantly decreased GSH levels after 4 h treatment concomitant with an increase in GSSG levels in A549 epithelial cells. This was associated with a significant increase in GSH at 24 h, without any change in GSSG levels, compared with control values (Fig. 1 and Table I). By contrast, dexamethasone (3 μm) depleted intracellular GSH levels significantly at both 4 and 24 h. At 4 h dexamethasone produced no change in GSSG, but at 24 h GSSG was decreased compared with control levels (Fig. 1 and Table I). However, exposure to dexamethasone produced a 31% decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio at 4 h and an 24% increase at 24 h in A549 cells, compared with control values. Co-incubation of TNF-α and dexamethasone produced further depletion of GSH at 24 h in epithelial cells, compared with TNF-α or dexamethasone alone, without any significant change in the GSH/GSSG ratio (Fig. 1 and TableI). Co-incubation of TNF-α and dexamethasone produced a similar decrease in GSH levels to TNF-α alone at 4 h, but with an 50% decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio. Cell viability remained >95% after all of the above treatments.Table IEffects of TNF-α and dexamethasone on GSSG levels in alveolar epithelial cellsTreatmentGSSG4 h24 hnmol/106 cellsControl2.0 ± 0.201.8 ± 0.31TNF-α4.2 ± 0.14ap < 0.05.2.2 ± 0.40Dex1.8 ± 0.400.67 ± 0.22bp < 0.01 versus control.TNF-α + Dex2.2 ± 0.220.52 ± 0.34bp < 0.01 versus control.A549 epithelial monolayers were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and/or dexamethasone (Dex) (3 μm) for 4 and 24 h.

Open table in a new tab A549 epithelial monolayers were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and/or dexamethasone (Dex) (3 μm) for 4 and 24 h. Cellular GSSG levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 4). γ-GCS activity was not affected by TNF-α and/or dexamethasone treatment at 4 h, compared with control values (Fig. 2). However, TNF-α produced an increase in γ-GCS activity at 24 h (Fig. 2). By contrast, dexamethasone significantly decreased γ-GCS activity at 24 h (Fig. 2). Co-incubation of TNF-α with dexamethasone produced a further decrease in γ-GCS activity at 24 h, compared with dexamethasone alone. Addition of BSO (50 μm) only inhibited 65–72% of the total γ-GCS activity. The results were corrected for the BSO non-inhibitable enzyme activity after each treatment. The mean BSO-inhibitable γ-GCS activity in the A549 cell homogenate was 0.065 ± 0.01 units/mg protein. We investigated the mechanism of the above effects on GSH and γ-GCS activity following TNF-α and dexamethasone alone or in combination. Neither TNF-α nor dexamethasone alone or in combination produced any significant change in the γ-GCS-HS mRNA level after 4 h, compared with control values (Fig.3 A). However, TNF-α significantly increased γ-GCS-HS mRNA expression, whereas dexamethasone treatment significantly depleted γ-GCS-HS mRNA, after 24 h, compared with GAPDH mRNA expression (Fig.3 B). The increased γ-GCS-HS mRNA expression produced by TNF-α at 24 h was completely abolished when the cells were co-treated with dexamethasone. To determine if AP-1 plays an important role in TNF-α and dexamethasone-mediated γ-GCS-HS gene regulation in A549 epithelial cells, we used a DNA fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the γ-GCS-HS containing a proximal putative AP-1 site and a commercially available DNA fragment containing an AP-1 consensus in the EMSA. Nuclear proteins were isolated at 4 and 24 h after TNF-α and/or dexamethasone treatment and were incubated with the DNA probes containing the AP-1 site. We found that TNF-α exposure increased AP-1 DNA binding activities in A549 cells using both the γ-GCS-HS AP-1 probe and commercial AP-1 probe at 4 h exposure (Figs.4 and 5), in A549 cells compared with untreated cells. Dexamethasone treatment alone did not produce any changes in the nuclear binding of γ-GCS-HS AP-1 probe at 4 or 24 h, compared with control values. However, dexamethasone treatment produced a significant decrease in the nuclear binding using commercial AP-1 at 24 h, withou"

We therefore developed stable transfectants of the renal epithelial cell line, LLCPKcl4, that expressed an active regio- and enantioselective arachidonic acid (AA) epoxygenase. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to convert bacterial P450 BM-3 into an active regio- and stereoselective 14S,15R-epoxygenase (F87V BM-3). In clones expressing F87V BM-3 (F87V BM-3 cells), exogenous AA induced significant 14S,15R-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) production (241.82 ng/108 cells, >97% of total EETs), whereas no detectable EETs were seen in cells transfected with vector alone. In F87V BM-3 cells, AA stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation and increased cell proliferation, which was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, by the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI-3) kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, and by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059. AA also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and PI-3 kinase that was inhibited by the cytochrome P450 BM-3 inhibitor, 17-ODYA. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased EET production in F87V BM-3 cells, which was completely abolished by pretreatment with either 17-ODYA or the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitor, quinacrine. Compared with vector-transfected cells, F87 BM-3 transfected cells demonstrated marked increases in both the extent and sensitivity of DNA synthesis in response to EGF. These changes occurred in the absence of significant differences in EGF receptor expression. As seen with exogenous AA, EGF increased ERK tyrosine phosphorylation to a significantly greater extent in F87V BM-3 cells than in vector-transfected cells. Furthermore, in these control cells, neither 17-ODYA nor quinacrine inhibited EGF-induced ERK tyrosine phosphorylation. On the other hand, in F87V BM-3 cells, both inhibitors reduced ERK tyrosine phosphorylation to levels indistinguishable from that seen in cells transfected with vector alone.These studies provide the first unequivocal evidence for a role for the AA epoxygenase pathway and endogenous EET synthesis in EGF-mediated signaling and mitogenesis and provide compelling evidence for the PLA2-AA-EET pathway as an important intracellular-signaling pathway in cells expressing high levels of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase.

Release of arachidonic acid secondary to phospholipase A2 activation is a well recognized cellular response to a variety of growth factors, hormones, and cytokines (1Needleman P. Turk J.

Fatty Acids. 1995; 53: 239-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Metabolites of arachidonic acid play important roles as intracellular second messengers, with well documented autocrine effects of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites (1Needleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowitz J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Baker R.R. Clin.

Isakson P.C. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 6-9PubMed Google Scholar). There is now abundant suggestive evidence that arachidonate metabolites generated by cytochrome P450, the third pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, may also serve as second messengers (6Makita K. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These compounds have been implicated in the regulation of peptide secretion, distal nephron Na+ fluxes, cell Ca2+ influx, and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels (6Makita K. Falck J.R. Capdevila J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have relied upon the use of inhibitors of limited selectivity for cP450 or upon the exogenous administration of relatively high concentrations of cP450 arachidonate metabolites; in addition, a significant limitation to studies of EET 1The abbreviations EETepoxyeicosatrienoic acidEGFepidermal growth factorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasePFBpentafluorobenzylPLA2phospholipase A2 mechanisms and sites of actions is the well documented loss and redistribution of cP450 isoforms that occur soon after the initiation of cell culture. To overcome these limitations, we have used stable transfection of a mammalian proximal tubule-like cell line, LLCPKcl4, with F87V BM-3, an active and regio- and stereoselective 14S,15Rarachidonic acid expoxygenase of bacterial origin containing a cP450 domain fused to a cP450 reductase domain (7Graham-Lorence S.

We report studies of the mechanism of EET-dependent EGF-mediated mitogenesis and provide unequivocal evidence that in these cells, cP450 arachidonic acid metabolite production increases in response to agonist activation, and cP450 arachidonic acid metabolites can serve as intracellular second messengers to mediate signal transduction and functional responses. epoxyeicosatrienoic acid epidermal growth factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase pentafluorobenzyl phospholipase A2 Polyclonal rabbit anti-BM-3 antibodies were purified using protein G chromatography (7Graham-Lorence S.

Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal anti-PI-3 kinase antibody and anti-EGF receptor antibody were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies and protein A-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Arachidonic acid was obtained from NuCheck-Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). The sulfonimide analog of 14,15-EET was synthesized as described previously (8Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. J. Biol.

Genistein, wortmannin, PD98059, and quinacrine were from Calbiochem. 17-ODYA was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. LLCPKcl4, an established proximal tubule epithelial cell line derived from pig kidney (9Amsler K. Cook J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C94-C101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The medium was changed every 2–3 days. The entire coding region of mutant BM-3 (F87V BM-3) cDNA was cloned into theHindIII and XbaI sites in the mammalian expression vector pCB6+. 1 μg/ml F87V BM-3 cDNA in pCB6+ or empty pCB6+ vector alone was used for stable transfection. Cultured LLCPKcl4 cells were grown to 80% confluence and were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 6 h, the DNA-LipofectAMINE mixture was removed and the cells incubated in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h, then cultured for 7 passages in medium containing 600 μg/ml of G418. G418-resistant clones were then isolated and screened by immunoblotting with the affinity purified polyclonal antibody against BM-3. Two of the clones that expressed detectable levels of immunoreactive F87V BM-3, C9, and C23 (Fig. 1 A), along with LLCPKcl4 cells transfected with vector alone, were used for subsequent functional studies. Quiescent LLCPKcl4 cells were treated with arachidonic acid and/or other drugs as indicated, then washed twice with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 30 min with radioimmune precipitation buffer (8Chen J.-K.

Cell lysates were clarified at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, immune complexes captured with protein A-agarose beads, washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 100 μmNa3VO4), and eluted by boiling in sample buffer. Total cell lysates or anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, as indicated in the corresponding data, were subjected to 7.5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with the indicated primary antibody and the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with biotin, incubated with preformed avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex using a commercially available kit (ABC kit; Pierce), and the immune complexes detected by a peroxidase-catalyzed enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham, United Kingdom). Quiescent C9, C23, and empty vector-transfected cells were treated with or without 30 μm arachidonic acid, 10 nm EGF, and/or indicated inhibitors for the indicated times, scraped with a 1:1 mixture of media and CH3OH, and then mixed with two volumes of CHCl3 containing 1 mm triphenylphosphine, and an equimolar mixture of synthetic 14C-labeled 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET (55–56 mCi/mmol, 30 ng each). After acidification, the samples were extracted twice and the organic phases evaporated under argon. To the resulting residue, 0.5 ml of 0.4 n KOH in 80% CH3OH was added and the mixture incubated at 50 °C for 60 min. Acidification was followed by extraction into ethyl ether and chromatography in SiO2 as described (10Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The EETs were resolved into 14,15-EET, and a mixture of 8,9- and 11,12-EET by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and then derivatized to the corresponding pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters by reaction with pentafluorobenzyl bromine. Aliquots of the purified EET-PFB regioisomers were individually dissolved in dodecane and analyzed and quantified by NICI/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, utilizing CH4 as reagent gas, as described (10Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For stereochemical analysis, samples of enzymatically derived [14C]14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (25 μg, 1 μCi/μmol) and of synthetic 14R,15S-EET and 14S,15R-EET were catalytically hydrogenated over PtO2 and esterified using excess pentafluorobenzyl bromine, as described (10Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The resulting PFB esters were purified by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and, after solvent evaporation, the optical antipodes of the purified PFB-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid were resolved by high-pressure liquid chromatography on a Chiralcel OD column (4.6 × 250 mm) (J.T. Baker Inc.) with an isocratic mixture of 0.11% isopropanol, 99.89% n-hexane at 1 ml/min with UV monitoring at 210 nm. The retention times for the PFB esters of synthetic 14R,15S- and 14S,15R-EET were 70.6 and 78.9 min, respectively (7Graham-Lorence S. Truan G. Peterson J.A. Falck J.R. Wei S. Helvig C. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells in 24-well plates were made quiescent with serum-free medium. Agonists and antagonists were routinely added to the quiescent cells in triplicate and incubated for 19 h, followed by addition of 2 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine to pulse the cells for an additional 2 h. Cells were then washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, precipitated twice (30 min each time on ice) with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, briefly washed once with ice-cold ethanol, then lysed with 0.2 nNaOH, 0.5% SDS lysis buffer, incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 min, and radioactivity of incorporated [3H]thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman). Results were plotted as the number of counts/min/well. Each experimental data point represents triplicate or duplicate wells from at least four different experiments. For determination of cell proliferation, cells were plated in replicate dishes at a density of 105 cells in 60-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 + 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h later, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 + 0.2% fetal calf serum and 5 μmarachidonic acid. Data are presented as means ± S.E. for at least four separate experiments (each in triplicate or duplicate). Unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical analysis and for multiple group comparisons, analysis of variance and Bonferronit tests were used. A value of p < 0.05 compared with control was considered statistically significant. Previous studies indicated that synthetic 14,15-EET was a potent mitogen for renal epithelial cells and that the mitogenic effects of this EET were mediated, at least in part, by Src kinase and the initiation of a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation cascade (8Chen J.-K.

To reproduce more physiologic conditions in which the putative lipid mediator is synthesized endogenously from endogenous AA pools, we have used a novel strategy to investigate the role of the 14,15-AA epoxygenase in endogenous EET production and cell signaling. LLCPKcl4 cells, a well characterized proximal tubule cell line with undetectable endogenous cP450 expression levels, were stably transfected with a mutant form of bacterial cP450 BM-3. cP450 BM-3, isolated fromBacillus megaterium, is a single polypeptide containing fused cP450 and cP450 reductase domains that catalyzes NADPH-dependent AA oxidation as a self-contained catalytic unit (7Graham-Lorence S.

Replacement of phenylalanine 87 for valine converts this protein into a regio- and stereoselective 14S,15R-epoxygenase (14S,15R-EET, 99% of total products, 98% optical purity) (7Graham-Lorence S.

We identified two clones, C9 and C23, that expressed immunoreactive F87V BM-3 proteins (Fig.1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, in the absence of exogenous arachidonic acid, EET levels were low or undetectable in quiescent C9 or C23 or in control vector-transfected cells. Following incubation with exogenous arachidonic acid (30 μm), EET production increased significantly in both C9 (67.28 ng/108 cells) and C23 (241.82 ng/108 cells), whereas there was no increase in the cells transfected with empty vector alone. The greater increase in EET production in C23 was consistent with the higher levels of immunoreactive protein expression in this clone (Fig. 1 A). The predominant EET present in arachidonic acid-treated F87V BM-3-transfected cells was 14S,15R-EET (>97% optical purity), indicating enzymatic production by the expressed F87V BM-3 (Table I).Table IStereochemical analysis of the EET produced in arachidonic acid-treated cells14,15-EET11,12-EET8,9-EETTotalR,SS,RR,SS,RR,SS,REmpty vectorNDaND, not detected.NDNDND0.451.481.93C233.90110.500.603.393.205.90127.50C23 and empty vector-transfected cells (empty vector) were made quiescent with serum-free medium for 24 h and treated with 30 μm arachidonic acid for 30 min, then scraped into the culture medium and subjected to stereochemical analysis (values in ng/108 cells).a ND, not detected.

Together with increased EET production, the AA addition stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner in the F87V BM-3-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig.1 C). In the absence of added growth factors, 5 μm arachidonic acid also stimulated cell proliferation in F87V BM-3-transfected cells but not in vector-transfected cells (Fig.1 D). There were no differences in growth rate in the absence of exogenous arachidonic acid administration (not shown). Similar to what was previously observed in LLCPKcl4 cells in response to exogenous administration of 14,15-EET (8Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), arachidonic acid stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation in F87V BM-3-transfected cells was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (11Akiyama T.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B), suggesting an important role for PI-3 kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERKs) in the EET-mediated mitogenic response. Arachidonic acid produced significant increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK in F87V BM-3 cells (Fig. 2 C) and also increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase (not shown). On the other hand, no such effects were observed in vector-transfected cells. Pretreatment of the cells with 17-ODYA (15Muerhoff A.S. Williams D.E. Reich N.O. CaJacob C.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 749-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a potent inhibitor of BM-3 P450 enzyme activity2 did not alter the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERKs by exogenously administered 14,15-EET in either empty vector-transfected cells or F87V BM-3-transfected LLCPKcl4 cells. However, 17-ODYA inhibited completely ERK tyrosine phosphorylation induced by arachidonic acid in F87V BM-3 cells (Fig. 2 D). To study hormonal regulation of EET production in these transfected cells and to investigate the role of this pathway in EGF signaling, LLCPKcl4 cells were exposed to EGF, a documented mitogen for these cells (8Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). EGF/EGF receptor interactions markedly increased EET production to 387.59 ng/108 cells in C23, whereas minimal increases were seen in empty vector-transfected LLCPKcl4 cells (Fig.3 A). The EGF-induced EET production in C23 was completely inhibited by 17-ODYA, and the PLA2 inhibitor, quinacrine, completely abolished the EGF-stimulated EET production in these cells (Fig. 3 A). EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation was significantly greater in the F87V BM-3-transfected LLCPKcl4 cells than in cells transfected with empty vector alone (Fig. 3 B). F87V BM-3 transfection resulted in (a) increased sensitivity to EGF, i.e. stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation could be observed at lower concentrations of EGF in the transfected cells; and (b) augmentation of the mitogenic potency, i.e. maximal stimulation seen with 1 μm EGF was greater in the F87V BM-3-transfected LLCPKcl4 cells. These effects appeared to be associated with the changes in EGF-signaling efficiency, because no changes in the levels of immunoreactive EGF receptor were observed after cell transfection (Fig.3 C), whereas administration of EGF to F87V BM-3 cells increased ERK tyrosine phosphorylation to a significantly greater extent than in cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig.3 D). In cells transfected with the vector alone, as well as in wild type LLCPKcl4 cells (not shown), 17-ODYA had no effect on EGF-induced ERK tyrosine phosphorylation. Similarly, quinacrine did not affect EGF-induced ERK tyrosine phosphorylation in the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, either 17-ODYA or quinacrine reduced EGF-stimulated ERK tyrosine phosphorylation in the F87V BM-3-transfected LLCPKcl4 cells to levels not different from that observed in the empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 D). A further indication of intracellular responses induced by endogenously produced EETs in the F87V BM-3-transfected cells was the finding that administration of arachidonic acid to these cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (Fig.4). These results are consistent with our previous findings of increased EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation following administration of exogenous 14,15-EET to wild type LLCPKcl4 cells (8Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent epoxidation of arachidonic acid to 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET, in a regio- and stereoselective manner (16Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R.

Previous studies have indicated that EETs, or their dihydroxy derivatives, have potent biological activities, including modulation of vascular tone (19Harder D.R. Campbell W.B. Roman R.J. J. Vasc. Res. 1995; 32: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), glomerular hemodynamics (20Takahashi K. Capdevila J. Karara A. Falck J.R. Jacobson H.R. Badr K.F. Am. J.

Physiol. 1991; 261: F578-F586PubMed Google Scholar), and regulation of mitogenesis (22Harris R.C. Homma T. Jacobson H.R. Capdevila J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). EETs have been suggested to be an endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factor (23Campbell W.B. Gebremedhin D. Pratt P.F. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have also suggested that EETs may serve as intracellular second messengers in vasculature (24Graier W.F. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and in epithelia (25Burns K.D. Capdevila J.H. Wei S. Breyer M.D. Homma T. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C831-C840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most studies implicating a role for EETs as intracellular second messengers have been based on the effects of cP450 inhibitors and/or the use of synthetic EETs. The cP450 inhibitors currently available do not selectively inhibit epoxygenase activity, so these studies cannot definitively rule out the possibility that other cP450 arachidonate metabolites, other cellular activities of cP450, or even non-cP450-derived arachidonate metabolites, mediate the observed effects. Although reproduction of the effect with the addition of exogenous EETs is suggestive evidence, the high concentrations of exogenously administered EETs required to elicit biological responses has also raised the possibility of nonspecific effects. In addition, it is well documented that most lipid mediators are only one component of what are usually complex signaling processes that involve, in addition to the temporally and spatially controlled biosynthesis of the putative lipid mediator, the coordinated participation of additional signaling pathways to elicit the indicated cellular response. Therefore, addition of synthetic EETs or other lipid moieties bypasses the integrated cellular response seen in response to EGF or similar agonists. To overcome these limitations of previous studies, the present studies used stable transfection of a cP450 that has been genetically engineered to be a regio- and stereoselective epoxygenase to investigate the potential role of EETs as intracellular second messengers. The findings in the present study demonstrate that 14,15-EET can serve as an intracellular second messenger for EGF in cells expressing epoxygenase activity and that these signaling mechanisms involve the activation of kinase-associated mitogenic pathways. Endogenous production of EETs significantly augmented the mitogenic effects of EGF, indicated both by augmented stimulation of early signaling responses such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI-3 kinase and by increases in DNA synthesis. In F87V BM-3-transfected cells, administration of exogenous arachidonic acid activated a tyrosine kinase cascade and increased [3H]thymidine incorporation. This activation required conversion of the arachidonic acid to 14S,15R-EET, because addition of 17-ODYA blocked 14,15-EET production and subsequent cellular responses. The lack of significant EET formation in the absence of either exogenous arachidonic acid or agonist stimulation, and the inhibition of EGF-mediated EET production and functional activity by PLA2inhibition, indicate that, as with most enzymes of the AA cascade, the rate-limiting step for the cP450 pathway is substrate availability. In addition to autophosphorylation following ligand binding, there has been increasing evidence for tyrosine phosphorylation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase receptors by activation of seven-transmembrane receptors (26Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Chai Q. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10329-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y.

Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). These G-protein receptor-mediated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins use growth factor receptors such as EGF receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor as “scaffolds” (29Luttrell L.M.

Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar); unlike the sequence of events occurring when these receptors bind their ligands, they are not activated by autophosphorylation in this process but are tyrosine phosphorylated by Src-like kinases. Src, GRB2, and SOS may be associated via interactions with Shc, which interacts with SH2 domains of the receptor. It is therefore of interest that, together with our previous findings (8Chen J.-K. Falck J.R. Reddy K.M. Capdevila J.H. Harris R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29254-29261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), our results indicate that the endogenous AA epoxygenase metabolite, 14,15-EET, also appears to activate Src kinase and initiate a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that uses the EGF receptor as a scaffold and results in mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. cP450 arachidonic acid metabolites have been implicated as second messengers for a number of agonists that activate seven-transmembrane receptors, such as angiotensin II, bradykinin, and parathyroid hormone (31Madhun Z.T. Goldthwait D.A. McKay D. Hopfer U. Douglas J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Ribeiro C.M. Dubay G.R. Falck J.R. Mandel L.J. Am. J.

Biochemical Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 1054-1070Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar); whether EETs are also involved in activation of tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways by these agonists has not yet been determined. The biological effects of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other polar arachidonic acid metabolites are largely mediated through specific cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors; in contrast, the mechanisms of activation of the less polar cP450 arachidonate metabolites is unclear. There have been reports of a specific binding site for 14,15-EET in monocytes (34Wong P.Y. Lin K.T. Yan Y.T. Ahern D. Iles J. Shen S.Y. Bhatt R.K. Falck J.R. J.

Cell Signal. 1997; 16: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have indicated that EETs activated calcium-activated K+ channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. EETs did not activate channels when added directly to cytoplasmic surface of excised inside-out patches but required intermediate signaling steps involving G-proteins (36Hu S. Kim H.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 230: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 37Li P.L. Campbell W.B. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It is also possible that these compounds may directly activate or modulate enzymatic activity or could become incorporated into phospholipid and thereby modulate function. The availability of cultured cells with robust functional epoxygenase activity should provide a valuable tool for elucidation of the mechanisms of action of EETs. In summary, the lack of significant functional cP450 activity in cultured cell systems has contributed to the failure heretofore to appreciate fully the signaling capabilities of these compounds. The present studies provide direct and definitive evidence that cP450 arachidonate metabolites can serve as intracellular second messengers in cells expressing functional cP450 activity and should stimulate further research to explore the range of functions and molecular mechanisms of cP450 arachidonate metabolites."

In contrast to soluble lectin, agarose-immobilized, and hence noninternalizable ABL had no effect on proliferation of HT29 colon cancer cells. Electron microscopy of HT29 cells incubated with fluorescein- and gold-conjugated ABL showed internalization of the lectin into endocytotic vesicles and multivesicular bodies. Confocal microscopy showed perinuclear accumulation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectin, which also inhibits HT29 cell proliferation, raising the possibility that the lectin might interfere with nuclear pore function. Transport of heat shock protein 70 into the nucleus in response to heat shock was blocked by preincubation of HT29 cells for 6 h with 40 μg/ml ABL. In digitonin-permeabilized cells, nuclear uptake of bovine albumin conjugated to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-containing peptide was also inhibited by a 15-min preincubation with 40–100 μg/ml ABL. In contrast, serum-stimulated nuclear translocation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which is NLS-independent, was not affected by pretreatment of cells with the lectin.

Rhodes J.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 1410-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), as well as with anti-TF monoclonal antibodies (15Yu L.-G. Janssen B. Fernig D.G. Milton J.D.

In contrast, the lectin from the common edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus (ABL), which unlike PNA, can also bind to the 2–3 sialylated TF antigen, has been shown to inhibit proliferation in a reversible and noncytotoxic fashion in a wide range of epithelial cell types, blocking the growth-stimulatory effects of epidermal growth factor, serum, and insulin (14Yu L.-G. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Milton J.D. Rhodes J.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4627-4632PubMed Google Scholar). Because many lectins are tightly globular proteins that are highly resistant to heat and digestion (16Pusztai A. Plant Lectins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1991: 78-95Google Scholar) and can be detected in active form in feces (10Ryder S.D. Smith J.A. Rhodes J.M. J. Natl.

Because ABL has a powerful anti-proliferative effect on malignant colon cells without any apparent cytotoxicity, we have investigated the mechanism by which this lectin elicits its biological effects.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Proliferation, RNA, and Protein SynthesisThe HT29 cell line, established from an adenocarcinoma from a 44-year-old female Caucasian, was obtained from the European Cell Culture Collection (Public Health Laboratory Service, Porton Down Wiltshire, UK) and cultured as described previously (14Yu L.-G.

After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, ABL (Sigma), agarose immobilized-ABL (EY Laboratories Inc., San Mateo, CA), 10-nm colloidal gold-conjugated ABL (EY Laboratories) or FITC-conjugated ABL (EY Laboratories) was added for 24 h before a 1-h pulse with 0.8 μCi/well [methyl-3H]thymidine. The cell-associated radioactivity was determined as described previously (15Yu L.-G. Janssen B. Fernig D.G. Milton J.D. Smith J.A. Gerasimenko O.V. Jones M. Rhodes J.M. Int. J.

The cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine, [3H]uridine, or [3H]leucine for 1 h at the time indicated in the figure legends, and the radioactivity associated with macromolecules was determined as described previously (15Yu L.-G.

Cancer. 1997; 73: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Internalization Assessed by Electron MicroscopyGold-ABLHT29 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% FCS (v/v) in 24-well plates until 80% confluent. The culture medium was replaced by serum-free DMEM containing 250 μg/ml BSA and 5 μg/ml 10-nm colloidal gold-conjugated ABL. In control wells, the medium was replaced with either serum-free DMEM containing 250 μg/ml BSA or 5 μg/ml 10-nm colloidal gold (Sigma). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 h. After three washes with filtered PBS, the cells were released from the plates by trypsinization. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min and then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) (electron microscopy grade, Agar Scientific Ltd., Stansted, UK) in Sorensen's buffer, pH 7.4. The samples were processed for conventional electron microscopy using a standard 3-day processing protocol, stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, and viewed on a Philips CM-10 electron microscope.FITC-ABLHT29 cells were cultured as above in the presence of 0 to 40 μg/ml FITC-ABL for 1 or 24 h. The cells were released, washed, and pelleted as above before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in Sorensen's buffer. Cell pellets were dehydrated through an ethanol series before embedding in LR White (London Resin Co., UK). Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-fluorescein antibody (DAKO Ltd., Cambridge, UK) followed by gold (10 nm)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). On some sections the gold labeling was silver-enhanced (British Biocell International, UK) before staining with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. Control sections included untreated cells and omission of primary antifluorescein antibody.Intracellular Distribution of FITC-ABL and Tetramethylrhodamine Isothiocyanate (TRITC)-Dextran Analyzed by Confocal MicroscopySubconfluent HT29 cells cultured in glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp. Ashland, MA) were incubated at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml FITC-ABL in serum-free DMEM containing 250 μg/ml BSA. After 1 h, unbound lectin was removed by three washes with PBS, and the cells were cultured in fresh serum-free DMEM containing 250 μg/ml BSA at 37 °C in a CO2 chamber attached to a LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The FITC distribution was then monitored every h for 24 h.In dual-label experiments, the cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.15 μg/ml TRITC-dextran (155 kDa, Sigma) followed by the addition of 2 μg/ml FITC-ABL. The subcellular distributions of FITC and TRITC were monitored simultaneously using the 488-nm and 543-nm laser lines every h for 10 h.Effect of ABL on Nuclear Import of Heat Shock ProteinHT29 cells were cultured on glass coverslips in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 5% FCS (v/v) at 37 °C for 5 days. The cells were washed once with PBS and cultured in DMEM containing 1% FCS (v/v) for a further 24 h at 37 °C. ABL (0–80 μg/ml) or PNA (40 μg/ml) was added, the same volume of diluent (PBS) was added to control cells, and the cells were then cultured at 37 °C for 6 h before being placed into a 43 °C incubator (5% CO2-95% air) for 1 or 3 h of heat stress. The time course of the ABL effect was also assessed by varying the length of incubation of HT29 cells with 80 μg/ml ABL from 0–24 h before heat shock. The cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and fixed overnight with 3.5% paraformaldehyde (w/v) and 0.1% Triton-100 (v/v) in PBS at 4 °C (18Velazquez J.M. Lindquist S. Cell. 1984; 36: 655-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The fixed cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and then washed with PBS containing 1% BSA (w/v) and 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% normal rabbit serum (v/v) for 1 h at room temperature. Mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes Hsp73 (Sigma) (1:50 dilution with 1% BSA (w/v) in PBS) or mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody to inducible Hsp72 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:200 dilution with 1% BSA (w/v) in PBS), was applied and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. After four washes with PBS, anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC (Sigma) (1:50 dilution with 1% BSA (w/v) in PBS) was then applied and reacted in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, 2 times with 1% BSA (w/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), PBS, and 3 times again with PBS. The glass coverslips were mounted (Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence H-1000, Vector, Burlingame, CA), and photographs were taken with incident illumination in a fluorescence microscope (Polyvar, Reichert-Jung, Austria).Conjugation of NLS Peptide with BSAA peptide containing the SV40 large T antigen wild type NLS CGGGPKKKRKVED with the N-terminal C providing a thiol group for conjugation and the GGG acting as a spacer was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and pentafluorophenyl ester on a PerSeptive 9050 synthesizer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Hertford, UK) using standard protocols. Before conjugation, BSA (5 μg/ml) was activated by incubation for 90 min at room temperature in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, containing a 100-fold molar excess of sulfosuccinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane 1-carboxylate (Pierce and Warriner, Chester, UK) (19Gorlich D.S. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Excess cross-linker was removed by gel filtration on a PD10 column containing 9.1 ml of Sephadex-G25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activated BSA solution was added to a 30-fold molar excess of NLS peptide. The pH was adjusted to 7.5, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C. Uncoupled peptide was removed by gel filtration on a PD10 column equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl. The molar ratio of coupling was 20–30 peptides/BSA molecule as estimated from the electrophoretic mobility. For fluorescein conjugation, carboxyfluorescein-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Boehringer Mannheim) was dissolved in Me2SO and then added to peptide-BSA solution in 0.2 m NaHCO3 at a 2:1 molar ratio to BSA. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, free fluorescein was removed by gel filtration on a PD10 column. The resulting conjugates were freeze-dried, dissolved in 150 mmNaCl, and kept at −80 °C.Preparation of Cytosol Fractions for Nuclear Protein ImportSubconfluent HT29 cells (108) were collected by scraping with a rubber policeman and washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g. The cells were then washed once with 10 mm HEPES-HCl buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The cell pellet was gently resuspended in 1.5 volumes of 5 mm Hepes-HCl buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 10 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm cytochalasin B, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) and kept for 15 min on ice before homogenization by 30 strokes in a No. 2 bulb homogenizer (Jencons Scientific Ltd. Leighton Buzzard, UK). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed extensively against transport buffer (20 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was 10–20 mg/ml.Cell Permeabilization and in Vitro Nuclear Protein ImportCell permeabilization and nuclear protein import was carried out by a modification of the method described by Adam et al. (20Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). HT29 cells cultured in glass chamber slides (Nunc, Kamstrup, Denmark) were first rinsed in cold transport buffer and then permeabilized in 40 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) in transport buffer for 6 min at 4 °C. After extensive washes with ice-cold transport buffer, transport mixture (final volume 140 ml) was applied (20% cytosol fraction, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 2 mm BSA-NLS-fluorescein in transport buffer). The chamber slides were maintained on ice during the procedure. The protein transport reaction was started by transferring the chamber slides into a 30 °C incubator and, after 30 min, was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer.For the ABL inhibition experiment, before the addition of the NLS-BSA-fluorescein, the permeabilized cells were first incubated with ABL (0–100 μg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of cytosol fraction and ATP-regenerating system as above. Substitution of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 100 μg/ml) for ABL acted as a positive control for this experiment. The cells were then washed extensively with transport buffer, and the slides were mounted and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Polyvar, Reichert-Jung, Austria) with a 25× objective.Effect of ABL on Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK (ERK-1 and ERK-2)) Nuclear TranslocationHT29 cells were cultured in 8-well glass chamber slides (Nunc) for 24 h. After 1 wash with PBS, the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM containing 250 μg/ml BSA for a further 24 h before the addition of 40 μg/ml ABL (the same volume of PBS was added to control wells). Six h later, 20% FCS (v/v) was added to each well for 20 min. The cells were quickly rinsed once with PBS and fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. The cells were blocked with 1% BSA (w/v) in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with 1.5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal antibody to phosphorylated MAPK (Promega Ltd, Southampton, UK) in 1% BSA (w/v), 0.25% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), PBS for 4 h (the same volume of 1% BSA (w/v), 0.25% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), PBS was added to control cells but without anti-MAPK antibody). After 6 washes with PBS, biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:250 dilution in 1% BSA (w/v) in PBS) (Sigma) was applied for 1 h followed by incubation of the cells with avidin-FITC conjugate (1:200) (Sigma) for 1 h in the dark. After washing with PBS, the cells were visualized and photographed using a fluorescent microscope (Polyvar, Reichert-Jung, Austria) with a 25× objective.Quantification of Relative Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fluorescence by Confocal MicroscopyQuantification of apparent nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescent ratios was achieved using Kinetic Imaging Lucida software (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK). From each cell in randomly chosen fields, a 2-μm-thick confocal slice centered on the nucleus was obtained. The nucleus and whole cell sections were carefully traced using the “lasso” function of the kinetic imaging software. At least 20 cells were analyzed for each datum point.RESULTSComparison of Effects of Free and Conjugated ABL on HT29 Cell ProliferationTwenty μg/ml free ABL produced 81% inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA in HT29 colon cancer cells (Fig.1). When ABL was immobilized by conjugation to agarose, no significant inhibitory effect was seen at concentration up to 100 μg/ml ABL (Fig. 1), suggesting that the lectin has to be internalized to have its inhibitory effect on proliferation. Minimum concentrations of ABL conjugates capable of agglutinating type O human red blood cells were free ABL (2 μg/ml) and FITC-ABL (4 μg/ml).As a prelude to electron and confocal microscopic studies of intracellular trafficking of the lectin, FITC- and gold-conjugated ABL were also assessed for their effects on agglutination and proliferation. Colloidal gold (10 nm)-conjugated-ABL (20 μg/ml ABL) had no significant effect on HT29 cell proliferation (Fig. 1), but at this concentration, the gold-ABL conjugate had only weak agglutinating ability (see below). Higher concentrations of gold-ABL were not attainable. In contrast, FITC-conjugated ABL (20 μg/ml ABL) produced 49% inhibition of HT29 cell proliferation (Fig. 1). The minimum concentration of these conjugates capable of agglutinating red blood cells was 16 μg/ml for both gold- and agarose-ABL. Neither 10-nm colloidal gold alone nor FITC-BSA (20 μg/ml BSA) had any effect on HT29 cell proliferation. We next examined the intracellular fate of gold-ABL and FITC-ABL.Intracellular Trafficking of ABLElectron Microscopy StudiesInternalization of ABL by HT29 cells was demonstrated by electron microscopy in 10 separate experiments using 10-nm gold-conjugated ABL and also using fluorescein-conjugated ABL in view of the ability of the latter conjugate to inhibit proliferation. After incubation with HT29 cells for 1 h, gold-ABL was bound to the cell surface, and internalization had begun. The gold-ABL was aggregated in clathrin-coated pits and immediately beneath the plasma membrane in clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig.2 A). The cellular entry of gold-ABL also involved clathrin-independent pathways, because noncoated pits and pinocytotic vesicles also contained gold particles (Fig.2 A). A third mechanism of entry was macropinocytosis, recognized by association of the gold label with surface folds or villi and subsequent incorporation into vacuoles of 0.5 μm or more (result not shown). The gold-ABL extended beyond the system of early endosomes and was identified frequently within the endosomal carrier vesicles, often called multivesicular bodies (Fig. 2, B andD), which traffic to the late endosomal system (21Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Over a 12-h incubation, more lectin became internalized, but it remained within membrane-bound vesicles that were often found in close proximity to the nuclear envelope. In control cells incubated with 10-nm colloidal gold, no gold was found inside the cells (results not shown). A further series of experiments with both 5- and 10-nm colloidal gold-conjugated ABL confirmed localization within the lumen of vesicles that were often close to the nucleus, but for both particle sizes, there was no clear evidence of lectin outside vesicles. Studies of the fluorescein-conjugated lectin (Fig. 2, C, D, andE) yielded almost identical results, with prominent accumulation within multivesicular bodies, although there was possibly some fluorescein-conjugated lectin identified within cytoplasm close to these bodies.Figure 2Intracellular trafficking of gold-ABL and FITC-ABL. A, 10-nm colloidal gold-conjugated ABL internalized in clathrin-coated vesicles (thin arrow) and in pinocytotic vesicles (thick arrow) after a 2-h incubation with HT29 cells. B, gold-ABL seen in multivesicular bodies (arrow) after a 6-h incubation. C, FITC-ABL identified after a 1-h incubation using anti-fluorescein antibody and gold-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody with silver enhancement. Labeling is intense on the cell surface, and there is also evidence of internalization within vesicles. The fixation protocol (2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde) did not allow identification of clathrin coating. D, FITC-ABL identified within multivesicular bodies (24-h incubation). Some FITC-ABL is apparently in adjacent cytoplasm. E, FITC-ABL around the periphery of two large organelles containing heterogenous inclusions in close proximity to the nuclear membrane (24-h incubation). HT29 cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM containing 250 μg/ml BSA with 5 μg/ml 10-nm colloidal gold ABL or 40 μg/ml FITC-ABL for up to 24 h, and then the cells were fixed, and 90-nm sections were cut and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Bar, 0.15 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Confocal MicroscopyAfter a 1-h incubation of the cells with 20 μg/ml FITC-ABL, strong cell surface and intracellular fluorescence was observed (Fig. 3 A). By 3 h, accumulation of fluorescence around the nucleus was seen in the majority of cells in each of 12 independent experiments (Fig. 3,B–D). In all cells, punctate intracellular FITC-ABL fluorescence was seen, but in addition, a ring of perinuclear fluorescence was observed. We then compared the intracellular trafficking of TRITC-dextran, a marker of fluid phase endocytosis (22Steinmam R.M. Mellman I.S. Muller W.A. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), with that of FITC-ABL. Both conjugates were clearly internalized. However, the TRITC-dextran fluorescence was always punctate and showed no overlap with the distribution of FITC-ABL (Fig. 3 E). These results suggested that FITC-ABL internalization is receptor-mediated rather than occurring via fluid phase endocytosis.Figure 3Intracellular trafficking of FITC-ABL and TRITC-dextran in HT29 cells. Fluorescence image of the cells assessed by confocal microscopy after incubation of the cells with 20 μg/ml FITC-ABL for 1 (A), 3 (B), and 6 (C) h. After a 1-h incubation (A), ABL fluorescein is mainly seen in association with cell membranes but with some internalization. After 3 (B) and 6 (C) h, it shows perinuclear accumulation. D shows phase contrast image. E shows a dual image of FITC-ABL and TRITC-dextran 4 h after addition to the cells at 2 μg/ml and 0.15 μg/ml, respectively. The staining patterns are clearly distinct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of ABL on the Nuclear Import of Heat Shock Protein 70 in Live CellsThe perinuclear accumulation of FITC-ABL raised the possibility that the inhibitory effect of ABL on cell proliferation might be the consequence of interaction with the protein import machinery of the nuclear pores. To test this hypothesis, the effect of ABL on nuclear import of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was studied. Hsp70 is produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in response to environmental changes such as heat stress. There are two forms of Hsp70, one (Hsp73) is constitutively expressed, whereas the synthesis of the other (Hsp72) is induced by heat shock from existing mRNAs (23Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 959-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). During heat stress, both forms of the Hsp70 are imported into the nucleus, whereas a small quantity remains cytoplasmic (18Velazquez J.M. Lindquist S. Cell. 1984; 36: 655-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23Pelham H.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 959-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). During recovery from heat stress, Hsp70 leaves the nucleus and becomes distributed throughout the cytoplasm (18Velazquez J.M. Lindquist S. Cell. 1984; 36: 655-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).As expected, Hsp73 became concentrated in the nuclei of the control cells after 1 h of heat shock at 43 °C (Fig.4 A , a). However, when the cells were pretreated with 40 μg/ml ABL for 6 h, Hsp73 remained in the cytoplasm after the same heat shock (Fig.4 A, b). To rule out the possibility that this effect might be because of the inhibition of Hsp73 synthesis by ABL, a parallel experiment was performed in which the cells were cultured in the presence or abse"

The present study examines the interaction between PYK2 and p130Cas (Crk-associatedsubstrate), suggested to be part of the signaling pathway initiated by osteoclast adhesion. Using murine osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) and their mononuclear precursors (pOCs), generated in a co-culture of bone marrow and osteoblastic MB1.8 cells, we show that: 1) p130Cas is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon adhesion of pOCs to vitronectin or ligation of β3 integrins; 2) p130Cas colocalizes with PYK2 and the cytoskeletal proteins F-actin, vinculin, and paxillin in the podosomal-rich ring-like structures of OCLs plated on glass and in the sealing zone in actively resorbing OCLs on bone; 3) p130Cas and PYK2 form a stable complex in pOCs, independent of tyrosine phosphorylation of either molecule, and this complex is present in Src (−/−) OCLs, in which neither protein is phosphorylated or associated with the osteoclast adhesion structure; 4) the association of p130Cas and PYK2 is mediated by the SH3 domain of p130Cas and the C-terminal domain of PYK2. These findings suggest that p130Cas and its association with PYK2 may play an important role in the adhesion-dependent signaling that leads to cytoskeletal reorganization and formation of the sealing zone during osteoclast activation.

PYK2 is highly expressed in brain and various hematopoietic cells (3Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol.

In addition, stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 and complex formation between PYK2 and Src via the SH2 domain of Src, leading to activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway (9Dikic I.

This unique structure suggested that p130Cas may serve as a docking protein for multiple SH2 and SH3 domain-containing molecules. In addition, p130Cas is tyrosine-phosphorylated during integrin-mediated adhesion and localizes to focal adhesions in fibroblasts (15Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PYK2 was shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with p130Cas upon B cell adhesion to fibronectin and stimulation of the antigen receptor (10Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts are highly differentiated bone resorbing cells. Osteoclast activation is initiated by adhesion to bone matrix and formation of the sealing zone, a specialized adhesion structure responsible for the tight attachment of osteoclasts to mineralized bone matrix (20Lakkakorpi P. Tuukkanen J. Hentunen T. Järvelin K. Väänänen K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Lakkakorpi P.T. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found that PYK2 is highly expressed in osteoclasts and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon integrin-mediated adhesion and is activated by osteoblastic MB1.8 cells, which are essential for osteoclast function in vitro (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23Wesolowski G. Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nagy R.M. Tezuka K. Tanaka H. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PYK2 localizes to podosomes, the primary adhesion structures in osteoclasts which become the sealing zone in actively resorbing osteoclasts (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We also showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas is involved in the organization of the podosome-rich ring structures in osteoclasts (24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas was markedly reduced in osteoclasts derived from Src(−/−) mice, in which osteoclast activity is severely compromised (24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that p130Cas participates in adhesion-mediated signaling in osteoclasts. p130Cas is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon β3-integrin engagement by ligand binding or antibody-induced clustering. In osteoclasts, p130Cas is stably associated with PYK2, via the SH3 domain of p130Cas and the C-terminal domain of PYK2, independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, p130Casco-localizes with PYK2 in the sealing zone of resorbing osteoclasts on bone. These findings suggest that the engagement of β3-integrin initiates the activation of the p130Cas·PYK2 complex which plays a role in osteoclast activation. Fibronectin was from NY Blood Center (New York, NY); vitronectin and laminin were from Life Technologies, Inc.; and collagen was from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Anti-PYK2 and anti-p130Cas polyclonal antibodies were developed as described (15Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol.

Heterozygote Src(+/−) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and Src(−/−) mice were phenotypically distinguished from their Src(+/?) siblings by lack of tooth eruption. All animals were cared for according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Guide. Prefusion osteoclasts (pOCs) were prepared as described previously (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T.

Briefly, mouse bone marrow cells were co-cultured with osteoblastic MB1.8 cells for 5–6 days in the presence of 10 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3. pOCs were released from dishes with 10 mm EDTA after removing MB1.8 cells with collagenase-dispase. Alternatively, the co-cultures were kept for 7–8 days to achieve multinucleated osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) and purified as described (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Src(−/−) and Src(+/?) OCLs were obtained from co-cultures of MB1.8 cells and spleen cells isolated from 2–3 wk old Src(−/−) or their normal littermates as described above. After isolation, pOCs (105cells/plate) were washed twice with serum-free α-minimal essential medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and kept in suspension or allowed to attach to polystyrene dishes, coated with ECM proteins (fetal bovine serum, fibronectin (25 μg/ml), vitronectin (10 μg/ml), osteopontin (50 μg/ml), laminin (25 μg/ml), type I or type IV collagen (25 μg/ml)). After 5–60 min at 37 °C, an equal volume of 2× TNE lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm NaVO3, 20 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the plates. Clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and -blotting. Alternatively, pOCs were allowed to attach to vitronectin-coated plates in serum-free medium for the indicated times and then fixed and stained for TRAP as described (24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Numbers and area of attached pOCs were measured using the Empire Imaging Analyzing Systems (Milford, NJ). Results are expressed as the means (± S.E.) of four fields for the number of attached cells and of more than 300 cells for the area of pOCs. Lysates were separated on a 4–20% gradient or 8% SDS-PAGE (Novex, San Diego, CA), and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) overnight. After blocking with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detected with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were precleared with Sepharose-4B and precipitated with anti-PYK2 polyclonal antibodies or anti-p130Cas monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, respectively. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with lysis buffer (5×), followed by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and stained as described above. Antibody-induced clustering in pOCs was performed as reported (25Greenberg S. Chang P. Silverstein S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3897-3902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell suspensions (1 × 106cells/ml) were incubated with various anti-β subunit antibodies at 25 μg/ml, 4 °C for 30 min, washed twice with ice-cold serum-free medium containing 100 μm Na3VO4, and incubated with 50 μg/ml goat F(ab′)2 anti-rat IgG or anti-hamster IgG at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and proteinase inhibitors) and subjected to immunoprecipitation and blotting as described above. These experiments were performed with GST-fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of Fyn, Lyn, Src, PI3-kinase, and p130Cas or the kinase and N- and C-terminal domains of PYK2. OCLs lysates (1 mg/ml) were incubated with GST-fusion protein coupled with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed (3×) with lysis buffer and with phosphate-buffered saline (1×), and precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-PYK2 or anti-p130Cas antibody. pOCs were seeded on glass coverslips or on bone slices together with 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated MB1.8 cells. At the indicated times, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stained using polyclonal anti-PYK2, poly- or monoclonal anti-p130Cas, anti-vinculin and anti-paxillin antibodies, followed with the appropriate secondary antibodies, or with FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Immunofluorescent stainings were viewed with a fluorescence microscope or with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany), equipped with a multiline Omnichrome argon-crypton laser (Chino, California) (26Lakkakorpi P.T. Helfrich M.H. Horton M.A. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 663-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of p130Cas and PYK2 in osteoclasts was examined using Western blot analysis. Both pOCs and multinucleated OCLs express significant levels of p130Casand PYK2 similar to that of IC-21 macrophages (Fig.1 A). We have previously found that the osteoblastic MB1.8 cells do not express detectable levels of PYK2 (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The effect of adhesion on p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was examined in isolated pOCs, which can be reseeded on various ECM proteins in the absence of serum. Attachment to vitronectin, osteopontin, fibronectin, and serum stimulated p130Castyrosine phosphorylation, whereas lower levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in pOCs adhering to type I or type IV collagen, or to laminin (Fig. 1 B). Relative to pOCs maintained in suspension, p130Cas was tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner upon attachment to vitronectin. An increase in p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was detected within 5 min of seeding and reached the maximum around 30 min (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, pOC attachment to vitronectin-coated plates appears to precede the peak phosphorylation of p130Cas (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas may play a role in the cytoskeletal organization of osteoclast precursors upon adhesion. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation parallels to the time course of osteoclast spreading (Fig. 2 C). Matrix preferences for inducing p130Cas phosphorylation suggested a selective integrin-mediated phenomenon. Osteoclasts express αvβ3-, αvβ1-, and α2β1-integrins (26Lakkakorpi P.T. Helfrich M.H. Horton M.A. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 663-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Davies J. Warwick J. Totty N. Philp R. Helfrich M. Horton M. J.

Immature osteoclast precursors were shown to express β2- and β5-integrins (30Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Tanaka S. Murakami H. Owan I. Tamura T. Suda T. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31Teitelbaum S.L. Tondravi M.M. Ross F.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Integrin involvement and specificity for p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was examined by antibody-mediated clustering of integrins in pOCs in suspension. Clustering with anti-β3-antibody strongly induced p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas clustering with anti-β1- or anti-β2-antibody induced low levels of p130Cas phosphorylation in pOCs (Fig.3), indicating that the vitronectin receptor αvβ3 is the major integrin responsible for this effect. Clustering of β5-integrin was not examined in this study because antibodies that recognize the extracellular domain of the murine β5-integrin are not available. Because β3-mediated adhesion is thought to be involved in osteoclast activation, the subcellular localization of p130Cas was examined in OCLs plated on glass coverslips and on bone. On glass coverslips, p130Cas was localized in podosomes (Fig. 4) and, along with F-actin, organized in a typical podosomal-rich adhesion structure at the periphery of OCLs (24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Double staining of p130Cas and PYK2 in OCLs on glass showed that p130Cas also co-localized with PYK2 (Fig. 4). On mineralized bone matrix, osteoclasts polarize and form the sealing zone that circumscribes the resorptive ruffled border membrane, where protons and proteases are secreted. Sealing zone formation can be followed using vinculin immunostaining to visualize the transition from small rings in podosomes to a double circle structure in the mature sealing zone (21Lakkakorpi P.T. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Similarly, on bone, p130Cas localized in OCLs to podosomes and to the nascent sealing zone, as well as to the double circle structure in the mature sealing zone (Fig. 5 A). p130Cas also co-localized with the cytoskeletal proteins F-actin, vinculin, and paxillin (Fig. 6). The distribution of paxillin (Fig. 6 h), shown here for the first time in osteoclasts on bone, follows the staining pattern of vinculin. However, in resorbing OCLs, p130Cas also co-localized with PYK2 in the nascent sealing zone, as well as in the mature sealing zone (Fig. 5 B). This morphological evidence for the co-localization of p130Cas and PYK2 in osteoclastsin vivo supports a role for p130Cas in the morphological changes associated with osteoclast activity.Figure 5Characteristic patterns of p130Cas localization in OCLs on bone, and its co-localization with PYK2. pOCs were cultured with MB1.8 cells on bone in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 to obtain resorbing OCLs.

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments show association of p130Cas with PYK2 in pOCs in situ (Fig. 7). Furthermore, this association was present both in suspended and attached cells (Fig. 7), suggesting that it is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. This was confirmed in Src(−/−) osteoclasts. Src has been implicated in p130Cas and PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and osteoclast function is severely compromised in Src(−/−) mice (9Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 32Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). As observed previously, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 immunoprecipitated from Src(−/−) OCLs is markedly reduced, although the same level of PYK2 is expressed in Src(−/−) and Src(+/?) OCLs (Fig. 8) (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a comparable level of p130Cas was immunoprecipitated with PYK2 from both Src(−/−) and Src(+/?) OCLs (Fig. 8, middle panel). We previously reported the expression of both p130Cas isoforms (Cas A and B) in Src(−/−) OCLs, as compared with the predominant expression of Cas B in Src(+/?) OCLs. Both isoforms of p130Cas appeared to associate with PYK2 in Src(−/−) OCL lysates (Fig. 8, middle panel). Furthermore, treatment of Src(+/?) OCLs with cytochalasin D for 20 min caused dephosphorylation of PYK2 and dissociation of the Src and PYK2 complex (Fig. 8, bottom panel) but had no significant effect on the association of p130Cas with PYK2 (Fig. 8, middle panel). These results indicate that the association of p130Cas and PYK2 is not dependent on an intact cytoskeleton or on c-Src function in osteoclasts. To characterize the domains that mediate the association of p130Cas with PYK2, GST-fusion proteins encoding for SH3 domains from various signaling molecules, as well as the kinase and N- and C-terminal domains of PYK2 were incubated with lysates prepared from OCLs. GST-fusion protein encoding the SH3 domain of p130Cas binds to PYK2 from OCL lysates, whereas the GST-fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domains of Src, Lyn, Fyn, or PI3-kinase or GST alone do not bind to PYK2 in OCL lysates (Fig.9 A). On the other hand, the GST-fusion protein encoding the C-terminal domain of PYK2, but not the kinase or N-terminal domains or GST alone, interacts with p130Cas (Fig. 9 B). Lysates from attached OCLs were used for this experiment, and the p130Cas that associated with the C-terminal domain of PYK2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas can associate with PYK2. Bone resorbing osteoclasts are highly differentiated cells specialized in the digestion of mineralized matrix. Osteoclast activation is initiated by recognition of and adhesion to the bone surface, followed by cellular polarization and formation of the sealing zone, a specialized membrane structure mediating tight adhesion between the osteoclast cell membrane and the bone surface. It is well documented from pharmacological studies that αvβ3, the major integrin in osteoclasts, is important for osteoclast function (27Davies J. Warwick J. Totty N. Philp R. Helfrich M. Horton M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1817-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Sato M. Sardana M.K. Grasser W.A. Garsky V.M. Murray J.M. Gould R.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). αvβ3 mediates osteoclast adhesion to several RGD matrix proteins including vitronectin, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and fibronectin (35Helfrich M.H. Nesbitt S.A. Dorey E.L. Horton M.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although αvβ3 localizes to podosomes, the initial adhesion structure in osteoclasts (26Lakkakorpi P.T. Helfrich M.H. Horton M.A. Väänänen H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 663-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zambonin-Zallone A. Teti A. Grano M. Rubinacci A. Abbadini M. Gaboli M. Marchisio P.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the presence of this integrin in the mature sealing zone in resorbing osteoclasts is controversial (26Lakkakorpi P.T.

The signaling mechanisms regulating the adhesion-dependent activation of osteoclasts are not well understood. We have recently found that PYK2 is the major adhesion kinase in osteoclasts, which undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon β3-integrin engagement and that localizes to the sealing zone (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similarly, p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with the formation of the podosomal-rich adhesion structures in osteoclasts plated on glass or on plastic culture dishes (24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that both PYK2 and p130Cas may be involved in the adhesion-dependent signaling that mediates cytoskeletal organization in osteoclasts. This is further supported by the present study which shows that both p130Cas and PYK2 are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon pOC adhesion to the same ECM proteins and with a similar time course. In addition, p130Cas, similar to PYK2, is highly tyrosine-phosphorylated in pOCs upon β3-integrin clustering by either ligand engagement or antibody cross-linking. However, whereas PYK2 appears to be selectively tyrosine-phosphorylated upon clustering of the β3-integrin (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation is also induced, albeit to a lower level by other osteoclast integrins including β1 and β2-integrins. The adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in osteoclasts is consistent with findings in other cell types although the kinetics are slightly different. In fibroblasts (17Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and primary chicken embryo cells (15Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), maximal phosphorylation was seen at 15–20 min, whereas in osteoclasts, optimal phosphorylation is not reached until after 30 min, paralleling the time course of osteoclast spreading. The preferences for ECM proteins is also different, osteopontin, vitronectin, and fibronectin in osteoclasts rather than primarily fibronectin in fibroblasts. β3seems to be the major integrin that mediates these effects in osteoclasts. We further examined the localization of p130Cas in osteoclasts and found it to be present in podosomes, where it co-localizes with PYK2 and cytoskeletal proteins. More importantly, it colocalizes with PYK2 in the sealing zone. During bone resorption, osteoclast adhesion to bone matrix leads to reorganization of cytoskeletal structures and formation of the sealing zone, a tight attachment between the osteoclast plasma membrane and bone matrix, with specific organization of F-actin and associated proteins, such as vinculin and talin (21Lakkakorpi P.T. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Initial formation and accumulation of podosomes precedes these changes (21Lakkakorpi P.T. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this study, we localized p130Cas by confocal microscopy in resorbing osteoclasts on bone and found it is present in the newly forming sealing zone and mainly at the edges (the double circle structure) of mature sealing zones. In these structures, p130Cas colocalizes with vinculin and paxillin and as mentioned with PYK2. Together with our recent results on PYK2 (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), these findings strongly suggest that p130Cas and the p130Cas·PYK2 complex play a role in the cytoskeletal reorganization and formation of the sealing zone during osteoclast activation. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of p130Cas and PYK2 in osteoclasts shows stable association of the two proteins. This resembles the association of p130Cas with FAK (15Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 18Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and is consistent with recent findings in B cells (10Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Using GST-fusion proteins, this association was found to be mediated by the SH3 domain of p130Cas and the C-terminal domain of PYK2, similar to the association of p130Cas with FAK (15Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with recent findings by Ohba et al. (39Ohba T. Ishino M. Aoto H. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), showing that the first proline-rich sequence in the C-terminal domain of PYK2 can bind SH3-domain of p130Cas. Interestingly, SH3 domains of Src, Fyn, Lyn, or PI3-kinase did not bind to PYK2, suggesting preferential interaction of the SH3 domain of p130Cas with PYK2. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and PYK2 are not necessary for the association of these two molecules. This was further confirmed using osteoclasts derived from Src(−/−) mice, in which tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and p130Cas (24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) are markedly reduced, but p130Casstill associates with PYK2. Interestingly, p130Casassociation with FAK was not readily detected in lysates from Src(−/−) fibroblasts. This association was found to be mediated by the N-terminal fragment of c-Src which includes its SH3 and SH2 domains (40Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), suggesting that c-Src serves as an adapter for the p130Cas-FAK interaction (40Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that in osteoclasts p130Cas and PYK2 associate in the absence of c-Src but do not localize to the podosomes and ring-like structures (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that c-Src may be necessary in osteoclasts for the integrin-mediated activation of the p130Cas·PYK2 complex required for its recruitment to the adhesion structures. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas·PYK2 complex could regulate and possibly enhance downstream signaling events initiated by β3-integrins ligation in osteoclasts. In osteoclasts, c-Src is highly expressed and is essential for osteoclast function (32Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). Src-deficient mice have an osteopetrotic phenotype caused by nonfunctional osteoclasts (32Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The majority of c-Src is localized in the osteoclast ruffled border and in vacuoles rather than in the sealing zone (41Horne W.C. Neff L. Chatterjee D. Lomri A. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 42Tanaka S. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Fukui Y. Kurokawa T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction of c-Src and the p130Cas·PYK2 complex precedes formation of the actin ring and sealing zone. However, the direct involvement of c-Src in this process is clearly indicated by our recent findings showing adhesion-induced association of PYK2 with c-Src in osteoclasts (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and PYK2 phosphorylation by c-Src in vitro. In addition, both PYK2 and c-Src were shown to translocate to the cytoskeleton upon osteoclast adhesion (22Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 43Lakkakorpi P.T. Wesolowski G. Zimolo Z. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), pointing to Src interaction with PYK2 in vivo. Furthermore, integrin-mediated p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation is substantially diminished in both Src-deficient fibroblasts and osteoclasts (19Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, c-Src was shown to bind directly to p130Cas (44Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), suggesting that p130Cas could be a substrate of c-Src in vivo. In human B cells, PYK2 phosphorylates p130Cas following β1-mediated stimulation (45Astier A. Manié S.N. Avraham H. Hirai H. Law S.F. Zhang Y. Golemis E.A. Fu Y. Druker B.J. Haghayeghi N. Freedmen A.S. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19719-19724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that cooperation between PYK2 and Src kinases may be required for the complete phosphorylation of p130Cas, which is probably involved in downstream signaling. In summary, the findings presented here show adhesion- and β3-integrin-mediated, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas in osteoclasts with similar kinetics as recently shown for PYK2. Furthermore, p130Casand PYK2 are stably associated via the SH3 domain of p130Cas and the proline-rich C-terminal domain of PYK2, independent of tyrosine phosphorylation or c-Src. Finally, p130Cas localizes to podosomes and the sealing zone, the functionally important adhesion structures in osteoclasts, where it co-localizes with PYK2. Taken together these findings suggest a role for p130Cas and the p130Cas·PYK2 complex in the c-Src and adhesion-dependent signaling that leads to osteoclast activation, cytoskeletal reorganization, and formation of the sealing zone.

In this study, transposon mutagenesis of an unencapsulated strain yielded an encapsulated mutant.

Inactivation of the putative sensor gene, csrS, in three different unencapsulated strains yielded encapsulated mutant strains.

The putative response regulator, CsrR, was partially purified and was shown to bind the has operon promoter fragment. The affinity and specificity of CsrR for the fragment were increased significantly after incubation with acetyl phosphate. DNase I footprinting determined that the acetyl phosphate-treated CsrR was binding to key sequences in the promoter and the coding region of hasA.

The Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes are the cause for many suppurative infections of the skin and throat, as well as the nonsuppurative sequelae of rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Strains of GAS which lack M-protein are more readily destroyed in the presence of phagocytes than strains with M-protein (1Perez-Casal J. Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar studies have shown that the presence of a hyaluronic capsule inhibited phagocytosis and increased the virulence of GAS during invasive infection (2Schmidt K.H. Gunther E. Courtney H.S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 184: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Wessels M.R. Goldberg J.B. Moses A.E. DiCesare T.J. Infect.

Increased isolation of mucoid strains of GAS from human outbreaks of rheumatic fever as well as severe invasive infections suggests that capsule production may be an important virulence factor in these diseases (5Johnson D.R. Stevens D.L. Kaplan E.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, production of hyaluronic acid by GAS is apparently important in the initial stages of colonization of the upper respiratory tract of intranasally inoculated mice (6Wessels M.R. Bronze M.

Immun. 1997; 65: 1422-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This evidence is supported by the observation that hyaluronic acid can function as an adhesin capable of binding to CD44 on keratinocytes found on the pharyngeal mucosa and skin (8Schrager H.M.

Its structure is chemically indistinguishable from hyaluronic acid found in the connective tissues of its hosts. Production of hyaluronic acid by GAS occurs only at the exponential phase of growth and is lost at the stationary phase. This loss of production has been correlated with a loss of synthase activity from membranes of GAS isolated at the stationary phase (9van de Rijn I. Kessler R.E. Infect. Immun. 1979; 26: 883-891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes required for hyaluronic acid production are encoded in the has operon. These enzymes arehasA (encodes the hyaluronic acid synthase) (10DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28676-28680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression of the has operon is under the control of a single promoter identified upstream of hasA (11Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Crater D. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, this operon is highly conserved among GAS regardless of capsule phenotype (15Crater D. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As shown by Crater and van de Rijn, the simultaneous detection of the has operon mRNA transcript and hyaluronic acid during the exponential growth phase of encapsulated strains but not unencapsulated strains suggests that transcriptional mechanisms control hyaluronic acid production (15Crater D. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The expression of the M-protein as well as many of the secreted extracellular products of GAS is controlled at the transcriptional level by the trans-activator Mga (16Simpson W.J. LaPenta D. Chen C. Cleary P.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 696-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Perez-Casal J. Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 18Podbielski A. Flosdorff A. Weber-Heynemann J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 9-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A decrease in transcription of hasA in a strain of GAS in which the gene encoding Mga (mga) was inactivated indicated that Mga may be involved in has operon regulation (19Cleary P.P. McLandsborough L. Ikeda L. Cue D. Krawczak J. Lam H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, Perez-Casalet al. (17Perez-Casal J. Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) reported no effect on hyaluronic production after inactivation of mga. Recently, Alberti et al. (20Alberti S. Ashbaugh C. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) defined strain-specific cis-acting sequences within the promoter region of hasA which affected capsule gene expression, thus implying that differences observed in capsule expression among strains of GAS are related to individual promoter structure and strength. However, the data could not completely rule out that trans-acting factors may play a part in regulation as well (20Alberti S. Ashbaugh C. Wessels M.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, no consistent evidence exists correlating atrans- or cis-acting factor with the transcriptional regulation of the production of hyaluronic acid. This report describes the identification of two genes encoding a putative two-component system that influences the production of hyaluronic acid by GAS. Inactivation of these genes converted the previously unencapsulated strains (B931, D471, and GT8760) to encapsulated strains. Further analysis of these two genes determined that inactivation of the putative sensor in the two-component system was sufficient for converting an unencapsulated strain of GAS into an encapsulated strain. In addition, the product of the gene encoding the putative response regulator was partially purified, and after the protein was treated with acetyl phosphate it was shown to bind specifically to regions within the promoter and coding region ofhasA. The streptococcal strains used in this study (B931(T2), D471(T6), S43(T6), B915(T49), 5-19(T3), GT8760(T49), and WF51(T18)) as well as the strains generated (B931EnTn916, B931ΔcsrS, D471ΔcsrS, and GT8760ΔcsrS) were grown in chemically defined medium (21van de Rijn I.

The bacteria were transferred onto a filter (0.45 μm; Millipore; Bedford, MA) and then grown on THY agar plates with defibrinated sheep's blood (2%). The filters were incubated overnight at 37 °C after which the bacteria were washed from the filter with chemically defined medium, and aliquots of this suspension were plated on Todd Hewitt yeast blood plates supplemented with tetracycline (5 μg/ml) and streptomycin (1 mg/ml). Transductants were screened for capsule production by direct microscopic observation and India ink staining. To confirm that the transposon insertion was the cause of the observed mutation, generalized transductions were conducted using the GAS phage A25 as described by Caparon and Scott (29Caparon M. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was digested withHindIII, separated on a 0.5% agarose gel, and transferred to Zeta-Probe® GT Genomic Tested Blotting Membranes (Bio-Rad) via capillary action. DNA-DNA hybridization between the DNA blotted on the membrane and the probe DNA was conducted according to the Genius System (Boehringer Mannheim) with the following modifications. After incubation with anti-digoxygenin alkaline phosphatase antibody, the membrane was washed with 1 × Post-SAAP (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 10, 0.1 m NaCl) for 20 min, four times, with 5-min washes with distilled water between each wash. Hybridization was detected by incubation of the membrane with disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenylphosphate (Boehringer Mannheim) for 15 min at 37 °C, and bands were visualized by exposure of the membrane to BioMax 228 MR film (Eastman Kodak) at room temperature. Capsule production was initially detected by India ink staining (30van de Rijn I. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of hyaluronic acid production was conducted using a colorimetric assay described previously by Moses et al. (31Moses A.E. Wessels M.R. Zalcman K. Alberti S. Natanson-Yaron S. Menes T. Hanski E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 64-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that chemically defined medium was used as the growth medium instead of THY because THY contains interfering substances. Chromosomal DNA from strains being analyzed was purified, digested withHindIII, and analyzed by Southern blotting to determine the size of the two fragments of Tn916 generated. The digested DNA was run on a 0.5% agarose gel, and the desired fragments of DNA were extracted from the gel using the Qiagen Qia-Quick system. The extracted DNA was ligated and purified, and primers specific for a site at the left end of Tn916 (D224; Table I) and the region flanking the HindIII site (D225; Table I) were used to amplify the DNA adjacent to the insertion site via PCR. The standard conditions used for PCR in these studies were as follows: 8 μl of 20 mm MgSO4, 5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer without MgSO4 for pwo polymerase, 5 μl of a 10 μm stock of the oligonucleotide primers, 5 μl of the ligated DNA, 4 μl of a 10 mm stock of dNTPs, 18 μl of deionized water, and 0.26 μL of pwo polymerase. Using a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus), the region was amplified for 35 cycles using the following conditions: melting temperature (95 °C) for 45 s, annealing temperature (47 °C) for 30 s, and extension temperature (72 °C) for 2 min. The PCR product was sequenced at the WFUBMC Sequencing Laboratory using the primer D224 (Table I). The sequence obtained was analyzed using the data base of the M1 streptococcus DNA sequence at the University of Oklahoma Advanced Center for Genome Technology (www.genome.ou.edu). A shuttle vector for allelic replacement of a portion of the second open reading frame in the potential two-component system was generated by amplifying two regions, approximately 1 kb in size, flanking the replacement site (via PCR) and ligating them into the allelic replacement vector pFW6. This PCR amplification required the oligonucleotide primers D231and D232 (TableI) for generation of the region upstream of the replacement site and D233b and D234 (Table I) for generation of the region downstream of the site. The standard conditions for PCR for these studies were used except with the following changes: melting temperature (95 °C) for 1 min, annealing temperature (52 °C) for 1 min, and extension temperature (72 °C) for 1 min; 35 cycles. The upstream and downstream fragments were cloned into the MCSI and MCSII sites of pFW6, respectively, and electroporated into streptococci using a method described previously (32Ricci M.L. Manganelli R. Berneri C. Orefici G. Pozzi G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 119: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on Todd Hewitt yeast blood plates with spectinomycin 100 μg/ml. Using a fragment specific for the region targeted for allelic exchange withincsrS, double and single crossovers were confirmed by Southern analysis. The DNA for this probe was amplified using primers D239 and D240 (Table I). Standard conditions for PCR were used except for the following changes: annealing temperature (60 °C) for 1 min and extension temperature (72 °C) for 1 min; 35 cycles. Cytoplasmic extracts from strains being analyzed were prepared (11Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and assayed for the ability to bind to the promoter region of the has operon using a protocol described previously by Chodosh (33Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 1-10Google Scholar). The following modifications were made. Reaction conditions for the crude extracts and the radiolabeled DNA fragment included (in a final volume of 10 μl) extract (2–30 μg), 2 fmol of 32P-radiolabeled DNA fragment, 2 μg of poly(dA-dT), 60 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithioerythritol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of crude extracts to the reaction mixture and were incubated for 15 min at 15 °C. Next, the DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis through a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm borate, and 2 mm EDTA) buffer. Gels were run for 40 min at 200 volts (constant voltage, 4 °C) and transferred to and dried upon 3MM Whatman paper (80 °C). Finally, the dried gel was subjected to autoradiography using BioMax 228 MR film. The radiolabeled DNA fragment was generated using the primers D48 and D55 (Table I). The PCR conditions for generating this DNA fragment were as follows: 8 μl of 20 mm MgSO4; 5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer without MgSO4 for pwopolymerase; 3 μl of a 10 μm stock of the oligonucleotide primers; 1 μl of individual 10 μmstocks of dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP; 0.5 μl of a 10 μm stock of dATP; 1 μl of a 1:10 dilution of B931 chromosomal DNA; 25 μl of deionized water; and 2 μl of [α-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci mmol−1, 10 μCi μl−1; ICN; Costa Mesa, CA). The DNA fragment was amplified for 35 cycles using the following conditions: melting temperature (95 °C) for 30 s, annealing temperature (53 °C) for 35 s, and extension temperature (72 °C) for 25 s. After completion of amplification free unlabeled radionucleotide was removed using a G-50 spin column (5′ – 3′, Inc.; Boulder, CO). The radioactivity of the DNA fragment was measured in a liquid scintillation counter, and the DNA was stored at −70 °C until used. To clonecsrR into the expression vector pET-11a, csrR was amplified using the oligonucleotide primer D241 to incorporate anNdeI site at the 5′-end of csrR and the primer D242 to incorporate a BamHI at the 3′-end. The standard PCR conditions were used with the following changes: annealing temperature (58 °C) for 1 min and extension temperature (72 °C) for 55 s. The 696-bp PCR product was subjected to T4 polynucleotide kinase to phosphorylate the ends to prepare them for ligation into theEcoRV-digested plasmid pBluescript. Once subcloned,csrR was removed from pBS-csrR by digestion withNdeI and BamHI and was then ligated intoNdeI/BamHI-digested pET-11a to create pET-11a-csrR. Finally, the pET-11a-csrR plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)(pLysS) to overexpress the protein using the T7 promoter expression system (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET-11a was used as a negative control. After the plasmids were transformed into E. coli, a microcolony from each transformation was transferred to 5 ml of TYPG and grown at 37 °C to an OD600 = 0.7. A 1-ml sample of this culture was removed to represent a preinduction culture, while the remaining culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. This culture was incubated for 3 additional h, and a 1-ml sample was taken. The pre- and postinduction samples were sedimented at 13,000 × gfor 10 s, and the pellet was suspended in 150 μl of TE. A nonreducing sample buffer was added to the samples and boiled for 10 min in a water bath. Aliquots of each sample were removed and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel via electrophoresis (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) to confirm expression of CsrR. To generate a large preparation of the overexpressed CsrR, 125 ml of TYPG was inoculated with 1 ml of a culture (OD600 = 0.7) containing BL21 (DE3)(pLysS) (pET-11a-csrR or pET-11a) and grown to an OD600 = 0.8 before induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The induced culture was grown for 3 h postinduction, and then the cells were sedimented at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The cells were suspended in 10 ml of the following buffer: 0.05m NaH/KH2 phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Cells were lysed with a French press (12–14,000 p.s.i.), and the membranes were sedimented at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was retained (cytoplasmic extract) and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay. For the EMSA analyzing the binding activity of the CsrR, ammonium sulfate precipitation was used as described by Scopes (34Scopes R.K. Cantor C.R. Protein Purification: Principles and Practice. Springler-Verlag, New York1994: 347-348Google Scholar) to partially purify CsrR from the E. coli cytoplasmic extracts. Each fraction was dialyzed at 4 °C with the above buffer using Spectrapor® membrane tubing (Spectrum Medical Industries, Los Angeles) with a molecular mass cutoff of 12,000–14,000 kDa. Extracts were stored at 4 °C after dialysis. The partially purified CsrR and control extracts from E. coli (0.2–6 μg) were treated with acetyl phosphate as described by McCleary (35McCleary W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were treated with 32 mm acetyl phosphate in a phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithioerythritol) for 75 min at 37 °C and then were analyzed using EMSA as described above. The final volume for each reaction was 6 μl prior to the addition of 4 μl of the EMSA mixture buffer (described above). To footprint the promoter of the has operon with the partially purified CsrR, the 220-bp fragment extending from −80 to +140 (strain B931) of hasA was used. To label the DNA fragment, the 220-bp fragment was digested with EcoRI, and the end was labeled with the Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. Free, unlabeled radionucleotide was removed using a G-50 spin column (5′ – 3′, Inc.). The DNA fragment was purified by phenol chloroform extraction and concentrated via ethanol precipitation. To ensure purity, the DNA fragment was electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel, excised, and eluted from the acrylamide in a solution of 0.5 m ammonium acetate and 1 mmEDTA, pH 8. Ethanol precipitation was used to concentrate the DNA fragment after elution. The radioactivity of the DNA fragment was measured in a liquid scintillation counter, and the DNA was stored at −70 °C until used. For each reaction, 15,000–20,000 cpm of the DNA fragment was used. First, 0.5 μg of each extract was reacted with or without acetyl phosphate as described above. Next, the 6-μl reaction containing the acetyl phosphate-treated protein was added to 44 μl of a reaction buffer containing 1× EMSA buffer, 2 μg of poly(dA-dT), and the radiolabeled DNA fragment. The binding reactions were conducted using the same conditions as described for EMSA. After incubation, 50 μl of a solution containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm CaCl2 was added to each reaction. A 1:100 dilution of RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega) was added to each tube and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. After 2 min, 100 μl of a stop solution (1% SDS, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 4 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA) was immediately added to each tube and mixed. Finally, each sample was purified via phenol chloroform extraction and concentrated via ethanol precipitation. After drying, the DNA was suspended in a 1:1 dilution of the stop solution from the Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were heated for 10 min at 65 °C and run on a sequencing gel adjacent to a sequencing ladder of the region being analyzed. The sequencing was conducted using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gel was transferred to and dried upon 3MM Whatman paper and subjected to autoradiography using BioMax 228 MR film. As shown previously by Crater and van de Rijn (15Crater D. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the has operon is controlled at the transcriptional level. To determine if unencapsulated strains of GAS may have trans-acting factors that repress the expression of the has operon, an unencapsulated GAS strain, B931, was mutagenized using Tn916 transposon mutagenesis. Using the enterococcal strain CG110 as the donor and a streptomycin-resistant derivative of GAS strain B931 as the recipient, the conjugative transposon Tn916 was transferred via filter matings. Of the resulting transconjugants, one transconjugant (B931EnTn916) was encapsulated and was isolated for further study. This mutant excluded the capsule stain India ink, and this exclusion was lost in the presence of the enzyme hyaluronidase. Unencapsulated transconjugants were also analyzed and did not exclude India ink. To confirm that the capsule produced by the transconjugant B931EnTn916 was hyaluronic acid, the hyaluronic acid content of both the parent strain and the mutant strain was examined. The actual amount of a cell-associated and total (bound plus secreted) hyaluronic acid was determined, and the values are presented in TableII. As shown, mutant strain B931EnTn916 produced hya"

To explore these observed effects, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of recombinant factor XIII A2 in the presence of calcium, strontium, and ytterbium. The main calcium binding site within each monomer involves the main chain oxygen atom of Ala-457, and also the side chains from residues Asn-436, Asp-438, Glu-485, and Glu-490. Calcium and strontium bind in the same location, while ytterbium binds several angstroms removed. A novel ytterbium binding site is also found at the dimer two-fold axis, near residues Asp-270 and Glu-272, and this site may be related to the reported inhibition by lanthanide metals (Achyuthan, K. E., Mary, A., and Greenberg, C. S. (1989) Biochem. J. 257, 331–338). The overall structure of ion-bound factor XIII is very similar to the previously determined crystal structures of factor XIII zymogen, likely due to the constraints of this monoclinic crystal form. We have merged the three independent sets of water molecules in the structures to determine which water molecules are conserved and possibly structurally significant.

This activity was first recognized while studying blood coagulation; fXIII was required to form an insoluble clot (1Laki K. Lorand L. Science. 1948; 108: 280Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The activated form of fXIII covalently cross-links two fibrin molecules via an isopeptide bond between the side chains of a glutamine and a lysine located in the C-terminal region of the γ-chain. Over a longer time period in coagulation, it also forms cross-links between the α- and γ-chains of fibrin (2Lewis K.B. Teller D.C. Fry J. Lasser G.W. Bishop P.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and between α2-anti-plasmin and fibrin (3Ichinose A. Tamaki T. Aoki N. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). fXIII has been shown to react with more than fibrin (4Muszbek L. Ádány R. Mikkola H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 357-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and it has recently been found in brain tumors (5Bárdos H. Molnár P. Cdécsei G. Ádány R. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 536-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and arthritic joints (6Carmassi F. De Negri F. Morale M. Song K.Y. Chung S.O. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and there are cases of fXIII deficiencies (7Kitchens C.S. Newcomb T.F.

Factor XIII is a member in the family of transglutaminases (TGases), which have a wide range of biological functions (9Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). factor XIII transglutaminase root mean square deviation 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid factor XIII transglutaminase root mean square deviation 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Like most coagulation factors, fXIII is synthesized as a zymogen and then cleaved by a protease to become an active enzyme. The structure of fXIII zymogen was determined several years ago (10Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this crystal form, the active site cysteine, Cys-314, is inaccessible to solvent and is not available for catalysis. Physiologically, calcium ions are required for fXIII activation and for TGase activity. In the blood, activation of circulating fXIII requires thrombin cleavage, calcium ions (1.5 mm) (12Curtis C.G.

Curtis C.G. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). High levels of calcium (>50 mm) can activate fXIII without the use of thrombin (15Credo R.B. Curtis C.G. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and it has recently been shown that platelet fXIII can be activated nonproteolyticallyin vivo (16Muszbek L. Haramura G. Polgár J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence, the calcium binding site was predicted to be in a region (residues 468–479) with high similarity to the EF-hand motif (17Takahashi N. Takahashi Y. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8019-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Ichinose A. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5829-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The main calcium binding site, as seen in the preliminary crystallographic study (19Yee V.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Pedersen L.C. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), involves residues Asn-436, Asp-438, Ala-457, Glu-485, and Glu-490. C-terminal truncation experiments removing several residues from the calcium binding pocket show a total loss of enzymatic activity (20Lai T.S. Achyuthan K.E. Santiago M.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24596-24601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the glutamate residues in the calcium binding region of guinea pig liver TGase decreases its sensitivity to calcium, while maintaining some enzymatic activity (21Ikura K. Yu C. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Furuyoshi S. Kawabata N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). There is further in vitro evidence that calcium and other divalent cations have effects on proteolytic susceptibility (22Mary A. Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and heat stability (23De Backer-Royer C. Meunier J.C. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Several lanthanide ions have been shown to replace calcium ions during fXIII activation (10–40 μm). Furthermore, these lanthanide ions can inhibit fXIII activity when the ion concentration is greater than 40 μm (24Achyuthan K.E. Mary A. Greenberg C.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Most of these effects occur when the calcium ion is in the millimolar range, and with the lanthanide ion in the micromolar range. We have solved the structures of recombinant fXIII zymogen complexed with calcium, strontium, and ytterbium to determine the structural effects of these cations on fXIII. The goal in using the latter two cations was to positively identify the electron-rich ions in the electron density maps. All three ions bind to the same pocket. We have found an additional ytterbium binding site, hypothesized to be the lanthanide inhibition site. Crystals of recombinant human factor XIII A2 (166 kDa) (25Bishop P.D. Teller D.C. Smith R.A.

The crystals show the symmetry of space group P21 with two monomers in the asymmetric unit. The ion-bound crystals were obtained by soaking zymogen crystals for 1–2 days in 90 mm CaCl2, 120 mmSrCl2, or 2 mm YbCl3 in an artificial mother liquor of 1,2-propanediol (24%) and MES buffer at pH 6.2. Data for the calcium soaked crystal were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beamline 9–1 with a MAR image plate detector at −170 °C. For the strontium and ytterbium crystals, data were collected in-house at room temperature on an R-AXIS IIc image plate detector equipped with a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator.

Our previously refined P21fXIII zymogen structural model was used to generate initial phases for all three ion-bound structures. The initial R (Σ ‖‖F obs‖ − ‖F calc‖‖/Σ ‖F obs‖) was 48.2%, 36.8%, and 31.0% for the calcium, strontium, and ytterbium structures, respectively. The calcium refinement began with a series of rigid body minimization steps at 8–3.5 Å resolution using X-PLOR (26Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3 (1): A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The first rigid body refinement used two monomers, while the next was composed of the eight domains; finally, a refinement with 193 secondary structure elements (helix, strand, loop) was performed. After those three steps, theR had dropped from 48.2% to 32.9%. This multistep rigid body procedure was used because of the cryogenic data collection and higher initial R factor. This rendered a 2.3% lowerR factor than if a simple two-monomer rigid body step was used. From here, the resolution was expanded to 2.2 Å in six steps by alternating rigid body (with 193 groups) and positional least square refinements. The R dropped to 27.9% with anR free of 38.6%. Simulated annealing with slow cooling from 2000 to 300 K, followed by a round of positional andB value least squares minimization gave a drop inR of 0.4% and R free of 1.6%. Refinement continued through several rounds of map fitting with the program XtalView (27McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar) and least squares and dynamics minimization. The program DDQ (28van den Akker F. Hol W.G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used to assess model and map quality during the refinement procedure. Waters were added at positions with difference electron density peaks greater than 3.0 ς, which also were within hydrogen bonding distance of the protein or other waters. In the end, the structure was refined with overall anisotropic scaling of the data along with a bulk solvent model and a resolution of 20.0–2.1 Å; this resulted in an R of 22.7% and R freeof 31.2%, with a total of 1001 waters (Table I). The strontium and ytterbium refinements were carried out over the resolution range of 10–2.5 Å for all steps. The X-PLOR refinement began with a positional and individual B value minimization of the starting model, which lowered the R to approximately 27%, and was followed by adding two ions per dimer at the highest peaks in the difference map (Table II). It then proceeded through more cycles of least squares minimization and manual map fitting in the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). In the ytterbium refinement, three additional 10–12 ς difference peaks were observed near the non-crystallographic two-fold axis within the dimer, and three ions were added (sites 3, 4, and 5). Furthermore, one additional Yb3+ ion was added at a 10 ς difference peak (site 7), which is located at a crystallographic contact with another dimer. Following refinement of these four ions in the structure, one more difference peak appeared on the two-fold axis, so another ytterbium ion was added (site 6). After further refinement and map fitting, the R decreased to 19.8% (strontium) and 22.0% (ytterbium), and waters were placed at chemically reasonable 3 ς difference peaks. Additionally, a strong difference peak about 2 Å away from the main Yb3+ (site 2) in monomer B was identified, and a new Yb3+ ion (site 8) was added with an occupancy of 0.25, while the occupancy of the original Yb3+ion was reduced to 0.75. Several more rounds of least squares refinement, map fitting, and water addition led to a final Rof 18.3% and 18.8%, an R free of 27.5% and 28.1%, and 230 and 265 waters for the strontium and ytterbium complexes, respectively (Table I).Table IIStatistics for the cationsIonSite no.Initial peak height observed inF o - F c map (ς)Final peak height for F o - F c omitaThe omit map is constructed from the final refined structure which contains all atoms except the ion being measured.map (ς)Refined B (Å2) for ionOccupancy of ionB (Å2) of water at same locationCalcium13.89.1591.02324.611.1451.014Strontium17.821.6521.02bThe refinement program (X-PLOR) was configured such that 2.0 Å2 is the lower limit on B values.25.624.3461.02Ytterbium111.736.8551.02211.036.5360.752312.219.3170.252411.616.7230.252510.115.8230.25263.9cThis peak was only observed after other Yb3+ ions (1–5 and 7) were included in the refinement and map calculation.20.8100.252710.016.2640.50588.1dThis was the value observed with Yb3+ ions (1-7) already included in the structure and map calculation.14.1350.256a The omit map is constructed from the final refined structure which contains all atoms except the ion being measured.b The refinement program (X-PLOR) was configured such that 2.0 Å2 is the lower limit on B values.c This peak was only observed after other Yb3+ ions (1–5 and 7) were included in the refinement and map calculation.d This was the value observed with Yb3+ ions (1Laki K.

Each monomer of fXIII in the dimer has 731 residues and consists of four domains: the β-sandwich, the catalytic core, and barrels 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). The active site residues Cys-314, His-373, and Asp-396 are not accessible to solvent, as in the zymogen structure. The calcium binding site is located in the core domain, near the surface of the protein. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between all atoms from the strontium- and ytterbium-bound structures compared with the starting ion-free fXIII zymogen structure is less than 0.85 Å. The calcium structure, on the other hand, differs from the two cation structures and the starting structure with an r.m.s.d. of 1.1 Å. This higher atomic coordinate deviation is likely due to the cryogenic data collection for the calcium structure. Due to uninterpretable electron density, the monomers are missing various numbers of residues from the N terminus (residues 1–8), the linker between the activation peptide and the β-sandwich (residues 30–43), the region between the core and barrel 1 (residues 508–516), and the C terminus (residues 728–731). Most of the residues were well resolved, with 90% having average B values of less than 60 Å2. Less than 0.4% of the torsion angles are in the forbidden regions of the Ramachandran diagram, as reported by PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Three peptide bonds in each monomer are in thecis conformation (10Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One involves a proline residue, 410–411, and the other two do not, 310–311 and 425–426. The structures are reasonable as judged by DDQ (28van den Akker F. Hol W.G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 206-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Verify3D (34Eisenberg D.

Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). The main ion binding site is near the interface between the catalytic core and barrel 1 (Fig. 1), and the ion binding helix (residues 485–501) is in contact with the other monomer. The calcium and strontium atoms superimpose within this site, while the main ytterbium ion is 2.7 Å from their location (Fig.2). The mean peak sizes in an early difference map were about 4, 7, and 11 ς for the calcium, strontium, and ytterbium ions, respectively (TableII). When water molecules replaced the calcium ions at these positions, their B values refined to about 14–23 Å2. However, for the strontium and ytterbium sites, the B values of the replaced water molecules refine down to 2 Å2, the minimum allowable value. This analysis implies that a water molecule in this location does not have enough electrons to adequately match the strontium and ytterbium x-ray diffraction data. The main cation site consists of a pocket with negatively charged side chains of Asn-436, Asp-438, Glu-485, and Glu-490 plus the main chain oxygen of Ala-457. All three ion-bound structures and the zymogen structure overlap quite closely in this region (Fig. 2). TableIII lists the oxygen atoms that are potentially involved in coordinating each cation. The main chain oxygen from Ala-457 is the main protein ligand for the Ca2+ and Sr2+ ions, as indicated by its low B value and its distance from the metals. The Yb3+ ion is farther from Ala-457 and closer to Glu-485 and Glu-490. The B values for the residues in the region from 484 to 490 are higher than average, and the electron density is weak.Table IIIThe distance and B value of all oxygen atoms within 4.0 Å of the specified ion of each siteResidueAtomMonomer AMonomer BDistance (Å)B (Å2)Distance (Å)B (Å2)CalciumAla-457O2.7742.62.5442.8Glu-485OE13.9475.5Wat-62LO2.2654.1Wat-402LO3.8189.2Wat-744LO2.8946.5Wat-745LO2.1438.9Wat-5LO2.6228.6Wat-23LO2.9069.9Wat-243LO2.8347.1Wat-300LO3.6663.8Wat-746LO2.5230.4StrontiumAsn-436O3.9421.9Asn-436OD13.4841.7Ala-457O2.5736.12.7029.0Glu-485OE13.6367.52.8671.2Glu-485OE23.9069.8Ytterbium(¾ Occ.)aThese refer to the strong and weak ytterbium ions, which are modeled as 0.75 and 0.25 occupancy, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The ion site in monomer B of the calcium structure has six putative ligands arranged in a distorted bipyramidal arrangement (Fig.3). One protein atom (O–Ala-457) and up to five waters are within 4.0 Å of the ion. Residues Asp-438, Asn-436, and Glu-490 are hydrogen-bonded to several of these waters. Fewer waters were identified in the strontium and ytterbium structures due to the lower resolution data. The ytterbium ion has one monodentate (Asn-436) and two bidentate (Glu-485, Glu-490) ligands provided by the protein and nearby water molecules. The ion site in monomer B of the ytterbium structure has two alternate positions for the Yb3+ ion 1.8 Å from each other. The occupancies for each ion were chosen such that they refined to equal B values and summed to 1. It is unlikely that the weaker Yb3+ ion (site 8) is a negative chloride ion because it is very close to the position of the positive calcium ion from the calcium structure, which implies that its location is suitable for only positive ions. The ligand distances between the Yb3+ ion and the oxygen atoms are as low as 1.98 Å, but this is consistent with other Yb3+-oxygen distances, as observed in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1CNT (37McDonald N.Q.

Four large electron density peaks near the non-crystallographic dimer two-fold axis form a nearly perfect tetrahedron with an edge length of approximately 3.6 ± 0.1 Å (Fig. 4 and Table II). Furthermore, a similar tetrahedron is observed in the ytterbium soak of the orthorhombic crystal form (10Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) of fXIII (data not shown). After modeling four ytterbium ions at 0.25 occupancy into the electron density, the B values refined to 17, 23, 23, and 10 Å2. Placing waters at full occupancy in these locations gave B values that refined to 2 Å2. No ions or solvent molecules exist in the same location in the Ca2+- or Sr2+-bound crystal structures. Residues Asp-270, Asp-271, and Glu-272 of each monomer are in this region, but the electron density does not specify one distinct conformation for the side chains, and the B values are quite high. After the refinement of the three structures, waters were grouped into subsets based on their occurrence in each crystal. If waters from different structures were located within 2.4 Å from each other, they were considered equivalent, and given the same chain identification and residue number in the Protein Data Bank files. In some cases, the determination of equivalent waters was made on the basis of their B values and local protein differences between structures. A Venn diagram was constructed (Fig.5) showing the seven different subsets from the three independent groups. If a water from one structure had no equivalent waters from another structure, it was given a particular chain identifier (L for calcium, R for strontium, Y for ytterbium). If a water molecule was in only two different structures, it was given the same residue number and chain identification (U for calcium and strontium, V for calcium and ytterbium, W for strontium and ytterbium). Finally, water molecules that exist in all three structures were given the chain identification of S along with the same residue number. The average and standard deviation of B values and Cβ density for the water molecules are presented in TableIV. The Cβ density (41Sippl M.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 473-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) estimates the amount of burial at each water site by counting the number of Cβ atoms within 10 Å of the water site. It has a numerical range of 2–30 atoms, which qualitatively ranges from highly exposed to deeply buried.Table IVWater subsets: average B values and Cβ densitiesWater subsetCa, Sr, and YbCa and SrCa and YbSr and YbCa onlySr onlyYb onlyPDB chain IDSUVWLRYNumber of H2O7968118137367055Ca2+ structure:〈B〉 Å236 (12Curtis C.G.

Water molecules that are present in all three structures (subset S) have B values about 10 Å2 lower than unique waters. Likewise, these common waters are more buried, as shown by the 50% larger number of nearby Cβ atoms. Calcium and other cations have definite effects on fXIII behavior in solution. The ion soaking concentrations in the calcium and strontium crystals were above the level at which conformational changes, such as enzyme activation, are expected. No significant conformational differences between the ion complex and the zymogen structure are seen. Two complementary reasons for this lack of conformational change are: 1) the active conformation of the enzyme cannot pack in this crystal form, and 2) some other molecule, such as a substrate or inhibitor, is required to stabilize fXIII in its active form. Packing interactions in the monoclinic crystal form restrict any major conformational changes induced in fXIII. Crystallization of thrombin cleaved fXIII in the presence of 1.5 mm calcium has resulted in the same crystal form and the same conformation (42Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Thromb. Res. 1996; 78: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, co-crystallization of 45 mm CaCl2with fXIII has yielded this monoclinic crystal form with the same conformation (43.Pedersen, L. C., X-ray Structure Determination of Factor XIII.Ph.D. dissertation, 1994, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.Google Scholar). Structurally, one residue that must move to expose the active site Cys-314 is Tyr-560, located in barrel 1. In this space group, barrel 1 is trapped in place by crystal contacts. We therefore believe that this crystal form is incompatible with the active form of fXIII. The biochemical experiments used to demonstrate the effects of calcium and other cations on fXIII use either a substrate or inhibitor to measure whether the enzyme is active. We propose that one of these molecules is another requirement for the stabilization of the active form. In the presence of calcium, the inactive form of fXIII is in equilibrium with the active conformation. During crystallization, the inactive form is more likely to be crystallized; thus, mass action causes any active fXIII to change to its inactive conformation. The presence of a substrate or inhibitor might stabilize the active conformation further and allow crystallization in a new crystal form. This proposal is in line with the known effect of fibrin(ogen) in facilitating the activation of fXIII (14Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6175-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 44Greenberg C.S. Achyuthan K.E. Fenton II, J.W. Blood. 1987; 69: 867-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some ideas about calcium activation can be gained from the location of the main binding site with respect to other features on the molecule. First, the calcium binding pocket is only 10 Å from barrel 1, which is responsible for partially blocking the active site via Tyr-560. The bound ion may induce some dynamical changes in nearby barrel 1, including exposure of the active site. Additionally, one end of the calcium binding helix forms close contacts with the other monomer. This may allow for allosteric communication between the calcium binding site of one monomer and the active site of the other, as described by Hornyak and Shafer (14Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6175-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The residues involved in calcium binding are well conserved within the TGase family. The coordination geometry for the calcium and strontium is not ideal; many of the putative ligands are water molecules, and the metal-ligand distances are somewhat longer than observed for calcium complexes in other proteins (45McPhalen C.A. Strynadka N.C.J. James M.N.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 77-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Table III). The B values for these residues are not much different from those observed for the ion free structures. These observations are consistent with fXIII's millimolar binding affinity (15Credo R.B.

The Yb3+ ion, which binds more tightly, is in a slightly different location and has more coordinating protein atoms with fewer water ligands. This ion has a smaller radius and has a higher charge than divalent cations, so the fact that it has a different binding location is not unreasonable. The four ytterbium ions on the dimer two-fold axis are modeled with ¼ occupancy each. The interatomic distances are too small to allow multiple positively charged ions to be present concurrently. They are time and space averaged throughout the crystal so that only one ion is in the site at any given time. This multiplicity of the ion has made it difficult to model the protein ligands. We postulate that this tetrahedron of partial occupancy ions is the lanthanide inhibition site. Achyuthan et al. (24Achyuthan K.E. Mary A. Greenberg C.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have observed that the addition of lanthanide ions above 40 μmto thrombin-cleaved fXIII results in the non-competitive inhibition of fXIII. This inhibition cannot be reversed by a 200-fold molar excess of calcium ions. Furthermore, when the level of the lanthanide ion is between 10 and 40 μ m, fXIII can be activated by thrombin cleavage as in the presence of calcium. These results (24Achyuthan K.E. Mary A. Greenberg C.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) could be explained by multiple lanthanide binding sites. The main ion site, observed in all three ion-bound structures, is required for proper thrombin activation, and the novel Yb3+ site, which has a slightly weaker affinity, is responsible for the inhibition of fXIII. Given the soaking concentration of 2 mm in this data set, both ions sites are filled. Functionally, the location at the dimer interface could potentially destabilize the quaternary structure. Additionally, the residues that form the lanthanide inhibition site (Asp-270 to Glu-272) are only 5 residues away from Trp-279, which may play an important role in catalysis (11Pederson L.C. Yee V.C. Bishop P.D. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Stenkamp R.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Grouping the waters into subsets based on their presence in multiple structures has been helpful in identifying structurally significant waters. One example is that of water 6059S (Fig. 6). This water in the core domain binds to several residues that are fully conserved in the TGase family (Thr-466, Lys-467, Arg-333, and Tyr-204). The water is located at the separation fork of a pair of β strands. One half of each strand forms a paired sheet, and the other half of each strand diverges nearly at a right angle. Furthermore, these strands are linked with functionally important parts of the protein. One strand pairs with the strand containing the active site His-373; and the other strand contains a ligand (Ala-457) for the calcium binding site. Monomer B also contains a water molecule in this location (6009S). We believe this water is structurally important for maintaining the unique conformation of this pair of strands. Many other waters in this subset S are contacting conserved residues in this protein, and it is possible that some of these waters may help to explain natural fXIII deficiency mutations or other interesting structural and evolutionary features. In fact, of the 18 identified missense mutations (46Mikkola H. Palotie A. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 47Anwar R. Stewart A.D.

The probability of this happening by chance is 5%. There are no major conformational changes between the different ion-bound fXIII structures and the zymogen. This is likely due to crystal packing interactions and the lack of a substrate or inhibitor molecule to stabilize the active conformation. The location of the main ion binding site provides ideas about the mechanism of calcium activation, such as its proximity to barrel 1 and its contact with the other monomer. The novel ytterbium binding site, on the dimer two-fold axis, could be responsible for the biochemically observed lanthanide inhibition. The procedure of finding common waters between the structures is a new method for identifying particular waters and residues that may be structurally significant and important for the function of fXIII. Overall, these three structures positively identify the calcium binding site in factor XIII."

The gene encoded a protein consisting of 444 amino acid residues, corresponding in size to the large subunit of previously reported Rubiscos. Rubisco of P. kodakaraensis KOD1 (Pk-Rubisco) showed only 51.4% similarity with the large subunit of type I Rubisco from spinach and 47.3% with that of type II Rubisco from Rhodospirillum rubrum, suggesting that the enzyme was not a member of either type. Active site residues identified from type I and type II Rubiscos were conserved. We expressed the gene in Escherichia coli, and we obtained a soluble protein with the expected molecular mass and N-terminal amino acid sequence. Purification of the recombinant protein revealed thatPk-Rubisco was an L8 type homo-octamer.Pk-Rubisco showed highest specific activity of 19.8 × 103 nmol of CO2 fixed per min/mg, and a τ value of 310 at 90 °C, both higher than any previously characterized Rubisco. The optimum pH was 8.3, and the enzyme possessed extreme thermostability, with a half-life of 15 h at 80 °C. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the gene was transcribed inP. kodakaraensis KOD1. Furthermore, Western blot analysis with cell-free extract of P. kodakaraensisKOD1 clearly indicated the presence of Pk-Rubisco in the native host cells."

The PTHrP NTS bears some similarity to both the lysine-rich bipartite sequences seen in proteins such as nucleolin (8Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the arginine-rich sequence in the retroviral protein Tat (9Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that mediates binding of the protein to RNA as well as nucleolar targeting. The PTHrP NTS also contains, at its amino terminus, a lysine-rich motif similar to the consensus core that has been identified in numerous double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (10Kharrat A.

Xiu X. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As such, they are prominent in interphase cells undergoing rapid protein synthesis and disappear as distinct entities in mitotic or metabolically inactive cells. Morphological analysis at electron microscopic resolution defines the nucleolus as a membrane-free organelle containing regions of varying electron density (12Warner J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In previous work, we localized PTHrP, by immunoelectron microscopy, to the dense fibrillar component of nucleoli in tissue sections from fetal rat bone (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This region represents complexes of newly transcribed 45 S rRNA and protein that are subsequently processed and assembled into ribosomes. The complex series of events involved in ribosome biogenesis depends on the presence of numerous nucleolar proteins that have known RNA binding properties. In a manner similar to protein/protein interactions and protein/DNA interactions, the specific and stable association of RNA and protein is most often mediated through recognition motifs (13Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). In many cases, a larger module containing several repeats of shorter motifs is required for efficient interaction, whereas in other instances, a self-contained motif appears to be sufficient. Perhaps the best characterized and most widely recognized RNA-binding proteins are those that contain multiple copies of either ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (14Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) or K homology (KH) domains (15Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Heringa J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These modules stretch over 80–100 amino acids and are often found in conjunction with RGG boxes (13Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Other proteins that have been loosely categorized on the basis of structural homology and potential biological function are those such as Tat that contain an arginine-rich motif. Yet another large (>300) group of loosely categorized proteins, to which TRBP (TAR-binding protein) (16Gatignol A. Buckler C. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), GCN2 (17Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8388-8395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) belong, are those that bind to double-stranded RNA. These proteins contain one or more copies of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding motif with a lysine-rich core. To extend our previous observations toward defining the role played by PTHrP in the region of the nucleolus engaged in rRNA synthesis and processing, we investigated the possibility that PTHrP binds RNA. We now demonstrate that both endogenous and transfected PTHrP proteins bind poly(G) homopolymeric RNA, GC-rich double-stranded RNA, and total cellular RNA. The interaction is of high relative affinity and is dependent on the presence of a core lysine motif shared with other RNA-binding proteins. The previously described plasmids pPTHrP/3 (rat PTHrP) and pΔ87–107PTHrP/3 (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) were modified to include an in-frame Myc tag. Oligonucleotides myctag 3 (5′-cggaattcgcgtctatggaacaaaagctgattagcgaagagg-3′) and myctag 4 (5′-ccgctcgagtcagttgttcaggtcctcttcgctaatcagc-3′) were used to generate a polymerase chain reaction product encoding the Myc epitope flanked by a 5′-EcoRI site and a 3′-XhoI site. After digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, the fragment was ligated into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3myc. Oligonucleotides myctag 1 (5′-cgggatcccacgatgctgcggaggctg-3′) and myctag 2 (5′-ggaattcatgcgtccttgagctggg-3′) were used to generate PTHrP DNA fragments with a 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-EcoRI site using pPTHrP/3 and pΔ87–107PTHrP/3 as templates. The fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pcDNA3myc. The resulting plasmids, PTHrPmyc and PTHrPmyc-NTS, were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutations were introduced into the target plasmid pPTHrP/3 using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following series of mutant cDNAs was generated with selectively altered residues within one of three distinct basic domains in the PTHrP NTS: M1,87GKKKK91 to 87GEEKI91, M2, 96KRREQ100 to96KGTEL100; and M3,102KKKRR106 to102IIERG106. The resulting cDNAs, M1PTHrP, M2PTHrP, and M3PTHrP, were modified to include an in-frame Myc tag as described above. Human FMR1 was used as a positive control to demonstrate binding to ribosomal RNA proteins (19Feng Y. Absher D. Eberhart D.E. Brown V. Malter H.E. Warren S.T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and all plasticware (Falcon) was from Becton Dickinson Labware (Lincoln Park, NJ). The PTr cell line (a kind gift of G. N. Hendy, Calcium Research Laboratory, Montreal, Canada) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and antibiotic/antimycotic. COS-1 cells were maintained and transfected as described previously using a mock transfection for control (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed with buffer for binding assays and immunoblot analysis. PTr cells plated at a density of 2 × 106/150 mm2 were grown to 80% confluence, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested by scraping into lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mmsodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 500 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation prior to use in binding assays. Transcription and translation were performed in vitro using pPTHrP/3 or pΔ87–107PTHrP/3 as a DNA template with the TNT T7 coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of plasmid DNA was added to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing T7 RNA polymerase and 500 μCi/ml [3H]leucine (ICN). 2 μl of the translation product was removed to represent the total cell lysate prior to dividing the remaining product equally for RNA binding experiments. Ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (20Wang L.L. Richard S. Shaw A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2010-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) using the following synthetic homopolymers: poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), poly(U), or double-stranded poly(G)·poly(C) and poly(dG)·poly(dC) coupled to Sepharose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed and reconstituted to 50% (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline. Binding reactions were carried out in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer containing 2 μl of in vitro translated product, 100 μg of total protein from transfected COS-1 cells, or 300 μg of total protein from PTr cells. Binding was performed at the indicated NaCl concentrations for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer prior to resuspension in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the nucleic acid by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed either by autoradiography or by immunoblot analysis. The polyclonal antiserum raised against rat PTHrP-(67–86) has been previously characterized (22Asa S.L. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D. Drucker D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 9E10, specific for the human c-Myc epitope (23Evan G.I. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 4: 2843-2850Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was harvested as ascites fluid from mice 7 days after implantation of the hybridoma (American Type Culture Collection). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera were purchased from Sigma (goat anti-mouse IgG) and Pierce (goat anti-rabbit IgG). Proteins denatured in Laemmli sample buffer were separated by size on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat milk protein in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight with either the anti-Myc or anti-PTHrP-(67–86) primary antibody. The protein bands were detected using an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cellular RNA was labeled by incubating HeLa cells, grown to 50% confluence, with 500 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) overnight (21Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were immunoprecipitated, with either control IgG or anti-Myc antibody, from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the various PTHrP constructs. 3 × 106 cpm of labeled RNA was incubated with the equivalent of one-third of a cell lysate for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. Immunoblot analysis of the counted samples was performed as described above using anti-Myc antibody to verify the expression level of the immunoprecipitated proteins. To examine the profile of RNAs recovered in the binding assays, bound RNAs, eluted from the precipitated proteins by denaturing in formamide buffer at 70 °C for 5 min, were subjected to formaldehyde-agarose electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was exposed to x-ray film overnight. An aliquot of unlabeled cellular RNA was run in the presence of ethidium bromide to identify 28 S and 18 S ribosomal bands on the membrane. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 87–107 of PTHrP (PTHrP NTS) or amino acids 281–301 of nucleolin (nucleolin NTS) were synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal biotin tag at the Sheldon Institute for Biotechnology (McGill University, Montreal). Competition assays were performed by incubating 2 μl of in vitro translated PTHrP with poly(G)-Sepharose in the presence of the peptides at concentrations of 10−7 to 10−3m. The bound proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. For the peptide binding studies, 10−7m biotinylated peptides were incubated either with poly(G)-Sepharose in lysis buffer containing up to 1000 mm NaCl or with poly(A)-, poly(C)-, or poly(U)-Sepharose in the presence of 250 mm NaCl. The beads were washed, and the bound peptides were eluted by heating in Laemmli sample buffer prior to separating on 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The peptides were detected by immunoblot analysis with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Stratagene). In previous studies, we identified sequence homology between amino acids 87–107 of the cellular protein PTHrP and amino acids 48–57 of the retroviral regulatory protein Tat (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the case of Tat, the same amino acids represent an arginine-rich RNA-binding motif. Taken together with our previous observation that PTHrP localizes to the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus, we sought to determine if PTHrP is an RNA-binding protein and if the interaction is mediated through its NTS. We first examined the possibility that transiently expressed PTHrP could associate with total cellular RNA. COS-1 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding full-length rat PTHrP with the Myc epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus (PTHrPmyc) to facilitate identification of the expressed protein. Lysates of PTHrPmyc-transfected or mock-transfected COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with control (IgG) or anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then incubated with32P-labeled total cellular RNA and washed, and the bound RNA was quantitated by scintillation counting. A significant proportion of the radiolabeled RNA was observed in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates of PTHrPmyc-transfected cells, but not in mock-transfected cells or IgG immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A). Immunoblot analysis of the counted samples was then performed, using anti-Myc antibody, to verify the equality of expression levels of the immunoprecipitated proteins (data not shown). To determine whether the PTHrP NTS was required for this interaction, we transfected COS-1 cells with an expression plasmid encoding PTHrPmyc devoid of the NTS (PTHrPmyc-NTS) and analyzed the lysates for RNA binding. Despite an equivalent level of PTHrP expression, Myc immunoprecipitates of PTHrPmyc−NTS-expressing cells showed no significant binding to radiolabeled RNA (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the NTS is required for the association of PTHrP with RNA. To investigate whether PTHrP, like many other RNA-binding proteins (13Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), associated with homopolymeric RNA, COS-1 cells expressing full-length PTHrPmyc were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), or poly(U) homopolymeric RNA covalently coupled to Sepharose beads. Immunoblot analysis of PTHrPmyc-expressing COS-1 cell lysates reproducibly demonstrated two to three distinct protein species that bound poly(G) homopolymeric RNA, but not poly(A), poly(C), poly(U), or Sepharose beads alone (Fig.1 B). The proteins most probably represent prepro-PTHrP and the mature protein. PTHrP protein devoid of the NTS (PTHrPmyc−NTS) was unable to associate with homopolymeric RNA (Fig. 1 B). To assess the relative affinity of the PTHrPmyc/RNA interaction, we performed binding studies in the presence of a high salt concentration, which has been shown in the past to disrupt nonspecific protein/RNA interactions (24Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The association between PTHrPmyc and poly(G)-Sepharose was stable and persisted at a salt concentration of 1m (Fig. 1 C). These data suggest that PTHrP is abona fide RNA-binding protein and that the association requires all or part of the NTS. To identify the species of RNA that bound to PTHrP immobilized on the Sepharose beads, the binding studies were repeated using total RNA harvested from32P-labeled HeLa cells and protein expressed in COS-1 cells from cDNAs encoding wild-type PTHrPmyc, PTHrPmyc−NTS, and human FMR1myc. RNAs eluted from the protein-bound beads were then subjected to formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2 A, ribosomal RNA species bound to both wild-type PTHrPmyc and human FMR1myc, but not to PTHrPmyc−NTS. Fig.2 B demonstrates immunoblot analysis of the proteins harvested from transfected COS-1 cells that were used for RNA binding. To further explore the apparent specificity of the interaction between PTHrP and poly(G) homopolymeric RNA, the PTr cell line was used as a source of endogenous PTHrP. Lysates of PTr cells were incubated with different homopolymeric RNAs conjugated to Sepharose beads, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with PTHrP-(67–86) antiserum. As was true of transfected PTHrP, endogenous PTHrP bound specifically to poly(G), but not to poly(C)-, poly(A)-, or poly(U)-Sepharose or Sepharose beads alone (Fig. 3 A). The bound protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa, and the association was capable of withstanding salt concentrations up to 1m, indicating that the interaction was specific and of apparent high affinity (Fig. 3 B). To define the minimum sequence within the NTS required for RNA binding activity, we tested several PTHrP constructs that contain mutations in this region (Fig.4 A). We have shown previously that mutation of 87GKKKK91 to87GEEKI91 (M1PTHrPmyc) effectively blocked the nuclear/nucleolar targeting function of the PTHrP NTS. Substitution of102KKKRR106 for102IIERG106 (M3PTHrPmyc) was only partially effective in this respect, and mutation of96KRREQ100 to96KGTEL100 (M2PTHrPmyc) had little or no effect on targeting the protein to the nuclear compartment (33Henderson J.E. He B. Karaplis A.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10 Suppl. 1: S286Google Scholar). To determine whether the proteins expressed from these cDNAs bound RNA, COS-1 cells were transfected with the expression vectors, and the lysates were used for homopolymeric binding studies. All of the proteins bound poly(G)-Sepharose at 250 mm salt, but considerable differences were observed at higher salt concentrations (Fig.4 B). The binding of both M1PTHrPmyc and M3PTHrPmyc to poly(G)-Sepharose was absent or severely impaired at 750 mmsalt, whereas the binding of M2PTHrPmyc was unaffected at that salt concentration (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that the overall composition of the basic residues in the NTS affects its interaction with poly(G) homopolymeric RNA. We also examined the ability of the mutant proteins to associate with total cellular RNA (Fig.4 C). M2PTHrPmyc and wild-type PTHrPmyc bound radiolabeled cellular RNA with similar apparent affinities. However, the ability of M1PTHrPmyc to bind RNA was severely impaired, and that of M3PTHrPmyc was partially impaired (Fig. 4 C). These observations were consistent with the data demonstrating compromised binding of the mutant PTHrPmyc proteins to poly(G)-Sepharose. We examined the possibility that the interaction between PTHrP and RNA was direct by incubating in vitro translated PTHrP with poly(G) RNA. Radiolabeled PTHrP was generated by incubating the full-length rat PTHrPmyc cDNA in the presence of [3H]leucine in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In vitro translated PTHrP bound poly(G)-Sepharose, and the binding persisted at a 1 m salt concentration (Fig.5 A), suggesting that the association between PTHrP and RNA was direct. The specificity of the association was then tested by performing competition binding studies in the presence of peptides corresponding to either the PTHrP NTS or the nucleolin NTS. Amino acids 87–107 of PTHrP and amino acids 281–301 of nucleolin are similar lysine-rich bipartite motifs that target the respective proteins to the nuclear compartment (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whenin vitro translated PTHrPmyc was incubated with poly(G)-Sepharose in the presence of the PTHrP NTS peptide at a concentration of 10−4m, the interaction between PTHrPmyc and RNA was effectively blocked (Fig. 5 B). The nucleolin NTS peptide, on the other hand, was ineffective in this capacity even at 10−3m (Fig. 5 B). The high concentration of peptide required to dislodge in vitro translated PTHrPmyc from poly(G) homopolymeric RNA was a further indication that the association was specific and of apparent high affinity. These competition data suggested that the PTHrP NTS peptide might bind RNA directly. This possibility was tested by incubating biotinylated PTHrP NTS peptide with the different homopolymeric RNAs. The bound peptides were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. As was true of the full-length protein, the PTHrP NTS peptide bound specifically to poly(G)-Sepharose beads (Fig. 5 C), and the binding withstood salt concentrations up to 1000 mm. The nucleolin NTS, on the other hand, was incapable of binding to any of the synthetic homopolymers. These experiments confirmed that the interaction between the PTHrP NTS and poly(G)-Sepharose was specific and direct and was not merely a function of its ionic strength. TRBP is one of a number of cellular proteins that associate with GC-rich double-stranded RNA, including the stem-loop structure formed by the Tat transactivating or TAR region of nascent viral RNA (16Gatignol A. Buckler C. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In view of the similarities between Tat and PTHrP, we investigated the possibility that PTHrP might also bind to GC polynucleotide sequences. In the presence of 250 mm salt, wild-type and mutant PTHrP proteins bound poly(G)·poly(C) RNA, but did not demonstrate significant binding to the corresponding deoxynucleotide sequences (Fig. 6 A). The association between poly(G)·poly(C) and PTHrP was maintained in the presence of 1m salt, indicating an apparent high affinity interaction (Fig. 6 B). The same pattern of compromised binding of M1PTHrPmyc and M3PTHrPmyc was observed with poly(G)·poly(C) compared with poly(G) alone, whereas M2PTHrPmyc had little effect. These data suggest that PTHrP is capable of binding poly(G)-rich sequences in the context of both single- and double-stranded RNAs, but does not bind DNA. We have shown that endogenous and transfected PTHrP proteins bind to single- and double-stranded RNAs at salt concentrations up to 1m. The binding is direct and is highly dependent on the presence of a core GXKKXXK motif within PTHrP that is conserved among other RNA-binding proteins. A peptide corresponding to the PTHrP NTS can bind alone to poly(G)-Sepharose and can compete with wild-type PTHrP for binding to the homopolymer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the RNA binding activity of PTHrP was direct and dependent on preservation of the core motif. The endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine mechanisms of PTHrP action, which are mediated through transduction cascades following the interaction of secreted PTHrP with the common PTH/PTHrP cell-surface receptor, are well documented. On the other hand, little is known regarding the documented intracellular role played by PTHrP. The PTHrP NTS is situated in a highly conserved region of the protein that has also been identified as a site of endoproteolytic cleavage (25Wu T.L. Vasavada R.C. Yang K. Massfelder T. Ganz M. Abbas S.K. Care A.D. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24371-24381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the presence of an intact NTS has been shown to have biological relevance not only in protecting serum-deprived chondrocytes from apoptosis (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), but also as a requirement for PTHrP-induced mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells (6Massfelder T. Dann P. Wu T.L. Vasavada R. Helwig J.J. Stewart A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13630-13635Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Others have shown that PTHrP is targeted to the nucleolus of cells in G1 and suggest that its subcellular distribution is cell-cycle dependent (7Lam M.H.C. Olsen S.L. Rankin W.A. Ho P.W.M. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Moseley J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a first step toward defining the molecular basis for these intracellular actions of PTHrP, we now show that PTHrP is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein and that the association with RNA is dependent on the presence of a core motif found in double-stranded RNA-binding proteins. In the absence of highly specific PTHrP antibodies, we modified all of our expression constructs to include a Myc epitope tag. Using the anti-Myc antibody, two major species of PTHrP were commonly detected in immunoblot analysis of lysates prepared from PTHrPmyc-transfected COS-1 cells. They migrated with apparent molecular sizes slightly larger (due to the 11-amino acid Myc tag) than those previously detected with an antiserum raised against the amino terminus of PTHrP (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). An antiserum that was raised against synthetic PTHrP-(67–86) recognized a major species of endogenous PTHrP that bound to poly(G)-Sepharose and migrated with an apparent size similar to that of prepro-PTHrP. Thus, it appeared that more than one species of PTHrP could associate with homopolymeric RNA. The strength of binding of a protein to a specific nucleotide sequence, whether it be DNA or RNA, can be assessed by performing the binding studies at high salt concentrations. If the binding is weak or requires additional sequences outside of those being tested, then the association will not withstand an elevation in salt concentration (13Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). In this context, binding of the KH domain proteins hnRNP K and FMR1 to RNA is mediated through a combination of KH domains and an RGG box (24Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar,26Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Binding of in vitro translated, wild-type FMR1 to poly(G)-Sepharose was severely compromised at a salt concentration of 500 mm. Binding of the prototypical hnRNP K protein to RNA, on the other hand, was resistant to 1 m salt, as was demonstrated for PTHrP in our own work. Homopolymeric RNA binding in the presence of high salt concentrations was abrogated by deletion of the RGG box or the carboxyl-terminal KH domain in FMR1 (24Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Variable alterations in binding to RNA at high salt concentrations resulted from point mutations of critical Ile residues in the three KH domains in hnRNP K (26Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, we have shown that deletion of the PTHrP NTS results in abrogation of binding to poly(G)-Sepharose and that conservative mutations within the NTS lead to variable alterations in binding to RNA at high salt concentrations. It is interesting to note that, despite their lack of structural similarities, PTHrP and FMR1 both bind 28 S and 18 S species of ribosomal RNA with an apparent equal affinity at low salt concentrations. As is true for many other RNA-binding proteins, the physiological significance of the different structural motifs and their RNA binding affinities and specificities awaits further investigation. In the absence of the NTS, there was no specific binding to total cellular RNA or to homopolymeric RNA. However, deletion of a stretch of 20 amino acids could influence the overall structure of PTHrP, thus preventing it from making contact with its RNA target. We therefore sought to map the point of contact between PTHrP and RNA using a set of NTS mutants that had previously been generated for immunofluorescent localization of the protein. In those studies, it was shown that substitution of the amino-terminal lysines was most effective in preventing nuclear/nucleolar targeting of PTHrP (33Henderson J.E. He B. Karaplis A.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10 Suppl. 1: S286Google Scholar). More recently, others have demonstrated that proteins in which either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal lysine tract was deleted failed to stimulate proliferation when expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, as did intact PTHrP (6Massfelder T. Dann P. Wu T.L. Vasavada R. Helwig J.J. Stewart A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13630-13635Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We now show that substitution of these same basic amino acids, particularly the amino-terminal stretch, compromises binding of the protein to both synthetic and total cellular RNAs. This is in keeping with the observation that PTHrP87GXKKXXK93 constitutes a core motif that is also found in the functionally heterogeneous group of proteins containing dsRNA-binding domains. The general structure of the dsRNA-binding domain is αβββα, and it is believed that the junction between the third β-sheet and the α-helix plays a critical role in RNA binding (10Kharrat A. Macias M.J. Gibson T.J. Nilges M. Pastore N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PTHrP does not conform to these structural requirements in that it has helix-breaking prolines at positions 86 and 94 that flank the core motif and does not possess the extended dsRNA-binding domains. Despite this lack of overall homology, mutation of specific lysines within the core motif resulted in severely compromised binding of PTHrP to RNA in our own studies as well as in those of others examining binding of the dsRNA-binding domain proteins PKR (27McMillan N.A.J. Carpick B.W. Hollis B. Toone W.M. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2601-2606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and GCN2 (17Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to RNA. In the case of PTHrP, substitution of other lysine or arginine residues in the NTS had only a modest or no effect on binding. Another member of the family of dsRNA-binding proteins is TRBP, which was isolated from a HeLa cell expression library on the basis of its ability to bind with high affinity to the GC-rich double-stranded stem of TAR RNA (16Gatignol A. Buckler C. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Rounseville M.P. Kumar A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1688-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The prototypical TAR-binding protein, Tat, on the other hand, appears to identify single-stranded loops in the context of the double-stranded stem (29Roy S. Parkin N.T. Rosen C. Itovitch J. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that PTHrP binds avidly to G-rich sequences in both a single- and double-stranded context. It is therefore possible that the cellular RNA target of PTHrP might be a defined structure similar to that formed by TAR. In view of evidence that suggests that some rDNA transcription takes place in the dense fibrillar core of the nucleolus where PTHrP localizes in vivo (30Lazdins I.B. Delannoy M. Sollner-Webb B. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), it is possible that it might play some role in the processivity of RNA polymerase I, as has been suggested for Tat in the case of RNA polymerase II (31Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). PTHrP could inhibit rRNA synthesis and allow the cell to arrest in G0/G1 in an environment that could not support proliferation. In support of this hypothesis is evidence that transfected PTHrP was found in the nucleolus of only 10–15% of randomly cycling cells (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and that endogenous PTHrP localized to the nucleolus only in quiescent keratinocytes (7Lam M.H.C. Olsen S.L. Rankin W.A. Ho P.W.M. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Moseley J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An alternative role that PTHrP might play in the nucleus is in the processing of pre-rRNA. However, despite its nucleolar localization, the lack of repetitive RNP motifs or RGG boxes appears to exclude it from the RNA recognition motif family, to which the large group of small nuclear/nucleolar RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA processing and transport belongs. One member of this family is nucleolin, which, like PTHrP, has a classic bipartite nuclear/nucleolar targeting signal composed of two polylysine tracts separated by a 10-amino acid spacer. It has been suggested that the nucleolin NTS localizes the protein to the nucleolus, where it is subsequently retained by binding to rRNA through RNP and RGG motifs (8Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Serin G. Joseph G. Ghisolfi L. Bauzon M. Erard M. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13109-13116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In our own studies, we have shown that the PTHrP NTS is both necessary and sufficient to localize the protein to the nucleus/nucleolus (4Henderson J.E. Amizuka N. Warshawsky H. Biasotto D. Lanske B.M.K. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We now show that a peptide corresponding to the PTHrP NTS binds directly, with specificity and apparent high affinity, to poly(G)-Sepharose, whereas a similar, equally lysine-rich peptide (nucleolin NTS) does not. In view of our data that identify the PTHrP NTS as the motif that mediates binding of the full-length protein to RNA, this observation strongly suggests that PTHrP binds RNA directly, rather than through some other molecule. Additionally, the inability of a peptide representing the nucleolin NTS to compete with PTHrP for binding to poly(G)-rich RNA supports the conjecture that PTHrP does not belong to the RRM family of RNA-binding proteins. However, the possibility that PTHrP plays some as yet undefined role in rRNA processing cannot be excluded. It is evident from the above discussion that the classification of RNA-binding proteins on the basis of structural similarities does little to elucidate their biological function. Thus, the RNA binding characteristics of PTHrP most closely resemble those of the dsRNA-binding protein TRBP, whose biological function remains undefined. Our current work characterizing the RNA binding properties of PTHrP, combined with our previous observation that PTHrP localizes to the dense fibrillar core of the nucleolus, predicts a role for the protein in the transcription or processing of rRNA. However, further studies will be required to co-localize PTHrP with the subnucleolar sites of rDNA transcription and early rRNA processing events to clarify these issues.

https://openalex.org/W2093149486,"The thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is essential for normal brain maturation. To determine the mechanisms by which T3 controls neuronal proliferation and differentiation, we have analyzed the effect of this hormone on the expression and activity of cell cycle-regulating molecules in neuroblastoma N2a-β cells that overexpress the β1 isoform of the T3 receptor. Our results show that incubation of N2a-β cells with T3 leads to a rapid down-regulation of the c-myc gene and to a decrease of cyclin D1 levels. T3 also causes a strong and sustained increase of the levels of the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. This increase is secondary, to the augmented levels of p27Kip1 transcripts as well as to stabilization of the p27Kip1 protein. The increased levels of p27Kip1 lead to a significant increase in the amount of p27Kip1 associated with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and to a marked inhibition of the kinase activity of the cyclin·CDK2 complexes. As a consequence, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the retinoblastoma protein-related protein p130 are hypophosphorylated in T3-treated N2a-β cells. This study shows for the first time that T3-mediated growth arrest and neuronal differentiation are associated with an increase in the levels of a cyclin kinase inhibitor, which does not allow the inactivation of retinoblastoma proteins required for progression through the restriction point in the cell cycle. The thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is essential for normal brain maturation.

Although the thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is essential for the normal development of the central nervous system, the specific mechanisms by which these hormones control neuronal proliferation and differentiation are currently unknown. T3 actions in cells are initiated by binding to nuclear receptors encoded by two genes, α and β, which give rise to different receptor isoforms (1Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The neuroblastoma cell line N2a expresses low levels of nuclear receptors (2Yusta B. Ortiz-Caro J. Bedo G. Pascual A. Aranda A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, a stably transfected cell line (N2a-β cells) that overexpresses the nuclear receptor β1 isoform has been established (3Lebel J.-M. Dusault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). T3 treatment of N2a-β cells blocks proliferation by an arrest of cells in G0/G1 and induces morphological and functional differentiation (3Lebel J.-M. Dusault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Puymirat J. Etonge-Mayer P. Dussault J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30651-30656Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings in neuroblastoma cells correlate with similar effects of T3 in primary neuronal cultures and in the developing brain (5Dussault J.H. Ruel J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Puymirat J. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 39: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that T3 may act as a timing clock by pushing the neuroblasts out of the mitotic phase, and a role of nuclear receptor β1 in this effect is supported by the finding that β1 transcripts are predominantly found in zones of neuroblast proliferation (7Bradley D.J. Towle H.C. Scott-Young W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge no studies on the effect of T3 on the expression of proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle in neural cells have been reported. To gain some insights into the mechanisms by which T3 regulates neuronal cell growth and differentiation, we have analyzed the effect of this hormone on the expression and activity of cell cycle-regulating molecules. Our results show that incubation of N2a-β cells with T3 leads to a rapid down-regulation of the c-myc gene, to a decrease of cyclin D1 levels, and to a sustained induction of the cyclin kinase inhibitor (CKI) 1The abbreviations CKIcyclin kinase inhibitorpRbretinoblastoma proteinCDK2cyclin-dependent kinase 2DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1The abbreviations CKIcyclin kinase inhibitorpRbretinoblastoma proteinCDK2cyclin-dependent kinase 2DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediump27Kip1. This increase is secondary to the augmented levels of p27Kip1 transcripts as well as to stabilization of the p27 protein. As a consequence of the increased levels of p27Kip1, the kinase activity associated with the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complexes is inhibited and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family members are hypophosphorylated in T3-treated N2a-β cells.

Dusault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the cell cultures with guanidine thiocyanate. The RNA was run in 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon-nitrocellulose membranes (Nytran) for Northern blot analysis. The RNA was stained with 0.02% methylene blue. The blots were hybridized with labeled mouse cDNA probes for c-myc, cyclin D1, or p27Kip1. Quantification of mRNA levels was carried out by densitometric scan of the autoradiograms. The values obtained were always corrected by the amount of RNA applied in each lane, which was determined by densitometry of the stained membranes. The cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Aliquots containing 50 μg of lysate were boiled in 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll), the membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. This was followed by incubation with the corresponding diluted antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The antisera used were the following: anti-c-myc (N-262, sc-764), anti-cyclin D1 (9, sc-92), anti-p27Kip1 (M-197, sc-776), anti-p130 (C-20, sc-137) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-Rb (14441A, PharMingen). After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with an appropiate secondary antibody, and the proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein bands were analyzed by densitometry. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μl of anti-CDK2 antibody-agarose conjugated (M2-G, sc-163-G). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and revealed with the anti-p27 antibody. To measure kinase activity, immunoprecipitates were washed twice, resuspended in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μmATP) containing 5 μg of histone H1 and 7 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 32P-labeled histone H1 was detected by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. After a 48-h incubation period in the presence or absence of 5 nmT3, the cells were detached from the culture plates and pulse-labeled for 1 h with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1.5 mCi/10 ml) in methionine- and cysteine-deficient DMEM. Labeled cells were washed and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 150 μg/ml unlabeled amino acids. After a chase for 0, 3.5, and 7 h, the cells were washed and lysed. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-p27Kip1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After fluorography, the amount of 35S incorporated into p27Kip1 was quantitated in an Instantimager (Packard Instruments Co.). N2a-β cells were transfected by calcium phosphate with 0.5 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase plasmid and 5 μg of pLPC (8de Stanchina E. McCurrach M.E. Zindy F. Shieh S.Y. Ferbeyre G. Samuelson A.V. Prives C. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) or pLPC-p27 (human p27 cDNA subcloned into the pLPC vector). The DNA precipitates were added to dishes containing coverslips. Cells were exposed to the DNA precipitates for 16 h, washed, and incubated in DMEM containing 10% T3-depleted serum for 48 h. Cells undergoing DNA synthesis were identified by incubation with the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) at a final concentration of 10 μm for the last 4 h, and transfected cells were identified by staining for β-galactosidase. Cells were fixed with methanol/acetic acid/water (90:5:5, v/v) for 30 min at room temperature, stained with a 1:500 dilution of β-galactosidase antibody (Promega), and subsequently with a BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as suggested by the supplier. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibodies to visualize β-galactosidase and BrdUrd-stained cells, respectively. Cells were then examined using fluorescence microscopy with the appropiate filters. T3 treatment of N2a-β cells strongly blocks DNA synthesis and causes an arrest of cells in G0/G1 (Ref. 3Lebel J.-M. Dusault J.H. Puymirat J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2644-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Although the mechanisms connecting c-Myc function to cell cycle control are not well understood, different signals that arrest growth and elicit cell differentiation suppress c-Myc expression. As shown in Fig.1 A, the levels of c-Myc were markedly decreased in N2a-β cells incubated for 48 h in the presence of 5 nm T3. The reduction of c-Myc is a consequence of the decreased c-myc mRNA levels. Incubation with T3 causes a rapid decrease of c-myctranscripts in N2a-β cells. A maximal reduction (approximately 3-fold) was found only after 2 h of incubation with the hormone, and the levels of c-myc transcripts remained low for at least 72 h (data not shown). This is one of the most rapid effects of thyroid hormones on gene expression known. As shown in Fig.1 B, the levels of cyclin D1, another important component of cell cycle progression, were also strongly reduced after 48 h of T3 treatment. As in the case of c-Myc, a reduction of cyclin D1 transcripts was found, showing that T3 also alters cyclin D1 gene expression. Because CKIs are targeted by different growth-inhibitory and differentiation signals, the possibility that T3 could induce the expression of CKIs was also analyzed. In Fig. 2 A Northern analysis of RNA from N2a-β cells indicated that p27Kip1transcripts were induced by T3. Fig. 2 B shows that this induction was already observed after 3 h, but the maximal effect was found at 24 h. p27Kip1 mRNA levels decreased thereafter, but were still higher than in the untreated controls after 96 h of incubation with T3. This regulation was specific for p27Kip1 because the level of p21Waf1 mRNA was not affected by T3 (data not shown). To analyze whether de novo protein synthesis was required for T3 induction of p27Kip1 transcripts, treatment with the hormone was performed in the presence and absence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 2 C treatment with T3 for 4 h caused a detectable increase of p27Kip1 transcripts. Incubation with cycloheximide alone was able to induce p27Kip1 mRNA levels, showing that this induction has characteristics similar to those found with different early response genes, which have transcripts with short half-lives in which labile proteins are implied. T3 was not able to induce further p27Kip1 transcripts in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that likely activation of p27Kip1 represents an indirect effect of the T3 receptor, which requires previous synthesis of a protein or proteins. The increase of p27Kip1 transcripts could also be secondary to mRNA stabilization. To analyze this point, p27Kip1mRNA levels were determined in control cells and in cells induced with T3 for 24 h and then incubated for varying times with 5 μg/ml of actinomycin D. Fig. 2 D shows that p27Kip1 mRNA disappeared with a similar half-life (2 h) in both untreated and T3-treated N2a-β cells, showing that mRNA stabilization is not involved in the induction of p27Kip1transcripts. To directly address the question of whether the increase of p27Kip1 transcripts by T3 is caused by an increase of p27 gene transcription, a p27Kip1 reporter construct containing a 1.6-kilobase upstream genomic fragment was used to transiently transfect N2a-β cells (9Kwon T.-K. Nagel J.E. Buchholtz M.A. Nordin A.A. Gene. 1996; 180: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Treatment with T3 did not increase p27Kip1 promoter activity. Similar results were obtained with plasmids containing shorter promoter fragments (data not shown). These results suggest that either p27Kip1 is not a transcriptionally responsive target gene of the T3 receptor, or that the sequences responsible for the transcriptional effect are outside of the promoter fragments examined. Fig. 3 A shows that p27Kip1 protein levels were markedly induced in N2a-β cells incubated with the hormone for different time periods. Quantification of different blots revealed that treatment with 5 nm T3 between 24 and 96 h increased by 8–9-fold the cellular levels of p27Kip1. It has been described that different antiproliferative signals regulate p27Kip1accumulation by posttranslational mechanisms (10Hengst L. Reed S. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). To determine whether p27Kip1 stabilization could also contribute to the elevated p27Kip1 levels found in T3-treated cells, the incorporation of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine into p27Kip1 and the half-life of the labeled protein was determined. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, the half-life of the p27Kip1 protein was much shorter in the untreated N2a-β cells than in the cells treated with T3. Whereas in control cells35S-p27Kip1 disappeared with an apparent half-life of approximately 5 h, most of the label remained after a 7 h chase in T3-treated cells. Thus, protein stabilization clearly contributes to the accumulation of p27Kip1 protein observed in the cells incubated with T3. To analyze whether an increase in the expression of p27Kip1 protein is able to block cell cycle progression in N2a-β cells, DNA synthesis was determined in cells that overexpress p27Kip1. For this purpose, the cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding p27Kip1. Cotransfection with a plasmid expressing a β-galactosidase gene was used to identify the transfected cells, and cells that entered S-phase were identified by staining for BrdUrd incorporation. Staining with β-galactosidase showed that approximately 20–25% of the total cell population was successfully transfected. As shown in TableI, expression of p27Kip1caused a dramatic decrease in the percentage of cells in S-phase. Whereas in N2a-β cells transfected with an empty noncoding vector, a large fraction (more than 70%) of the β-galactosidase-positive cells were BrdUrd positive, only 14% of the cells transfected with the p27Kip1-expressing plasmid entered S-phase.Table Ip27kip1 blocks N2a-β cells proliferationVectorBrdUrd Positive Cells%pLPC73 ± 5pLPC-p27kip114 ± 2N2a-β cells were cotransfected with the CMV β-galactosidase plasmid and pLPC-p27kip1 vector, which directs the expression of p27kip1, or with the pLPC vector as a negative control.

Data are the average ± S.D. of counting at least twenty different microscopy fields from two separate experiments. CDK inhibitors are thought to prevent cell proliferation by interaction with cyclin-CDK complexes. To elucidate the significance of the induced p27Kip1 by T3, we studied the complex formation of p27Kip1 with CDK2. As shown in Fig. 4, the levels of CDK2 did not change after incubation of N2a-β cells with T3. However, the amount of p27Kip1 precipitated with anti-CDK2 antibody increased significantly in T3-treated cells concomitantly with the increased content of total p27Kip1 under this condition. It was expected that association of CDK2 with p27Kip1 could result in an impaired kinase activity. Thus, we next examined this activity in the immunoprecipitates using histone H1 as a substrate. Fig. 5 A shows that CDK2-associated kinase activity was indeed strongly reduced by T3 in N2a-β cells.Figure 5A, effect of T3 on kinase activity associated with CDK2. Histone H1 kinase activity was measured in immunoprecipitates of CDK2 obtained from cells treated with 5 nm T3 for the indicated times. A representative autoradiogram is shown at the bottom. The upper panel shows the quantification of kinase activities obtained from two independent experiments performed with duplicate cultures.B, T3 increases the amount of hypophosphorylated pRb family proteins. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with extracts from cells incubated with or without T3 for 48 h. The pRb antibody specifically detects the underphosphorylated forms of the protein (pRb unphospho), and the p130 antibody detects both the hyperphosphorylated (p130-phospho) and underphosphorylated (p130 unphospho) forms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of T3 on pRb family proteins were investigated by immunoblotting. Fig. 5 B shows the results obtained with anti-pRb antibody that recognizes specifically the underphosphorylated forms of the protein. These forms were almost undetectable in control N2a-β cells, and T3 produced a significant accumulation of unphosphorylated pRb. In addition, the hormone induced a shift from the slower migrating hyperphosphorylated p130 found in control N2a-β cells to their faster migrating hypophosphorylated forms. These results are consistent with the requirement of CDK2 activity for phosphorylation of pRb and p130 (11Li Y. Graham C. Lacy S. Duncan A.M. Whyte P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2366-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 12Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4303) Google Scholar), and with the finding that during neuronal diiferentiation pRb hypophosphorylation is concomitant with the loss of CDK2 activity (13Kranenburg O. Sharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our results show that T3-mediated growth arrest and differentiation of neuroblastoma cells is associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb and the related protein p130. The pRb family members appear to be essential for neurogenesis and are highly expressed in cell types undergoing neuronal differentiation, whereas loss of pRb affects the ability of neurons to differentiate properly (14Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. van Roon M. van der Lugt N.M.T. van der Valk M. Hooper M.L. Berns A. te Riele H. Nature. 1992; 359: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 15Lee E.Y.-H. Chang C.-Y. Hu N.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2008-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). One of the molecular events required for cell cycle progression is the inactivation by hyperphosphorylation of pRb family proteins (12,17). Therefore, T3 maintains pRb family proteins in their active form. Under these conditions, they associate with E2F/DP factors and repress transcription of target genes required for progression through the restriction point in the cell cycle (18Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 457-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The hyperphosphorylation of pRb family members is catalyzed by the CDKs. It has been shown that during neuronal differentiation the loss of pRb phosphorylation correlates with loss of activity of the pRb kinases CDK2 (associated with cyclins A or E) and CDK4 (associated with D-type cyclins) (13Kranenburg O. Sharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our results in neuroblastoma cells demonstrate that T3 causes a strong reduction of CDK2 activity without altering the cellular levels of CDK2. The activities of the CDKs are regulated by various mechanisms including dimerization with cyclins, phosphorylation, and association with a group of inhibitory proteins called CKIs (19Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 20Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). The Cip/Kip family of CKIs, which are targeted by different growth-inhibitory and differentiation signals, includes p21Waf1 (21Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zang H. Casso D. Kobayasi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 336: 701-704Crossref Scopus (3162) Google Scholar), p27Kip1 (22Poliak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempts P. Massagué J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar, 23Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar), and p57Kip2 (24Lee M.-H. Reynisdóttir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) that bind to and inhibit all G1-cyclin·CDK complexes. It has been described that during differentiation of neuroblastoma cells with Me2SO, the activities of CDK2 and CDK4 decline by association with p27Kip1 (13Kranenburg O. Sharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and that differentiation by nerve growth factor and an inhibitor of DNA polymerases is also accompanied by the expression of p21Waf1, another CKI that inhibits cyclin E-associated kinase activity and is required for neuroblastoma cell survival (25Poluha W. Poluha D.K. Chang B. Crosbie N.E. Schonhoff C.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Ross A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, neuronal differentiation can be induced by overexpression of p27Kip1 or pRb, suggesting that inhibition of CDK activity and pRb phosphorylation are the major determinants for neuronal differentiation and survival (13Kranenburg O. Sharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Poluha W. Poluha D.K. Chang B. Crosbie N.E. Schonhoff C.M. Kilpatrick D.L. Ross A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In agreement with the important role of CKIs on neuronal differentiation, we find that T3 induces a strong and sustained increase of the levels of p27Kip1 in N2a-β cells. It is generally accepted that the mRNA level of p27Kip1 remains constant regardless of the state of cell growth and that p27Kip1 stabilization or destabilization is the cause of the changes in p27Kip1levels (10Hengst L. Reed S. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 26Kato J. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 27Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M.

However, our results show that T3 increases the level of p27Kip1 transcripts. Recent work has shown an increase of p27Kip1 mRNA levels after incubation of gastric carcinoma cells by interferon-β (30Kuniyasu H. Yasui W. Kithara K. Naka K. Yokozaki H. Akama Y. Hamamoto T. Tahara H. Tahara E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 47-52PubMed Google Scholar), or myelomonocytic cells with vitamin D3 (31Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 32Wang Q.M. Luo X. Studzinski G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2851-2855PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in p27Kip1 mRNA levels in N2a-β cells is found as soon as 3 h after treatment with the hormone, which suggests a direct effect on p27Kip1 gene transcription. Transcriptional effects of thyroid hormones are mediated by binding of nuclear receptors to hormone-response elements located normally in the promoter region of regulated genes and several potential nuclear receptors binding sequences are present in the 5′-flanking region of the p27Kip1 gene. However, we did not identify a functional response element, because T3 did not increase the activity of the p27 promoter in N2a-β cells. Moreover, T3 was not able to induce p27Kip1 transcripts above the levels found in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting the requirement of de novoprotein synthesis for this induction. This suggested that T3 could increase p27Kip1 expression primarily by stabilization of the gene transcripts, but the hormone did not increase the half-life of p27Kip1 mRNA, which was approximately 2 h, regardless of the treatment. The short half-life as well as the implication of labile proteins in the mRNA turnover demonstrated by the induction in the absence of protein synthesis could explain the rapid induction by T3. The findings that the induction in p27Kip1 levels by T3 was more pronounced than that of p27Kip1 mRNA levels, and that p27 transcripts decline between 24 and 72 h of incubation with T3, when the protein levels are maximally induced, suggested that p27Kip1 stabilization could also contribute to the elevated p27Kip1 levels. This fact was demonstrated by pulse-chase experiments, which showed that T3 significantly increased p27Kip1 half-life in N2a-β cells. It has been reported that accumulation of p27Kip1 protein is not sufficient on its own to arrest the cell cycle or to induce differentiation in oligodendrocytes (33Durand B. Gao F.B. Raff M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this cell model, the levels of p27Kip1 progressively increase in the precursor oligodendrocytes as they proliferate, but despite high levels of the inhibitor the cells tend to keep dividing and not differentiate in the absence of hydrophobic signals such as T3. In contrast, our results clearly show that overexpression of p27Kip1 is sufficient in itself to trigger an exit from the cell cycle in N2a-β cells. Our results are in agreement with the finding that expression of p27Kip1 blocks cell cycle progression in G1 in different cell lines tested (17Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Although the hypophosphorylation of pRb and p130 caused by T3 is most likely secondary to the increase in p27Kip1 and the consequent inhibition of CDK2 activity, cyclin D-dependent kinases also induce pRb hyperphosphorylation (34Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2583) Google Scholar). Cyclin D is rate limiting for the G1/S transition, and it has been reported that expression of cyclin D1 advances the G1/S transition and leads to the immediate appearance of hyperphosphorylated pRb. Induction of cyclin D1 promotes cell cycle progression not only by activating CDKs but also by sequestering p27Kip1 (35Poliak K. Kato J.-Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massagué J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar, 36Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 37Reynisdottir J. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Because T3 reduces cyclin D1 expression, this decrease as well as the induction of p27Kip1 might contribute to maintain pRb family proteins in their hyposphosphorylated state. p27Kip1 and the c-myc proto-oncogene generally have opposite roles in cell growth control, and c-Myc antagonizes the growth arrest induced by p27Kip1 (38Henriksson M. Lüstcher B. Adv. Cancer. Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of c-myc is suppressed by different growth-inhibitory or differentiation signals (39Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not surprising that T3 reduced c-myc gene expression in N2a-β cells. It has been shown that c-Myc induces an as yet unknown cellular activity leading to sequestration of p27Kip1, derepression of cyclin/CDK activity and pRb hyperphosphorylation and thus allowing the escape from the restriction point control in the cell cycle (38Henriksson M. Lüstcher B. Adv. Cancer. Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Suppression of c-Myc levels by T3 assuredly contributes to growth arrest and differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. In summary, our results indicate that T3 coordinately regulates the expression of several genes that play a key role in cell cycle control and differentiation of neuronal cells. The induction of a CKI, which inhibits the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases and does not allow progression through the restriction point in the cell cycle, provides a mechanism to explain the crucial effects of thyroid hormones on neuroblast growth and differentiation in the developing brain.

In calculating the overall stoichiometry of the neuronal DA uptake process as 2:1:1 for Na+:Cl−:DA, the authors have combined the evidence for co-transport of two Na+ ions and one Cl− ion per DA molecule with the assumption that the cationic form of DA is the substrate for uptake (7Krueger B.K. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 8Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sonders M.S.

DA has an amino group that can accept a proton and a phenolic hydroxyl group that can donate a proton; the second phenolic group has a pK avalue greater than 12. Therefore, except at extremely basic pH values where both hydroxyl groups can be dissociated, DA can exist as a cation (+H3NDOH, with D for DA skeleton), a zwitterion (+H3NDO−), a neutral form (H2NDOH), or an anion (H2NDO−). With pK a1 and pK a2 values of 8.86 and 10.5, respectively (10Armstrong J. Barlow R.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1976; 57: 501-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Lewis G.P. Br. J. Pharmacol.

Indeed, in the analogous cases of neuronal uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, strong evidence for translocation of the cationic form has been advanced (13Rudnick G. Kirk K.L. Fishkes H.

Indirect evidence in favor of the cation also being the active form for DA uptake comes from site-directed mutagenesis studies (15Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc.

The question of the active monoamine form for uptake by the vesicular monoamine transporter was given a great deal of attention more than a decade ago, with mixed conclusions. A case has been made for the cationic (17Njus D. Kelley P.M. Harnadek G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 237-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Darchen F. Scherman D. Desnos C.

Rev. 1988; 68: 232-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and to our knowledge no new information on this issue is available.In the present study, the question of the active form of DA for the neuronal DAT is addressed by monitoring for the human DAT (hDAT) cloned by Janowsky and colleagues (20Eshleman A.J.

Uptake was measured by monitoring the accumulation of [3H]DA, and binding was assessed indirectly through inhibition of high affinity binding of the cocaine analog [3H]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (WIN 35428), which interacts with a domain on the DAT that overlaps with the DA domain (5Rudnick G.

Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By comparing DA uptake and binding, we can determine whether changes in uptake as a function of pH are solely determined by changes at the level of DA recognition, the first step in the DA translocation cycle. In contrast to DA, which is a dihydroxylated phenylethylamine, bretylium is a nonhydroxylated bromophenylmethylamine in which the amine is quaternary (25Maxwell R.A. Ferris R.M. Burcsu J.E. Paton D.M. The Mechanism of Neuronal and Extraneuronal Transport of Catecholamines. Raven Press, New York1976: 95-153Google Scholar), and therefore the formation of an overall neutral species is not possible for this compound. Bretylium is usually employed for its inhibitory effect on norepinephrine release (see Ref. 26Masuda M. Kanai S. Miyasaka K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G29-G34PubMed Google Scholar) and monoamine oxidase (27Molinoff P.B. Brimijoin S. Axelrod J. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 32P-33PCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it can be taken up into dopaminergic cells (28Kamal L.A. Arbilla S. Galzin A.M. Langer S.Z. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 227: 446-458PubMed Google Scholar) and interferes with DA uptake into striatal synaptosomes (29Kammerer R.C. Amiri B. Cho A.K. J. Med. Chem. 1979; 22: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Guanethidine is a compound derived from guanidine. The latter is a strong base with a pK a of 12.5 (30Steinmetz P.R. Balko C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1973; 289: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and is therefore predominantly in the positive guanidinium ion form over a wide pH range up to 11. Guanethidine has a pK a1 of 11.4 and a pK a2 of 8.3 (31Katzung B.G. Katzung B.G. Basic & Clinical Pharmacology. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1995: 1-8Google Scholar). The former pK avalue describes the ability of guanethidine, at the pH values between 6.0 and 8.2 studied here, to carry one proton at the guanidine residue, whereas the latter pK a value represents the ability of the guanido group to accept an additional proton as a function of pH (at pH 8.2 in ∼50% of the molecules). In a similar but not identical manner as bretylium, guanethidine is known to interfere with catecholaminergic transmission in mammalian (32Collins G.G. West G.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 34: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and invertebrate (33Silinsky E.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1974; 51: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) systems. Guanethidine can act as a substrate for the norepinephrine transporter (34Sachs C. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1970; 341: 1-66PubMed Google Scholar) and has been reported to inhibit neuronal uptake of norepinephrine (25Maxwell R.A. Ferris R.M. Burcsu J.E. Paton D.M. The Mechanism of Neuronal and Extraneuronal Transport of Catecholamines. Raven Press, New York1976: 95-153Google Scholar), but its affinity for the DAT, to our knowledge, has not been reported.

https://openalex.org/W2031778251,"Inflammatory mediators like bacterial lipopolysaccharide induce monocytes to express tissue factor (TF), the cell-surface protein that triggers the blood clotting cascade in hemostasis and thrombotic disease. The physiologic ligand for TF is the serine protease, factor VIIa (FVIIa), and the resulting bimolecular enzyme, TF/FVIIa, can be reversibly inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Culturing monocytic cells in the presence of both FVIIa and TFPI caused down-regulation of TF expression via reducing its half-life. To exert this effect, FVIIa had to be competent to bind both TF and TFPI, and TFPI had to contain the C-terminal domain required for binding to other cell-surface receptors, including the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). TF down-regulation by FVIIa plus TFPI was abrogated by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, which blocks binding of all known ligands to LRP. Furthermore, treatment with FVIIa plus TFPI caused monocyte TF to colocalize with α-adaptin, a component of clathrin-coated pits. Thus, in addition to reversibly inhibiting TF/FVIIa catalytic activity, TFPI also mediates the permanent down-regulation of cell-surface TF in monocytic cells via LRP-dependent internalization and degradation. This represents an unusual mechanism for receptor internalization, requiring ligand-dependent bridging of one cell-surface receptor (TF) to a second cell-surface receptor (LRP), the latter being capable of clathrin-mediated internalization.

Gensini G.F. Gori A.M. Attanasio M. Martini F. Lancet. 1990; 336: 1444-1445Abstract Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TF is also expressed in monocytes/macrophages resident in atherosclerotic plaques (7Wilcox J.N. Smith K.M. Schwartz S.M. Gordon D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is therefore important to understand how TF expression is controlled in monocytic cells. Several studies have focused on transcriptional control of TF gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 9Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and mRNA half-life (10Brand K. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Mol. Cell.

TFPI circulates in association with lipoproteins and is present in platelets. In addition, a large pool of TFPI is apparently bound to the vascular endothelium in vivo, which is releasable by heparin injection (11Broze Jr., G.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). TFPI has three Kunitz-type inhibitor domains, allowing it to inhibit factor Xa (FXa) and TF/FVIIa simultaneously (12Callander N.S. Rao L.V.M. Nordfang O. Sandset P.M. Warn-Cramer B. Rapaport S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 876-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the TFPI·FXa complex is an especially potent inhibitor of TF/FVIIa, TFPI can also inhibit TF/FVIIa directly. TFPI binds to two classes of cell-surface proteins, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (13Narita M. Bu G. Olins G.M. Higuchi D.A.

LRP is responsible for mediating clathrin-dependent endocytosis and subsequent degradation of TFPI by hepatoma cells (14Warshawsky I. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25873-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, TFPI mediates the uptake and degradation of FXa by fibroblasts and hepatoma cells (15Ho G.Y. Toomey J.R. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9497-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In cultured vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, TF is localized, via TFPI-dependent (16Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or -independent (17Mulder A.B. Smit J.W. Bom V.J.J. Blom N.R. Ruiters M.H.J. Halie M.R. Van der Meer J. Blood. 1996; 88: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) means, to caveolae, specialized membrane domains whose phospholipid content differs significantly from the remainder of the plasma membrane (18Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 19Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Thiel E. Futterner A. Herzug V. Wirtz A. Riethmüller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the role of TFPI in down-regulation of TF expression in human peripheral blood monocytes and the human monocytic leukemia cell line, Mono Mac 6 (MM6)(19). When FVIIa and TFPI bound to TF on the surface of monocytic cells, the half-life of TF was shortened from 3.7 to 1.3 h. Down-regulation of TF expression was dependent upon both FVIIa and TFPI and required that TFPI have an intact C terminus. In contrast to endothelial and smooth muscle cells, no evidence was obtained in monocytes for translocation of TF to caveolae or other membrane domains with altered phospholipid content. However, TF down-regulation by TFPI plus FVIIa in monocytic cells was dependent upon LRP. We propose that when TF/FVIIa on the surface of monocytic cells binds TFPI, the resulting TF·FVIIa·TFPI complex associates with LRP and is translocated to clathrin-coated pits. TF is thereby internalized and degraded by an unusual mechanism in which one integral membrane protein (TF) is bridged, in a ligand-dependent fashion, to a second integral membrane protein (LRP), the latter promoting clathrin-mediated internalization.

The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) and rabbit anti-LRP IgG were prepared as described (23Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol.

FFR-FVIIa was prepared by reaction of FVIIa with FFR-chloromethyl ketone (1:20 molar ratio) for 30 min at room temperature in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% human serum albumin, followed by extensive dialysis to remove unreacted inhibitor. FFR-FVIIa had less than 1% of its original amidolytic activity (27Neuenschwander P.F. Branam D.E. Morrissey J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 970-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant E2PD-FVIIa was constructed and purified as described for E2PD-FX (28Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

TF was purified from human brain by affinity chromatography as described (29Morrissey J.H. Revak D. Tejada P. Fair D.S. Edgington T.S. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 481-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) except that antibody TF9–5B7 was used in place of TF8–5G9. Recombinant soluble TF was prepared as described (30Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Preparation of polyclonal anti-TF IgG and anti-TF mAb were described previously (31Morrissey J.H. Fair D.S. Edgington T.S. Thromb. Res. 1988; 52: 247-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The CHO-B cDNA probe was a gift from Dr. R. Walls of the UCLA School of Medicine (Los Angeles, CA). All proteins except TFPI, XK1, and RAP were supplemented with 0.5% human serum albumin and dialyzed against sterile phosphate-buffered saline before use in cell cultures. Stock solutions of TFPI (8 mg/ml) and TFPI13–160(4.7 mg/ml) were in 2 m urea/phosphate buffered saline and were diluted directly into culture medium when used. Controls with similarly diluted urea were performed. MM6 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640, 10% calf serum supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin. For experiments, cells were rinsed once with Ca2+,Mg2+-free HBSS and once with AIM-V medium, and then resuspended in AIM-V, 0.01% calf serum unless otherwise indicated. MM6 cells were then cultured in multiwell plates. AIM-V has been used for long term culture of macrophages (32Helinski E.H. Bielat K.L. Ovak G.M. Pauly J.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1988; 44: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that MM6 cells cultured in AIM-V for 10 days were viable and grew at a rate only slightly lower than cells cultured in RPMI/10% calf serum (data not shown). Platelet-poor human plasma was prepared by centrifugation of heparinized blood for 15 min at 300 × g and recentrifugation of plasma for 15 min at 5,000 × g. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood by centrifugation using Histopaque, per the manufacturer's instructions, then suspended in AIM-V, 0.01% calf serum, and cultured in multiwell plates or sterile polypropylene culture tubes at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were used in experiments immediately after isolation. TF was solubilized from cells and culture media by adding EDTA (7 mm final) and either Triton X-100 (1% final) or octyl glucoside (60 mm final), after which TF levels were measured by a sandwich ELISA (30Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). EDTA was included to dissociate FVIIa and TFPI from TF, to eliminate competition with anti-TF antibodies. Control experiments in which FVIIa and TFPI were added to lysates of TF-expressing monocytes confirmed that these proteins did not interfere with TF measurement by ELISA in the presence of EDTA. Statistical significance of differences in ELISA values was determined using Student's t test. For measurement of the half-life of TF, cells were treated for 4 h with LPS and then treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide; cultures were immediately divided; TFPI and FVIIa were added as indicated, and timed aliquots were removed and processed for ELISA. The effect of staurosporine on TF levels was investigated by incubating LPS-stimulated cells as above for 3.5 h, adding 2 μmstaurosporine or vehicle (ethanol) and incubating for an additional 30 min. FVIIa and TFPI were then added for 2 h, after which cells were collected for ELISA. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended at 1 × 107cells/ml in SDS sample buffer with dithiothreitol, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then treated with blocking buffer (4% bovine serum albumin and 1% casein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Membranes were subsequently treated with 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated polyclonal anti-TF IgG in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with NeutrAvidin-horseradish peroxidase in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. In some experiments, membranes were co-stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-caveolin antibody, using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit as the secondary antibody. Human endothelial cell lysate as positive control for caveolin staining was provided by the supplier of the anti-caveolin antibody. Membranes were rinsed as above and treated with chemiluminescence substrate (3 ml per 54-cm2 membrane) for 5 min, after which they were exposed to Kodak BIOMAX x-ray film. RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 cells using RNAzol according to the manufacturer's instructions, resolved by electrophoresis on formaldehyde/agarose gels, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were hybridized at 65 °C for at least 24 h with radiolabeled TF or CHO-B cDNA probes and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software, with TF signals normalized to CHO-B. The caveolar membrane isolation protocol of Lisanti et al. (33Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.-H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) was modified as follows: MM6 cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mmNaCl) containing 1 mm each NaVO4 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were adjusted to 45% sucrose, overlaid with 4 ml each 35 and 5% sucrose (in MES-buffered saline), and centrifuged 16–20 h at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Triton-insoluble membranes, including caveolae, float to the 5/35% interface (34Song K.S. Shengwen L. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions (1 ml) were assayed for light scattering at 600 nm, TF content by ELISA, and protein content (bicinchoninic acid assay). The densest three fractions contained approximately 500–700 μg of protein, and the lighter fractions contained ≤100 μg of protein. Proteins were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The entire fraction or 100 μg of protein (whichever was less) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted as above. MM6 cells were rinsed with ice-cold HBSS plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 10 μg/ml biotinylated goat anti-TF IgG (45 min at 4 °C). After rinsing, cells were incubated with streptavidin-Oregon Green (45 min at 4 °C), rinsed again, and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (10 min at 4 °C). The fixative was rinsed away, and cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in HBSS (10 min at 4 °C). After rinsing, cells were incubated 45 min on ice with HBSS plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml anti-α-adaptin mAb, rinsed in HBSS, 0.5% donkey serum, and then treated with donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy-3. After final rinsing, cells were collected onto a slide by cytospin centrifugation and mounted in 9:1 glycerol:HBSS, pH 8.5. Dual immunofluorescence detection of TF and α-adaptin was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad Life Science Group, Hercules, CA), equipped with a krypton/argon laser. A series of 0.2-μm optical sections in the z axis were analyzed with Confocal Assistant software written by T. C. Berlje (University of Minnesota). Images were pseudo-colored and merged using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Specificity of anti-TF staining was demonstrated by adding a large excess (100 μg/ml) of recombinant soluble TF, which reduced the level of staining to that observed in the absence of primary antibody. The degree of colocalization of TF with α-adaptin was quantified using an image analysis protocol described elsewhere (35Haase A.T. Henry K. Zupancic G. Sedgewick G. Faust R.A. Melroe H. Cavert W. Gebhard K. Staskus K. Zhang Z.-Q. Dailey P.J. Balfour Jr., H.H. Erice A. Perelson A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Briefly, the original confocal images were converted into binary images with Adobe Photoshop using a thresholding tool, such that no additional pixels were introduced into the signal after binarization. For these experiments, the resolution was approximately 0.2 μm/pixel. The individual binarized TF images were then multiplied with binarized α-adaptin signals at a 50% scale, so that the TF pixels remained white when they colocalized with α-adaptin pixels, but were gray when they did not colocalize. Colocalization was calculated as the percentage of white pixels relative to total pixels (gray plus white). For these analyses, a total of 6–11 cells and 5609–10,883 pixels were examined. LPS induces TF expression in cultured peripheral blood monocytes (36Schwartz B.S. Levy G.A. Fair D.S. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 1464-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in monocytic cell lines such as THP-1 (10Brand K. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4732-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and MM6 (37Tenno T. Botling J. Öberg F. Nilsson K. Siegbahn A. Thromb. Res. 1997; 88: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In many published studies, monocytes and monocytic cell lines have been cultured in media supplemented with serum. In this study, when MM6 cells were cultured in the serum-free medium AIM-V, we observed that adding very low concentrations of calf serum (0.01% and below) enhanced TF expression in response to LPS, whereas higher concentrations of serum (0.05–10%) reduced TF expression relative to that seen with 0.01% serum (Fig.1). Low levels of serum may enhance the responsiveness of MM6 cells to LPS by providing a source of LPS-binding protein (38Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), but it was unclear why higher concentrations of serum caused MM6 cells to express lower levels of TF following LPS stimulation. Serum contains FVIIa, the primary ligand for TF, and also TFPI, a reversible protease inhibitor that binds to the TF·FVIIa complex. Accordingly, we hypothesized that these molecules may bind to TF on monocytic cells and promote the down-regulation of TF expression. MM6 cells or PBMC were cultured in AIM-V medium supplemented with 0.01% calf serum to support optimal TF expression, typically measured 4–6 h after stimulating the cells with 10 ng/ml LPS. (0.01% serum contributes negligible levels of FVIIa or TFPI.) Cells incubated with TFPI after LPS stimulation expressed TF at levels comparable to cells treated with LPS alone (Fig. 2). Cells treated with FVIIa had very slightly reduced levels of TF. However, MM6 cells and PBMC treated with both TFPI and FVIIa had TF levels that were typically 50–60% of cells treated with LPS alone (Fig. 2). TFPI can react both with FXa and with FVIIa bound to TF. In some settings, the TFPI·FXa complex has a higher affinity for TF/FVIIa than does TFPI alone (39Girard T.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, addition of FXa to TFPI and FVIIa resulted in levels of TF expression by MM6 cells and PBMC that were similar to those of cells treated with TFPI and FVIIa without FXa. To simplify interpretation of results, most of the rest of the experiments in this study were therefore performed using TFPI and FVIIa without added FXa. The time course of TF expression in MM6 cells in response to LPS stimulation was altered when TFPI and FVIIa were included in the culture medium. Thus, MM6 cells cultured in the absence of these two proteins expressed more TF, and did so over a longer period of time, than did cells treated with a combination of TFPI and FVIIa (Fig.3). However, Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated 1 h after LPS stimulation revealed that TFPI and FVIIa had no effect on TF mRNA levels in MM6 cells (data not shown), indicating that these ligands affected a later stage of TF biosynthesis and/or degradation. Accordingly, the effect of TFPI and FVIIa on the half-life of TF protein in MM6 cells was examined by inducing TF expression with LPS, after which cycloheximide was added to block further protein synthesis. TF antigen levels were then quantified by ELISA (Fig. 4). Treating cells with TFPI and FVIIa reduced the half-life of TF protein 3-fold compared with control cells (mean half-lives of 3.7 h versus 1.3 h; n = 3). In subsequent experiments, the effect of TFPI and FVIIa on TF expression was evaluated in cells incubated for 6 h, since this time point consistently showed the largest difference in TF levels with and without treatment.Figure 4TFPI and FVIIa shorten the half-life of TF in MM6 cells. MM6 cells at 5.5 × 105 cells/ml were stimulated for 4 h with 10 ng/ml LPS, at which time 10 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to inhibit further TF synthesis (time = 0). The culture was split into two samples, which were either treated (•) or not (○) with 75 nm TFPI and 50 nmFVIIa for the indicated times. TF levels quantified by ELISA (mean ± S.D. from samples assayed in quadruplicate) are from a representative experiment. Mean half-lives calculated from three separate experiments were 3.7 h for untreated MM6 cells and 1.3 h for cells treated with TFPI and FVIIa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous studies showed that TF on the surfaces of endothelial cells (16Sevinsky J.R. Rao L.V.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (17Mulder A.B. Smit J.W. Bom V.J.J. Blom N.R. Ruiters M.H.J. Halie M.R.

In endothelial cells, translocation of TF from Triton-soluble to Triton-insoluble membrane fractions (associated with caveolae (18Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

When activated by dithiols, NTPase is one of the most potent apyrases known to date, but its physiological function remains unknown. The genes encoding NTPase have been cloned (Bermudes, D., Peck, K. R., Afifi-Afifi, M., Beckers, C. J. M., and Joiner, K. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29252–29260). We have recently shown that the enzyme is tightly controlled within the vacuolar space and may influence parasite exit from the host cell (Silverman, J. A., Qi, H., Riehl, A., Beckers, C., Nakaar, V., and Joiner, K. A (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 12352–12359). In the present study, we have generated an antisense NTP RNA construct in which the 3′-untranslated region is replaced by a hammerhead ribozyme. The constitutive synthesis of the chimeric antisense RNA-ribozyme construct in parasites that were stably transfected with this construct resulted in a dramatic reduction in the steady-state levels of NTPase. This inhibition was accompanied by a decrease in the capacity of the parasites to replicate. The reduction in parasite proliferation was due to a specific effect of antisense NTP RNA, since a drastic inhibition of hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HXGPRT) expression by a chimeric antisense HXGPRT RNA-ribozyme construct did not alter NTPase expression nor compromise parasite replication. These data implicate NTPase in an essential parasite function and suggest that NTPase may have more than one function in vivo. These results also establish that it is possible to study gene function in apicomplexan parasites using antisense RNA coupled to ribozymes.

These data implicate NTPase in an essential parasite function and suggest that NTPase may have more than one function in vivo. These results also establish that it is possible to study gene function in apicomplexan parasites using antisense RNA coupled to ribozymes. Apicomplexan parasites (e.g. Toxoplasma,Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium, and Eimeria) are prevalent worldwide and cause significant diseases in humans and animals. In particular, the obligate intracellular parasiteToxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic infection associated with AIDS and congenital neurological birth defects (1Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Treatment regimens for this infection are not always effective, and this has mandated the search for novel drug targets.

The 63-kDa NTPase isoforms are encoded by two genes,NTP1 and NTP3, which share more than 97% sequence identity (2Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi-Afifi M. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When activated in vitro by dithiols, NTPase is one of the most potent apyrases known to date, capable of sequentially degrading ATP to ADP and AMP (4Asai T. O'Sullivan W.J. Tatibana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6816-6822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because T. gondii is a purine auxotroph, it is thought that NTPase may participate in purine salvage (2Bermudes D. Peck K.R.

Recently we have shown that the enzyme may facilitate parasite exit from infected host cells (8Silverman J.A. Qi H. Riehl A. Beckers C. Nakaar V. Joiner K.A J. Biol.

However, the presence in the genome of multiple copies of a gene (such as NTP) combined with low frequency of homologous recombination in T. gondii, hamper gene targeting efforts in these organisms. Moreover, it is not feasible to investigate the biological function of essential genes using this approach because of the lethality of the phenotype. To circumvent these difficulties, we sought to develop an antisense strategy to inhibit gene expression inT. gondii. Antisense RNA has been shown to regulate gene expression in bacteria (12Green P.J. Pines O. Inouye M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 569-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), Dictyostelium (13Knecht D.A. Loomis W.F.

Nature. 1988; 333: 866-869Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar) but has not yet been demonstrated in the apicomplexan parasites. This strategy is at present still by trial and error. This may be partly ascribed to the finding that in eukaryotes, 3′-end formation of mRNA promotes the export of the mature transcript to the cytoplasm (21Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Birnstiel M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Since antisense-induced mRNA degradation in eukaryotes occurs in the nucleus (22Cornelissen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7203-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the use of a polyadenylated RNA may reduce the overall efficiency of antisense RNA. Eckner et al. (21Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Birnstiel M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have shown that substituting the normal polyadenylation signal with cis-acting ribozymes leads to the nuclear retention of the product RNAs by generating export-deficient transcripts (21Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Birnstiel M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules that are active in vitro, both in cell-free systems and in living cells (23Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 24Gu J.-L. Veerapanane D. Rossi J. Natarajan R. Thomas L. Nadler J. Circ.

J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1988; 260: 3030-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Sarver M. Cantin E. Chang P. Ladne P. Stephens D. Zaia J. Rossi J. Science. 1990; 247: 1222-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the expression of NTPase can be substantially inhibited by stably introducing into the parasite genome an antisense gene in which its 3′ end is modified by a hammerhead ribozyme. The attenuation of NTPase activity inhibits parasite proliferation, suggesting a role for NTPase in parasite metabolism. The inhibition of parasite replication was due to specific reduction in NTPase by antisense RNA, since a drastic reduction in hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HXGPRT) expression did not alter NTPase expression nor compromise parasite replication. The chimeric antisense RNA-ribozyme strategy should be useful for the study of gene function in other protozoan parasites. RH-strain of T. gondii parasites were cultivated in Vero cells or in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), and the tachyzoites were transfected with plasmid constructs pαNTP-RZ, pASHXRZ, or p5′NTP-RZ (see Fig. 1) subcloned into a vector containing the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate-synthase (DHFR-TS) gene, which confers pyrimethamine resistance for selection (29Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected in 1 μm pyrimethamine, and individual clones were isolated. Confluent cultures of HFF cells in 10-cm plates or 25-cm2T-flasks were inoculated with 106 freshly lysed-out parasite tachyzoites and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and the cultures were replaced with fresh medium so as to remove parasites that had not yet invaded. The doubling of intracellular parasites was followed by counting the number of tachyzoites per parasitophorous vacuole at the various times (at least 50 vacuoles were scored at each time point). The number of parasite divisions since infection was determined using log2 (parasite number) formula (30Fichera M.E. Bhopale M.K. Roos D.S. Antimicrob. Agent Chemother. 1995; 39: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Statistical significance was assessed by measures of analysis of variance and two-tailed t test. NTPase enzymatic activity was done as described previously using equivalent amounts of parasite extracts (2Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Afifi-Afifi M. Beckers C.J.M. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29252-29260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–10 μg of cell lysate was incubated with [2,8-3H]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 30 mmmagnesium acetate, 10 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction products were separated by TLC, spots corresponding to the nucleobase and 5′ products were excised, and the radioactivity was counted under liquid scintillation. HXGPRT activity and parasite replication were assayed by measuring the incorporation of [8-3H]xanthine (Moravek Biochemicals) and [5,6-3H]uracil (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. 2–5 × 105 parasites/well were used to infect monolayers of HFF in a 24-well plate at 37 °C. Unattached parasites were removed 4 h later, and after 24 h post-infection, 1 μCi of radiolabel was added to each well. Incubation was continued for 2–6 h before the monolayers were fixed with trichloroacetic acid, rinsed, and counted as described (31Pfefferkorn E.R. Nothnagel R.F. Borotz S.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,32Donald R.G.K. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were isolated from parasites with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and Northern blot analyses were performed with 10 μg of total RNA using gel-purified NTP cDNA probe (corresponding to the 1.98-kilobaseXhoI-EcoO109IA fragment of NTP1; see Fig. 1) labeled by random priming with [α32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were done at 65 °C in a solution containing 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt and 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml tRNA. The filters were washed at 65 °C with several changes of 1× saline, sodium phosphate, EDTA, 0.1% SDS followed by 0.1× saline, sodium phosphate, EDTA, 0.1% SDS and exposed for autoradiography. Between 106 and 107parasites were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, and the material was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The filters were probed with anti-HXGPRT antiserum (generously given by Buddy Ullman, Portland, Oregon) or with anti-NTPase polyclonal antibody, GRA3, and SAG1 monoclonal antibodies as described previously (2Bermudes D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15350-15357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were generally used at 1:1000 dilution. Secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit were horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Boehringer Mannheim) used at 1:2000 dilution followed by detection with ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We targeted the gene encoding the abundant NTPase in T. gondii for inhibition by antisense RNA. Previous experiments by others suggest that a high ratio of transfected antisense RNA to the endogenous mRNA is required for effective reduction of expression of the target gene (34Kim S.K. Wold B.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Izant J.G. Weintraub H. Science. 1985; 229: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To increase the effectiveness of the antisense expressing vector (Fig. 1), we designed a construct that incorporated potentially enhancing features: a potent NTP promoter (36Nakaar V. Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the inclusion of an autocatalytic ribozyme structure and RNA structural elements that may act to stabilize the antisense RNA, as well as the possible enrichment for antisense RNA within the nuclear compartment (21Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Birnstiel M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 37Liu Z. Batt D.B. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4258-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Substituting the polyadenylation signal with a cis-acting ribozyme that cleaves in a site-specified manner leads to nuclear retention of the product RNAs by generating export-deficient transcripts (21Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Birnstiel M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 37Liu Z. Batt D.B. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4258-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We inserted a hammerhead ribozyme (23Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) immediately downstream of the antisense DNA, thus replacing the 3′-untranslated region of the gene. This operation potentially creates a pool of antisense RNA in the nucleus comparable with the endogenous mRNA. Since 3′-end formation promotes the export of mature polyadenylated RNA from the nuclear compartment where antisense effects most likely occur in eukaryotes, we did not include in these experiments a plasmid containing NTP antisense sequences with a polyadenylation signal (21Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Birnstiel M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 22Cornelissen M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7203-7209Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Kim S.K. Wold B.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Izant J.G.

A. 1994; 91: 4258-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clones expressing antisense NTP RNA (and hereafter referred to as AS-NTP) displayed a dramatic reduction in NTPase enzymatic activity, ranging from ∼4 to >19-fold (Fig.2 A). The variation in the degree of inhibition as revealed by the enzymatic assay is considered a general feature of antisense inhibition (20van der Krol A.R. Lenting P.E. Veenstra J. van der Meer I.M. Koes R.E. Gerats A.G.M. Mol J.N.M. Stuitje A.R. Nature. 1988; 333: 866-869Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 38Smith C.J.S. Watson C.F. Ray J. Bird C.R. Morris P.C. Schuch W. Grierson D. Nature. 1988; 334: 724-726Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This variation may be related to the difference in the steady-state levels of antisense RNA generated due to chromosomal location of the gene or in copy number of the integrated gene (38Smith C.J.S. Watson C.F. Ray J. Bird C.R. Morris P.C. Schuch W. Grierson D. Nature. 1988; 334: 724-726Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 39Rodermel S.R. Abbott M.S. Bogorad L. Cell. 1988; 55: 673-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To ascertain that reduction in enzyme activity was due to reduced synthesis of the protein, the amount of NTPase protein was assessed by immunoblot. NTPase levels were reduced between 86 to 88% when compared with WT in selected clones expressing antisense RNA and correlated with the decrease in enzymatic activity (Fig. 2 B). To control for the possible nonspecific effects of antisense RNA, we measured the levels of another dense granule protein, GRA3, and of the surface antigen, SAG1. The level of each of these proteins was comparable in all the samples analyzed. By immunofluorescence, NTPase signal was reduced in the transformants, whereas SAG1 expression was not affected (data not shown). The controls in these experiments indicated that the expression of antisense NTP RNA did not globally impair parasite metabolism. We determined the steady-state levels of NTP transcripts by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 C). NTP RNA levels were depressed at least by 2- to 6-fold in clones expressing antisense RNA. There appeared to be a good correlation between the steady-state levels of NTP RNA and the synthesis of the protein as assessed by Northern blot and immunoblot, respectively. Using a double-stranded DNA probe in Northern hybridization, we did not detect antisense RNA, although dot blot analysis revealed the presence of the gene in the genomic DNA of stably transfected clones (data not shown). One possible reason for this is that the antisense transcripts or their cleavage products are highly unstable and are degraded extremely rapidly in the parasite. However, the reduced steady-state levels of NTP mRNA coupled with the lack of detection of antisense RNA in the transfected clones is consistent with observations in other systems (38Smith C.J.S. Watson C.F. Ray J. Bird C.R. Morris P.C. Schuch W. Grierson D. Nature. 1988; 334: 724-726Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 39Rodermel S.R. Abbott M.S. Bogorad L.

Genet. 1995; 246: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is generally assumed to be caused by duplex formation between antisense RNA and the target mRNA in the nucleus, thereby interfering with normal nuclear processing, cytoplasmic export, and translation of mRNA (34Kim S.K. Wold B.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Izant J.G. Weintraub H. Science. 1985; 229: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A direct inhibition of the production of NTPase through disruption of mRNA processing and transport seems plausible since ribozyme-processed RNA has been shown to be retained in the nuclear compartment (21Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Birnstiel M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 37Liu Z. Batt D.B. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4258-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results indicate that antisense RNA can block mRNA and protein expression in T. gondii. Parasites expressing antisense RNA were impaired in intracellular replication but not invasion. At 8 h after infection, equal numbers of parasitophorous vacuoles were established by both control (108 ± 4.9) and antisense-expressing clones (114 ± 7.2, 111 ± 14.3; Table I), indicating that transgenic parasites that had a normal morphology invaded host cells normally. However, once inside the cell, the transgenic parasites divided more slowly than wild type, as evidenced by two different assays for parasite replication: intracellular doubling (Table I; Fig.3, A, B, andC) and nucleobase uptake (Fig. 3 D). For example, at 24 h after inoculation, the average doubling for the control was 2.89, which differed from 2.17 and 1.67 (p < 0.01), displayed by the antisense-expressing parasites (Table I). For the control parasites, this doubling corresponds to a replication time of about 8 h, similar to that previously reported (30Fichera M.E. Bhopale M.K. Roos D.S. Antimicrob. Agent Chemother. 1995; 39: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The reduced replication of the antisense parasites is coincident with reduced [3H]uracil incorporated into parasite nucleic acid pools as shown by the lower values (37 and 48%) in transformants relative to wild type (Fig. 3 D). The lag in replication of the transformants in the first 24–32 h after infection may reflect the deficit in initial NTPase levels and represents the time needed to overcome this deficit by synthesis, packaging into dense granules, and exocytosis of a threshold amount of NTPase into the vacuolar space.Table IDistribution of parasitophorous vacuole sizes in antisense-expressing and control parasitesSampleTime after entry into vacuole% vacuoles with the following No. of parasite doublings (No. of parasites/vacuole)aMean ± S.E. from experiments involving the examination of at least 50 independent vacuoles at each time point in four different experiments is shown.

There was no significant difference (P < 0.5) between control and the experimental groups. Antisense-expressing parasites continued to replicate but at a reduced rate. At the 24-h time point, 66% of parasitophorous vacuoles of the control parasites were at ≥8-cell stage, whereas for the antisense clones, only 25 and 36% were at ≥8-cell stage. Similarly, at 32 h, 48% of the parasitophorous vacuoles of the control were at ≥16-cell stage, and for the transformants, only 18 and 24% were at ≥16-cell stage.b NS, not significant; P was determined by analysis of variance against control. Open table in a new tab Stably transfected transgenic clones and control RH parasites were inoculated into fresh HFF cells. After 4 h, parasites that did not infect were washed off, and the number of parasites per vacuole was scored at the indicated times. The average number of vacuoles is expressed as % and plotted in Fig. 3. Parasite doublings were determined by log2(parasite number). To further control for nonspecific effects of antisense RNA, we employed two additional constructs; the histone-ribozyme vector, p5′NTPRZ (Fig. 1 A) and pAS-HXRZ, containing the HXGPRTgene in the antisense orientation (Fig. 1 B). Stable, pyrimethamine-resistant lines expressing these constructs showed no significant reduction in NTPase levels (Fig.4 A) nor in NTPase enzymatic activity (clones AS-HXRZ-26, 32, andRZ; Fig. 4 C). In contrast, parasites harboring pAS-HXRZ displayed a profound reduction in HXGPRT levels (Fig.4 A), which was accompanied by a significant reduction in HXGPRT activity (Fig. 4 B). These transgenic parasites did not reveal any morphological changes nor any growth retardation (Fig.4 D) and were comparable with the control HXGPRT knock out strain of RH (KO; Fig. 4, C and D). Similarly, parasite replication was not significantly reduced in parasites harboring the p5′NTPRZ construct (RZ; Fig.4 D). The reduction in HXGPRT activity with no adverse effects on parasite replication is consistent with the finding thatHXGPRTis not an essential gene (32Donald R.G.K. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These results also suggest that promoter interference or squelching is not responsible for the inhibition of endogenous NTP expression. Although we have not directly tested these constructs (Fig. 1) in host cells, it is unlikely that they affect host cell growth or viability because they are driven by the developmentally regulated NTP promoter (32Donald R.G.K. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the inhibition of parasite replication is a consequence of a deficit in NTPase production brought about by antisense NTP RNA. We propose that NTPase is functionally required for proliferation ofT. gondii. The molecular mechanism by which the reduction in NTPase levels leads to inhibition of parasite replication is unknown. Nevertheless, this study implicates NTPase for the first time in an essential parasite function. Data from other studies support the notion that NTPase may have a regulatory function in T. gondiigrowth and replication. First, NTPase activity is tightly regulated invivo, as unfettered activation of the enzyme leads to rapid exit of parasites from the host cell (8Silverman J.A. Qi H. Riehl A. Beckers C. Nakaar V. Joiner K.A J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12352-12359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Second, it has been shown that quercetin (P-type ATPase inhibitor) effectively prevents growth ofT. gondii in culture at concentrations that inhibit NTPase by >90% in vitro (41.Asai, T. & Sibley, L. D. (1996) Fourth International Biennial Toxoplasma Conference, July 22–26, 1996 (abstract), Drymen, Scotland.Google Scholar). Third, the secretion of NTPase into the parasitophorous vacuoles occurs shortly before replication ofToxoplasma sporozoites (infective forms within oocysts generated after the sexual cycle in the definitive feline host) (42Tilley M. Fichera M.E. Jerome M.E. Roos D.S. White M.W. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, NTP promoter activity is developmentally down-regulated in bradyzoites, the slowly dividing form of T. gondii that persists in the host as a chronic infection (36Nakaar V. Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Of interest, in gene knock out experiments we have never recovered any clones with a disrupted NTP1 or NTP3 gene locus, although we have employed targeting vectors with large contiguous genomic sequences. This suggests indirectly that NTPase is an essential gene and may thus provide a potential target for chemotherapy in T. gondii. The experiments were undertaken in this study to demonstrate the biological role of NTPase, one of the most potent ATP degrading enzymes, in the metabolism of the parasite. To this end, we employed antisense RNA coupled to a hammerhead ribozyme to reveal the role of NTPase in parasite proliferation. Although it remains to be formally proven, a complete abrogation of NTPase expression may be incompatible with parasite growth and survival. Since NTPase can also influence parasite exit from the host cell (8Silverman J.A. Qi H. Riehl A. Beckers C. Nakaar V. Joiner K.A J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12352-12359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that the physiological role of NTPase may be multifunctional. In this study, we have also shown that even a very abundant protein such as NTPase or HXGPRT is titratable by antisense RNA. Because it is effective and simple, antisense RNA strategy should find widespread application among apicomplexan parasites for the rapid analysis of gene function. For example, genes that are refractory to targeted gene disruption or essential genes that generate a lethal phenotype when they are disrupted, are especially amenable to this strategy. We thank G.

Alternative splicing of a 38-amino acid region between TM3 and TM4, termed the flip/flop module specified by exons 14 and 15 of the GluR-B gene (9Kohler M. Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol.

A genome-encoded glutamine (Q) codon (CAG) in exon 11, located in TM2 of AMPA receptor subunits, has been identified as a key residue that controls Ca2+ permeability (11Hollmann M. Hartley M.

Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Since an arginine (R) CIG codon is generated by editing, the site is designated as the Q/R site (1Simpson L. Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev.

Editing at the Q/R site occurs almost completely in GluR-B transcripts (>99%), as demonstrated by RT-PCR analysis of brain RNA isolated from adult rats (14Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H.

A second A-to-I editing site, termed the R/G site due to a conversion of an arginine (R) codon (AGA) to a glycine (G) codon (IGA), occurs in the GluR-B, -C, and -D subunits; the R/G site is the last codon of exon 13, immediately upstream of the flip/flop module (9Kohler M.

Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Editing at the R/G site controls the kinetic properties of AMPA receptor channels because alteration of this single amino acid leads to faster recovery rates from receptor desensitization (16Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Hoger T. Geiger J.R.P. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the RNA elements dictating the GluR-B editing specificity at the Q/R site revealed a unique cis-acting inverted repeat sequence located in the proximal portion of intron 11, which is predicted to form an imperfect duplex structure with the exon 11 sequence spanning the Q/R site (13, Fig. 1 A). Similar duplex RNA structures also exist within exon 13 containing the R/G site and the proximal portion of intron 13 in the genes of the GluR-B, -C, and -D subunits (Fig. 1 A) but are absent in the gene encoding GluR-A subunit (16Lomeli H.

Mutational analyses established that these exon-intron dsRNA structures are absolutely essential for efficient editing at the Q/R and R/G sites (13Higuchi M. Single F.N. Kohler M. Sommer B.

In addition, multiple editing sites within intron 11 have been identified that also undergo A-to-I modification; these are referred to as hotspots (13Higuchi M. Single F.N. Kohler M. Sommer B.

The ADAR1 cDNA specified a 1226-amino acid protein that contains in the central region three functionally distinct copies of the highly conserved double-stranded RNA-binding motif (dsRBM), designated as dsRBMI, dsRBMII, and dsRBMIII. These dsRBM copies constitute the RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) and are implicated in the recognition of dsRNA structures within the substrate RNAs (25Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell.

Two immunologically related forms of the human ADAR1 deaminase that differ in size, intracellular location, and interferon inducibility are present in a variety of human cell lines; an interferon-inducible ∼150-kDa protein is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and a constitutively expressed ∼110-kDa truncated protein is present predominantly if not exclusively in the nucleus (25Patterson J.B.

The ADAR1-c variant has an additional deletion of 19 amino acids within exon 6 located between dsRBMII and dsRBMIII resulting from an alternative 3′-splice-site selection (36Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the three ADAR1 isoforms exhibit comparable deaminase activity measured with a synthetic dsRNA substrate, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the three dsRBM copies of the ADAR1 variants are functionally distinct (36Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similar to ADAR1, multiple splice variant isoforms of ADAR2 have been identified, some of which show altered deaminase activities (28Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast to the case of ADAR1, the alternative splice-site variants identified for ADAR2 differ within the catalytic deaminase domain by insertion of an Alu-like sequence, or at the C terminus (28Lai F.

Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 52: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), rather than in the central RNA-binding region as seen for ADAR1. The ADAR1 and ADAR2 deaminases show different activities for GluR-B RNA transcripts as indicated by editing analyses in vitro (28Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Recombinant ADAR1-a enzyme possesses little editing activity at the Q/R site but efficiently modifies the intron hotspot adenosine at the +60 site of GluR-B pre-mRNA (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, recombinant ADAR2 enzyme efficiently edits the Q/R site of GluR-B transcripts (28Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 41Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Both ADAR enzymes are capable of editing the R/G site of GluR-B pre-mRNA (28Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol.

Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated, using a synthetic dsRNA substrate, that the three dsRNA-binding motifs of ADAR1 are functionally distinct within the three splice-site variant isoforms (36Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we describe the site-dependent editing of GluR-B RNA in vitro by the splice variant isoforms of ADAR1 and the editing patterns in vivo in RNA from dissected brain regions. Although the three recombinant ADAR1 variants a, b, and c were comparably active in vitro for editing the intron +60 hotspot of GluR-B pre-mRNA, none was active for the adjacent Q/R exon site. The R/G exon site was edited by all three variants, but ADAR1-b and -c displayed higher editing activity than ADAR1-a. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses of the RNA transcripts from different rat brain regions revealed differential expression levels of the GluR-B flip and flop receptor isoforms, with region-specific differences in editing efficiency at the R/G site. Construction of ADAR1 expression vectors in pcDNA I/Neo was as described previously (31Liu Y. Herbert A. Rich A. Samuel C.E.

Wild-type FL and M296 constructs included the three naturally occurring splice-site variants ADAR1-a, -b, and -c (36Liu Y. George C.X. Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4419-4428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mutant ADAR1-b constructs likewise have been described (32Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J.

These substitution mutants include the three single mutants, each with one of the three dsRBM motifs mutated: dsRBMI(K554E), dsRBMII(K665E), or dsRBMIII (K776E) designated as the RI, RII or RIII mutant, respectively (32Liu Y. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double substitution mutant of ADAR1 deficient in catalytic activity, designated as the “C” mutant and constructed in the M296 form of ADAR1-b, possesses H910Q and E912A substitutions within the highly conserved CHAE sequence of the C-terminal deaminase catalytic domain (32Liu Y.

Monkey kidney COS-1 cells, maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), were transfected with wild-type or mutant cDNA expression vectors by the DEAE-dextran-chloroquine phosphate method for the expression of ADAR1 proteins (44Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Recombinant ADAR1 proteins were prepared from cytoplasmic extracts as described previously (31Liu Y.

ADAR1 protein levels were monitored by Western immunoblot analysis carried out with antiserum (1:500 dilution) generated against recombinant ADAR1 protein expressed inEscherichia coli as described previously (25Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Antibody-antigen complexes were subsequently detected with125I-labeled protein A (0.05 mCi/ml; ICN) by autoradiography, and quantitation was done using a molecular imager system (Bio-Rad GS-525). The dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase activity of the expressed recombinant ADAR1 proteins was routinely measured with a 32P-labeled synthetic dsRNA substrate as described previously (25Patterson J.B.

Conversion of adenosine to inosine was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on cellulose NM 300 glass plates (Macherey & Nagel) to separate IMP and AMP, following hydrolysis of the deaminated RNA product with nuclease P1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation was carried out with the molecular imaging system. The following oligonucleotides were used for subcloning and construction of mouse GluR-B minigenes (9Kohler M. Kornau H.C. Seeburg P.H.

The oligonucleotides derived from exons 13, 14, and 15 were also used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the alternatively spliced flip and flop isoforms of GluR-B RNA transcripts from rat brain RNA since these sequences are identical between mouse and rat GluR-B genes.

Ligand-conjugated poly-l-lysine (poly K)-DNA complexes directed at this receptor deliver reporter genes, specifically, to receptor-bearing cells. The synthetic ligands are based in sequence on amino acids 346–374 of human α1-antitrypsin (9Ziady A.G. Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Gerken T. Beegen H. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. Am. J. Phys. 1997; 273: G545-G552PubMed Google Scholar). We undertook a systematic study of the contribution of the protein portion of the complex to intensity and duration of gene expression.Prior studies of the composition of the protein portion of receptor-directed gene transfer complexes have focused on the degree of substitution (6Wagner E. Cotten M. Foisner R. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4255-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 15Erbacher P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Midoux P. Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One study did not find a consistent relationship between chain length and gene expression in vitro (6Wagner E. Cotten M. Foisner R. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4255-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). No study has examined the relation between the chain length of poly K used to condense DNA and duration of expression. Moreover, it is not clear whether modifications worked out in an in vitro model can be applied to the in vivo situation (16Ferkol T. Lindberg G.L. Perales J.C. Chen J. Ratnoff O.D. Hanson R.W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Ferkol T. Perales J.C. Kaetzel C.S. Eckman E. Hanson R.W. Davis P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 493-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our system has several advantages for studies of this type, including the ability to determine the extent of lysine substitution by linker and ligand, even at very low levels, with NMR. Furthermore, the same ligands bind to the receptors of human, mouse, and rat, thus allowing parallel examination in vitro in human cells and in vivo in animal models. We used this system to investigate the influence of chain length of poly K used on the intensity and duration of gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Using our in vitro model, we compared the optimally substituted poly K molecules of average chain length 36 with those of average chain length 256. Longer chain poly K molecules gave significantly longer duration of expression both in vitro and in vivothan shorter chain poly K molecules for a given ligand and degree of substitution.Manipulation of the protein portion of receptor-targeted DNA complexes strongly influenced the duration and intensity of gene expression. This demonstration, in vitro and in vivo, addresses some of the limitations of the system and provides a new basis for improvement of this molecular conjugate for therapeutic purposes.DISCUSSIONThe composition of the protein portion of receptor-targeted gene transfer protein-DNA complexes profoundly affects the intensity and duration of gene expression, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro the number of ligands/DNA molecule, the identity of the ligand, and the chain length of poly K all have strong effects on intensity and duration of gene expression, but the most striking effect was that of poly K chain length on the duration of expression. Using the ligand and number of ligands/DNA molecule found to be optimal in the cell culture system, we tested the effect of poly K chain length on in vivo expression. Complexes made with long chain poly K produced much more protracted gene expression in vivo than complexes prepared with short chain poly K.Optimization of the SEC-R-directed gene transfer for in HuH7 cells resulted in greatly increased reporter gene expression (relative to Lipofectin control) compared with our prior report (9Ziady A.G. Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Gerken T. Beegen H. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. Am. J. Phys. 1997; 273: G545-G552PubMed Google Scholar). Activity in the best complexes tested in the present study was about 20-fold higher than activity produced by the same amount of plasmid DNA delivered with the Lipofectin reagent; in our previous report maximal activity was less than the Lipofectin control. Increased peak activity indicates increased efficiency, which has been a problem for most nonviral strategies. At the same time, duration of activity could be greatly prolonged in vitro by informed selection of the specific receptor ligand (C105Y versus C1315), the number of ligands/plasmid DNA molecule (over 2–40 ligands), and the chain length of poly K used to condense the DNA. It is likely that the number of ligands and the identity of the ligand entrains routing within the cell, with the best complexes promoting routing into the endosomal compartment rather than to the lysosomal degradative pathway. For another receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor, high number of ligands promotes lysosomal trafficking, whereas fewer ligands promote endosomal recycling (27Lai W.H. Cameron P.H. Doherty II, I.W.J.-J. Kay D.G. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), so fewer ligands might well entrain a more favorable trafficking pattern, delaying the destruction of delivered DNA. In addition, different ligands for some receptors, such as the transferrin receptor, may be trafficked differently (28Scidmore M.A. Ficher E.R. Hackstadt T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may account for the differences in duration of expression for complexes containing the two SEC-R ligands, which have very similar affinity for the receptor and very similar initial transgene expression.In vitro, the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene persisted (within a log maximum) in HuH7 cells for at least 40 days for some complexes that contained the long chain poly K-ligand conjugates. Because the half-life of the luciferase protein in mammalian cells is 3 h (29Brubaker J.O. Thompson C.M. Morrison L.A. Knipe D.M. Siber G.R. Finberg R.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1598-1604PubMed Google Scholar) and we observed rapid decline in luciferase activity in HuH7 cells transfected using Lipofectin (thus, HuH7 cells do not retain high levels of luciferase activity, however the gene is delivered), protracted luciferase expression from complexes made with long chain poly K probably represents continuing transcription of plasmid DNA. In an in vitro assay, we did not observe transcription from plasmid DNA compacted with either short or long chain poly K, so it is likely that in vivo, plasmid DNA separates from poly K before transcription. These considerations suggest that the prolonged expression results from retention of plasmid DNA complexed with poly K for a longer period of time for complexes containing long chain poly K than for the short chain. Condensation with poly K protects DNA against degradation (4Michael S.I. Curiel D.T. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar), and better protection is afforded by long chain poly K than short chain in in vitro assays. Thus, we speculate that plasmid DNA is retained within the cell for both complexes (because both have better persistence of expression than Lipofectin) with gradual degradation, which is resisted longer by complexes containing long chain poly K. Whether the complexes reside in membrane-bound cytoplasmic compartments, the cytoplasm, or the nucleus is not yet clear. It is also possible that the less tightly compacted complexes with the shorter poly K allow better access for the RNA polymerase to the DNA and accounts for the higher initial expression. In such a scenario, transgene expression would depend on a dynamic relationship between the availability of the DNA for transcription and the rate of its subsequent degradation.Transgene activity persists better in vitro (40 days) thanin vivo (less than 30 days), even for genes delivered using complexes containing long chain poly K. There are probably several reasons for this difference. In vitro, only processes within the transfected cell account for decay of transgene activity, whereasin vivo, immune processes can be recruited to destroy cells expressing proteins not recognized as “self.” Bacterial β-galactosidase has been shown, in and of itself, to incite cytotoxic lymphocyte responses in vivo, and therefore, cells expressing this protein are preferentially targeted and destroyed (27Lai W.H. Cameron P.H. Doherty II, I.W.J.-J. Kay D.G. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is probably one mechanism of extinguishing β-galactosidase activity. In addition, the HuH7 cells transfected in vitroare immortal but fail to grow and divide after about 12–14 days under our culture conditions if they are not subcultured. In vivo, normal cell turnover of transfected cells may limit duration of expression.Complexes containing a minimal number of ligands that specifically deliver exogenous DNA to receptor bearing cells might be less immunogenic than more heavily substituted complexes.

Immunol. 1962; 88: 330-338PubMed Google Scholar) have been found to be relatively nonimmunogenic. Thus, possible immunogenicity of receptor-targeted complexes in vivo may depend on the ligand portion and, in part, its abundance. The abundance of SEC-R in lung, liver, and brain (14Perlmutter D.H.

The development of optimal complexes that produce high level gene expression for short (9.7-kDa poly K conjugates) or longer (53.7-kDa poly K conjugates) periods of time will be useful in achieving optimal therapeutic effects. Receptor-mediated gene transfer has great appeal as a strategy for gene therapy because of its specificity and low toxicity in vivo but has drawbacks, including low level and transient gene expression (1Cotten M.

Ligand-conjugated poly-l-lysine (poly K)-DNA complexes directed at this receptor deliver reporter genes, specifically, to receptor-bearing cells. The synthetic ligands are based in sequence on amino acids 346–374 of human α1-antitrypsin (9Ziady A.G. Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Gerken T. Beegen H. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. Am. J.

Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One study did not find a consistent relationship between chain length and gene expression in vitro (6Wagner E. Cotten M. Foisner R. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4255-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). No study has examined the relation between the chain length of poly K used to condense DNA and duration of expression. Moreover, it is not clear whether modifications worked out in an in vitro model can be applied to the in vivo situation (16Ferkol T. Lindberg G.L. Perales J.C. Chen J. Ratnoff O.D. Hanson R.W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Ferkol T. Perales J.C. Kaetzel C.S. Eckman E. Hanson R.W. Davis P.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 493-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our system has several advantages for studies of this type, including the ability to determine the extent of lysine substitution by linker and ligand, even at very low levels, with NMR. Furthermore, the same ligands bind to the receptors of human, mouse, and rat, thus allowing parallel examination in vitro in human cells and in vivo in animal models. We used this system to investigate the influence of chain length of poly K used on the intensity and duration of gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Using our in vitro model, we compared the optimally substituted poly K molecules of average chain length 36 with those of average chain length 256. Longer chain poly K molecules gave significantly longer duration of expression both in vitro and in vivothan shorter chain poly K molecules for a given ligand and degree of substitution. Manipulation of the protein portion of receptor-targeted DNA complexes strongly influenced the duration and intensity of gene expression. This demonstration, in vitro and in vivo, addresses some of the limitations of the system and provides a new basis for improvement of this molecular conjugate for therapeutic purposes. DISCUSSIONThe composition of the protein portion of receptor-targeted gene transfer protein-DNA complexes profoundly affects the intensity and duration of gene expression, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro the number of ligands/DNA molecule, the identity of the ligand, and the chain length of poly K all have strong effects on intensity and duration of gene expression, but the most striking effect was that of poly K chain length on the duration of expression. Using the ligand and number of ligands/DNA molecule found to be optimal in the cell culture system, we tested the effect of poly K chain length on in vivo expression. Complexes made with long chain poly K produced much more protracted gene expression in vivo than complexes prepared with short chain poly K.Optimization of the SEC-R-directed gene transfer for in HuH7 cells resulted in greatly increased reporter gene expression (relative to Lipofectin control) compared with our prior report (9Ziady A.G. Perales J.C. Ferkol T. Gerken T. Beegen H. Perlmutter D.H. Davis P.B. Am. J. Phys. 1997; 273: G545-G552PubMed Google Scholar). Activity in the best complexes tested in the present study was about 20-fold higher than activity produced by the same amount of plasmid DNA delivered with the Lipofectin reagent; in our previous report maximal activity was less than the Lipofectin control. Increased peak activity indicates increased efficiency, which has been a problem for most nonviral strategies. At the same time, duration of activity could be greatly prolonged in vitro by informed selection of the specific receptor ligand (C105Y versus C1315), the number of ligands/plasmid DNA molecule (over 2–40 ligands), and the chain length of poly K used to condense the DNA. It is likely that the number of ligands and the identity of the ligand entrains routing within the cell, with the best complexes promoting routing into the endosomal compartment rather than to the lysosomal degradative pathway. For another receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor, high number of ligands promotes lysosomal trafficking, whereas fewer ligands promote endosomal recycling (27Lai W.H. Cameron P.H. Doherty II, I.W.J.-J. Kay D.G. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), so fewer ligands might well entrain a more favorable trafficking pattern, delaying the destruction of delivered DNA. In addition, different ligands for some receptors, such as the transferrin receptor, may be trafficked differently (28Scidmore M.A. Ficher E.R. Hackstadt T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may account for the differences in duration of expression for complexes containing the two SEC-R ligands, which have very similar affinity for the receptor and very similar initial transgene expression.In vitro, the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene persisted (within a log maximum) in HuH7 cells for at least 40 days for some complexes that contained the long chain poly K-ligand conjugates. Because the half-life of the luciferase protein in mammalian cells is 3 h (29Brubaker J.O. Thompson C.M. Morrison L.A. Knipe D.M. Siber G.R. Finberg R.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1598-1604PubMed Google Scholar) and we observed rapid decline in luciferase activity in HuH7 cells transfected using Lipofectin (thus, HuH7 cells do not retain high levels of luciferase activity, however the gene is delivered), protracted luciferase expression from complexes made with long chain poly K probably represents continuing transcription of plasmid DNA. In an in vitro assay, we did not observe transcription from plasmid DNA compacted with either short or long chain poly K, so it is likely that in vivo, plasmid DNA separates from poly K before transcription. These considerations suggest that the prolonged expression results from retention of plasmid DNA complexed with poly K for a longer period of time for complexes containing long chain poly K than for the short chain. Condensation with poly K protects DNA against degradation (4Michael S.I. Curiel D.T. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar), and better protection is afforded by long chain poly K than short chain in in vitro assays. Thus, we speculate that plasmid DNA is retained within the cell for both complexes (because both have better persistence of expression than Lipofectin) with gradual degradation, which is resisted longer by complexes containing long chain poly K. Whether the complexes reside in membrane-bound cytoplasmic compartments, the cytoplasm, or the nucleus is not yet clear. It is also possible that the less tightly compacted complexes with the shorter poly K allow better access for the RNA polymerase to the DNA and accounts for the higher initial expression. In such a scenario, transgene expression would depend on a dynamic relationship between the availability of the DNA for transcription and the rate of its subsequent degradation.Transgene activity persists better in vitro (40 days) thanin vivo (less than 30 days), even for genes delivered using complexes containing long chain poly K. There are probably several reasons for this difference. In vitro, only processes within the transfected cell account for decay of transgene activity, whereasin vivo, immune processes can be recruited to destroy cells expressing proteins not recognized as “self.” Bacterial β-galactosidase has been shown, in and of itself, to incite cytotoxic lymphocyte responses in vivo, and therefore, cells expressing this protein are preferentially targeted and destroyed (27Lai W.H. Cameron P.H. Doherty II, I.W.J.-J. Kay D.G. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is probably one mechanism of extinguishing β-galactosidase activity. In addition, the HuH7 cells transfected in vitroare immortal but fail to grow and divide after about 12–14 days under our culture conditions if they are not subcultured. In vivo, normal cell turnover of transfected cells may limit duration of expression.Complexes containing a minimal number of ligands that specifically deliver exogenous DNA to receptor bearing cells might be less immunogenic than more heavily substituted complexes. DNA (30Ebner R. Derynck R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and poly-l-amino acids (31Maurer P.H. J.

Recently, we demonstrated that Ifn-γ can significantly potentiate TNF-α-induced nuclear factor (NF)-κB nuclear translocation in neuronal derived and endothelial cell lines. The mechanism by which these two cytokines exert their synergistic effect on NF-κB involves the de novo degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBβ. The double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase PKR is Ifn-inducible and has been implicated in the activation of NF-κB; therefore, we examined the possibility that PKR may play a role in the synergistic activation of NF-κB during TNF-α/Ifn-γ cotreatment. The PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP) inhibited TNF-α/Ifn-γ-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation in neuronal derived cells but not in endothelial cells. The induced degradation of IκBβ, which is normally observed upon TNF-α/Ifn-γ cotreatment, was blocked completely by 2-AP in neuronal derived cells. Also, 2-AP treatment or overexpression of a catalytically inactive PKR inhibited the TNF-α/Ifn-γ-induced synergistic activation of κB-dependent gene expression. Our results suggest that the signal generated by Ifn-γ during TNF-α/Ifn-γ cotreatment may require PKR to elicit enhanced NF-κB activity, and this signal may affect the stability of the IκBβ protein.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). However, IκBα is characteristically involved in the transient activation of NF-κB, whereas IκBβ has been implicated in the persistent activation of NF-κB (14Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J.

Typically, the coregulatory effects involve the independent activation of NF-κB by TNF-α (for review, see Ref. 4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

Recently, we reported that Ifn-γ, which typically does not activate NF-κB, synergistically enhances TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of p50-p65 NF-κB heterodimers and synergistically activates κB-dependent gene expression (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the mechanism for this synergistic activation involved the de novo degradation of the IκBβ protein and that the TNF-α/Ifn-γ coactivation of NF-κB in PC12 cells is sensitive to the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important signal transduction molecule that is targeted by Ifns is the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR). This serine/threonine kinase was first discovered as a translation inhibitor because of its ability to phosphorylate and deactivate the translation initiation factor, eIF-2 (for review, see Ref. 28Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). It plays a role in cellular antiviral responses and growth control and is a candidate tumor supressor gene (for review, see Refs. 29Proud C.G. Trends Biochem.

PKR is Ifn-inducible, is present at low levels in most cells, and is found in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm (31Jeffrey I.W. Kadereit S. Meurs E.F. Metzger T. Bachmann M. Schwemmle M. Hovanessian A.G. Clemens M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that activation of NF-κB by dsRNA, but not by TNF-α or interleukin-1β, may involve PKR and that PKR may phosphorylate IκBα in vitro (32Kumar A. Yang Y.-L. Flati V. Der S.

In this report, we provide evidence supporting a role for PKR involvement in the synergistic activation of NF-κB by TNF-α/Ifn-γ cotreatment in the preneuronal derived cell line, PC12. The PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP) (36Zinn K. Keller A. Whittemore L.-A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Hu Y. Conway T.W. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) blocks synergistic TNF-α/Ifn-γ-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation. The requirement for PKR may be specific for cells of neuronal origin because 2-AP was able to block the synergy in another neuronal derived cell line (B12), but not in an endothelial cell line (EA.hy926). The synergistic activation of κB-dependent gene expression can be inhibited by 2-AP or by the overexpression of a catalytically inactive, dominant negative form of PKR. Also, 2-AP inhibits the de novo degradation of IκBβ observed during TNF-α/Ifn-γ cotreatment in PC12 cells and B12 cells but does not affect the normal pattern of IκBα degradation. Therefore, the mechanism by which the Ifn-inducible kinase PKR functions in this system may involve targeted phosphorylation and degradation of IκBβ. These data indicate a novel role for PKR in the activation of NF-κB.

Cells were incubated for the times indicated under “Results” with 0.025–10 ng/ml human recombinant TNF-α (Boehringer Mannheim), 50–100 units/ml rat recombinant Ifn-γ (Life Technologies, Inc.), or 10 mm 2-AP (Sigma). The day before treatment, cells were plated in 10 ml of complete media in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 1 × 107 cells/plate (PC12), 1 × 106 cells/plate (B12), or 2 × 106cells/plate (EA.hy926). After treatment, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were made using a procedure described previously (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from plates, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and lysed on ice in 3 pellet volumes of cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Nuclei were pelleted, and cytoplasmic supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Nuclei were washed with 100 μl of extraction buffer without Nonidet P-40 and then repelleted. Supernatants were discarded, and nuclear pellets were resuspended by vortexing in 2 pellet volumes of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, and 2.5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) in which the final salt concentration was adjusted to ∼400 mm NaCl. All cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were cleared and transferred to fresh tubes. Next, glycerol was added to the cytoplasmic extracts to a final concentration of 20%, protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (500-0006), and all extracts were stored at −70 °C until analyzed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with a32P-labeled probe containing a κB site from the class I MHC promoter (41Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 42Scheinman R.I. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell.

Complexes were separated in 5% polyacrylamide gels in Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 1 mmEDTA), dried, and autoradiographed. Equal amounts of cytoplasmic extracts were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The upper half of each membrane was probed with an antibody specific for IκBβ (sc-945, Santa Cruz), and the lower half was probed with an antibody specific for IκBα (100-4167C, Rockland). Specific proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transient transfection of PC12 cells was accomplished using 20 μl/ml LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a total of 6 μg of DNA for each sample. The MHC-NF-κBLuc plasmid contains three tandem repeats of the κB site from the class I MHC enhancer cloned into a luciferase expression vector (44Baldwin Jr., A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase expression vector was a gift of Bill Sugden, University of Wisconsin, Madison. The wild-type PKR expression plasmid (wtPKR) and the catalytically inactive Lys296 → Arg mutant PKR expression plasmid (mutPKR) were described previously (32Kumar A. Yang Y.-L. Flati V. Der S. Kadereit S. Deb A. Haque J. Reis L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates (7 × 106 cells/plate) the day before transfection. LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes were allowed to form for 30 min in serum-free medium before being added to plates containing cells plus 2 ml of serum-free medium (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the complexes for 7–8 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% serum, and 8 h of cytokine treatment began 36 h after the medium change. Cells were washed, collected, resuspended in 2 pellet volumes of 0.25 m Tris pH 7.5, and subjected to three cycles of freeze/thaw. Samples were cleared, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. Luciferase assays were performed in duplicate on equal amounts of protein using 200 μmd-Luciferin as a substrate (Sigma), and relative light units were determined using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Berthold Analytical Instruments, Inc., Nashua, NH). PC12 cells stably expressing MHC-NF-κBLuc or its mutated counterpart were obtained by LipofectAMINE cotransfections with the reporter plasmid and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which contains the neomycin resistance gene. 2 days post-transfection, the medium was replaced with complete medium containing 600 μg/ml Geneticin/G418 (Life Technologies) for selection purposes. Fresh G418-containing medium was added every 4–5 days for 2 months, allowing pools of cells stably expressing MHC-NF-κBLuc to grow out. Stably transfected cells were plated (80% confluent in 60-mm plates) the day before treatment. Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 mm 2-aminopurine before treatment for 8 h with TNF-α and/or Ifn-γ. Cells were collected, lysed, and assayed as described for transient transfections (see above). Previously, we demonstrated that Ifn-γ treatment synergistically enhances TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB in PC12 cells even though Ifn-γ, by itself, does not induce NF-κB in these cells (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to dsRNA treatment but not to TNF-α or IL-1β treatment, the Ser/Thr protein kinase PKR can induce NF-κB DNA binding activity, and this may occur following phosphorylation of IκBα (32Kumar A. Yang Y.-L. Flati V. Der S. Kadereit S. Deb A. Haque J. Reis L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 33Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J.

Jagus R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine if Ifn-γ-enhanced NF-κB activity involves PKR, PC12 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 2-AP, a selective inhibitor of PKR, which can inhibit PKR autophosphorylation and activation (36Zinn K. Keller A. Whittemore L.-A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Hu Y. Conway T.W. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and then were treated with TNF-α and/or Ifn-γ. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSA. As described previously (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there was very little binding to a consensus κB site with nuclear extracts from untreated PC12 cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Although it has been documented that a 2-h incubation with 10 mm 2-AP can slightly increase NF-κB DNA binding in the human promonocytic cell line U937 (45Brown F.L. Tahaoglu E. Graham G.J. Maio J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5245-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we do not detect a change in binding in PC12 cells after 1 or 3.5 h of treatment (comparelanes 1–3). Treatment with TNF-α alone for 30 min (lane 4) induced binding of one major NF-κB-specific complex that was identified previously as p50-p65 (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By 3 h of TNF-α treatment the binding activity was reduced significantly (lane 6) and returned to basal levels by 16 h (data not shown). Pretreatment with 2-AP did not affect the TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding profile (compare lane 4 with5 and lane 6 with 7). As expected, treatment with Ifn-γ alone or after pretreatment with 2-AP did not induce binding to the NF-κB-specific probe (lanes 8–11). Cotreatment with TNF-α and Ifn-γ elicited a striking synergistic effect on κB-specific binding activity after 3 h of cotreatment as reported earlier (compare lane 6 with lane 14) (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment with 2-AP completely blocked the TNF-α/Ifn-γ-induced synergy (compare lanes 14 and15). Similar experiments were performed with the central nervous system-derived B12 cell line, and the effects of cytokine treatment with and without 2-AP treatment were nearly indistinguishable from the PC12 cell NF-κB activation profiles (data not shown). In the endothelial cell line, EA.hy926, the TNF-α/Ifn-γ-induced activation of NF-κB was not inhibited by 2-AP but was enhanced slightly (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Pretreatment with the broad specificity serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine had no effect on the TNF-α/Ifn-γ-induced synergy in either cell type (data not shown). Collectively, the data from these three cell lines indicate that PKR may be involved in the regulatory mechanism for this synergistic response in cells of neural origin. Typically, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins that are collectively referred to as IκB proteins (for review, see Refs. 3Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4626) Google Scholar and 4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). In general, NF-κB-inducing stimuli promote the degradation of specific IκB proteins, which allows the release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits. Previously, we demonstrated that costimulation of NF-κB by TNF-α and Ifn-γ in PC12 cells requires the de novo degradation of IκBβ (27Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether 2-AP affects IκBα or IκBβ protein degradation. Western blot analyses were performed on cytoplasmic extracts collected at the same time as the nuclear extracts that were analyzed for Fig. 1 A. Incubation for up to 3 h with 2-AP alone had no effect on either IκBα or IκBβ protein levels (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1–3). TNF-α treatment for 30 min resulted in degradation of IκBα but not IκBβ protein levels (compare lanes 1and 4), and 2-AP did not inhibit this degradation (comparelanes 1, 4, and 5). In fact, 2-AP appears to enhance IκBα degradation in the presence of TNF-α, consistent with the slight increase in DNA binding activity observed in Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5. TNF-α was able to lead to a modest reduction in IκBβ levels after 3 h of stimulation, and this was not affected by 2-AP (Fig. 1 A,lanes 6 and 7). As expected, IκBα was resynthesized within 3 h because the expression of IκBα is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB (lane 6) (for review, see Ref. 4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Treatment with Ifn-γ either alone or after pretreatment with 2-AP also did not change the level of either IκB protein (lanes 8–11). Furthermore, TNF-α/Ifn-γ cotreatment caused extensive degradation of IκBβ which corresponds to the synergistic activation of NF-κB shown in Fig. 1 (Fig. 2, lane 14). Interestingly, the degradation of IκBβ was inhibited by 2-AP (compare lanes 14 and 15), which corresponds to the inhibition of NF-κB activity shown in Fig. 1. Similar experiments were performed with the central nervous system-derived B12 cell line, and the effect of 2-AP on TNF-α/Ifn-γ-induced IκBβ degradation was nearly identical (data not shown). We were unable to identify a higher mobility, hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ which has been detected following its initial degradation (17Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, we have not analyzed the potential of TNF-α and Ifn-γ to lead to enhanced degradation of other forms of IκB, such as IκBε. Our data indicate that the degradation of IκBβ in response to TNF-α/Ifn-γ cotreatment and therefore the synergistic activation of NF-κB may be PKR-dependent in cells of neuronal origin. To test whether the synergistic activation of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional responses requires PKR activity, we examined the ability of 2-AP to inhibit κB-dependent reporter gene expression. We used cells that were stably transfected rather than transiently transfected with a κB-dependent reporter because transient expression can be affected by 2-AP (45Brown F.L. Tahaoglu E. Graham G.J.

In our studies ofP. gingivalis and ways to protect against periodontal disease, we have prepared the monoclonal antibody mAb-Pg-vc and its recombinant antibody, which are capable of inhibiting the hemagglutinating activity of P. gingivalis (Shibata, Y., Kurihara, K., Takiguchi, H., and Abiko, Y. (1998) Infect. Immun. 66, 2207–2212). To clarify the antigenically related hemagglutinating domains, we attempted to determine the minimum motifs responsible for P. gingivalis hemagglutinin. Initially, the 9-kilobase EcoRI fragment encoding the 130-kDa protein was cloned from the P. gingivalis chromosome using mAb-Pg-vc. Western blot analysis of nested deletion clones, the competition experiments using synthetic peptides, and the binding assay of the phage-displayed peptides using the mAb-Pg-vc allowed us to identify the minimum motifs, PVQNLT. Furthermore, the presence of multi-gene family coding for this epitope was confirmed via Southern blot analysis and PCR using the primers complementary to the domain corresponding to this epitope. It is suggested that the hemagglutinin-associated motif may be PVQNLT and that the gene families specifying this motif found in P. gingivalis chromosome encode many hemagglutinin and/or hemagglutinin-related proteases.

Initially, the 9-kilobase EcoRI fragment encoding the 130-kDa protein was cloned from the P. gingivalis chromosome using mAb-Pg-vc. Western blot analysis of nested deletion clones, the competition experiments using synthetic peptides, and the binding assay of the phage-displayed peptides using the mAb-Pg-vc allowed us to identify the minimum motifs, PVQNLT. Furthermore, the presence of multi-gene family coding for this epitope was confirmed via Southern blot analysis and PCR using the primers complementary to the domain corresponding to this epitope. It is suggested that the hemagglutinin-associated motif may be PVQNLT and that the gene families specifying this motif found in P. gingivalis chromosome encode many hemagglutinin and/or hemagglutinin-related proteases. It is recognized that the adherence of bacteria to host tissues is a prerequisite for colonization and one of the causative factors of bacterial pathogenesis. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that is isolated primarily from infectious periodontal pockets and considered to be the major pathogen for adult periodontitis (1Slots J. Genco R.J. J. Dent. Res. 1984; 63: 412-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Slots J. Bragd L. Wikström M. Dahlén G. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1986; 13: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Colonization of this bacterium in gingival tissues is critical in the pathogenic process of periodontal disease resulting in tissue destruction. Therefore, a number of molecules including fimbriae (3Isogai H. Isogai E. Yoshimura F. Suzuki T. Kagota W. Takano K. Arch. Oral Biol. 1988; 33: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), potential molecular adhesins such as hemagglutinins (4Boyd J. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 403-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and lipopolysaccharides (5Holt S.C. Bramanti T.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1991; 2: 177-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) responsible for colonization have been identified as the virulence factors. On the other hand, the cysteine proteases from this pathogen have been extensively investigated because these enzymes could play an important role in tissue destruction, activating host proenzymes, neutralizing host defense mechanisms, and providing essential amino acids for growth as well (6Kuramitsu H.K. Yoneda M. Madden T. Adv. Dent. Res. 1995; 9: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Some of the enzymes are specific for cleavage of peptide bonds containing arginine (7Chen Z. Potempa J.

Biophys. 1995; 316: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), others are specific for lysine residues (13Pike R. McGraw W. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1996; 120: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas still others exhibit specificity for both amino acid residues (15Bedi G.S. Williams T. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that the adherence of P. gingivalis to erythrocytes (13Pike R. McGraw W. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fibrinogen (17Lantz M.S. Allen R.D. Vail T.A. Switalski L.M. Hook M. J.

Immun. 1978; 19: 254-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is mediated, at least in part, by such proteases at the cell surface. Several investigators have indicated interesting results for the correlation of the protease and hemagglutinin activities inP. gingivalis (8Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Nishikata M. Yoshimura F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Immunol. 1996; 11: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar): arginine-specific cysteine protease (arginine-gingipain)-deficient mutants exhibited decreased hemagglutinating activity, which suggests notable properties of this protease (8Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Okamoto K. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23619-23626Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Yoneda M. Kuramitsu H.K. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 11: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recent enzymatic and molecular cloning analysis directly revealed that these proteases are composed of two distinct domains: one for proteolytic activity and the other for hemagglutinating activity (9Aduse-Opoku J. Muir J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Curtis M.A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4744-4754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Potempa J. Pavloff N. Travis J. Trend. Microbiol. 1995; 3: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Madden T.E. Clark V.L. Kuramitsu H.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of hemagglutinating activity on the P. gingivalis cell surface was first reported by Okuda and Takazoe (25Okuda K. Takazoe I. Arch. Oral Biol. 1974; 19: 415-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Indeed, the specific genes for P. gingivalishemagglutinin, such as hagA, which have four repeat units of the hemagglutinin domain without the protease activity, have been isolated (26Han N. Whitlock J. Progulske-Fox A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4000-4007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is reasonable to expect that some hemagglutinin molecules or other hemagglutinin domains encoded by many protease genes in P. gingivalis possess the ability to degrade a broad range of host proteins. Additionally, protoheme is an absolute requirement for the growth of P. gingivalis (27Chu L. Bramanti T.E. Ebersole J.L. Holt S.C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1932-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is probably derived from erythrocytes in the natural niche of the organism (28Shah H.N. Gharbia S.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 61: 213-218Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the hemagglutinin molecule may be particularly important for the organism not only for the attachment to the gingival tissues but also to agglutinate and lyse erythrocytes to survive in vivo. Although it is now well known that genes coding for hemagglutinins and other proteases may share the domain specifying hemagglutinin and hence consisting of a multigene family, the minimum motif responsible for hemagglutinating activity in this family has only been speculated by some investigators (29Curtis M.A. Aduse-Opoku J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Booth V. Cridland J. Shepherd P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2532-2539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Aduse-Opoku J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Muir J. Young K.A. Curtis M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4778-4788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our approach to protect from periodontal diseases is to develop a passive immunization system whereby the colonization of P. gingivalis cells onto human host tissues could be blocked. Toward this goal, we first prepared a monoclonal antibody (mAb-Pg-vc) and a recombinant single chain variable fragment antibody that inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of P. gingivalis (31Shibata Y. Kurihara K. Takiguchi H. Abiko Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using these antibodies, P. gingivalis genomic library was screened, and the gene coding for the 130-kDa protein was isolated. The present investigation will describe the detailed properties of the 130-kDa protein, and its possible role in agglutination with erythrocytes will be discussed. P. gingivalis 381 was grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) supplemented with hemin (0.2 μg/ml) and vitamin K1 (5 μg/ml) in an anaerobic atmosphere (80% N2, 10% H2, 10% CO2) for 24–48 h. Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) was grown on LB (1% trypton, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). For plasmid selection, 60 mg/liter of ampicillin was added to LB agar plates. Vesicles were isolated basically by the method of Grenier and Mayrand (32Grenier D. Mayrand D. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 111-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a slight modification as previously reported (33Hiratsuka K. Abiko Y. Hayakawa M. Ito T. Sasahara T. Takiguchi H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1992; 37: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). P. gingivalis 381 genomic DNA was prepared, digested with EcoRI, and inserted into the EcoRI site of λzapII. The constructed phage library was screened by mAb-Pg-vc, and the initial phage clone, HEM9, was isolated. This clone produced an immunoreactive 130-kDa protein (130-kDa hemagglutinating domain; 130k-HMGD). To obtain the minimum coding region for a 130k-HMGD, phage HEM9 DNA was digested with SacI. DNA fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene), and the mAb-Pg-vc-reactive E. coli transformant harboring pHEM6 was isolated. For forward DNA sequencing, pHEM6 was digested with ApaI andEcoRI and incubated with exonucleases III and mung bean nuclease. Nested deletion clones were prepared following recircularization and transformation into E. coli cells. For reverse DNA sequencing, the SmaI fragment of pHEM6 was subcloned, and the nested deletion clones were constructed in the same way. DNA sequencing was performed with the Taq Dyedeoxy system (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and analyzed on an ABI 373A DNA sequencer. Complete coverage of both strands and the contiguous linkage were achieved by Long Ranger gel solution (FMC Bioproducts) using the LI-COR 4000L infrared automated sequencer (ALOKA). The DNA sequence data were analyzed using the DNASIS programs (TaKaRa) and searched for in the DNA data bank. Sequence grade plasmid DNA was purified by the automatic DNA isolation system PI-50 (KURABO). Preparation of the rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against P. gingivalis vesicles and its monoclonal derivative, mAb-Pg-vc, has been described previously (31Shibata Y. Kurihara K. Takiguchi H. Abiko Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which neutralize the hemagglutinating activity ofP. gingivalis vesicles. Recombinant 130k-HMGD was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein was purified by excising the gel corresponding to the recombinant 130-kDa protein band. A rabbit serum antibody against the recombinant 130k-HMGD was prepared after three intramuscular injections of the purified protein. Prior to usage, the rabbit serum was absorbed with sonicated E. coli cells to minimize nonspecific immunoreaction. The Ph.D.™ ligand screening system (7 peptides) was used to identify the epitopes recognized by mAb-Pg-vc. The sterile 65 × 15 mm polystyrene Petri dishes were coated with 1.5 ml of 0.01 m NaHCO3containing mAb-Pg-vc and stored overnight at 4 °C in humidified container. After the antibody solution was poured off, blocking buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.6, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Then these dishes were washed with TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) six times, and 2 × 1011 phage in 1 ml of TBST buffer was added and rocked gently for 1 h at room temperature. These dishes were vigorously washed 10 times with TBST, and the bound phage was then eluted by lowering the pH with 1 ml of 0.2 mglycine-HCl (pH 2.2) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After neutralization with 150 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.1), the phages were amplified by infecting with E. coli NM522. Recovered phage particles were subjected to a repeated biopanning procedure in the same manner. After the third round of biopanning, a total of 10 plaques were selected, and the phages were amplified. To obtain the single-strand phage DNA, each culture supernatant was added to polyethylenglycol/NaCl, and the recovered pellets were incubated with iodide buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 4 m NaI) to remove the phage protein. For sequencing, the primer (5′-CCC TCA TAG TTA GCG TAA CG) was used. To quantify the amounts of phages bound to the coated mAb-Pg-vc, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody. The hemagglutinating activity of the vesicle fraction ofP. gingivalis 381 was assayed with washed rabbit erythrocytes in round-bottomed microtiter plates. 70 μl of vesicle solution (0.625 μg/ml) and 20 μl of antibody solution were transferred into microtiter wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, 100 μl of 2% rabbit erythrocyte was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The inhibition of hemagglutinating activity induced by adding synthetic peptides was carried out under the same conditions as mentioned above. To clone other genes coding for the epitope sites recognized by mAb-Pg-vc, the primers F (5′-TCC AAT GAA TTT GCT CCT) and R (5′-ATT TTC GAA TGA TTC GGA) were designed. These two primers were able to amplify the region corresponding to the base positions 1298–1447 in pHEM6. PCR 1The abbreviations PCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)ORFopen reading frameARSantibody recognition sitebpbase pair(s) was carried out by employing Pfu turbo (Stratagene) DNA polymerase and P. gingivalis genomic DNA as a template, and a reaction was performed for 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min). The PCR products were precipitated with 0.1 m of LiCl, 20 μg of glycogen, and 70% ethanol, ligated into the pCR-Script SK(+) vector (Stratagene), cloned, and then sequenced. polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) open reading frame antibody recognition site base pair(s) P. gingivalisgenomic DNA was digested with endonucleases, and the fragments were separated in a 0.8% agarose gel. After alkaline denaturation, DNA fragments were transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham). Southern blot analysis was carried out using ECL labeling and indirect detection kits (Amersham) according to supplier's recommendation. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, P. gingivalis whole cells, vesicles, and other recombinant samples were solubilized in 0.1% SDS solution, and subjected to 12% acrylamide-bisacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared by electroblotting samples onto nitrocellulose for 1.5 h at 6 V in a transfer buffer (50 mm Tris-glycine, 20% methanol) using a semi-dry transfer cell system (Bio-Rad). Cloning of the gene coding for 130k-HMGD and isolation of chimeric plasmid, pHEM6, is outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” To examine the antigenic properties of the recombinant protein produced by HEM6, Western blot analysis was carried out. As shown in Fig.1, both the rabbit polyclonal antibody and mAb-Pg-vc recognized the recombinant protein whose molecular mass was 130 kDa (A and B, lanes 3, respectively). This indicated that the subcloned 4.6-kb SacI fragment originating from the recombinant phage, HEM9, retained the same gene that encodes a recombinant 130-kDa protein responsible for hemagglutinin. The rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the 130k-HMGD exhibited the superimposable Western blot profile (Fig.1 C) as that of mAb-Pg-vc (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that these two antibodies recognized the same epitopes of the hemagglutinin-related molecules of P. gingivalis. To fully characterize the 130k-HMGD, the 4.6-kb SacI fragment was completely sequenced. The GC composition of this fragment was 48%, a typical value for this organism (data not shown). Fig.2 (A and B) shows the gene organization and both nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, respectively. It was revealed that the 4.6-kbSacI fragment contained two open reading frames (ORFs).Figure 2The gene organization (A) and nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences (B) of the 4.6-kb EcoRI-SacI fragment.In B, the two potential epitope sites, ARS-I and ARS-II, recognized by mAb-Pg-vc are boxed. The proposed hemoglobin-binding domain (39Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) is underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The upstream ORF contained no ATG initiation codon, which is preceded by a functional ribosome-binding site, ACATT, in this bacterium (35Kiyama M. Hayakawa M. Shiroza T. Nakamura S. Takeuchi A. Masamoto Y. Abiko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This ORF did possess the TAA termination codon, suggesting that the upstream ORF might be a 3′ portion of a putative gene, and expressed under the control of the plasmid-borne lacZ′ gene. The upstream ORF consisted of 1223 codons capable of coding for the 131.5-kDa protein, which is in good agreement with the experimentally determined molecular mass of recombinant 130k-HMGD. Detailed characterization of this ORF will be discussed later. The downstream ORF was composed of 212 codons coding for the 24.4-kDa protein. Following computer analysis, it was revealed that this gene product exhibited a high homology with the transposase of IS1126 from P. gingivalis W83 (36Maley J. Roberts I.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During the course of the sequencing experiments, a series of nested deletion clones were constructed. Using these clones, we effectively examined the region responsible for mAb-Pg-vc binding (Fig. 3). Western blot analysis of theE. coli lysate harboring each of the deletion plasmids permitted us to specify the antigenically active domains (data not shown). mAb-Pg-vc recognized Asn1-Gly734, Asn1-Arg602, Asn1-Asn482, and Asn1-Thr475. In addition to these clones,E. coli lysate harboring a 5′ portion ofEcoRI-BamHI fragment, which encompasses amino acid residues Asn1-Ser432, was also analyzed. No immunopositive signals were observed in this clone (data not shown). These results suggested that the epitope might reside within amino acid residues from Ser432 to Thr475. We designate this region as antibody recognition site-I (ARS-I). In 5′ deletion clones, both Ile603 and Pro783exhibited positive signals; however, no signals were observed in Ser989, suggesting that an additional epitope might exist in the C-terminal portion (783–988) of 130k-HMGD. This second epitope region is referred to as ARS-II. As mentioned above, two immunoreactive regions, ARS-I and ARS-II, were identified in recombinant 130k-HMGD. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences corresponding to these regions revealed the presence of three nearly resembling amino acid stretches, PVQNLT, LKWD(N)AP, and LS(N)ES(D)FEN. The first two are within ARS-I, whereas the remainder is outside of immunoreactive region. To confirm the exact epitope domain, a series of overlapping peptides, encompassing the amino acid residues from Lys423 to Thr473, were synthesized (Fig.4 A). The monoclonal antibody, mAb-Pg-vc, recognized the peptide-437AP. Using these peptides, inhibition of the vesicle-associated hemagglutinating activity was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 B, peptide-431EG (EGSNEFAPVQNL) and peptide-437AP (APVQNLTGSSVG) indicated an inhibitory effect on the vesicle-associated hemagglutinating activity. Although the other peptides KVTLKWDAPNGT, APNGTPNPNPNP, and NPNPGTT showed only limited inhibition, KVCKDVTVEGSN and SSVGQKVTLKWD had no effect. This strongly suggests that the region around the APVQNL structure possesses the ability to compete with vesicles for binding to erythrocytes. To confirm the epitope structure recognized by mAb-Pg-vc, phage clones expressing random hepta-residues were screened by biopanning as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” As a result, a total of seven independent phage clones were isolated. Predicted amino acid sequences are: FPVSQEL, HPVGNTS, KPLTIDT, THGPLSP, KHPTYRQ, YKLNPTR, and YTIGPPS. Among these, quantification of phages bound to coated mAb-Pg-vc by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that following four hepta-peptides were immuno-positive; FPVSQEL, HPVGNTS, KPLTIDT, and YKLNPTR (data not shown). Comparison of these peptide sequences with that of 130k-HMGD suggested that PVQNLT (438–443) seemed to be the structure most responsible for the epitope site of mAb-Pg-vc (Fig. 4 C). This conclusion was supported by the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 (A andB). Both the monoclonal antibody mAb-Pg-vc and the rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against 130k-HMGD recognized several proteins (Fig. 1). This suggested that P. gingivalis might possess gene families that encode for mAb-Pg-vc-reactive proteins. Alternatively, it was possible to explain that these multiple bands were degradation products of progenitor proteins. To confirm either possibility, Southern blot analysis was carried out. The P. gingivalis chromosome was digested with EcoRI orSacI, digested doubly with EcoRI andSacI, and transferred onto membrane. For a positive control, the 9-kb EcoRI fragment from HEM9 was also used. These blots were analyzed using the 4.6-kb SacI and the 150-bp (epi-150) fragments as probes. The latter fragment corresponds to Ser433-Asn482, which contained the proposed epitope structure, PVQNLT. As shown in Fig.5, both probes exhibited superimposable blotting profiles. As expected, the 9- and 4.6-kb bands were visualized in genomic EcoRI and EcoRI-SacI digests. In addition to these bands, several DNA fragments, ranging from 4.3 to 19.3 kb in size, could also be detected in genomicSacI digest. These data suggested that the P. gingivalis chromosome might contain multiple discrete loci coding for the mAb-Pg-vc epitope. Because Southern blot analysis suggested the presence of multiple discrete loci coding for the mAb-Pg-vc recognizable epitope, we attempted to clone these genes using a PCR technique (Fig.6). The two primers were designed so that the 150-bp fragment (epi-150), which was used as the probe in the Southern blot analysis, could be amplified when the 4.6-kbSacI fragment was used as a template (Fig. 6 C,lanes 2 and 4). When the P. gingivalischromosome was used as a template, several discrete DNA fragments were detected on the agarose gel (Fig. 6 C, lane 1). These PCR products were ligated with plasmid and transformed ontoE. coli cells. We randomly picked 48 white colonies, and all inserts were sequenced. As a result, following five independent clones were isolated with duplications (Fig. 6 D): epi-6 (165 bp), epi-11 (135 bp), epi-12 (150 bp), epi-41 (165 bp), and epi-22 (1.4 kb). The deduced amino acid sequence of epi-12 is exactly the same as that of 130k-HMGD and several other registered gene products with or without protease activity (GenBankTM accession numbers PGTLAGEN, PGU42210, and PGU75366; Swisprot accession number AF017059). In the other four clones, no identical sequences were found in the registered genes; however, each clone exhibited the following similarity; epi-06 (PGPRPR1), epi-11 (PGU41807), epi-41 (PGPRPR1), and epi-22 (PGU41807). Comparison of DNA sequences between each clone and that of the computer-aided counterpart protein indicated the presence of conservative (underlined) and nonconservative base-changes or deletion (boxed). In epi-06, for example, DNA sequence corresponding to underlined region (PNPNP) in counterpart protein PGPRPR1 is different from that of epi-06; however, translated amino acids were conserved. In addition, boxed NP sequence found in epi-06 was missing in PGPRP1. That the similar nucleotide disturbances were also observed in the remaining three clones rules out the possibility of contamination of strains used in the present study. P. gingivalis is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that has become recognized as a major pathogen for adult periodontitis. One characteristic aspect of this bacterium is the formation of vesicle particles, budding from the parental P. gingivalis cell surface. One of the pathogenic properties resulted from released vesicles is the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes or hemagglutination. Using vesicle particles as antigen, we prepared two antibodies, anti-vesicle rabbit serum and mouse monoclonal antibody mAb-Pg-vc (31Shibata Y. Kurihara K. Takiguchi H. Abiko Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), capable of inhibiting hemagglutinating activity. In the present study, one of the antibodies, mAb-Pg-vc, was employed to screenP. gingivalis genomic library, and the 4.6-kbEcoRI-SacI fragment encoding for 130-kDa protein was successfully isolated. Complete nucleotide sequencing revealed that this fragment contained two ORFs; the upstream ORF is a 3′ portion of putative gene and is responsible for 130k-HMGD, whereas the downstream ORF specifies IS1126-like (30Aduse-Opoku J.

Lett. 1994; 123: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using the purified recombinant 130k-HMGD protein as the “landmark,” we carried out three experiments: (i) Western blot analysis of nested deletion clones, (ii) competition experiments using synthetic peptides, and (iii) binding assay of phage-displayed peptide library. As a result, a possible amino acid stretch, PVQNLT, responsible for antigenicity was identified. Southern blot analysis of P. gingivalis genome with DNA fragment corresponded to this antigenic region as probe, the presence of gene family coding for PVQNLT traits was suggested, and further PCR experiment coupled with nucleotide sequencing confirmed this. Curtis et al. (29Curtis M.A. Aduse-Opoku J. Slaney J.M. Rangarajan M. Booth V. Cridland J. Shepherd P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2532-2539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Kelly et al. (37Kelly C.G. Booth V. Kendal H. Slaney J.M. Curtis M.A. Lehner T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 110: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have reported that the synthetic polypeptide GVSPKVCKDVTVEGSNEFAPVQNLT (residues 907–931 of PrpR1) was recognized in the serum from a patient with periodontitis and that this domain must be related to bacterial colonization. These information gave authenticity to our results. Unexpectedly, however, 130k-HMGD exhibited no prominent hemagglutinating activity. This observation strongly suggests that vesicle-associated agglutination of erythrocytes consists of many steps. Attachment of vesicles onto the surface of erythrocyte may trigger the molecular cascade toward the hemagglutination, and native 130k-HMGD is involved in one of early events in these steps. To confirm this hypothesis, further experiments will be necessary. Using the DNA sequence data obtained in the present study, we performed a homology analysis of the registered genes. As a result, several genes could be identified with high homology. Among these, a total of 14 genes possessing the hemagglutinin domains were chosen, and their protein structures are shown in Fig. 7. Based on the protein structure, these proteins could be classified into five groups. The first group is prtK (W50), prtP(W12), and lysine-specific cysteine protease (W83), in which the hemagglutinin domains exhibit the highest homology (99.3, 99.0, and 98.8%, respectively) with that of 130k-HMGD. The second group (kgp and hagD from 381) is the homologue of the lysine gingipain K in which the C-terminal portion of residues (amino acids 890–1150) are different. The third group consists ofrgp-1 (H66), prtR (W50), and prpR1(W50), whose hemagglutinin domain is shorter than that of the first two groups. The fourth group is composed of prtH (W83),prtRII (381), rgp2 (H66), and rgpB and possesses only short hemagglutinin domain. The last protein is the HagA (381), which contains four repeating hemagglutinin domains in a single molecule. In a comparison of the protein structures of 130k-HMGD and the PrtK, it appeared that the “native” gene coding for 130k-HMGD is a homologue of the prtK and that the 3′ two-thirds of this gene was cloned in the present study. We predict P. gingivalis strain 381 might retain this gene. Additional computer analysis of the registered genes other than P. gingivalisprovided us the interesting hemagglutinin molecules (HA1 and HA2) originating from influenza virus. Of these, HA1 contains PVQNLT homologue residue, PLQNLT (38Donis R.O. Bean W.J. Kawaoka Y. Webster R.G. Virology. 1989; 169: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This further supports the fact that PVQNLT might contribute to the immunogenicity in 130k-HMGD. Recently, Nakayama et al. (39Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have reported that the hemoglobin receptor domain (HGP-15) was found in several P. gingivalis proteases including arginine-gingipain (rgp1), lysine-specific cysteine proteases (prtP, and kgp), and hemagglutinin (hagA), which was located next to the putative hemagglutinin region. Using a lysine-gingipain-deficient mutant in which the uptake of hemin was greatly retarded, Okamoto et al. (42Okamoto K. Nakayama K. Kadowaki T. Abe N. Ratnayake D.B. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21225-21231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) indicated the defect of hemoglobin adsorption and heme accumulation. Interestingly enough, the duplicating immunoreactive amino acid stretch, PVQNLT, identified in the present study could be found in both sides of the HGP-15 in 130k-HMGD and other hemagglutinin-associated proteins as well. This fact is consistent with the idea that prior to penetration into erythrocyte, two PVQNLT stretches positioned in both side of HGP-15 might facilitate the attachment of P. gingivalis onto the erythrocyte cell surface. Once erythrocytes are coagulated, HGP-15 may function under the aid of the proteolytic activity equipped with the adjacent domain to obtain heme molecules. This gene structure seems to be ideal in this bacterium for the growth in the periodontal pocket to obtain the heme molecules as an iron source. Deduced amino acid sequence of 130k-HMGD, the identification of short motif present in this protein, and the multiplication process of this motif in P. gingivalis cells shed the light on the two arguments that can explain the pathogenicity of this bacterium. First, deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the PVQNLT stretch is followed by a PN repeat, which is composed of typical structure-braking residues, making immunoresponsible residues outside of the cell wall. In ARS-II, a proline-rich stretch (TTTPPPG), another structure-braking feature, did exist that may again facilitate localization of the PVQNLT toward the molecular surface position. Second, nucleotide sequencing of the 4.6-kb EcoRI-SacI fragment indicated the presence of IS1126-like next to the gene coding for 130k-HMGD. Because the insertion sequence has the ability to move on chromosome concomitant with a particular gene, it is likely that this IS sequence may help spread the gene coding for PVQNLT all around theP. gingivalis chromosome and that it contributes to make this bacterium a more virulent strain. In the present study, we identified the amino acid stretch, PVQNLT, responsible for hemagglutinating activity. Because the synthetic peptide, APVQNLTGSSVG, exhibited the inhibitory activity toward hemagglutinin and because these motifs are so specific and widely distributed at the P. gingivalis cell surface, this information might provide useful tools to establish a passive immunization system to prevent periodontal disease in human."

Sordarin and its derivatives bind to the eEF2-ribosome-nucleotide complex in sensitive fungi, stabilizing the post-translocational GDP form. We have previously described a class of Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutants that exhibit resistance to varying levels of sordarin and have identified amino acid substitutions in yeast eEF2 that confer sordarin resistance. We now report on a second class of sordarin-resistant mutants. Biochemical and molecular genetic analysis of these mutants demonstrates that sordarin resistance is dependent on the essential large ribosomal subunit protein L10e in S. cerevisiae. Five unique L10e alleles were characterized and sequenced, and several nucleotide changes that differ from the wild-type sequence were identified. Changes that result in the resistance phenotype map to 4 amino acid substitutions and 1 amino acid deletion clustered in a conserved 10-amino acid region of L10e. Like the previously identified eEF2 mutations, the mutant ribosomes show reduced sordarin-conferred stabilization of the eEF2-nucleotide-ribosome complex.

Detection of a complex between fungal eEF2 and a labeled sordarin analog is strongly dependent upon the presence of ribosomes.

In yeast, mutational analysis of the L10e ribosomal protein gene has shown that only L10e is essential, and that the carboxyl-terminal 132 amino acids of the L10e protein are required for viability. However, the L12e proteins that comprise the L10e/L12e pentameric complex are not essential (14Remacha M. Jimenez-Diaz A. Santos C. Briones E. Zambrano R. Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Guarinos E.

Several findings suggest that there are associations between the stalk proteins and elongation factors. Mutations in L7/L12 perturb both EF-Tu and EF-G functions inE. coli (15Bilgin N. Kirsebom L.A.

Experiments were performed to investigate the involvement of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) on NOS-2 induction and its regulation by NOS-2 inhibitors such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an antioxidant, or protein kinase inhibitors. Analysis by transitory transfections showed that LPS, alone or with IFN-gamma, stimulated activity of the murine NOS-2 promoter fragment linked upstream of luciferase and its suppression by PDTC and by the different protein kinase inhibitors, genistein (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (mitogen-actived protein (MAP) kinase kinase inhibitor), and SB 203580 (p38 MAP inhibitor). Using specific antibodies, we have confirmed that extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38 MAP kinase were activated by LPS and IFN-gamma in retinal pigmented epithelial cells. Analysis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that IFN-gamma alone or combined with LPS induced an accumulation of IRF-1 mRNA and protein and IRF-1 DNA binding. Transfections assays with the IRF-1 promoter showed an induction of this promoter with IFN-gamma, potentiated by LPS. The decrease of LPS/IFN-gamma-induced IRF-1 promoter activity, IRF-1 synthesis, and IRF-1 activation, by PDTC, genistein, PD98059, and SB 203580, could explained in part the inhibition of the NOS-2 induction by these compounds. Our results demonstrate that IRF-1 is necessary for NOS-2 induction by LPS and IFN-gamma and that its synthesis requires the involvement of a redox-sensitive step, the activation of tyrosine kinases, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and p38 MAP kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1989962542,"D-Mannitol is taken up by Bacillus stearothermophilus and phosphorylated via a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The genes involved in the mannitol uptake were recently cloned and sequenced. One of the genes codes for a putative transcriptional regulator, MtlR. The presence of a DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif and two antiterminator-like PTS regulation domains, suggest that MtlR is a DNA-binding protein, the activity of which can be regulated by phosphorylation by components of the PTS. To demonstrate DNA binding of MtlR to a region upstream of the mannitol promoter, by DNA footprinting, MtlR was overproduced and purified. EI, HPr, IIAmtl, and IICBmtl of B. stearothermophilus were purified and used to demonstrate that MtlR can be phosphorylated and regulated by HPr and IICBmtl, in vitro. Phosphorylation of MtlR by HPr increases the affinity of MtlR for its binding site, whereas phosphorylation by IICBmtl results in a reduction of this affinity. The differential effect of phosphorylation, by two different proteins, on the DNA binding properties of a bacterial transcriptional regulator has not, to our knowledge, been described before. Regulation of MtlR by two components of the PTS is an example of an elegant control system sensing both the presence of mannitol and the need to utilize this substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2021320002,"Activated protein C (APC) requires both Ca2+ and Na+ for its optimal catalytic function. In contrast to the Ca2+-binding sites, the Na+-binding site(s) of APC has not been identified. Based on a recent study with thrombin, the 221–225 loop is predicted to be a potential Na+-binding site in APC. The sequence of this loop is not conserved in trypsin. We engineered a Gla domainless form of protein C (GDPC) in which the 221–225 loop was replaced with the corresponding loop of trypsin. We found that activated GDPC (aGDPC) required Na+ (or other alkali cations) for its amidolytic activity with dissociation constant (K d(app)) = 44.1 ± 8.6 mm. In the presence of Ca2+, however, the requirement for Na+ by aGDPC was eliminated, and Na+ stimulated the cleavage rate 5–6-fold withK d(app) = 2.3 ± 0.3 mm. Both cations were required for efficient factor Va inactivation by aGDPC. In the presence of Ca2+, the catalytic function of the mutant was independent of Na+. Unlike aGDPC, the mutant did not discriminate among monovalent cations. We conclude that the 221–225 loop is a Na+-binding site in APC and that an allosteric link between the Na+ and Ca2+ binding loops modulates the structure and function of this anticoagulant enzyme. Activated protein C (APC) requires both Ca2+ and Na+ for its optimal catalytic function. In contrast to the Ca2+-binding sites, the Na+-binding site(s) of APC has not been identified. Based on a recent study with thrombin, the 221–225 loop is predicted to be a potential Na+-binding site in APC. The sequence of this loop is not conserved in trypsin. We engineered a Gla domainless form of protein C (GDPC) in which the 221–225 loop was replaced with the corresponding loop of trypsin. We found that activated GDPC (aGDPC) required Na+ (or other alkali cations) for its amidolytic activity with dissociation constant (K d(app)) = 44.1 ± 8.6 mm. In the presence of Ca2+, however, the requirement for Na+ by aGDPC was eliminated, and Na+ stimulated the cleavage rate 5–6-fold withK d(app) = 2.3 ± 0.3 mm. Both cations were required for efficient factor Va inactivation by aGDPC. In the presence of Ca2+, the catalytic function of the mutant was independent of Na+. Unlike aGDPC, the mutant did not discriminate among monovalent cations. We conclude that the 221–225 loop is a Na+-binding site in APC and that an allosteric link between the Na+ and Ca2+ binding loops modulates the structure and function of this anticoagulant enzyme.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Monovalent and divalent cations regulate the protein C anticoagulant pathway at the level of both the protein C zymogen activation and the catalytic function of activated protein C (APC). In the zymogen activation process, binding of Ca2+ to the N-terminal Gla domain and the first epidermal growth factor like domain-1 is required for efficient assembly of the protein into the activation complexes on cell surfaces (4Stenflo J. Blood. 1991; 78: 1637-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the Gla domain, Ca2+ binding to a high affinity site in the catalytic domain induces a conformational change in the activation peptide of protein C that is required for rapid activation by the thrombin·TM complex (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the activation, the non-catalytic domains of APC remain covalently linked to the serine protease domain to mediate the Ca2+- and Gla-dependent binding of APC to its specific cofactors, protein S or the endothelial cell protein C receptor (7Dahlbäck B.

Although several previous studies have demonstrated that Ca2+ and other divalent cations stimulate the amidolytic and esterolytic activity of APC (10Amphlett G.W. Kisiel W. Castellino F.J.

In this case, it is believed that Na+ allosterically regulates the activity of thrombin and that protein C is activated preferentially by the Na+-free form of thrombin, which is referred to as the slow form (12Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 13Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11185-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Na+-bound or fast form of thrombin is believed to function in the procoagulant pathway by specifically activating fibrinogen (12Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,13Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11185-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A dissociation constant of 30–100 mm for Na+ binding to thrombin has been reported (12Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In contrast to protein C activation, however, it has been demonstrated that bovine APC displays a strict requirement for Na+ (or other monovalent cations) for expression of its amidolytic activity toward tri-peptide chromogenic substrates (15Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 24: 609-617Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In previous studies an apparent dissociation constant of 87–129 mm for Na+ binding to bovine APC and activated Gla domainless protein C (aGDPC) has been reported (15Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 24: 609-617Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Hill K.A.W. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 261: 14991-14996Google Scholar). The exact role of Na+ in the activity of APC toward its physiological substrates, factors Va and VIIIa, is not known. In contrast to the divalent cation-binding sites of APC, the monovalent cation-binding site(s) of APC has not been identified. In the case of thrombin, a single metal-binding site for Na+ has been localized to a conserved loop consisting of residues 221–225 in the chymotrypsin numbering system (18Di Cera E. Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Wuyi M. Tulinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22089-22092Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 19Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The predicted consensus Na+-binding sequence in this loop is conserved in APC but not in trypsin (19Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine whether this loop in APC binds Na+, we prepared a mutant lacking the Gla domain (GDPC) in which the 221–225 loop of GDPC (Gly221-Tyr225) was replaced with the corresponding residues of trypsin (Ala221-Pro225). Both the wild type and GDPC mutant (GDPC tryp/loop) were expressed in mammalian cells, and sufficient quantities of both derivatives were isolated for activation and characterization. In addition to this mutant, we recently prepared and characterized another GDPC mutant in which Glu80 in the Ca2+ binding loop of the molecule was replaced with Lys (E80K) (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this previous study, we demonstrated that the 70–80 loop in this mutant was stabilized in the Ca2+ conformer possibly by Lys80 forming a salt bridge with Glu70 (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, the catalytic activities of the activated wild type, tryp/loop, and E80K GDPC (aGDPC) derivatives were monitored by their ability to hydrolyze several chromogenic substrates in both the absence and presence of Na+ and Ca2+. We found that unlike the wild type protease, the aGDPC tryp/loop mutant lost its ability to bind Na+ and no longer discriminated between various monovalent cations. The affinity of the mutant protease for Ca2+ was also impaired ∼16-fold. Interestingly, further study suggested that the affinity of the wild type aGDPC for Na+ in the presence Ca2+ was improved ∼20-fold, and the binding of aGDPC E80K to Na+ was of the high affinity type independent of Ca2+. These results suggest that the 221–225 loop is a Na+-binding site in APC, which is allosterically linked to the divalent cation-binding loop of the protease. The allosteric coupling of the two metal ion-binding loops in APC has likely played a role in the divergent evolution of this highly specific anticoagulant enzyme. The expression of Gla domainless protein C (GDPC) and GDPC E80K by the RSV-PL4 expression/purification vector system in human 293 cells has been previously described (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 221–225 loop (Gly221-Tyr225) of GDPC was replaced with the corresponding sequence of trypsin (GDPC tryp/loop) by the polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis approach, and the mutant molecule was expressed in the same vector system as described previously (20Rezaie A.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). Accuracy of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing prior to expression. The wild type and mutant zymogens were purified from the cell culture supernatants as described previously (20Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human plasma protein C (22D'Angelo S.V. Comp P.C. Esmon C.T. D'Angelo A. J. Clin.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1918-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and recombinant human thrombomodulin fragment 4–6 (TM4–6, the minimum fragment of TM required as a cofactor for thrombin activation of protein C) (20Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared by the cited methods. The chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme PCa (SpPCa) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), and S2266 and S2238 were purchased from Kabi Pharmacia/Chromogenix (Franklin, OH). The initial rate of protein C activation by the thrombin·TM4–6 complex (1 nm thrombin in complex with 100 nm TM) was measured as a function of different concentrations of GDPC or GDPC tryp/loop in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000), and 2.5 mmCa2+ at room temperature. After inhibition of thrombin activity by antithrombin, the initial rates of activation were measured from the rate of activated protein C generation in an amidolytic activity assay using 1 mm SpPCa in TBS buffer containing 0.1% PEG 8000 and 2.5 mm Ca2+. The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature in aV max kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Fixed reaction times of 5 min were employed for each GDPC concentration. Over this time only the initial rate of activation was measured and less than 1% substrate was activated. The concentration of active protein C derivatives in reaction mixtures was determined by reference to a standard curve, which was prepared by total activation of GDPC at the time of each experiment. This was accomplished by activation of 1 μm each protein C derivative with 10 nm thrombin in complex with 100 nm TM4–6 and 2.5 mm Ca2+ for 90 min at 37 °C. Under these experimental conditions, all protein C zymogens were completely activated in less than 30 min. TheK m and k cat values of protein C activation were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation. Protein C activation was also carried out on thrombin·TM complex assembled on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described previously (22D'Angelo S.V. Comp P.C. Esmon C.T. D'Angelo A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The active site concentrations of the aGDPC derivatives were determined by an active site-specific immunoassay using BioCap-FPR-ck (biotinyl-ε-aminocaproyl-d-phenylalanine prolylarginine chloromethyl ketone) (Hematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT) as described previously (27Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23807-23814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The aGDPC derivatives were desalted by passing through PD-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration columns equilibrated with Chelex-treated (Bio-Rad) 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 0.1% PEG 8000 and stored at −80 °C. The steady-state kinetic parameters of wild type and mutant enzyme toward S2266 (d-Val-Leu-Arg-p-nitroanilide) was performed at room temperature in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% PEG 8000, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 m of different monovalent chloride salts (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, and choline chloride). The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature in a V max kinetic plate reader as described above. The apparent K m andk cat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation. The specificity constant for each chloride salt was expressed as the ratio ofk cat/K m. The specificity constant for the bulky monovalent cation choline (Ch+) was used as a reference to determine the monovalent cation specificity as described by Dang and Di Cera (19Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The concentration of S2266 ranged from 20 μm to 15 mm depending on theK m values, and the concentration of enzymes ranged from 10 to 100 nm depending on thek cat values. The values forK d(app) of Na+ binding to each protease was determined from the effect of varying concentrations of Na+ on the activity of the protease toward three synthetic substrates SpPCa, S2266, and S2238 in both the absence (Chelex-treated buffer) and presence of 2.5 mmCa2+. In all experiments a constant ionic strength of 0.2m was maintained by addition of choline chloride. This procedure has been commonly used in the past to study the effect of monovalent cations on the catalytic function of various enzymes (12Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,19Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The values for K d(app) were calculated from the hyperbolic increase in the rate of substrate hydrolysis as a function of increasing Na+concentrations. The time course of human factor Va inactivation by activated GDPC was measured by a two-stage assay. In the first stage, factor Va (50 nm) was incubated with aGDPC (5 nm) at room temperature in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl or 0.15 m KCl and 0.1% PEG 8000. This stage of the assay was carried out in both the absence and presence of 2.5 mm Ca2+. For this purpose, aGDPC and factor Va (in 5 mm Ca2+) were passed through two separate PD-10 gel filtration columns equilibrated with Chelex-treated 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.1% PEG 8000 and used immediately in kinetic experiments. In the second stage, at different time intervals (0–12.5 min) the remaining activity of factor Va was determined by measuring its ability to accelerate factor Xa activation of recombinant human prethrombin-1 as described previously (28Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent K m andk cat values for substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the affinity of Na+ for each aGDPC derivative (K d(app)) was determined by nonlinear regression fits of data to a rectangular hyperbola using ENZFITTER (R. J. Leatherbarrow, Elsevier, Biosoft). All values are the average of at least 3–5 independent measurements ±S.D. Recombinant wild type and mutant GDPC derivatives were expressed in 293 cells and isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures”. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1) indicated that both derivatives expressed as two subforms with identical apparent molecular weights that correspond to α and β protein C that are glycosylation variants observed previously with this protein (20Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, a light chain was also observed with both derivatives. With both proteins a fraction of the protein samples remained non-reducible suggesting that the GDPC derivatives were expressed as a mixture of single and two-chain proteins. This property has been also observed for both recombinant and plasma-derived human protein C in the past (29Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11397-11404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grinnell B.W. Walls J.D. Gerlitz B. Berg D.T. McClure D.B. Ehrlich H. Bang N.U. Yan S.B. Adv. Appl. Biotechnol. Ser. 1991; 11: 29-63Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that both single and double-chain APC derivatives have identical catalytic activities (31Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12221-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mutation does not alter the post-translational modifications or the processing of the protein. With the mutant GDPC, however, a minor band migrating at ∼35 kDa was also observed (Fig. 1). The nature of this band was not characterized. Comparison of the initial rate of protein C activation by the thrombin·TM4–6 complex as a function of different zymogen concentrations suggested that both GDPC derivatives were activated at a similar rate (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE analysis of the activated products indicated that both zymogens were completely converted to activated forms (data not shown). This was consistent with the observation that the concentrations of enzymes as determined by the active site titration were similar (within 80%) with the values calculated based on the absorbance at 280 nm. To determine whether the mutant aGDPC can bind Na+, the effect of increasing concentration of Na+ on the activity of aGDPC derivatives toward the chromogenic substrates S2266, S2238, and SpPCa was studied. Since the catalytic domain of APC contains a Ca2+-binding site (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these studies were carried out both in the absence and presence of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, the amidolytic activity of aGDPC was strongly dependent on the presence of Na+ in the reaction buffer (Fig. 3 A). The amidolytic activity of aGDPC was enhanced with increasing concentrations of Na+ and reached saturation with aK d(app) of 44.1 ± 8.6 mm. In a previous study, the interaction of Na+with bovine aGDPC was shown to be cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.5 (17Hill K.A.W. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 261: 14991-14996Google Scholar). A similar cooperativity for Na+ binding to human aGDPC was also observed in this study in the absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). However, when the ionic strength of medium was adjusted to 0.2 m with choline chloride, no significant cooperativity was observed, and the nonlinear regression fits of data to a rectangular hyperbola was found to be suitable for obtaining the K d(app) values (Fig.3 A). In the presence of Ca2+, no cooperativity for Na+ binding to aGDPC was observed irrespective of whether the ionic strength of medium was adjusted to 0.2 mwith choline chloride. In this case an ∼5–6-fold stimulation of the amidolytic activity of aGDPC was observed at saturating Na+concentrations (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the affinity of Na+ for the protease was also improved ∼20-fold in the presence of Ca2+ (K d(app) = 2.3 ± 0.3 mm), and at higher concentrations of Na+ (>60 mm) the activity of aGDPC was slightly diminished. A similar improvement in the affinity of Na+ for the protease in the presence of Ca2+was observed at physiological temperature, although theK d(app) values were slightly elevated (141.0 ± 20.9 and 5.3 ± 0.3 mm in the absence and presence of 2.5 mm Ca2+, respectively). To ensure that this effect of Ca2+ on the Na+binding properties of APC was not a phenomenon related to the Gla domainless form of APC or an effect related to a particular substrate, the amidolytic activity of plasma-derived APC was monitored as a function of Na+ in both the absence and presence of Ca2+ with three different chromogenic substrates (S2266, S2238, and SpPCa). In all cases, similar results were obtained (data not shown). Only the results with SpPCa hydrolysis for aGDPC at room temperature are presented in these figures. It is worth noting that in previous studies, the amidolytic activity of bovine APC displayed a strict requirement for Na+ (16Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the current study, we noticed some base-line amidolytic activity for human aGDPC in the absence of Na+ and Ca2+(Fig. 3 A). However, we believe that our results are consistent with the literature since a similar base-line activity was also observed in previous studies (15Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 24: 609-617Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was previously suggested that the base-line amidolytic activity of APC in the absence of Na+ and Ca2+ may be due to the presence of other monovalent cations such as Tris+ and/or choline (Ch+) in the reaction buffer (15Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 24: 609-617Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Steiner S.A. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Na+ concentration dependence of the amidolytic activity of aGDPC tryp/loop mutant was studied in a similar fashion. In the absence of Ca2+, no K d(app)could be estimated for the Na+ interaction with the mutant since no saturation of Na+ binding to the mutant was observed up to 400 mm (data are presented for up to 200 mm NaCl in Fig. 3 B). No attempt was made to increase the concentration of Na+ above 400 mmsince the effect of high ionic strength on the structure of the enzyme is not known. However, in the presence of Ca2+, the amidolytic activity of the mutant was insensitive to the absence or presence of Na+ (Fig. 3 B). These results clearly suggest that the mutant has lost its ability to bind Na+and further suggest that Ca2+ binding to aGDPC has a profound effect on the ability of the protease to interact with Na+. There are two known Ca2+-binding sites on aGDPC that can influence the Na+ binding properties of the protease. The first Ca2+-binding site resides in the epidermal growth factor like domain-1 of the light chain and the other was localized to the C-terminal catalytic domain of APC (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Öhlin A. Landes G. Bourdon P. Oppenheimer C. Wydro R. Stenflo J. J. Biol.

The Ca2+-binding site in the catalytic domain is located on a loop between residues Glu70 and Glu80, analogous to the Ca2+ binding loop in trypsin (33Bode W. Schwager P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 693-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Previously, we prepared and characterized a GDPC derivative in which Glu80 was replaced with Lys (E80K) (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, we demonstrated that the catalytic domain of the mutant was stabilized in the Ca2+ conformer possibly as a result of Lys80 in the mutant forming a salt bridge with Glu70 (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize further the Na+-binding site of APC and determine the Ca2+-binding site responsible for altering the Na+ binding properties of the protease, the amidolytic activity of aGDPC E80K toward SpPCa was studied as a function of different concentrations of Na+. Interestingly, theK d(app) values for Na+binding to this mutant was of high affinity and insensitive to the absence or presence of Ca2+ (5.1 ± 0.7 mmin the absence of Ca2+ and 5.0 ± 0.6 mmin the presence of Ca2+) (Fig.4). TheK d(app) of Na+ for the mutant did not change even if the amidolytic activity of the mutant was monitored in the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA or EGTA to chelate divalent metal ions. It is known that there is an ∼20% Ca2+ stimulation of the amidolytic activity of aGDPC toward chromogenic substrates with aK d(app) of ∼50 μm (6Rezaie A.R. Mather T. Sussman F. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3151-3154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether mutagenesis of the 221–225 loop influences the affinity of the 70–80 loop for binding to Ca2+, the amidolytic activity of aGDPC tryp/loop was monitored as a function of increasing Ca2+ concentrations. Two interesting observations emerged. First, unlike the small effect of Ca2+ on the amidolytic activity of aGDPC, Ca2+stimulated the amidolytic activity of the mutant toward the chromogenic substrates 8–10-fold (data not shown). Second, theK d(app) for Ca2+ binding to the aGDPC tryp/loop mutant increased to ∼800 μm, representing about 16-fold weaker interaction than that observed for Ca2+ binding to aGDPC. Taken together, these results suggest that occupancy of one metal-binding site of aGDPC with its specific metal cation influences the affinity of the other site for its specific metal ligand. We conclude that the 70–80 and 221–225 loops of aGDPC are allosterically linked. It is known that other monovalent alkali cations can substitute for Na+ in stimulation of the amidolytic activity of bovine APC and that the activity increases in parallel with increasing cation radius (16Steiner S.A.

To identify the OST subunit that recognizes the peptide sites that can be glycosylated, we developed photoaffinity probes containing a photoreactive benzophenone derivative,p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa), as part of an125I-labeled peptide that could be expected to be glycosylated. We found that Asn-Bpa-Thr peptides served as substrates for OST and that photoactivation of these probes in the presence of microsomes abolished the OST activity.

By carrying out the photoactivation of the probe using microsomes containing epitope-tagged Ost1p, we demonstrated that the 125I-labeled protein was Ost1p. Radiolabeling of this protein was dependent on irradiation at 350 nm. No labeling was detected using a probe containing Ala instead of Thr as the third amino acid residue.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4179-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have described a tetrameric OST complex that lacks the ε and ζ subunits. So far in yeast eight subunits have been cloned that may be components of this enzyme complex. Five of them are essential genes (OST1, OST2, WBP1, SWP1, and STT3). The components of yeast OST complex show significant sequence similarity to the components of the complex purified from higher eukaryotes (12Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Much work has been done to characterize the substrates of OST (13Pless D.D. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1983; 209: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but little is known about the function of the subunits of the enzyme complex. Following the observation that modification of a cysteine residue on the OST complex by methyl methanethiosulfonate caused time- and concentration-dependent inactivation of enzyme activity, a biotin-tagged form of this reagent was shown to inactivate the enzyme and to label Wbp1p. Based on the finding that the substrate, Dol-PP-GlcNAc2, protected the enzyme from inactivation, it was proposed that Wbp1p may contain a site for the binding of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (11Pathak R. Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4179-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Following up on an earlier observation (16Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) on inactivation of pig liver OST by a hexapeptide in which Thr was replaced by epoxyethylglycine in the -Asn-X-Thr- consensus sequence, Bause et al. (17Bause E. Wesemann M. Bartoschek A. Breuer W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) used a N-dinitrobenzoylated form of this hexapeptide with the objective being to identify an OST subunit(s) that might become covalently linked to the epoxy inhibitor. Following incubation of the pig liver OST with Dol-PP-14C-oligosaccharides and theN-dinitrobenzoylated hexapeptide, two polypeptides, proposed to be ribophorin I and Ost48p, were found to be immunolabeled and radioactive. Our approach has been to identify one or more subunits of the yeast OST complex that would be expected to be involved in recognition of -Asn-X-Ser/Thr- glycosylation sites in the growing polypeptide chain. To accomplish this, we took advantage of the fact that small glycosylatable peptides can mimic nascent chains, because they can enter the ER and become glycosylated (5Hart G.W. Brew K. Grant G.A. Bradshaw R.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9747-9753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bause E. Legler G. Biochem.

Chem. 1983; 258: 11856-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this fact, we developed photoreactive glycosylatable peptides containing a benzophenone moiety. Such probes have several advantages: 1) they are chemically more stable than other photoreactive moieties such as diazo esters, aryl azides, and diazirines; 2) can be manipulated in ambient light and can be activated at 350 nm, conditions that minimize damage to proteins; and 3) react preferentially with normally unreactive C–H bonds, even in the presence of aqueous solvent and bulk nucleophiles. These three properties combine to allow for highly efficient covalent modifications of macromolecules, frequently with high site specificity (18Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 19Prestwich G.D. Dorman G. Elliott J.T. Marecak D.M. Chaudhary A. Photochem.

Using this probe we were able to show that Ost1p is the subunit in the OST complex that recognizes the N-glycosylation site sequence. W303-1a (MAT a ade2 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) was used as the parental strain to generate the Ost1p hemagglutinin (HA) and c-Myc epitopes integrated into the chromosome. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using the ME-3 plasmid (which contains a triple HA tag and the HIS5 gene fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe) as the template. The primers were 5′ GCACTAATGGGAGTTTTTGTCTTAAAAACTTTGAACATGAACGTAACTAACTACCCATACGATGTTCCT 3′ and 5′ TAAAACTTATAAAAAATTAAATACTGAATTTATTGCTCTGCATCATAAGGTGTCGACGGTATCGATAAG 3′. A linear polymerase chain reaction product was used to transform W303-1a by homologous recombination. The resulting transformant was designated as QYY101. QYY102 was generated in a similar way, but instead of containing the HA epitope, it contained nine copies of a c-Myc tag. QYY103 was generated by crossing QYY102 with RGY330. RGY330 (MAT α leu2-Δ1 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1-Δ1 his3-Δ200 with HA incorporated into the COOH terminus of Ost3p) was obtained from R. Gilmore (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Massachusetts). QYY104 was generated by crossing W303-1a with RGY330. Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am and Asn-Bpa-Ala-Am were custom-made by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). The amino terminus was derivatized with 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter (bh) reagent (3 Ci/μmol, ICN) as described (20Welply J.K. Kaplan H.A. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F. Lennarz W.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 808-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), yielding 125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am and125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Ala-Am, respectively, which were then purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 reverse-phase column (Vydac) using a 0–80% acetonitrile gradient (21Noiva R. Freedman R.B. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19210-19217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Acetic anhydride (7.3 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to prepare [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am and [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Ala-Am as described (22Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F. Park H.R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6459-6465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast microsomes were prepared as described by Baker et al. (23Baker D. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. Botstein D. Segev N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The enzyme assay for peptide glycosylation, a measure of OST activity, was performed as described (24Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Irradiation of crude yeast microsomes was conducted at 4 °C in a borosilicate glass tube (12 × 75 mm, VWR Scientific) whose bottom and sides were located 2 cm from the surface of four 350 nm photochemical reactor lamps (RMR 3500A, Southern New England Ultraviolet Co., Hamden, CT). In a standard assay, 200 μl of crude microsomes (protein concentration around 5 μg/μl) was irradiated for 10 min with 0.3 μCi of125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am or125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Ala-Am in B88 buffer (20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 250 mmsorbitol, 5 mm MgOAc) containing 10 mmMnCl2. After irradiation, immunoprecipitation was performed as described by Karaoglu et al. (25Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) except that after photoactivation the reaction was adjusted to 1.5% digitonin, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 3.5 mm MgCl2. The solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 55,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman), and the supernatant fraction was used for immunoprecipitation. Cells were collected by centrifugation from a 5-ml log phase culture (A 600/ml = 1.0), washed with 5 ml of distilled H2O, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After addition of 75 μl of acid-washed glass beads, sonication using a Branson sonicator at level 3 was performed on ice for three 15-s intervals with a 15-s wait on ice between sonications. The cell lysate was recovered by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g; it was subsequently used for analysis by SDS-PAGE with 10% gels followed by Western blot analysis. Asn-Bpa-Thr Serves as a Substrate for OST—To search for the peptide recognition subunit(s) of OST,125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am and [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am, two tripeptides in which the amino acid in the X position consisted of photoreactive Bpa, were synthesized (Fig. 1). The assumption was made that binding of these two tripeptides to one or more subunits of OST would occur because these peptides were expected to be substrates for OST. To test this assumption the tripeptides were incubated with a yeast cell lysate without photoactivation at 350 nm. Labeled glycopeptide formed from the labeled peptide was quantitated by binding of the former to ConA-agarose beads as described (24Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that formation of a 3H-labeled glycopeptide that binds to ConA-agarose was dependent on time (Fig. 2 A), the amount of cell lysate (Fig.2 B), and the amount of [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, addition of a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled peptide, Ac-Asn-Phe-Thr-Am, which is also a substrate for N-glycosylation, markedly inhibited formation of3H-glycopeptide (data not shown). These results established that [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am was a substrate for OST. Similar experiments with the 125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am probe gave similar results (data not shown). Since this work was completed a report on the synthesis and glycosylation of Bpa-containing peptides has appeared (26Xu T. Khanna H. Coward J.K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1821-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Figure 2Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am serves as a substrate for OST. Yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts, lysed, and then assayed for OST activity as described previously (24Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The lysate was incubated with [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am for 20 min or the indicated time at 25 °C. Then the reaction was stopped by adding Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 1%, and3H-glycopeptide formation was measured by binding to ConA-agarose beads. A, formation of 3H-labeled glycoprobe is dependent on the incubation time. B, formation of glycopeptide is dependent on the amount of cell lysate. AnA 600 value of 1 is equivalent to lysate prepared from 2 × 107 cells. C, formation of glycopeptide is dependent on the amount of probe added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) OST activity is essential for viability of yeast. If covalent attachment of the peptide to an OST subunit occurs, it would be expected that the OST complex would lose its catalytic activity, since the probe would be irreversibly attached to the peptide binding site. Of course this might only be expected if cross-linking occurred to one of the subunits of OST known to be essential for viability, namely, Ost1p, Ost2p, Wbp1p, Swp1p, and Stt3p. To test the effect of cross-linking by irradiation on the OST activity of microsomes, we used unlabeled photoprobe bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am. Although the conditions used in this experiment differed somewhat than those ultimately used to link labeled photoprobe to a polypeptide, the results in Fig. 3 clearly showed that irradiation in the presence of bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am abolished OST activity in a time-dependent manner. In a control experiment, microsomes that were irradiated without probe were found to lose little of their OST activity. Having established that125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am and [3H]Ac-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am are substrates of OST and that irradiation of the unlabeled photoprobe peptide inactivated OST, we investigated the target of its binding. It has been shown that incorporation of the HA epitope into the COOH terminus of Ost3p, followed by cell rupture and then immunoprecipitation under nondenaturing conditions, results in precipitation of all eight subunits of the OST complex (25Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After confirming this observation, we carried out experiments using microsomes prepared from a yeast strain in which an HA-tagged allele of Ost3p was integrated into the chromosome. Photoactivation of these microsomes in the presence of125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am was followed by solubilization, and then immunoprecipitation of Ost3-HAp, in order to detect any radiolabeled OST subunits. The results shown in Fig.4, lane 2, established that irradiation of microsomes prepared from the yeast strain carrying Ost3-HAp in the presence of 125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am produced a doublet of radiolabeled bands of apparent molecular masses of 62 and 64 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 2). As shown in Fig. 4, lane 1, when the microsomes were incubated with125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am, in the absence of irradiation, followed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent SDS-PAGE, no labeled protein bands were detected. Therefore, the radiolabeling of these proteins was irradiation-dependent. In other experiments (data not shown) we have found that reduction of the photoreactive ketone group in the Bpa abolished its ability to become covalently linked to protein. In addition, when the photoactivation was carried out using microsomes that had been inactivated by either heating, or by adding 4-fold molar excess of EDTA (to deplete the divalent cations known to be necessary for OST activity), radiolabeling of these two bands did not occur (lanes 7 and 8, respectively). To further confirm that photoactivation led to specific labeling of a polypeptide, a competition experiment was performed using a labeled probe and either an unlabeled peptide that is a known substrate for OST or a peptide that has been shown to not be a substrate. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, lane 4, when microsomes were incubated with125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Thr-Am with the presence of a large excess of a competing acceptor peptide, Ac-Asn-Phe-Thr-Am, labeling of the 62/64-kDa doublet did not occur. However, when microsomes were incubated with the labeled probe and a large excess of a peptide, Ac-Asp(NHCH3)-Leu-Thr-Am, which is known to be inactive as a substrate for OST (27Lau J.T. Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15255-15260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), labeling of the 62/64-kDa band was unaffected (Fig. 4, lane 5). Furthermore, when the labeled acceptor photoprobe was replaced with another labeled photoprobe that is not a substrate for OST, 125I-bh-Asn-Bpa-Ala-Am, no labeling was observed (lane 6). These results clearly showed that the photolabeling of the 62/64-kDa protein requires a probe that is a substrate for OST. Based on the specificity of anti-HA in precipitating only the OST subunits (25Karaoglu D. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32513-32520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the apparent molecular mass of the photolabeled protein we presumed that the subunit being labeled was Ost1p. It has been reported Ost1p migrates as a triplet of protein bands at 60/62/64 kDa due to different glycosylation states (26Xu T. Khanna H. Coward J.K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 1821-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), although as shown in Fig. 4, lane 2, we detected only a doublet at 62 and 64 kDa. To provide more direct proof that the labeled protein was Ost1p, photoactivation was carried out using microsomes prepared from a strain bearing chromosome-integrated HA tag located at the COOH terminus of Ost1p. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, followed by SDS-PAGE, revealed two labeled protein bands migrating at 67 and 65 kDa (Fig. 4, lane 3). The HA tag had a mass about 3 kDa, which explains why the doublet of labeled Ost1p now had a slower mobility than the Ost1p doublet observed when the epitope was attached to Ost3p (Fig. 4, lane 2). To further confirm that the labeled protein was Ost1p, we took advantage of the molecular weight shift expected upon synthesis of Myc-tagged Ost1p. A strain was generated with nine copies of Myc linked to the COOH terminus of Ost1p (QYY102). Then a diploid strain (QYY103) was made by crossing this Ost1-Mycp strain with strain RGY 330, which contains Ost3-HAp. A control diploid strain containing an untagged form of Ost1p was also made by crossing strain W303-1a with strain RGY330 (QYY104). Having confirmed that these diploid strains have the expected properties by Western blot analysis (data not shown), microsomes were prepared from them and then irradiation and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described above. As shown in Fig.5, lane 2, two radiolabeled proteins at 62 and 76 kDa were observed. As expected this diploid strain (QYY103) exhibited two different radiolabeled forms of Ost1p; the original Ost1p and Ost1-Mycp, with the increased mass expected from addition of the Myc epitope. As a control, in Fig. 5, lane 1, only one form of radiolabeled Ost1p was observed in microsomes made using the control diploid strain (QYY104), which contained only Ost1p. In an earlier effort to identify the peptide recognition element of OST by photoactivation of an acceptor, we utilized a glycosylatable peptide containing a photoreactive benzoylazido group attached to the ε-NH2 group of Lys located in the -X- position (22Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F. Park H.R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6459-6465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that this probe did not label a membrane protein, but instead the lumenal protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (28LaMantia M. Miura T. Tachikawa H. Kaplan H.A. Lennarz W.J. Mizunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4453-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Subsequently we excluded the possibility that labeling of a membrane protein failed because of the high abundance of PDI; even when PDI was depleted from the ER, little labeling of membrane proteins occurred. 2R. Noiva and W. J. Lennarz, unpublished observation. Using considerations described earlier (22Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Naider F. Park H.R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6459-6465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the current study, we introduced hydrophobicity into the peptide by 1) attachment of a Bolton-Hunter group on the NH2 terminus, 2) blocking of the carboxy group at the COOH terminus, and 3) introduction of the Bpa group in the X position. These hydrophobic modifications were made because in vitro studies had demonstrated that hydrophobic tripeptides were much better substrates than polar, water-soluble peptides (8Welply J.K.

Second, photoreactive Bpa was introduced into the peptide as the middle amino acid, because it is known that peptides containing any amino acid except proline in the Xposition are substrates (7Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), whereas those with modifications on either the Asn or the Thr residues are not recognized by OST (6Bause E. Legler G.

Lennarz, unpublished observations. it is clear that the reason for the different results in labeling of polypeptides in the microsomes in this and the earlier study must be due to the nature of the photoreactive moiety itself, rather than the overall design of the peptide. Using this photoprobe we have established that specific labeling of one of the essential subunits of OST, Ost1p, occurs. This specificity is documented by the finding that only this protein becomes photocovalently modified, even though the antibody directed against Ost3p has been shown to immunoprecipitate the entire OST complex. Previously, it has been directly shown that the OST1 gene is essential for growth and Ost1p is essential for OST activity (32Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our data clearly indicated that the photolabeling of Ost1p is an active site-directed reaction of the tripeptide and the OST subunit. A prerequisite for this active site-directed photolabeling is that the photoreactive peptide should be recognized by and specifically bind to the enzyme. This is the case, since the photoprobe can be glycosylated. Furthermore, photoactivation with microsomes abolishes OST activity and, as expected, photolabeling was dependent upon divalent cations. Additional evidence for the specificity of labeling was afforded by the observation that labeling did not occur when the Thr in the third position was converted to Ala. It is of interest to consider several aspects of the finding that Ost1p is the subunit that recognizes -Asn-X-Ser/Thr-. The sequence of this protein coupled with its glycosylated state indicates that it is a Type I membrane protein containing a short cytosolic COOH-terminal tail and a long NH2-terminal lumenal domain. Given the requirement that Ost1p recognize a small structural element, namely, two of three amino acids in a sequence within a growing polypeptide chain, the extended lumenal domain of Ost1p (427 amino acid residues) could have a sufficiently high degree of order to generate a very structured, specific binding site that can distinguish between Asn and Gln, and between Ser/Thr and Ala. Another aspect of interest is the relationship between this finding in yeast and work in mammalian systems, since Ost1p is homologous to ribophorin I. As mentioned above, Bause et al. (17Bause E. Wesemann M. Bartoschek A. Breuer W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have proposed that ribophorin I and Ost48p are involved in recognition of the acceptor peptide and Dol-PP-oligosaccharide, and the work of Pathak et al. (11Pathak R. Hendrickson T.L. Imperiali B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4179-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in yeast has implicated Wbp1p, the yeast homolog of Ost48p, in recognition of Dol-PP-oligosaccharide. Clearly a next step in extending our findings on the participation of Ost1p in recognition of the peptide binding site will be to use a bifunctional cross-linking probe to determine the possible interaction of Ost1p with other subunits of the yeast OST complex.

https://openalex.org/W2031810333,"Previously, the protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), L-744,832, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a number of tumor cell lines in vitro in a manner that correlated with the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Here we show that FTI inhibits p70s6kphosphorylation in mammary tumors in vivo in transgenic mice. Furthermore, in a mouse keratinocyte cell line, FTI inhibits p70s6k phosphorylation and activity and inhibits PHAS-1 phosphorylation in vitro in both rapidly growing cells and in growth factor-stimulated quiescent cells. Dominant-negative Ras expression inhibits p70s6k stimulation by epidermal growth factor, demonstrating a requirement for Ras activity during p70s6k activation. FTI does not inhibit protein kinase B phosphorylation on Ser473, indicating that FTI does not act by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. FTI also inhibits DNA synthesis in keratinocytes, and inhibition of DNA synthesis correlates closely with p70s6k inhibition. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70s6k and PHAS-1 phosphorylation, causes a 30–45% reduction in DNA synthesis in keratinocytes, while FTI induces an 80–90% reduction in DNA synthesis. These observations suggest that alteration of p70s6k and PHAS-1 function by FTI are responsible for a substantial portion of the growth-inhibitory properties of FTI. Together, these data demonstrate that p70s6k and PHAS-1 are novel downstream targets of FTI and suggest that the anti-tumor properties of FTI are probably due to the inhibition of multiple mitogenic pathways.

Most of the mechanistic studies involving FTIs, however, have focused on the MAPK signal transduction pathway and have not explored the effects of FTIs on other Ras-dependent mitogenic pathways. Ras has recently been shown to support cell survival through the sequential activation of PI 3-kinase and the serine/threonine kinase protein kinase B (PKB) (9Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These studies raise the possibility that FTIs may induce tumor regression by increasing apoptosis and decreasing mitogenesis through the inhibition of Ras-dependent PI 3-kinase activation. One PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway required for mitogenic signaling involves p70s6k (15Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 16McIlroy J. Chen D. Wjasow C. Michaeli T. Backer J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This enzyme was initially identified as a kinase capable of phosphorylating the ribosomal S6 protein in a growth factor-sensitive manner (17Blenis J. Kuo C.J. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14373-14376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of S6 is thought to regulate the synthesis of proteins whose transcripts contain 5′-oligopyrimidine tracts. More recently, in studies using embryonic stem cells containing targeted disruptions of both copies of the p70s6k gene, p70s6k was shown definitively to be the kinase responsible for S6 phosphorylation and for the growth factor-dependent stimulation of the translation of transcripts containing 5′-oligopyrimidine tracts (19Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Another protein regulated in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner is the translation initiation inhibitor PHAS-1 (properties of heat and acid stability). PHAS-1 was identified independently as a protein that becomes phosphorylated in response to insulin and that interacts directly with the mRNA cap binding protein elongation initiation factor 4B (reviewed in Ref.20Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Specifically, PHAS-1 regulates cap-dependent translation by binding to elongation initiation factor 4B in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of both p70s6k and PHAS-1 are inhibited by the macrolide rapamycin (21Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 22von Manteuffel S.R. Gingras A.-C. Ming X.-F. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Rapamycin acts by binding to its intracellular receptor FKBP12. The rapamycin-FKBP12 complex then binds to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and blocks its function. FK506, a macrolide structurally related to rapamycin, competes for the same binding site on FKBP12 and blocks the effect of rapamycin on TOR-dependent pathways. The TOR genes were initially identified in yeast genetic screens as genes involved in rapamycin sensitivity (24Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 25: 905-909Crossref Scopus (1503) Google Scholar) and subsequently shown to be involved in the control of G1 progression and protein synthesis (25Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Later, mTOR was purified from mammalian cell extracts as a protein that specifically binds to FKBP12 in a rapamycin-dependent manner (26Brown E.J. Albers M.w. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which mTOR regulates p70s6kand PHAS-1 activity are unclear but may involve direct phosphorylation of these proteins by mTOR (27Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Burnett P.E. Barrow R. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabitini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The fact that rapamycin induces a G1 cell cycle arrest in many cell lines and regulates p70s6k and PHAS-1 function underscores the potential role of these proteins in mitogenic signaling. In this report, we investigate the effect of FTI on p70s6k and PHAS-1 and find that FTI mimics the ability of rapamycin to inhibit p70s6k phosphorylation and activation, PHAS-1 phosphorylation, and DNA synthesis. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that inhibition of the p70s6k pathway plays an important role in the growth-inhibitory effects of FTI. The TGFα/neu double transgenic mice have been described previously (29Muller W.J. Arteaga C.L. Muthuswamy S.K. Siegel P.M. Webster M.A. Cardiff R.D. Meise K.S. Li F. Halter S.A. Coffey R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5726-5736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Excision biopsies from spontaneously arising tumors in murine mammary tumor virus-TGFα/neu double transgenic mice were collected when tumors reached approximately 300 mm3. The mice were then treated for 3 weeks with 40 mg/kg of FTI given daily as 100-μl subcutaneous injections, and a second biopsy was taken from the same tumors at the end of the treatment period. Under these treatment conditions, FTI was previously shown to induce tumor regression associated with a G1 arrest and increased apoptosis in mammary tumors in transgenic mice (4Barrington R.E. Subler M.A. Rands E. Omer C.A. Miller P.J. Hundley J.E. Koester S.K. Troyer D.A. Bearss D.J. Conner M.W. Gibbs J.B. Hamilton K. Koblan K.S. Mosser S.D. O'Neill T.J. Schaber M.D. Senderak E.T. Windle J.J. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have obtained similar results in the TGFα/neu double transgenic mice. 2Data to be presented elsewhere. Biopsies were either extracted immediately by sonication in radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS) or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The mouse keratinocyte cell line, Balb-MK, was cultured in low calcium minimum essential medium containing 8% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 4 ng/ml EGF in a 7% CO2environment as described (30Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2environment. MDA-MB-468 cells (ATCC) were cultured in McCoy's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2environment. For cell culture analyses, treated cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 nm microcystin (Biomol), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μmpepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin (lysis buffer). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 18,500 × g, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Extracts were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C or used immediately. For immunoblotting, extracts were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and 20 μg of total protein was resolved on 7.5, 10, or 15% SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels for the analysis of p70s6k, MAPK and PKB, or PHAS-1, respectively. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, and probed with antibodies directed against p70s6k (sc-230; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Erk1 (sc-93; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the dually phosphorylated active form of MAPK (Promega), His-tagged PHAS-1 (kindly provided by Dr. John Lawrence, University of Virginia School of Medicine), Ha-Ras (sc-029; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PKB (a 1:1 mixture of sc-1618 and sc-1619; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or PKB phosphorylated on Ser473 (New England Biolabs). Blots were washed, probed with the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed again, and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Balb-MK cells were plated at 700,000 cells/10-cm culture dish and incubated in complete medium for 24 h. The cells were then refed with medium lacking the 4 ng/ml EGF added to the normal growth medium (EGF(−) medium) and refed with EGF(−) medium at 24-h intervals for a total of 72 h to bring the cells to quiescence. During this 72-h period, some plates were also pretreated with various concentrations of FTI in EGF(−) medium for a total of 72 h. The medium in the FTI-treated plates was replaced with fresh EGF(−) medium containing the appropriate concentration of FTI at 24-h intervals. FTI vehicle controls received FTI diluent, which consisted of 17 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.4, and 89 mm NaCl. During the last 48 h of the EGF deprivation, some plates were treated with adenoviruses expressing a dominant negative mutant of Ras in which the serine residue at amino acid 17 is mutated to an asparagine residue (N17Ras) or β-galactosidase at a multiplicity of infection of 700 and 1900, respectively. This dose of N17Ras adenovirus was the lowest multiplicity of infection capable of completely inhibiting MAPK activation in response to EGF. The N17Ras-encoding adenovirus was generated as described (31Gnudi L. Frevert E.U. Houseknecht K.L. Erhardt P. Kahn B.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase-encoding adenovirus was kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Newgard (32Herz J. Gerard R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 33Becker T.C. BeltrandelRio H. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21234-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Plates treated with Me2SO or wortmannin were pretreated for 2 h in EGF(−) medium. To stimulate the cells, all plates except the EGF(−) control were refed with complete medium containing 4 ng/ml EGF. For the FTI-, Me2SO-, and wortmannin-treated plates, these compounds were present in the EGF(+)-containing medium. After a 15-min EGF stimulation, cell lysates were prepared and handled as described earlier. Three hundred micrograms of protein were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for either p70s6k or Erk1, and the immune complexes were precipitated with 20 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and two times in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm paranitrophenylphosphate, and 10 nmmicrocystin (kinase buffer). Five micrograms of S6 substrate peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or myelin basic protein (Boehringer Mannheim) dissolved in kinase buffer were added to the washed beads in a volume of 10 μl. Kinase assays were initiated with the addition of 10 μl of 333 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped with the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Twenty microliters of each reaction mixture were resolved on 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Since comparable results were obtained using phospho-MAPK antibodies and immune complex kinase assays, these MAPK assays were used interchangeably. Cells were plated at 20,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in complete growth medium and incubated for 24 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were cultured for an additional 22 h with 1 ml/well of the indicated treatments. Forty microliters of 0.1 mCi/ml [3H]thymidine were added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed, and incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was quantitated as described previously (30Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Munger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Since Ras is able to initiate multiple signaling cascades, we investigated the effect of FTI on several Ras-dependent signaling pathways in tumor-bearing transgenic mice. Protein extracts of tumor biopsies from TGFα/neu double transgenic mice taken before and after FTI treatment were analyzed by immunoblot using a variety of antibodies. Immunoblots of the tumor extracts using antibodies directed against p70s6k (Fig. 1) revealed a shift of the bulk of the p70s6k after FTI treatment to less phosphorylated forms that migrate more rapidly during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Importantly, the mobility of p70s6k closely correlates with kinase activity, with the more slowly migrating forms representing catalytically active enzyme and the faster migrating forms representing inactive enzyme (34Cheatham L.

The observed mobility shift indicates a decrease in p70s6kphosphorylation and probably correlates with a decrease in p70s6k activity following FTI treatment. In order to more directly determine the effect of FTI treatment on p70s6k activity, we examined the ability of FTI to inhibit the activation of p70s6k in Balb-MK cells. Balb-MK cells require EGF in order to proliferate and if deprived of EGF for 72 h exhibit very low levels of p70s6k activity and MAPK activity (Fig. 2). Balb-MK cells are therefore similar to mammary tumors in the MMTV-TGFα/neu transgenic mice in terms of their epithelial origin and presumably a dependence upon EGF signaling for proliferation. Treatment of the quiescent cells with EGF for 15 min resulted in a marked activation of both p70s6k activity and MAPK activity (Fig. 2). Pretreatment of the cells with 20 μm FTI for 72 h resulted in a 42% reduction in the activation of p70s6k by EGF. Inclusion of FTI in the p70s6k assays had no effect on enzyme activity, indicating that the inhibition of p70s6k by FTI is not direct but that FTI acts upstream of p70s6k (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the changes in p70s6k phosphorylation induced by FTI. Interestingly, FTI treatment did not cause a significant reduction in MAPK activation under these conditions. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin also blocked p70s6k activation but did not affect MAPK activation. PKB activation is dependent upon PI 3-kinase activity, and expression of activated forms of PKB results in p70s6kactivation (35Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 36Reif K. Burgering B.M.T. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol.

Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). PKB activation by PI 3-kinase is mediated by the phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 (38Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). In order to examine the effect of FTI on PKB phosphorylation, immunoblots were probed with an antiserum specific for PKB phosphorylated at Ser473. FTI had no significant effect on PKB phosphorylation at Ser473. Since phosphorylation of this site is inhibited by wortmannin, but not by FTI, this demonstrates that FTI does not act by inhibiting PI 3-kinase activity. Immunoblots performed using antibodies reactive against all forms of PKB demonstrated that the effect of wortmannin and lack of any FTI effect are not due to changes in the level of PKB protein. The possibility does exist, however, that FTI could inhibit PKB activity either directly or indirectly by inhibiting Thr308phosphorylation. Since FTIs were originally designed to inhibit Ras function but could also alter the function of other farnesylated proteins, we used the expression of dominant-negative Ras to distinguish Ras-dependent pathways from Ras-independent ones. Pretreatment of the cells for 48 h with an adenovirus encoding N17Ras, but not an adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase, strongly inhibited the activation of both p70s6k and MAPK by EGF. This result demonstrates that endogenous Ras is required for the activation of both p70s6k and MAPK and that a 72-h pretreatment with 20 μm FTI is insufficient to completely block Ras activity, since MAPK is still activated by EGF under these conditions. Treatment with 0.5 μm FTI was sufficient to block the farnesylation of adenovirally expressed N17Ras although this treatment has no effect on either p70s6k or MAPK activities (Fig. 2, lower panel). Adenovirally expressed Ha-Ras was used to monitor farnesyltransferase inhibition, because endogenous Ha-Ras was undetectable in the Balb-MK cells by immunoblot. The observation that low concentrations of FTI block farnesylation of adenovirally expressed Ras suggests that the concentrations of FTI employed are sufficient to block farnesyltransferase activity but that there is residual Ras activity after a 72-h treatment with 20 μm FTI. Since farnesylation is an irreversible modification, Ras activity would not be expected to be abrogated until the endogenous Ras is completely turned over. Alternatively, the residual Ras activity might be due to K-Ras, which can be geranylgeranylated rather than farnesylated in the presence of FTIs (39Rowell C. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14093-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The differential effect of FTI on p70s6k and MAPK might then be explained by either a difference in the relative sensitivity of these pathways to the level of Ras activity or to different Ras isoforms. The latter hypothesis is supported by recent studies (40Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) that show that K-Ras is more effective at activating MAPK than Ha-Ras, while Ha-Ras is more effective at activating PI 3-kinase than K-Ras. It is possible that in Balb-MK cells FTI is preferentially inhibiting PI 3-kinase activation by abrogating Ha-Ras farnesylation but having a weak effect on MAPK activation because K-Ras is being geranylgeranlyated and is thus still functional. The role of Ras in p70s6k activation is unclear. In one report, Ras was found to be unnecessary for the activation of p70s6k (41Ming X.-F. Burgering B.M.T. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 271: 426-429Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In another report, V12Ras, a constitutively active form of Ras, was shown to be sufficient for p70s6kactivation (42Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made regarding the PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB, which was found to be activated by V12Ras (43Datta K. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30835-30839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) but not inhibited by N17Ras (35Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Our results show that N17Ras inhibits PKB phosphorylation on Ser473, suggesting that Ras is important for PKB activation in Balb-MK cells. These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that PI 3-kinase can be activated by the binding of its p85 subunit to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and also by direct binding of the catalytic subunit to activated Ras. Whether the activation of a particular PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway is Ras-dependent will probably vary with the mechanisms of PI 3-kinase activation in a cell type- and growth factor-specific manner (44van Weering D.H.J. DeRooij J. Marte B. Downward J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that in Balb-MK cells, Ras activity is necessary for p70s6k activation. Since FTI induces a G1cell cycle arrest in mouse mammary tumors and p70s6k is required for the initiation of DNA synthesis (15Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 16McIlroy J. Chen D. Wjasow C. Michaeli T. Backer J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we examined whether FTI inhibits the proliferation of Balb-MK cells. To measure growth inhibition by FTI, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in rapidly growing Balb-MK cells was measured under various conditions. As shown in Fig.3 A, FTI caused a dose-dependent inhibition of EGF-induced DNA synthesis in Balb-MK cells. In order to determine whether FTI also inhibits DNA synthesis in tumor cells, thymidine incorporation experiments were performed using the LNCaP prostatic adenocarcinoma and MDA-MB-468 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines (Fig. 3 B). FTI also dramatically inhibited DNA synthesis in these two tumor cell lines. Thus, FTI inhibits DNA synthesis not only in the nontransformed Balb-MK cell line but also in two different tumor cell lines of epithelial origin. If p70s6k activity plays a role in stimulating mitogenesis in Balb-MK cells, then inhibition of p70s6k by rapamycin should also inhibit DNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3,A and B, rapamycin inhibited DNA synthesis to differing degrees in all three cell lines. The effect of rapamycin is specific, since in MDA-MB-468 cells, which are not growth-inhibited by FK506, FK506 blocks growth inhibition by rapamycin. The inhibition of thymidine incorporation by FTI, however, is greater than the inhibition by rapamycin, suggesting that FTI inhibits additional mitogenic pathways. In order to determine which signaling elements might be involved in the growth inhibition observed in Fig. 3, A and B, cell extracts from FTI- or rapamycin-treated Balb-MK cells were prepared and analyzed by assaying for p70s6k activity and immunoblotting for p70s6k, PHAS-1, and phospho-Erk1 and -2 (Fig.3 C). p70s6k assays demonstrated that p70s6k activity is inhibited 96% by rapamycin treatment and is inhibited 67% by 60 μm FTI. Importantly, the dose response of p70s6k inhibition closely correlated with the inhibition of DNA synthesis observed in Fig. 3 A. p70s6k immunoblots of the same extracts showed that rapamycin induces the collapse of the three distinct bands seen in the Me2SO control lane into a fourth rapidly migrating band. FTI treatment induced the upper three p70s6k bands to collapse into the two most rapidly migrating bands. Together, these observations support the observations made with the tumor extracts and demonstrate that FTI can inhibit p70s6k phosphorylation and activation. Because PHAS-1 is regulated similarly to p70s6k with respect to its sensitivity to PI 3-kinase inhibitors and rapamycin (reviewed in Ref. 20Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we investigated whether FTI can induce changes in PHAS-1 phosphorylation similar to those seen with rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin induced the formation of a faster migrating, less phosphorylated band of PHAS-1α (Fig. 3 C). FTI treatment also caused the appearance of PHAS-1α. These data suggest that FTI acts at a site upstream of both p70s6k and PHAS-1. Since the regulation of these two proteins bifurcates at mTOR or immediately upstream of p70s6k (45von Manteuffel S.R. Dennes P.B. Pullen N. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5426-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with the hypothesis that FTI acts at the level of mTOR or upstream of mTOR. Since FTI treatment inhibits MAPK activity and colony formation in tumor cell lines (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar), immunoblots of Balb-MK extracts were performed with antibodies specific for the dually phosphorylated active form of MAPK. These experiments showed a slight reduction in the levels of active MAPK at 60 μm FTI. The inhibition of MAPK, however, was weak, and in some experiments not apparent at all (see Fig. 2). Out of a total of nine experiments where the effect of FTI on MAPK was examined, FTI had no effect on MAPK activity in seven experiments and had a weak effect on MAPK activity in two experiments. In all nine experiments, FTI had a strong inhibitory effect on p70s6k. Moreover, the same level of inhibition of DNA synthesis by FTI was observed in experiments where no inhibition of MAPK was apparent, suggesting that the inhibition of MAPK by FTI in Balb-MK cells is not critical for the growth-inhibitory properties of FTI. This observation differs from a previous report (6Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar) in which growth inhibition of various tumor cell lines by FTI correlated with MAPK inhibition. Further studies will be required to determine whether FTI inhibition of cell growth correlates more closely with MAPK inhibition or p70s6k inhibition or whether each effect is important in a subset of cell lines. The inhibition of DNA synthesis by rapamycin, along with the inhibition of p70s6k activity and p70s6k and PHAS-1 phosphorylation by FTI, suggests that these effects are involved in the inhibition of DNA synthesis by FTI. Since farnesylation is an irreversible modification, the period of FTI treatment required to inhibit p70s6k activation should provide an estimate of the half-life of the farnesylated protein(s) involved. In order to determine the time course of FTI inhibition of p70s6k, rapidly growing Balb-MK cells were treated for various intervals with FTI and cell extracts prepared. Analysis of the extracts for p70s6k activity (Fig. 4) showed that p70s6k activity was inhibited relative to the untreated control by 50% as early as 0.5 h. p70s6kimmunoblots revealed four distinct phosphoforms of the enzyme. The control sample consisted primarily of the three most slowly migrating bands. FTI induced a partial loss of the most slowly migrating band as early as 0.5 h. p70s6k was most highly dephosphorylated at the 6- and 24-h time points. At 24 h, p70s6k activity was inhibited by 73% and consisted primarily of the two most rapidly migrating bands of p70s6k. FTI also induced a partial dephosphorylation of PHAS-1 indicated by the appearance of a third more rapidly migrating phosphoform (α). PHAS-1 dephosphorylation was reproducible but was modest relative to the dephosphorylation of p70s6k. The time course of PHAS-1 dephosphorylation was slower than the p70s6kdephosphorylation, with the α-band becoming apparent after 2 h of FTI treatment. This difference between the time courses of p70s6k and PHAS-1 dephosphorylation suggests the possibility that FTI inhibits p70s6k and PHAS-1 dephosphorylation by acting on distinct upstream targets. The differences, however, might be due to differences in the relative kinetics of the kinases and phosphatases acting on these two proteins. The level of phosphorylation of MAPK was unaltered relative to the untreated control at all time points examined. The relatively rapid effect of FTI suggests that the relevant farnesylated protein(s) have a very short half-life or, alternatively, that the effect of FTI on p70s6k and PHAS-1 is elicited by some mechanism other than through the inhibition of farnesyltransferase activity. An FTI structurally similar to the one used in this report was shown to revert the phenotype of Ras-transformed cells, including the loss of membrane ruffles (46Prendergast G.C. Davide J.P. de Solms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Graham S.L. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4193-4202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since Rac is required for the formation of membrane ruffles in response to growth factors (47Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar), the loss of membrane ruffles observed suggests that FTI may be acting by altering Rac function. We see similar FTI-induced morphological changes in Balb-MK cells (data not shown). Interestingly, these morphological changes, like the effects on p70s6k, occur more rapidly than would be expected if the FTI is working by blocking Ras prenylation. These observations, along with the fact that Rac is essential for Ras transformation (48Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McMormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and G1 progression (49Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in p70s6k activation (50Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), make it tempting to speculate that the FTI effects on cell morphology, cell proliferation, and p70s6k activity may be mediated by altering Rac function. This possibility is currently being investigated. These studies demonstrate that FTI inhibits p70s6kphosphorylation and activation and PHAS-1 phosphorylation. The observation that FTI inhibits the phosphorylation of p70s6k in vivo in tumors from TGFα/neu transgenic mice under conditions, where FTI induces tumor regression accompanied by a G1 arrest and increased apoptosis,2 suggests that the modulation of p70s6k and PHAS-1 function may be partially responsible for the anti-tumor effects of FTI. In Balb-MK cells, FTI inhibits p70s6k and PHAS-1 phosphorylation rapidly, and inhibition is observed in both rapidly growing cells and quiescent cells stimulated with EGF. We further show that Ras activity is required for p70s6k activation in response to EGF. The fact that FTI mimics the effects of rapamycin on p70s6k and PHAS-1 demonstrates that the effects of FTI on these pathways are involved in the inhibition of DNA synthesis by FTI. It should be noted that since FTI and rapamycin both inhibit p70s6k and PHAS-1 phosphorylation, the growth-inhibitory effects of these drugs could be mediated by p70s6k, PHAS-1, or some other effector in the same signaling pathway. These data lead us to speculate that an upstream element of the p70s6k signaling pathway may be one of the much sought after targets of FTI responsible for its anti-tumor effects. Future studies directed toward determining the pathways inhibited by FTIs during tumor regression may lead to the identification of new molecular targets for the next generation of mechanism-based anti-cancer drugs.

The age-dependent decrease in HS is more pronounced in atherosclerotic tissues than in normal tissues (10Hollman J. Schmidt A. von Bassewitz D. Buddecke E.

An inverse correlation between the amount of cholesterol in the lesion and the concentration of HS was observed in human aortas. More importantly, this negative correlation was observed in both normal and atherosclerotic vessels. 4–5-fold more cholesterol was found in vessels that have 50% less HS. The negative relationship between HS and atherosclerosis is not surprising because arterial HS is known to inhibit smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and promote antithrombin activity (5de Agostini A.I.

In addition, our recent studies show that HS masks subendothelial proteins such as fibronectin and prevents lipoproteins such as lipoprotein(a) and monocytes from associating with the matrix (18Pillarisetti S. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Pillarisetti S. Paka S. Obunike J. Berglund L. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in vascular HSPG could be athero-protective. Although the decrease of HSPG in atherosclerosis has been known for several years, it is not clear how this occurs. In vitro, a reduction in subendothelial HSPG was observed when endothelial cells were exposed to moderately oxidized LDL or lysolecithin, a product of lipoprotein oxidation. This reduction in subendothelial HSPG was found to be caused by secretion, by endothelial cells, of a HSPG-degrading heparanase activity (18Pillarisetti S. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Pillarisetti S. Paka S. Obunike J. Berglund L. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin.

During these studies an initial observation was made that HDL blocked the oxidized LDL- and lysolecithin-mediated decreases in HSPG (19Pillarisetti S. Paka S. Obunike J. Berglund L. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We now show that HDL, more specifically the apoE component of HDL, stimulates endothelial HS synthesis. [35S]Sulfate aqueous solutions were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Heparinase I and heparitinase (heparinase III) and chondroitin ABC lyase were purchased from Seikagaku America Inc. (Bethesda, MD). Receptor-associated protein (RAP) was kindly provided by Dr. D. K. Strickland (Bethesda, MD). For experiments with apoE either a recombinant apoE3 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Al-Haideri of Columbia University (20Al-Haideri M. Goldberg I.J. Galeano N.F. Gleeson A. Vogel T. Gorecki M. Sturley S.L. Deckelbaum R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12766-12772Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) or a commercially obtained apoE3 (Calbiochem) was used. VLDL (d < 1.006), LDL (d < 1.063), and HDL (d = 1.0–1.21) were isolated from fresh human plasma in the presence of EDTA by sequential ultracentrifugation and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm EDTA (20Al-Haideri M. Goldberg I.J. Galeano N.F. Gleeson A. Vogel T. Gorecki M. Sturley S.L. Deckelbaum R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12766-12772Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For mouse HDL, blood was drawn by retroorbital bleeding from wild type (C57BL/6J), apoE-null (genetic background C57BL/6J), and apoA-I-null mice; HDL was isolated as above. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described (21Pillarisetti S. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522PubMed Google Scholar). The cells (5–15 passages) were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). The subendothelial matrix was prepared as described previously (18Pillarisetti S. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) by incubation for 5 min in a solution containing 20 mm NH4OH and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature. Endothelial PG were radiolabeled with either [35S]sulfate or [3H]glucosamine for the indicated time periods. Cell-associated PG were assessed by removing the cells with NH4OH/Triton X-100 as described above. Subendothelial matrix PG were extracted by incubation with 6m guanidine hydrochloride for 4 h. Alternatively, the subendothelial matrix was incubated with either heparinase/heparitinase or chondroitinase, and released radioactivity was measured to assess HS and chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate PG. Total endothelial cell proteins were labeled by incubating the cells with [3H]leucine for 16 h at 37 °C. Protein synthesis was assessed either by extraction of cells with 0.1 n NaOH and 0.1% SDS for 1 h or by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. To study the effects of HDL and other lipoproteins, endothelial cells were incubated in culture medium containing35SO4 and the indicated concentrations of the lipoprotein or apoE (free or in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles; see Ref. 56Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) for 16 h. Cell and matrix PG were assessed as above. To determine changes in PG, DEAE-cellulose chromatography was performed as described previously (21Pillarisetti S. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16517-16522PubMed Google Scholar, 22Edwards I.J. Xu H. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were labeled with [3H]leucine, and labeled proteins were extracted using 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% octyl glucoside, 1% CHAPS, 0.1 mm each EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Equal amounts of labeled proteins from control and HDL-treated cells were loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column previously equilibrated with HEPES buffer containing 0.15m NaCl and 0.1% Tween 80. Stepwise elution was done with HEPES buffer containing 0.25 m and 0.5 m NaCl. The relative incorporation of [3H]glucosamine and 35SO4 was determined in isolated GAG. To prepare GAG chains, aliquots of purified PG were incubated with 0.10 volume of 10 n NaOH for 18 h at 26 °C with constant shaking and then neutralized with 10n HCl. Samples were dialyzed, and protein-free GAG were purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate-GAG were degraded by treatment with chondroitin ABC lyase (0.1 unit) treatment as described previously (22Edwards I.J. Xu H. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine the size of the GAG, gel filtration on Sepharose 6B was performed using 0.2m NaCl as eluant as described previously (22Edwards I.J. Xu H. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine heparin-like sequences in the subendothelial matrix,35SO4-labeled matrix prepared from control and HDL-treated cells was incubated with 1 unit/ml of heparitinase for 2 h at 37 °C. Released material (containing degraded and undegraded HS) was then passed through a PD-10 gel filtration column. Radioactivity eluting in the void volume was determined as undigested heparin-like HS. The undegraded material was further subjected to low pH nitrous acid treatment as described previously (22Edwards I.J. Xu H. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of PD-10 void volume material was incubated with an equal volume of a mixture containing 20% butyl nitrite in 1 m HCl. The mixture was incubated for 2 h, and the digested material was gel filtered on a PD-10 column. THP-1 monocytes were labeled with [3H]leucine (100 μCi/1 × 107 cells) for 2 h at 37 °C. The label was removed, and cells were washed three times with MEM-BSA and suspended in MEM-BSA. Suspended cells were added to the subendothelial matrix prepared from control or HDL-treated endothelial cells in 24-well plates (2–4 × 105cells/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The spontaneous release of radioactivity under these conditions was about 5%. Unbound monocytes were removed by washing four times with MEM-BSA, and bound radioactivity was extracted by incubation in 0.1 n NaOH and 0.1% SDS for 1 h. Antithrombin and lipoprotein lipase were iodinated using the enzymes lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase as described previously (23Stins M.F. Pillarisetti S. Sasaki A. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1853-1861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Iodinated proteins were purified by heparin-agarose chromatography, and proteins were eluted with 1.5 m NaCl. 5 μg of iodinated protein was incubated with subendothelial matrix in MEM-BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound protein was removed, and bound radioactivity was determined as above. Rat aortic SMC were kindly provided by Dr. L. Rabbani (Department of Medicine, Columbia University). SMC were grown in basal medium supplemented with growth factors (Clonetics). To determine the effects of HS on SMC proliferation, cells were plated at low density (8 × 104/well) and cultured for 3 days in the presence or absence of matrix HS. Matrix HS was isolated from [3H]glucosamine-labeled control and HDL-treated endothelial cells. Equal amounts of glucosamine radioactivity from control and HDL-treated cells were used. On the 4th day, the cell number was counted with a hemacytometer. Net growth was determined by subtracting the final cell number from the initial cell number. The percentage of SMC growth inhibition was calculated by using the average of each triplicate with the formula %InhibitionEquation 1 =1−Net growth in the presence of HSNet growth in the controls×100 In another experiment, SMC were cultured in the above conditions for 3 days, and the cells were then labeled with [3H]thymidine for 6 h; radioactivity incorporated into the DNA was determined. For this experiment HS isolated from nonlabeled cells was used. Control and apoE-null mice (4 weeks old, three each) were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μCi of35SO4 in 100 μl of saline. Mice were sacrificed after 4 h, tissues were perfused (through the left ventricle) with PBS, and liver and heart (together with the proximal aorta) were removed. Tissues were homogenized (Polytron) for 30 s in ice-cold HEPES pH 7.0 buffer containing 4 m urea, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.05 m NaCl, 1 mm each phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Homogenates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 20 min), and the supernatants were dialyzed extensively to remove free sulfate. Aliquots of dialyzed supernatants were counted, and radioactivity was expressed per mg of tissue protein. To determine the effects of HDL on PG, confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were incubated with HDL for 16 h. A dose curve of HDL versus 35SO4 incorporation in cells, matrix (Fig.1 A), and medium (Fig.1 B) is shown. 35SO4 incorporation in all three pools, secreted, cellular, and matrix, increased by 50–100%. An increase of 43% with 250 μg of HDL protein and an increase of 83% with 500 μg of HDL protein was observed in matrix. HDL also increased [3H]leucine incorporation into proteins by 15–20% (not shown). However, the increase in PG sulfate shown in Fig. 1 was found after normalizing for protein. These data suggest that HDL stimulated sulfate incorporation into PG. It should be noted that these changes were found using levels of HDL which are within the normal plasma concentrations of HDL protein (150–180 mg/dl fasting plasma (24Gotto Jr., A.M. Pownall H.J. Havel R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar)). To determine whether the HDL-mediated increase in sulfate incorporation was caused by increased synthesis, cells were labeled with35SO4 for different time periods in the presence of HDL (1,000 μg/ml). HDL increased sulfate incorporation by 25% in 2 h and by 37% in 6 h in cells (Fig.2 A) and matrix (Fig.2 B). When endothelial PG were first labeled with35SO4 and chased in cold medium for different time periods in the presence or absence of HDL, HDL did not alter the turnover rates of PG (not shown). These data suggest that HDL-mediated increases in 35SO4 incorporation were primarily the result of increased synthesis. To determine if increased 35SO4incorporation was caused by increased PG core proteins or increased GAG synthesis, cells were labeled either with [3H]leucine (to label proteins) or with [3H]glucosamine (to label GAG). To differentiate [3H]leucine incorporation into PG core proteins versus other cellular proteins, DEAE-cellulose chromatography was performed. In different experiments we showed that under the conditions ∼90% of bound 35SO4radioactivity was eluted at salt concentrations > 0.25m NaCl. When equal amounts of cellular proteins were loaded on DEAE, the amount of radiolabel eluted at 0.5 m NaCl was not different (Fig. 3, 2,992 cpm in control cells versus 3,079 cpm in HDL-treated cells). Although this suggests that total core proteins were not altered, whether HDL altered core proteins of specific PG (such as perlecan and syndecans, which may not reflect in total core proteins) remains to be determined. HDL increased endothelial GAG ([3H]glucosamine incorporation into PG, Fig.4 A), by 34% in cells and by 41% in matrix. Thus, the increase in 35SO4incorporation into PG was, in part, the result of increased GAG synthesis. Endothelial cells primarily synthesize HS; consistent with this >75% of total GAG was resistant to chondroitin ABC lyase (which removes chondroitin and dermatan sulfates) treatment (not shown). Enrichment in GAG could be caused by either an increased number of GAG or an increased chain length. Sizing analysis of isolated GAG by Sepharose 6B gel filtration chromatography did not show changes in the chain length of GAG isolated from control and HDL-treated cells (not shown). We then compared the increases in sulfation and GAG (expressed as sulfate cpm/glucosamine cpm) (Fig. 4 B). Although HDL increased glucosamine (Fig. 4 A), the GAG were relatively more sulfated in HDL-treated cells as indicated by an increase in the sulfate:glucosamine ratio. A 2.5-fold increase in the sulfation of cellular GAG and an increase of 1.5-fold in the sulfation of matrix GAG was observed. Several anti-atherogenic actions of HS require specific sulfate groups. Studies from this laboratory showed that subendothelial HS inhibition of monocyte binding require sulfation (18Pillarisetti S. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29760-29765Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Acceleration of antithrombin-induced proteinase inhibition by HS requires a pentasaccharide with 3-O sulfate on the internal glucosamine (2Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The anti-proliferative activity of arterial HS appears to require sequences rich in 2-O sulfated uronic acid (25Schmidt A. Yoshida K. Buddecke E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19242-19247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, HS that contains 2-O iduronic acid has a high affinity for lipoprotein lipase (26Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences are generally localized to heparin-like domains in HS (resistance to heparitinase). In our experiments we found a 1.7-fold increase in these heparitinase-resistant but nitrous acid-sensitive heparin-like sequences in matrix (cpm/well in a six-well plate, 10,532 ± 765 in control versus 17,986 ± 1,289 in HDL-treated cells). To determine the consequences of increased matrix HS, matrix was prepared from control and HDL-treated endothelial cells and incubated either with [3H]leucine-labeled monocytes or125I-labeled antithrombin III. The number of monocytes binding to the HDL matrix was decreased by approximately 49%, suggesting that increased HSPG inhibited monocyte interactions with subendothelial matrix (Fig. 5). In contrast, antithrombin III binding to matrix was increased by 43% in HDL-treated cells compared with control matrix. These data suggest an increase in specific HS (containing 3-O sulfates). We next tested the ability of the matrix HS to inhibit SMC proliferation, a key event in the development of atherosclerosis. SMC were cultured in the presence or absence of matrix HS isolated from control and HDL-treated endothelial cells. Cell proliferation was assessed either by counting the number of cells (Fig.6) or by assessing [3H]thymidine incorporation. Endothelial HS was normalized for glucosamine concentration before adding to SMC. Incubation of SMC with HS isolated from chlorate (an inhibitor of sulfation)-treated endothelial cells did not significantly inhibit SMC growth, suggesting the requirement for sulfated HS. Heparin, a known inhibitor of SMC proliferation, at 50 units/ml inhibited SMC proliferation by 42 ± 6%. HS prepared from HDL-treated endothelial cells showed most inhibition (82 ± 5%), better than heparin and control HS (56 ± 6%). These data suggest that HDL treatment increased antiproliferative HS in endothelial cells. We next tested whether HDL effects on PG sulfation require apoA-I and/or apoE. HDL was isolated from wild type (WT), apoA-I-null, and apoE-null mice and tested for its ability to stimulate sulfation. Equal amounts of HDL-protein (100 μg/ml) were used. HDL isolated from control and apoA-I-null mice increased35SO4 incorporation into cellular PG. HDL from apoE-null mice, in contrast, failed to stimulate endothelial PG sulfation (Fig. 7 A). Similar results were obtained when apoE HDL was removed from human HDL by heparin-Sepharose chromatography; the E-deficient HDL did not increase PG sulfation (data not shown). To determine further if this lack of stimulation was caused by the absence of apoE, apoE was added to apoE-null HDL (Fig. 7 A). The addition of 5 μg of apoE restored the ability of E-null HDL to stimulate PG sulfation to mouse WT HDL levels. At 10 μg of apoE, E-null HDL increased35SO4 incorporation by 2-fold. These data show that apoE is required to stimulate PG sulfation. We further examined the effects of apoE in emulsions and in lipid free form. ApoE was able to stimulate endothelial HS production in both free form and DMPC emulsions (Fig. 7 B). These data suggest that apoE actions do not require other HDL components. Surprisingly, however, VLDL failed to stimulate HS production despite containing similar or greater amounts of apoE (determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis; not shown). We next tested whether apoE would stimulate35SO4 incorporation in other cells. Unlike in endothelial cells, incubation of J774 macrophages (which do not synthesize apoE) or human skin fibroblasts with apoE (10 μg/ml) did not alter PG production (Table I).Table IEffect of apoE on 35SO4 incorporation in different cell typesTreatmentEndothelial cellsJ774 macrophagesFibroblastsNone10,490 ± 44234,490 ± 3,26015,790 ± 297ApoE32,902 ± 99036,050 ± 4,42215,610 ± 1,120Aortic endothelial cells or J774 macrophages or fibroblasts were grown to confluence and incubated in growth medium containing 25 μCi/ml35SO4 with (10 μg/ml) or without apoE for 16 h under culture conditions. Cellular proteoglycans were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Aortic endothelial cells or J774 macrophages or fibroblasts were grown to confluence and incubated in growth medium containing 25 μCi/ml35SO4 with (10 μg/ml) or without apoE for 16 h under culture conditions. Cellular proteoglycans were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” We next determined the role of lipoprotein receptors in mediating apoE actions. Competition with lipoproteins and receptor antagonists were used (Fig. 8). LDL or VLDL neither stimulated HS production (closed bars) nor inhibited HDL-mediated stimulation (open bars). Similar results were obtained with LDL receptor antibody. The 39-kDa RAP at concentrations that others have used to inhibit LDL receptor-related protein (5–10 μg) did not inhibit an HDL-mediated increase in35SO4 incorporation. However, at a higher dose (20 μg/ml) RAP inhibited apoE-mediated HS production by >60%. The requirement for higher doses of RAP could be caused by the longer incubation times (16 h) required for HS stimulation in the current experiments. Nevertheless, these data suggest that RAP-sensitive pathways are involved in apoE function. In different experiments heparin increased 35SO4 incorporation by 25–30%. HDL effects, however, were less pronounced in the presence of heparin. These data indicate that cell surface HSPG may partly contribute to apoE actions. To test whether apoE would affect PG sulfation in vivo, 35SO4incorporation was determined in WT and apoE-null mice. 4-week-old mice were injected with 35SO4, and incorporation into PG was determined after 4 h as described under “Materials and Methods.” 35SO4 incorporation was not different in livers of WT and apoE-null mice (Fig.9). However, hearts (containing part of the aorta) from apoE-null mice had ∼40% reduction in35SO4 incorporation compared with hearts from WT mice. These data suggest that apoE also stimulates sulfation of PGin vivo. Loss of endothelial HS has been postulated to lead to several pathological events, in particular to events related to atherosclerosis (15Rosenberg R.D. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2075616080,"Mammalian phosphodiesterase types 3 and 4 (PDE3 and PDE4) hydrolyze cAMP and are essential for the regulation of this intracellular second messenger in many cell types. Whereas these enzymes share structural and biochemical similarities, each can be distinguished by its sensitivity to isozyme-specific inhibitors. By using a series of chimeric enzymes, we have localized the region of PDE4 that confers sensitivity to selective inhibitors. This inhibitor specificity domain lies within a short sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the catalytic domain of the protein, consistent with the competitive nature of inhibition by these compounds. Surprisingly, the identified region also includes some of the most highly conserved residues among PDE isoforms. A yeast-based expression system was used for the isolation and characterization of mutations within this area that confer resistance to the PDE4-specific inhibitor rolipram. Analysis of these mutants indicated that both conserved and unique residues are required for isoform-specific inhibitor sensitivity. In some cases, combined point mutations contribute synergistically to the reduction of sensitivity (suppression of IC50). We also report that several mutations display differential sensitivity changes with respect to distinct structural classes of inhibitors."

The effect of H2O2 oxidation was determined by comparing bovine lenses incubated with and without 30 mmH2O2. The H2O2treatment decreased the glutathione and increased the protein-glutathione and protein-cysteine disulfides in the lens. The molecular mass of the γB-crystallin isolated from lenses, not treated with H2O2, agreed with the published sequence (M r 20,966). Some lenses also had a less abundant γB-crystallin component 305 Da higher (M r 21,270), suggesting the presence of a glutathione adduct. The γB-crystallins from H2O2 treated lenses had three components, the major one with one GSH adduct, another one with the mass of unmodified γB-crystallin, and a third with a mass consistent with addition of two GSH adducts. Mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides of γB-crystallins from different lenses indicated that the +305 Da modifications were not at a specific cysteine. For the lenses incubated without H2O2, there was evidence of adducts at Cys-41 and in peptide 10–31, which includes 3 cysteines. Analysis of modified peptide 10–31 by tandem mass spectrometry showed GSH adducts at Cys-15, Cys-18, and Cys-22.

Age-related cataract is one of the major causes of blindness in humans. The pathology of such a condition involves opacification and decreased transparency of the lens, which can lead to loss of vision. Although the mechanisms for age-related cataractogenesis are not understood, oxidation of the lens proteins, known as crystallins, is associated with cataract formation in humans (1Spector A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 2.Andley, U., Liang, J., and Lou, M. F. in Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology (Albert, D. M., and Jakobiec, F. A., eds) 2nd Ed., Saunders, New York, in press.Google Scholar). Protein thiolation, which involves the formation of disulfide bonds between the cysteinyl residues of lens proteins and other low molecular weight thiols in the lens, is one of the modifications caused by oxidative stress of the lens (3Lou M.F. Green K. Edelhauser H.F. Hackett R.B. Hull D.S. Potter D.E. Tripathi R.E. Advances in Ocular Toxicology. Plenum Press, New York1997: 27-46Crossref Google Scholar).

The conformational changes caused by protein thiolation (5Liang J.N. Pellitier M.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Kono M. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) may allow some of the buried functional groups to be exposed and modified. This may cause proteins to aggregate and disrupt the close packing of the crystallins, decreasing their solubility (7Pirie A. Invest. Ophthalmol. 1968; 7: 634-650PubMed Google Scholar) and leading to cataract formation. In the H2O2-induced cataract model, the progression of cataract is associated with sequential events involving first the formation of PSSG, followed by protein-protein disulfide cross-links, decreased protein solubility, and finally an increase in the formation of high molecular weight aggregates (8Cui X.-L. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein-thiol mixed disulfides accumulate in older human lenses (9Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Exp.

Elevated PSSG or PSSC or both have been found in lenses from animals treated with oxidants such as UV radiation (12Zigman S. Paxhia T. McDaniell T. Lou M.F. Yr N.-T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but previously available techniques have not permitted determination of the exact site of thiolation. Recently, mass spectrometry has been used to locate and identify sites of a variety of post-translational modifications of bovine lens crystallins (17Smith J.B. Thevenon-Emeric G. Smith D.L. Green B.

Mass spectrometry has also been used to detect protein-protein disulfide bonds (24Miesbauer L.R. Zhou X. Yang Z. Yang Z. Sun Y. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol.

Res. 1996; 26: 103-111Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as other modifications of human lens crystallins not associated with oxidation. Because picomole quantities are sufficient for these analyses, a single lens is adequate to obtain information about a variety of post-translational modifications. protein disulfide-bonded glutathione protein disulfide bonded cysteine electrospray ionization mass spectrometry trichloroacetic acid trifluoroacetic acid high performance liquid chromatography To understand the role of protein thiolation in H2O2-induced cataract, γB-crystallins were isolated from untreated bovine lenses and from lenses incubated with and without H2O2 in organ culture. γB-Crystallin was chosen because it contains 7 cysteine residues with various degrees of exposure and reactivity, making it naturally susceptible to thiolation under oxidative stress. In addition, the amino acid sequence and the conformation of γB-crystallin are known. In this investigation, the modifications of γB-crystallin caused by H2O2 treatment of the whole lens were determined to be GSH adducts at some cysteinyl residues, partial oxidation of all the methionines, and the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds. The following chemicals were purchased from Sigma: 30% H2O2, Tris-HCl, GSH, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), sodium bicarbonate, l-glutamine, glucose oxidase, penicillin, streptomycin, trypsin (l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-treated, from bovine pancreas), TC-199 medium with Earle's salts, dithio-nitrobenzoic acid, and EDTA. Bicinchoninic acid was obtained from Pierce. HPLC grade acetonitrile was purchased from Mallinkrodt Baker (Paris, KY). Water used in the HPLC system was purchased from Baxter Diagnostics, Inc. (Deerfield, IL) and/or Sigma or was deionized on-site using a Millipore SuperQ water treatment system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The dialysis tubing was CelluSepT2, with a 8000–10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Membrane Filter Products, Inc., San Antonio, TX). Eyes from 18–24-month-old cows were obtained from BeefAmerica, Inc. (Norfolk, NE). Each lens was surgically removed within 4 h postmortem. Three lenses were analyzed without any previous incubation or H2O2 exposure (referred to as fresh lenses). An additional two pairs of lenses were analyzed after organ culture in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C, following the method of Zigler and Hess (31Zigler J.S. Hess H.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1985; 41: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One lens of each pair was placed in 9 ml of TC-199 medium with no H2O2 and used as a control. The contralateral lens of each pair was placed in medium containing 30 mmH2O2 and sufficient glucose oxidase to maintain the 30 mm H2O2 concentration. After 24 h of incubation, morphological characteristics and changes were recorded, and the lenses were photographed. The incubated lenses were rinsed with saline solution, blotted on filter paper, weighed, and then processed immediately for biochemical analysis. Each lens was homogenized in 10 ml of an ice-cold solution of 0.1 mm EDTA. Approximately 1 ml of the homogenate from each of the incubated lenses was removed for determination of protein-thiol mixed disulfides and GSH. The remainder was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g to separate the water-soluble and water insoluble proteins. The water-insoluble pellet was redissolved in 10 m urea. The protein concentrations of both the water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (32Smith P.K. Krohn R.L. Hermanson G.T. Mallila A.K. Gartner F.H. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18701) Google Scholar). The remaining supernatant was separated by size exclusion chromatography into α-, βH-, βL-, and γ-crystallins fractions. In addition, three fresh lenses were homogenized, and the γ-crystallins were immediately isolated from the water-soluble portion. The proteins in the 1-ml aliquot of supernatant were precipitated in ice-cold 10% TCA and removed after centrifugation at 1600 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant from the TCA precipitation was immediately assayed for GSH with dithio-nitrobenzoic acid, following the method of Ellman (33Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The pellet from the TCA precipitation was immediately washed three times with 10% TCA solution followed by one wash with a 1:1 solution of methanol and ether. The precipitate was dried overnight in a dry bath at 60 °C and then stored at −20 °C pending analysis for protein-thiol mixed disulfides. The concentrations of PSSG and PSSC in the pellet were determined according to a previously published procedure (16Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Garadi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Glutathione and cysteine were released from the protein adducts by performic acid oxidation, forming glutathione sulfonic acid and cysteic acid, respectively. These acids were separated and quantified using a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) LC system equipped with an anion exchange column (AminoPac PA1, 4 × 250 mm) and postcolumn monitoring of the products at 570 nm after reaction with ninhydrin. Data were processed with PeakNet 4.3 software (Dionex Corp.). Approximately 1 ml (50 mg/ml) of the water-soluble portion of the homogenate from each lens, fresh as well as incubated with and without H2O2, was fractionated into α-, βH-, βL-, and γ-crystallins by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 column, 1.6 × 60 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an eluting buffer (0.02 mTris, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.001 m NaN3, pH 7.6) at a flow of 0.5 ml/min (8Cui X.-L. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected automatically at intervals of 2 min/tube, and the absorbance of each tube was measured at 280 nm. Fractions corresponding to α-, βH-, βL-, and γ-crystallins were pooled, lyophilized, reconstituted in water, dialyzed in 8000–10,000 molecular weight cutoff tubing, and lyophilized again. The samples were stored at −80 °C for future use. The γ-crystallins were further separated using a reversed phase HPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) consisting of a C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) and a linear gradient of 30–45% solvent B in 30 min. Solvent A was water with 0.1% TFA, and solvent B was acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA. The eluate was monitored with a UV detector at 280 nm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions for the γ-crystallin subfamilies were pooled and stored at −20 °C until analysis by mass spectrometry. After isolation of the γ-crystallins by reversed phase HPLC, their molecular weights were determined by direct injection of the protein solution (0.5–1.0 nmol) into a quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer (Platform II; Micromass, Manchester, UK). The sample was delivered to the mass spectrometer in a solution of 50:50 acetonitrile/water at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The ESIMS raw data for a protein consist of peaks due to several multiply protonated forms. The instrument was calibrated for protein analysis with the multiply charged peaks of myoglobin over a range of 700–1800 Da; data were processed with Mass Lynx 2.0 software to obtain reconstructed mass spectra showing the protein masses consistent with these multiply charged species. The mass uncertainty was ±2 Da. The γB-crystallins from the lenses that had been incubated with or without H2O2 were further analyzed after tryptic digestion to locate the sites of modification. Approximately 10 nmol of γB-crystallin, isolated by reversed phase HPLC, was dissolved in 300 μl of 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.8, and digested with trypsin using a 25:1 ratio of protein to enzyme with a 4-h incubation at 37 °C. The digest was stored at −20 °C until analysis. An on-line HPLC ESIMS system was used to fractionate the peptides and to determine their molecular weights. The on-line HPLC consisted of a C18 microbore column (Zorbax, 1 × 50 mm, 5 μm; Micro-Tech Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) with a binary gradient system (Gilson, Middleton, WI). Solvent A was water with 0.1% TFA, and solvent B was acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA. A gradient of 2–50% solvent B in 45 min eluted the peptides. The effluent from the HPLC was split with 10% diverted to the mass spectrometer, described previously, and 90% diverted through a UV detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), to a fraction collector, and saved for further analyses. The sample was delivered to the ESIMS in the HPLC effluent. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with NaI according to standard procedures suggested by the manufacturer. NaI forms a series of cluster ions (NanIn−1)+, which can be observed to ∼4000 Da (34Milberg R. McCloskey J.A. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 305-314Google Scholar). The uncertainty of the mass calibration was ±0.3 Da. Depending on the size and number of basic residues in a peptide, singly, doubly, and triply protonated peptides may be evident in an electrospray ionization mass spectrum. Peptides were identified by matching their molecular masses with the masses of peptides expected from tryptic digestion of γB-crystallin, which had been calculated from the known sequence of bovine γB-crystallin (35Hay R.E. Woods W.D. Church R.L. Petrash J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Approximately 1–2 nmol of γB peptide 10–31, which had been previously isolated from the reversed phase HPLC separation of a tryptic digest of the intact protein, was digested with pepsin (Sigma). The pepsin digest was performed at an enzyme/substrate ratio of ∼1:25 in water with 0.1% TFA, pH 2, at room temperature for 5 min. After enzymatic digestion, the subpeptides of peptide 10–31 were fractionated on a C18 capillary column (Hypersil C18, 300 μm inner diameter × 15 cm, 3 μm; LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) using an HPLC binary gradient system (Shimadzu Scientific Instrument Inc., Columbia, MD). Solvent A was water with 0.05% TFA, and solvent B was acetonitrile with 0.05% TFA. A gradient of 2–50% solvent B in 48 min was used for peptide elution. The sample was delivered to the ESIMS in the HPLC effluent. Tandem mass spectrometric experiments were performed on γB peptide 10–31 previously isolated from a tryptic digest of intact γB-crystallin (see above) using a Finnigan MAT (San Jose, CA) LCQ mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source. The sample was delivered to the mass spectrometer in a 50:50 mixture of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A collisional energy of 22% was used for peptide fragmentation with helium. The isolation width used was 1.5 Da. This instrument was calibrated with Ultramark over a mass range of 50–2000 Da with a mass uncertainty of ±0.3 Da. After the 24-h incubation, the lenses incubated without H2O2 (referred to as control lenses) retained their clarity, but lenses exposed to 30 mm H2O2 had become uniformly cloudy in the entire outer cortical region and appeared swollen (Fig.1). The wet weight was increased from 1.82 ± 0.05 g for the control lenses to 2.08 ± 0.12 g for the H2O2-treated lenses (TableI).Table IGlutathione and protein-thiol mixed disulfides in bovine lensesaData are expressed as mean ± S.D.;n = 2.TreatmentWet wtWater-insoluble proteinGSHPSSGbPSSG determined as glutathione sulfonic acid.PSSCcPSSC determined as cysteic acid.g%μmol/g wet wtμmol/g wet wtμmol/g wet wtNone1.82 ± 0.0557.54 ± 0.590.18 ± 0.070.11 ± 0.0230 mmH2O22.08 ± 0.12440.05 ± 0.015.12 ± 0.090.50 ± 0.04a Data are expressed as mean ± S.D.;n = 2.b PSSG determined as glutathione sulfonic acid.c PSSC determined as cysteic acid. Open table in a new tab Treatment of lenses with 30 mmH2O2 decreased the free GSH and increased both protein-thiol mixed disulfides (Table I). GSH decreased from 7.54 ± 0.59 μmol/g wet weight to 0.05 ± 0.01 μmol/g wet weight, a 99% loss. PSSG showed a 30-fold increase, from 0.18 ± 0.07 to 5.12 ± 0.09 μmol/g wet weight; PSSC had a 4-fold increase, from 0.11 ± 0.02 to 0.50 ± 0.04 μmol/g wet weight. The water-insoluble protein constituted only 5% of the total protein in a control lens but increased to 44% of the proteins of a lens that had been treated with H2O2(Table I). Size exclusion fractionation of the water-soluble proteins of both the fresh and control lenses showed five peaks corresponding to α-, βH-, βL-, and γ-crystallins and a low molecular weight fraction (Fig.2 A). The chromatograms for the proteins from the H2O2-treated lenses were substantially different from those for the fresh and control lenses in that the α- and βH-crystallin peaks appeared to merge into one larger peak, and the absorbances for βL- and γ-crystallins were less than half of those for the fresh and control lenses (Fig. 2 B). The bovine γ-crystallins collected from the size exclusion fractionation were further fractionated by reversed phase HPLC. There were five peaks for the γ-crystallins from the fresh and control lenses; the peaks for the γ-crystallins from the H2O2-incubated lenses were not as well resolved (Fig. 3, A and B). Although the γB-crystallins from the H2O2-treated lenses eluted at the same percent acetonitrile as those from the control lenses, the absorbance was considerably smaller. The molecular masses of the proteins separated by reversed phase chromatography from the fresh and control lenses indicated that the primary component of the first fraction was γS-crystallin (M r 20,835), the second fraction was γB-crystallin (M r 20,966), the third fraction was γD-crystallin (M r20,749), the fourth fraction contained γD- and γC-crystallins (M r 21,008), and the fifth fraction was γE-crystallin (M r 20,953). These experimental molecular masses are within 2 Da of those reported by Kilby et al. (36Kilby G.W. Truscott R.J.W. Aquilina A. Sheil M.M. Riley M.L. Harding J.J. Eur. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 1: 203-208Crossref Google Scholar). Some fractions contained more than one protein either because there was incomplete separation of the γ-crystallins or because a modified crystallin was also present. For example, the mass spectrum for fraction 2 shows that, in addition to γB-crystallin, there are minor components with molecular masses corresponding to γS-crystallin and γB-crystallin plus an additional 305 Da, suggesting the presence of a GSH adduct of γB-crystallin (Fig. 4 A). When GSH, with a molecular mass of 307 Da, forms a disulfide bond with a cysteinyl residue, 2 hydrogens are eliminated, resulting in an increase to the protein of 305 Da. The GSH adduct was evident in only one of the three fresh lenses as 4% of the signal and in the control lenses as 36 and 44% of the signal. Among other γ-crystallins from the control lenses, the only other molecular mass indicating modification was a very minor component in a mass spectrum of γS-crystallin, also 305 Da higher, suggesting the presence of a GSH adduct to γS-crystallin (data not shown). Mass spectra of the γ-crystallins isolated from the lenses incubated in 30 mm H2O2 indicated the presence of several modifications (Fig. 4). The mass spectrum of the first peak eluting from reversed phase HPLC yielded a molecular weight consistent with unmodified γS-crystallin. The major component of the second fraction collected from HPLC was γB-crystallin with one GSH adduct (M r 21,270). For one lens this peak constituted 62% of the signal; for the other lens, it was 58%. Other proteins in this fraction had molecular weights corresponding to γB-crystallin (M r 20,964), γB-crystallin plus two GSH adducts (M r 21,576), and γB-crystallin plus 7 oxygens (M r 21,078) (Fig.4 B). The peak representing addition of two GSH adducts was 8% for one lens and 15% for the other. The later eluting fractions contained proteins with molecular masses corresponding to γD-, γC-, and γE-crystallins, not modified. To confirm the identities of the modifications and to locate the specific sites that had been modified, γB-crystallins from the control and H2O2-treated lenses were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated and analyzed by on-line reversed phase HPLC and ESIMS. The masses of these peptides were compared with masses of expected peptides calculated from the known sequence (35Hay R.E. Woods W.D. Church R.L. Petrash J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). For both control lenses, masses corresponding to all of the expected peptides, except peptide 32–36, were found. The tryptic digest of one control lens also included a peptide corresponding to residues 10–31 plus 305 Da, indicating that some of peptide 10–31 had a GSH adduct. Peptide 10–31 contains three Cys residues, Cys-15, Cys-18, and Cys-22, all possible sites for the adduct. Analysis of the tryptic digest of the other control lens indicated that the GSH adduct was at Cys-41. No other modifications were noted for the control lenses. Several additional modifications were found in the γB-crystallins isolated from the H2O2-treated lens. There were masses corresponding to modification of peptide 100–115 and peptide 37–58 by GSH, partial oxidation of all Met-containing peptides, and the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds. The analysis of one of the H2O2-treated lenses with two GSH adducts showed one adduct present on peptide 10–31 and the other at Cys-109. Analysis of the other H2O2-treated lens indicated the two GSH adducts were located on peptide 10–31 and at Cys-41. Because peptide 10–31 contains 3 Cys residues, Cys-15, Cys-18, and Cys-22, this peptide was further analyzed both by tandem mass spectrometry and by on-line reversed phase HPLC and ESIMS after further digestion with pepsin. Both analyses indicated that all three Cys residues were partially modified, but no peptide included more than one modification. In the γB-crystallins from the H2O2-treated lenses, intramolecular disulfide bonds were found between peptide 10–31 and peptide 77–79 and between peptide 37–58 and peptide 77–79. Because Cys-41 and Cys-78 are the only cysteinyl residues in peptides 37–58 and 77–79, the participation of Cys-41 and Cys-78 is certain. Note that Cys-78 of peptide 77–79 was found both in a disulfide bond with peptide 10–31 and bonded to Cys-41. A summary of these modifications is given in Table II.Table IIPeptides found in tryptic digest of γB-crystallins from bovine lenses incubated in 30 mm H2O2Coordinates of tryptic peptideCalculated molecular wtExperimental molecular wtModification3–9942.4942.6None10–312537.02537.0None2842.0GSH at Cys-15, Cys-18, or Cys-22aThis modification also found in control lenses.37–582761.32761.5None2777.5Met-43 oxidized3066.5GSH at Cys-4160–762090.92092.0None2107.9Met-69 oxidized80–891168.61168.6None90–95866.5866.6None882.6Met-90 oxidized100–1151793.71794.0None2101.4GSH at Cys-1091810.5Met-102 oxidized116–1403005.53006.0None3021.9Met-136 oxidized116–1423218.63218.9None143–1521293.71293.8None154–1631167.51167.6None1184.4Met-160 oxidized164–168530.3530.7None169–174829.4829.6None845.6Met-171 oxidized170–174673.3673.3None10–31 plus 77–792901.22899.110–31 disulfide bonded to 77–7937–58 plus 77–793125.43123.237–58 disulfide bonded to 77–79a This modification also found in control lenses. Open table in a new tab A mass spectrum showing peptides in an HPLC fraction from the tryptic digest of the γB-crystallins isolated from an H2O2-treated lens is shown in Fig.6. Present in this fraction is unmodified peptide 10–31 (calculated M r 2537.0), which can be seen as the 2+ and 3+ charge states at m/z1269.4 and 846.8, respectively. Peptide 10–31 is also evident with a GSH adduct, again as the 2+ and 3+ charge states atm/z 1422.3 and 948.2, respectively. The 2+ and 3+ charge states indicate a peptide of molecular weight 2842.6, in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 2842.3 (2537.0 for peptide 10–31 plus 305.3 for the GSH adduct). The peaks atm/z 1450.2 and 967.4 in Fig. 6 are the 2+ and 3+ charge states of the dipeptide (M r 2899.1) formed by a disulfide bond between peptide 10–31 and peptide 77–79. In addition to the modifications at cysteinyl residues, there was evidence of partial oxidation of all 7 methionines of γB-crystallins isolated from the H2O2-treated lenses. A representative mass spectrum showing evidence of oxidation at Met 171 is shown in Fig. 7. The mass of peptide 169–174 is 829.5, yielding a protonated molecular ion of 830.5. The peak at m/z 846.4 corresponds to addition of 16 Da. Because mass spectrometric studies have shown that methionine is preferentially oxidized by H2O2 (30Smith J.B. Jiang X. Abraham E.C. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 26: 103-111Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Met-171 was assumed to be the modified site. Similar masses with an increase of 16 Da were found for all seven of the methionine-containing peptides. Even though peptide 100–115 contained both Met and Cys, oxidation of Met and the GSH adduct were not found on the same molecule; peptide 100–115 was seen unmodified, oxidized at Met-102, or with the GSH adduct. Bovine lenses (37Siezen R.J. Coppin C.M. Kaplan E.D. Dwyer D. Thomson J.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 48: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), as well as lenses from pigs (38Wang G.-M. Raghavachari N. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and monkeys (39Qin C. Rao P.V. Tumminia S.J. Russell P. Rao P.V. Zigler J.S. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have a higher resistance to oxidative stress than rodent lenses (16Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Garadi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The degree of morphological change in bovine lenses exposed to 30 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1) was similar to that of rat lenses exposed to 0.5 mmH2O2 (8Cui X.-L. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but the biochemical damage to the thiols was more severe. Although thiolation of proteins in rat lenses has been extensively studied, the sites of thiolation and other protein modifications attributable to oxidation have never been determined. Bovine lenses were more suitable than rat lenses for this study, because one bovine lens is 200-fold larger than a rat lens and can therefore provide enough purified crystallins for a detailed investigation of the modifications by mass spectrometry. With the organ culture conditions used in this study, 30 mmH2O2 was the threshold concentration for inducing a visible morphological change in the lens. A higher concentration, 150 mm H2O2, induced total lens opacification (data not shown). Because thiolation is an early event in the oxidation of lens proteins (8Cui X.-L. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), γB-crystallin, which contains seven cysteines, was chosen as a model to study the relation of thiolation to cataract formation. A high concentration of H2O2 (30 mm) was used to ensure that enough H2O2 could enter the lens for sufficient protein modification to be detected by mass spectrometry. In contrast to the fresh lenses, which had only 0–4% with a GSH adduct, the extent of GSH adduct formation in the control lenses was 36 and 44% even though they had not been exposed to H2O2. This suggests that the conditions for organ culture, although closely mimicking the physiological environment of a lens, allow oxidation of some proteins because of the differences in the O2 concentrations of organ culture and in vivo conditions. Although organ culture is useful for some studies, it cannot exactly replicate the in vivo system. Determination of PSSG and PSSC in the total lens after oxidation using a Dionex LC system does not show increases after 24 h of organ culture (data not shown). Perhaps only γB-crystallin is oxidized, and the amount of this protein in the total lens is too small to be detected in analysis of total protein-thiol mixed disulfides. The location of the GSH adduct was not at the same cysteine residue in the γB-crystallins from different lenses, indicating that its formation is not attributable to a specific reaction. In this investigation, the H2O2 treatment caused a large decrease in lens GSH. The majority (60%) of the decrease could be accounted for by the increase in PSSG (see Table I), indicating extensive thiolation of the lens proteins. It has been established previously in rat lenses that free GSH is the source of GSH for the adduct PSSG. It is believed that GSH is first oxidized to GSSG and then binds nonenzymatically to the thiol group of a lens protein (16Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Garadi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The increase in PSSC, in contrast, was relatively minor. The source for the cysteine adduct in PSSC is not clear, although the free cysteine pool in the lens is a likely source (40Veltman J. Lou M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34 (suppl.) (abstr.): 758Google Scholar). The level of cysteine in a normal lens is very low (3–5% of GSH), with most of it concentrated in the nuclear region (40Veltman J. Lou M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34 (suppl.) (abstr.): 758Google Scholar, 41Dickerson J.E. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 65: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of this, PSSC can be appreciably elevated only if sufficient oxidant penetrates into the inner region of the lens, as is the case with hyperbaric oxygen-treated guinea pig lenses (15Giblin F.J. Padgaonkar V.A. Leverenz V.R. Lin L.-R. Lou M.F. Unakar N.J. Dang L. Dickerson J.E. Reddy V.N. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and with rat lenses exposed to H2O2 for ≥48 h (8Cui X.-L. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 57: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Exposure of bovine lenses to 30 mmH2O2 induced a number of modifications in the lens crystallins, resulting in decreased solubility of the proteins (the portion of water-insoluble proteins increased from 5 to 44%) and changed the elution profiles of the lens crystallins. For instance, βH merged with α-crystallin, and the peak sizes of both βL- and γ-crystallins were diminished (Fig.2 B). The most important contribution of this investigation is the specific, detailed information about the modifications of γB-crystallins caused by in situ oxidative stress. The principal sites of modification were the cysteinyl and methionine residues. γB-Crystallin was chosen for observation of these modifications because it is a major protein of the γ-crystallin family containing 7 cysteine and 7 methionine residues. Among the 7 thiols, Cys-32 and Cys-78 are buried and inaccessible to bulky reagents, Cys-18 and Cys-109 are partially exposed, and Cys-15, Cys-22, and Cys-41 are exposed (42Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 43Blundell T.L. Lindley P.F. Miller L.R. Moss D.S. Slingsby C. Turnell W.G. Wistow G. Lens Res. 1983; 1: 109-131Google Scholar). Of the possible oxidative modifications, thiolation by GSH at the three Cys residues in peptide 10–31 (Cys-15, Cys-18, or Cys-22) and/or Cys-41 appears to occur most readily, because these are the sites of modification found in the control lenses. After oxidation by H2O2, GSH adducts were also found at Cys-109 (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that the thiolation sites in peptide 10–31 and Cys-41 are exposed and thus easily modified, in agreement with the x-ray crystallographic data (42Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that even though there are 7 thiols in γB-crystallin, only two GSH adducts per molecule were formed. Slingsby and Miller (44Slingsby C. Miller L. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), incubating isolated γB-crystallin with a large excess of GSH at a physiological pH, induced a maximum of three GSH adducts per molecule, although the major product was γB-crystallin with only two GSH adducts. This discrepancy may be attributable to the fact that the thiolation in the current study was done with an intact lens, whereas the study by Slingsby and Miller (44Slingsby C. Miller L. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) used isolated proteins. The second protein-thiol species, PSSC, was not observed in the γB-crystallins from the H2O2-treated lenses. As shown in Table I, the levels of PSSC in both the control and H2O2-treated lenses were much lower than that of PSSG. PSSC may not have formed, or the extent of modification in γB-crystallin may have been too low to be detected by the current procedure. The evidence for oxidation of all of the methionine residues of γB-crystallin agrees with an in vitro incubation study using isolated bovine α-crystallins (30Smith J.B. Jiang X. Abraham E.C. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 26: 103-111Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In that study, isolated α-crystallins, incubated with 1 mmH2O2 and 0.1 mm FeCl3, showed oxidation at all the methionines but at no other locations. The difference between those results and the present data, which show GSH adducts as well as oxidized methionines, can be attributed to the fact that no GSH was present in the incubation medium used with the isolated α-crystallins. The x-ray crystal structure of γB-crystallin (42Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) suggests that Cys-18 and Cys-22 are favorably positioned for easy formation of a disulfide bond, and a disulfide bond between these residues has previously been observed (20Qin W. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Edmonds C.G. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this investigation, however, there was no evidence for a disulfide bond between Cys-18 and Cys-22 in any of the lenses studied. Intramolecular disulfide bonds between Cys-78 and Cys-41 and between Cys-78 and peptide 10–31 were found in γB-crystallin after the lens was exposed to H2O2. Perhaps the initial thiolation in peptide 10–31 or at Cys-41 caused a conformational change that exposed the previously buried Cys-78, making it more accessible for disulfide bond formation. This suggestion of a thiolation-induced conformational change, along with previous evidence that GSH adducts induce conformational changes (5Liang J.N. Pellitier M.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Kono M. Sen A.C. Chakrabarti B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 45Maiti M. Kono M. Chakrabarti B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), further supports the hypothesis (16Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Garadi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that oxidative stress-induced thiolation plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of cataract formation. Mass spectral analyses were performed by the Nebraska Center for Mass Spectrometry. We express our appreciation to Fine Wu for assistance in preparing the figures."

Mutations in these residues cause distinct changes in substrate specificity.

The c-abl proto-oncogene encodes a multidomain non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues (reviewed in Refs. 1Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Mutant forms of c-abl are found in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia (1Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In these diseases, a chromosomal translocation event produces a chimeric oncogene consisting of 5′-sequences of bcr fused toabl. The BCR-Abl fusion protein has elevated tyrosine kinase activity relative to c-Abl, and the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-Abl fusion protein is necessary for disease progression. Similarly, tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for transformation of fibroblasts or hematopoietic cells by BCR-Abl (5Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N.

In addition to its tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, c-Abl has a short amino-terminal unique domain followed by SH3 and SH2 domains (1Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Laneuville P. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Pendergast A.M. Curr. Opin.

This domain organization is found in many non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Abl also possesses a large carboxyl-terminal region that includes a DNA-binding domain, an F-actin-binding domain, a nuclear localization signal, and a proline-rich region implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions. Studies aimed at understanding the normal physiological role of c-Abl have shown the enzyme to be involved in signal transduction, cytoskeletal rearrangement, RNA polymerase II activation, DNA repair, and cell cycle control (1Wang J.Y.J.

Sawyers C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F201-F216PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruptions in the c-abl gene have high neonatal mortality rates and are more susceptible to infection, suggesting a role for c-abl in B-lymphocyte development (7Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). At least eight in vivo substrates for Abl have been identified (4Raitano A.B. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F201-F216PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites for two of these proteins, RNA polymerase II (8Baskaran R. Dahmus M.E. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and c-Crk (9Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), have been described. These sequences do not share a common primary sequence motif, suggesting that Abl may have a broad range of substrate specificity. Studies using synthetic peptides have been used to examine the substrate specificity of Abl and to define any primary sequence determinants for substrate recognition (10Zhou S. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C.

These studies suggest that, although Abl does not have an absolute consensus sequence for phosphorylation, the best in vitro peptide substrates for Abl contain the sequence Ile-Tyr-Ala-Xaa-Pro, where Xaa is any amino acid. These studies indicate that the P−1 (Ile) and the P+3 (Pro) positions are most important for substrate recognition. The molecular basis of peptide/protein substrate recognition for tyrosine kinases is not well understood. Presently, a single high resolution crystal structure of a tyrosine kinase in complex with peptide substrate is available: the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor (IRK) 1The abbreviations IRKinsulin receptor tyrosine kinase domainAbl-CATAbl catalytic domainAMP-PNP5′-adenylylimidodiphosphateNlenorleucine complexed with a peptide substrate (12Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This structure reveals interactions between enzyme and substrate that govern substrate specificity. Two adjacent hydrophobic pockets on the surface of the C-terminal lobe of IRK accommodate Met side chains C-terminal to the phosphorylated tyrosine on the peptide substrate. The crystal structure of the activated IRK-peptide complex provides a structural basis for understanding the primary signaling specificity of IRK and serves as a general model for tyrosine kinase substrate recognition. insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain Abl catalytic domain 5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate norleucine In this paper, we have developed a molecular homology model of the kinase catalytic domain of Abl (Abl-CAT) to help identify amino acids that may be important in substrate recognition. A similar approach was used to propose a molecular model of the Bruton tyrosine kinase and to provide a structural basis for understanding mutations in this enzyme associated with the disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (13Vihinen M. Vetrie D. Maniar H.S. Ochs H.D. Zhu Q. Vorechovsky I. Webster A.D. Notarangelo L.D. Nilsson L. Sowadski J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12803-12807Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our molecular homology model is based on the crystal structure of the ternary complex of IRK with peptide substrate and AMP-PNP bound (12Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Using the model as a guide, we have targeted seven residues in Abl-CAT for amino acid substitutions to examine effects on substrate specificity. Site-directed mutants of Abl-CAT were engineered and tested with a series of peptide substrates to monitor changes in specificity. Kinetic analyses of these mutants with the peptide substrates show distinct changes in substrate preferences. Amino acids 362–625 of v-Abl were used to generate primary sequence alignments using the CLUSTALW alignment algorithm (14Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55957) Google Scholar) and were imported into Swiss-PDB Viewer (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9634) Google Scholar). The primary model of the Abl catalytic domain was prepared using the spatial coordinates of α-carbons from the crystal structure of the ternary form of IRK with peptide substrate and AMP-PNP bound (12Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Gaps in the sequence alignment were ligated manually, minimizing large steric clashes. Energy minimization and loop insertions were carried out using the Swiss-Model automated modeling system (16Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Additional rounds of energy minimization were carried out using Sculpt for Power Macintosh (17Surles M.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Brooks Jr., F.P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The stereochemical quality of the model was checked using PROCHECK Version 3.3 (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), which reports no distorted main-chain bonds, five distorted main-chain angles, and no distorted planar groups. The distorted main-chain angles were outside of the predicted substrate-binding region and do not interfere with our interpretation of the model. Solvent-accessible surface area was calculated and visualized using Web Lab Viewer (Molecular Simulations Inc.) with a 1.4-Å probe.

The sequence numbering used is from the gag-Abl fusion protein of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (20Reddy E.P. Smith M.J. Srinivasan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Abl catalytic domain was carried out using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis primers complementary to wild-type template were designed with single, double, or triple nucleotide substitutions. The DNA sequences encoding the entire catalytic domains of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing on an ABI373 automated DNA sequencer. Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli strain NB42 and purified using glutathione-agarose (19Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25146-25151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins expressed to similar levels, were of the expected size, and purified to >98% homogeneity. Synthetic peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems automated 431A peptide synthesizer. Peptides were purified using semi-preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to confirm the identity of the final products. Tyrosine kinase activity assays were carried out using two methods. In both cases, the intact glutathioneS-transferase-Abl fusion proteins were used; we showed previously that the specific activity and substrate specificity of glutathione S-transferase-Abl are similar to those of full-length Abl and that velocity versus [enzyme] plots are linear over the concentrations used here (19Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25146-25151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For initial comparisons of several substrates, phosphocellulose binding assays were used to measure incorporation of [32P]ATP into peptide substrates (19Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These reactions were carried out in triplicate at saturating concentrations of ATP (250 μm) and Mg2+ (10 mm). The reactions were carried out in volumes of 25 μl, using peptide concentrations of 50 μmor 1.5 mm and 1 μg of enzyme. Picomoles of phosphate incorporated into peptides were measured after 20 min as described (19Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25146-25151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A continuous spectrophotometric assay (22Boerner R.J. Barker S.C. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16419-16423Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used to measure initial rates of phosphorylation and to determine kinetic constants for some peptides. Reactions were carried out in volumes of 100 μl using 5 μg of purified enzyme. Saturating concentrations of ATP (500 μm) and Mg2+ (10 mm) were used, and peptide concentrations ranged from 50 μm to 2 mm. Data were sampled every 30 s to determine rates of phosphorylation. Initial rates (<10% of the reaction) were measured in triplicate. The initial rate values were averaged, andV max and K m were determined by fitting to the hyperbolic velocity versus [substrate] curves using the program MacCurve Fit. For some combinations of peptides and mutants, initial experiments established that theirK m values were in the millimolar range (>2 mm). In addition, we observed that high concentrations of these peptides were inhibitory. Thus, concentrations over 2 mm were not employed, and we were unable to determineK m values accurately using initial rate kinetics. For these peptides, the complete time courses for phosphorylation were measured using peptide concentrations less than K m. In these cases, we analyzed the data graphically as described (23Thomas N.E. Bramson H.N. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Fry D.C. Mildvan A.S. Kaiser E.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4471-4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to determine V max/K m. The overall topology of the Abl structural homology model reflects the typical bilobal structure shared by all eukaryotic protein kinases (24Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) with a five-stranded β-sheet and a single α-helix in the amino-terminal lobe, responsible for MgATP binding, and a highly helical carboxyl-terminal lobe (Fig.1). Based on results for other protein kinases, the C-terminal lobe is predicted to make most of the contacts with peptide/protein substrates. The total root mean square deviation of the polypeptide backbone between the Abl model and the IRK structure is 1.8 Å. The crystal structure of the activated insulin receptor catalytic domain with peptide bound (12Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) served as a model for the orientation and structure a peptide may adopt in the Abl active site. Comparison of the C-terminal peptide-binding domains of IRK and Abl indicated that the greatest differences are in the regions responsible for binding the P+3 amino acid side chain. The P−1 region differs only slightly from that of IRK. The activation loop (amino acids 500–521; see Fig. 1) is extremely flexible when examined using molecular mechanics (Sculpt, Interactive Simulations, Inc.), and the structure of the loop in our model is one of many possible conformations. Additionally, the structure of IRK used for our model is multiply phosphorylated on the activation loop (12Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Abl contains a single tyrosine within the activation loop, Tyr-513, which is phosphorylatedin vivo and in vitro and is believed to be involved in enzyme activation (25Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E. McLaughlin J. Bohlander S.K. Rowley J.D. Witte O.N. Gilliland D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 26Moro M. Walkenhorst J. Goga A. Witte O.N. Superti-Furga G. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 1997; 11 Suppl. 3: 313-315PubMed Google Scholar). Although we believe that our model represents the activated form of Abl, the activation loop tyrosine is modeled in its unphosphorylated state. Previous studies of the in vitro substrate specificity of Abl have been carried out in this laboratory and by others (for review, see Ref. 27Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We designed two groups of peptide substrates to examine any changes in specificity at the P−1 and P+1/P+3 positions for engineered mutant forms of Abl (Table I). (Amino acids in peptide substrates are designated by their position relative to the phosphorylated tyrosine. For example, in the sequence Ile-Tyr-Ala-Ser-Pro, Ile is at the P−1 position, Ala is at the P+1 position, and Pro is at the P+3 position.) Peptides used to examine P+1 and P+3 specificity share the sequence Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Xaa1-Thr- Xaa2-Gln-Ile-Gly, where either Xaa1 or Xaa2 is varied. These peptides are based on a peptide sequence derived from a phosphorylation site of insulin receptor substrate-1 used previously in our laboratory to examine the substrate specificity of wild-type Abl at the P+1, P+2, and P+3 positions (19Garcia P.

In these earlier studies, we found that amino acids at the P+2 position do not strongly influence substrate recognition. Moreover, in the ternary structure of IRK, specificity in peptide binding is achieved through interactions with the P+1 and P+3 residues (12Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we did not examine the effects of residue changes at the P+2 position in this study.Table IAmino acid sequences and designations of peptides used in this studyP-1 peptide variantsDesignationLys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-GlyP−1GluLys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Ile-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-GlyP−1IleLys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Leu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-GlyP−1LeuLys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-His-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-GlyP−1HisLys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Ala-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-GlyP−1AlaLys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Lys-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-GlyP−1LysLys-Lys-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Gln-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-GlyP−1GlnP+1 and P+3 peptide variantsDesignationLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Met-Thr-Met-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Met/P+3MetLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Ile-Thr-Met-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Ile/P+3MetLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Nle-Thr-Met-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Nle/P+3MetLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Ala-Thr-Met-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Ala/P+3MetLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Glu-Thr-Met-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Glu/P+3MetLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Met-Thr-Pro-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Met/P+3ProLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Met-Thr-Thr-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Met/P+3ThrLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Met-Thr-Ala-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Met/P+3AlaLys-Lys-Ser-Arg-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Met-Thr-Glu-Gln-Ile-GlyP+1Met/P+3Glu Open table in a new tab We chose to use a different series of peptides to examine P−1 specificity (Table I). This is because, in the context of the insulin receptor substrate-1 peptides, we did not observe a strong dependence on the amino acid at the P−1 position for Abl phosphorylation. 2D. A. Hinds, W. T. Miller, and S. E. Shoelson, unpublished observations. Peptides designed to examine specificity at the P−1 position share the sequence Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Xaa-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly, where Xaa is varied. This sequence is based on the autophosphorylation site of Src and has been previously used in our laboratory to examine P−1 specificity in wild-type Abl (11Till J.H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7423-7428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acids for the substituted position were chosen to explore the effect of size, charge, and hydrophobic character. Because the two groups of peptides are dissimilar in sequence, we did not attempt to draw conclusions about the relative importance of P−1 versus P+1/P+3 recognition for each mutant. Experiments with synthetic peptides and peptide libraries have demonstrated that Abl prefers proline at the P+3 residue of a substrate. In the crystal structure of IRK, Leu-1219 is part of a binding pocket that surrounds the P+3 methionine side chain of the peptide substrate (12Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In the Abl homology model, the residue homologous to Leu-1219 is Tyr-569. Tyr-569 is partially solvent-exposed in our model and could adopt the same role as Leu-1219 in IRK (Fig. 2). Three separate mutant forms of Abl-CAT were engineered with amino acid substitutions at Tyr-569: Y569L, Y569A, and Y569W. Alanine was chosen as a substitute for Tyr-569 to examine the effects of minimizing the amino acid side chain length. In c-Src, the residue corresponding to Tyr-569 is a leucine (28Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar), and the specificity of c-Src at the P+3 position differs from that of Abl (10Zhou S. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). For this reason, we chose to introduce leucine as a substitute for Tyr-569. We also mutated Tyr-569 to Trp because the Abl homology model suggests that a large side chain at this position might cause the putative P+3 substrate-binding pocket to be too narrow to accommodate amino acids with large side chains such as proline. Initial screens of Abl mutants were carried out using peptide concentrations of 1.5 mm and measuring [32P]ATP incorporation after 20 min to assess any changes in substrate phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Experiments using low (50 μm) peptide concentrations showed no changes in the rank order of specificity compared with those using higher peptide concentrations (data not shown). These initial activity measurements indicated that the Y569W and Y569L mutants had an altered specificity (Fig. 3); in particular, recognition of Pro at the P+3 position was greatly reduced. These changes in specificity were characterized further by more detailed kinetic analyses (TableII). The kinetic measurements show that the Y569W mutant phosphorylated the P+1Ala/P+3Met peptide best, with aV max/K m value of 5.6. The P+1Met/P+3Pro peptide, the best for the wild type with a V max/K m value of 10.7, was phosphorylated less efficiently by this mutant, with aV max/K m value of 1.3 (TableII). The phosphorylation of other peptides by the Y569W mutant was similar to the wild type (Fig. 3 and Table II). The difference in specificity observed in the Y569W mutant therefore arises from a decrease in V max/K m for the P+3Pro peptide specifically rather than an overall decrease in the phosphorylation of all peptides. Kinetic measurements also showed a decrease in the phosphorylation of the P+1Met/P+3Pro peptide by Y569L, with aV max/K m value of 4.4 (wild-type V max/K m = 10.7) (Table II). The Y569A mutant did not display any changes in phosphorylation of the peptides tested compared with wild-type Abl (Fig. 3), and we did not carry out kinetic analysis of this mutant.Table IIKinetic measurements for wild-type Abl and two mutant forms of Abl (Y569W and Y569L)EnzymeV maxK mV max/K mV max/K mrationmol/min/mgmmWild typeP+1Met/P+3Pro7.5 ± 0.90.7 ± 0.210.71.0P+1Met/P+3Thr2.3 ± 0.51.8 ± 0.61.31.0P+1Ala/P+3Met2.5 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.16.31.0P+1Nle/P+3Met3.4 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.26.81.0Y569LP+1Met/P+3Pro4.4 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.44.40.4P+1Met/P+3Thr2.0 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.12.21.7P+1Ala/P+3Met1.9 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.22.40.4P+1Nle/P+3Met3.6 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.17.21.1Y569WP+1Met/P+3Pro2.5 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.11.30.1P+1Ala/P+3Met2.8 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.15.60.9Enzyme/peptide combinations were chosen based on initial comparisons of enzymatic activity toward P+1/P+3 peptides (Fig. 3).

To compare phosphorylation of a particular peptide by mutant versus wild type, theV max/K m value for the mutant was divided by the value for the wild type. This ratio is given in the last column. Two residues in Abl-CAT, Phe-521 and Ile-523, were identified as residues that might contribute to P+1 substrate specificity (Fig. 2). Ile-523 was chosen based on the homology model. A solvent-accessible surface representation suggests that Ile-523 is partially solvent-exposed and forms the edge of a groove into which a substrate amino acid side chain may fit. Two substitutions were made for Ile-523: I523V and I523A. These amino acid substitutions were chosen to examine the effect of shortening the side chain on accommodating P+1 residues. Phe-521 was selected to test the possibility that residues near the activation loop contribute to specificity; based on homology to other protein kinases, the activation loop in Abl is predicted to span residues 500–521. We examined the effects of smaller (F521A) and larger (F521W) side chains at this position. Initial measurements of activity were used to assess changes in specificity (Fig. 4) using a panel of peptides that vary at the P+1 position. Initial rate measurements were used to characterize the changes in specificity shown in the I523V and F521A mutants (TableIII). The I523A and F521W mutants did not display any changes in specificity and were indistinguishable from wild-type enzyme in our initial comparisons (Fig. 4). For this reason, we did not pursue kinetic characterization of these mutants.Table IIIKinetic measurements for wild-type Abl and two mutant forms of Abl (I523V and F521A)EnzymeV maxK mV max/K mV max/K mrationmol/min/mgmmWild typeP+1Ala/P+3Met2.5 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.16.31.0P+1Nle/P+3Met3.4 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.26.81.0P+1Ile/P+3Met0.6 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.11.21.0I523VP+1Ala/P+3Met4.8 ± 0.50.5 ± 0.110.01.6P+1Nle/P+3Met3.3 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.16.61.0P+1Ile/P+3Met2.1 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.14.23.5F521AP+1Ala/P+3Met5.2 ± 0.50.4 ± 0.113.02.1P+1Nle/P+3Met3.4 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.18.51.3P+1Ile/P+3Met2.2 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.11.51.3Enzyme/peptide combinations were chosen based on initial comparisons of enzymatic activity toward all P+1 peptides (Fig. 4).

The three genes of the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV cluster are expressed in the intestine following cephalocaudal and crypt-to-villus axes. Previous studies have shown that the –780/–520 enhancer region of the apoC-III gene directs the expression of the apoA-I gene in both small intestinal villi and crypts, implying that other unidentified elements are necessary for a normal intestinal pattern of apoA-I gene expression. In this study, we have characterized transgenic mice expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the control of different regions of the apoC-III and apoA-IV promoters. We found that the –890/+24 apoC-III promoter directed the expression of the reporter gene in crypts and villi and did not follow a cephalocaudal gradient of expression. In contrast, the −700/+10 apoA-IV promoter linked to the −500/−890 apoC-III enhancer directed the expression of the reporter gene in enterocytes with a pattern of expression similar to that of the endogenous apoA-IV gene. Furthermore, linkage of the −700/−310 apoA-IV distal promoter region to the −890/+24 apoC-III promoter was sufficient to restore the appropriate pattern of intestinal expression of the reporter gene. These findings demonstrate that the −700/−310 distal region of the apoA-IV promoter contains regulatory elements that, in combination with proximal promoter elements and the −500/−890 enhancer, are necessary and sufficient to restrict apoC-III and apoA-IV gene expression to villus enterocytes of the small intestine along the cephalocaudal axis.

The mammalian small intestine is lined with a constantly renewing epithelium that is compartmentalized into a proliferative undifferentiated zone located in intestinal crypts and a nonproliferative differentiated zone located in the villi. The epithelium is composed of four specialized cell types that arise from stem cells located just above the base of the crypts (1Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Enterocytes, mucus-producing goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells differentiate as they migrate to the top of the villi, whereas Paneth cells differentiate and migrate to the base of the crypts. Each lineage completes its differentiation program through an orderly migration (2Schmidt G.H. Wilkinson M.M. Ponder B.A.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,3Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G813-G822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enterocytes are the most abundant epithelial cells in the small intestine and express a variety of specific genes as they exit the crypt compartment. Despite the rapid renewal of the intestinal epithelium, numerous genes display a specific pattern of expression in enterocytes from the proximal to the distal intestine and from the crypt to the villus tip (4Henning S.J.

The FABP-I promoter (−103/+28) is sufficient to direct transcription of the gene along the duodenum-to-colon axis. However, upstream sequences are needed to confine FABP-I expression to differentiated enterocytes of the villus. In particular, a 20-bp element located between nucleotides –263 and –244 of the promoter prevents FABP-I expression in crypt cells (6Cohn S.T. Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Birkenmeir E.H. Gordon J.I J.

A. 1995; 92: 8685-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Liver and intestinal human apoB gene expression is governed by distinct regulatory regions. Intestinal expression requires a very distant element located between 33 and 70 kb 5′ upstream from the apoB gene (11Nielsen L.B. McCormick S.P.A. Pierotti V. Tam C. Gunn M.D. Shizuya H. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29752-29758Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similarly, the −256/+22 proximal promoter of the human apoA-I gene is sufficient to direct its hepatic transcription. However, the sequences responsible for the intestinal expression reside 9 kb downstream from the human apoA-I gene (12Walsh A. Ito Y. Breslow J.L. J. Biol.

The human apoA-I gene is expressed at similar levels in the intestine and liver, whereas the human apoC-III gene is expressed predominantly in the liver and to a lesser extent in the intestine (13Zannis V.I. Cole F.S. Jackson C.L. Kurnit C.L. Karathanasis S.K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The apoA-IV gene is mainly expressed in the intestine in humans and non-human primates. ApoA-IV is also expressed in the liver in mice (13Zannis V.I. Cole F.S. Jackson C.L. Kurnit C.L. Karathanasis S.K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4450-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Elshourbagy N.A. Boguski M.S. Liao W.S.L. Jefferson L.S. Gordon J.I. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The apoA-I and apoA-IV genes are transcribed in the same direction, whereas the apoC-III gene is transcribed in the opposite direction. The apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region therefore constitutes a common 6.6-kb 5′-flanking sequence for these two genes. Since the three genes are expressed at different levels in the liver and intestine, this gene cluster represents an interesting model to decipher the molecular mechanisms involved in the determination of tissue-specific expression. The intestinal expression of the cluster is entirely restricted to enterocytes as they emerge from the crypt (15Gutierrez E.D. Grapperhaus K.J. Rubin D.C. Am. J.

A preliminary report indicated that the apoC-III/A-IV intergenic region allows the intestinal expression of the apoA-IV gene in transgenic mice (17Lauer S.J. Simonet W.S. Bucay N. de Silva H.V. Taylor J.M. Circulation. 1991; 84 (abstr.): 1390Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). More recently, Bisaha et al. (16Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the −890/−500 apoC-III enhancer is sufficient to direct the intestinal expression of the apoA-I gene. Based on these in vivo studies and previous in vitro promoter studies performed by us and others, we hypothesized that common regulatory sequences control the intestinal expression of the three genes of the cluster. In this study, we generated transgenic mice expressing the CAT reporter gene under the control of specific regulatory sequences of the apoA-IV/C-III intergenic region. Analysis of these mouse lines showed that the −700/−310 apoA-IV promoter in combination with the −500/−890 apoC-III enhancer is sufficient for correct gene expression in the enterocytes along the proximal-to-distal and crypt-to-villus axes. The different transgenes used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The transgenes C3-CAT and eC3-A4-CAT were obtained by digestion of the pUCSH-CAT plasmid containing the −890/+24 5′-flanking region of the human apoC-III gene or the –700/+10 apoA-IV promoter region fused with the −500/−890 apoC-III enhancer region, respectively, with XbaI andBamHI (see Fig. 1 A). These plasmids have previously been described (18Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The transgene dA4-C3-CAT was obtained from a plasmid in which the human −890/+24 apoC-III promoter region fused upstream from the CAT reporter gene was linked in the opposite direction to the −700/+10 apoA-IV promoter region fused with the lacZ reporter gene. This vector was constructed as follows. The −700/+10 apoA-IV promoter region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using nucleotide primers from −700 to −680 (coding strand) and from +10 to −10 (noncoding strand) containing a SalI and aHindIII restriction site, respectively. The resulting apoA-IV fragment was cloned upstream from the lacZ gene fused to a nuclear localization sequence (20Li Z. Marchand P. Humbert J. Babinet C. Paulin D. Development (Camb.). 1993; 117: 947-959PubMed Google Scholar); the C3-CAT fragment was then inserted in the BamHI and XbaI sites, upstream from the apoA-IV promoter in the opposite direction. The dA4-C3-CAT transgene was excised from the plasmid by digestion withBamHI and SmaI at a site located at nucleotide –310 in the apoA-IV promoter. Transgenes were dissolved at a concentration of 4 ng/μl and microinjected into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6J × CBA/J females mated with males of the same strain using established procedures (21Le Beyec J. Benetollo C. Chauffeton V. Domiar A. Lafrenière M.-J. Chambaz J. Cardot P. Kalopissis A. Transgenics. 1998; 2: 211-220Google Scholar). DNA was extracted from the tails of 10–15-day-old pups and then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to sequences +163 to +189 (coding strand) and +696 to +670 (noncoding strand) of the CAT gene. Founder mice were then further analyzed by Southern blotting, and the copy number was estimated by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms as described previously (21Le Beyec J. Benetollo C. Chauffeton V. Domiar A. Lafrenière M.-J. Chambaz J. Cardot P. Kalopissis A. Transgenics. 1998; 2: 211-220Google Scholar). Positive founder F0 mice were outbred to generate lines of heterozygous mice. Individual tissue samples were homogenized and assayed for CAT activity as described previously (22Pothier F. Ouellet M.

The percentage of chloramphenicol converted to acetylated forms was determined either by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms or by scraping individual spots from the thin-layer chromatogram and counting in a scintillation counter. CAT activity is expressed as pmol of acetyl chloramphenicol generated per min/mg of protein after subtracting the background for each tissue from control mice, which do not express the CAT gene.

The two cDNAs were digested with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into the pBluescript KS vector that had previously been digested withXbaI/HindIII. A 265-bp fragment of the CAT gene was obtained from pUCSH-CAT by digestion with HindIII andEcoRI and cloned into the pBluescript SK vector. Both sense and antisense mouse apoA-IV and apoC-III RNA probes (size: 300 bp) were generated using T3 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively (Promega). Sense and antisense CAT riboprobes were synthesized with T7 and T3 polymerases, respectively. All probes were labeled using35S-UTP. Adult mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the entire small intestines were rapidly removed and divided into three parts representing the proximal, middle, and distal regions of the small intestine. The samples were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm thick) were mounted on glass slides. In situ hybridization was performed by a modification of the method of Sassoon and Rosenthal (26Sassoon D. Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 384-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Sections of small intestine were hybridized with 200,000 cpm of probe/slide at 42 °C overnight. Tissues were washed for 30 min in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 10 mm dithiothreitol at 50 °C, two times for 20 min in 2× SSC and 50% formamide at 60 °C, and for 10 min in 1× SSC at 37 °C and then treated for 30 min with RNase A. Subsequent washes in 1× and 0.1× SSC at 37 °C were followed by dehydration in graded ethanol for total desiccation. The washed slides were dipped into Kodak NTB2 emulsion, stored in the dark at −20 °C for 8–16 days, and then developed. Total RNA from intestinal segments was extracted (RNazol kit, Bioprobe Systems), separated on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized with the [32P]dCTP-labeled mouse apoC-III and apoA-IV cDNA probes in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.04% pyrophosphate, 5 mm sodium Pi, and 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA at 42 °C. Washings were performed in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The quality and the amount of RNA samples were estimated using an 18 S RNA probe. Autoradiograms were scanned using an NIH Imager analysis program. Intestinal CAT activity was measured in the small intestine using the technique of Donoghue et al. (27Donoghue M.J. Alvarez J.D. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,28Donoghue M.J. Morris-Valero R. Johnson Y.R. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1992; 69: 67-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Additional acetyl-CoA was added after 12 h of incubation. Slides were prepared from tissues of nontransgenic mice. Mice were analyzed and utilized as controls. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, and sections (4 μm thick) were stained using the periodic acid-Schiff technique to identify goblet cells and the Grimelius silver method to identify enteroendocrine cells. We generated transgenic mice expressing the CAT reporter gene under the control of either the human –890/+24 apoC-III promoter (C3-CAT) (Fig.1 B) or the human –700/+10 apoA-IV promoter fused to the –500/–890 apoC-III enhancer in the opposite direction to the apoA-IV promoter in accordance with the organization of the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster (eC3-A4-CAT) (Fig.1 B). The number of transgene copies incorporated into the genome of each transgenic founder was determined by Southern blot analysis in comparison with increasing amounts of the transgene diluted in nontransgenic DNA (Fig. 1 C and TableI).Table ICAT activity in different tissues of CAT transgenic miceTransgeneMouse lineCopy No.TissueLiverIntestineKidneyHeartLungBrainMuscleProximalMiddleDistalpmol product formed/mg tissue (wet weight)/minC3-CATV2420 ± 300aResults are presented as means ± S.D. of at least three mice analyzed.67 ± 10150 ± 120150 ± 6051 ± 12113 ± 5748 ± 360 ± 4948 ± 3W>106217 ± 11712388 ± 7371308 ± 4011670 ± 59351 ± 12136 ± 57048 ± 42NDbND, not determined.Y2–562 ± 220.430001.4 ± 20.7 ± 0.70.5 ± 0.80.2 ± 0.3eC3-A4-CATZf21820 ± 6602574 ± 711251 ± 415<9035 ± 4500070 ± 40Zc>2017,05523,58812,566104421280029Zg2–55.5 ± 1.50.30.25000000a Results are presented as means ± S.D. of at least three mice analyzed.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab CAT activity was determined in tissue extracts from adult transgenic mice of each line (Table I). In all cases, CAT activity was mainly detected in the liver and small intestine, although ectopic expression of the CAT gene was observed in the heart of C3-CAT transgenic mice. Despite differences in the level of expression of the transgene, tissular distribution of CAT activity was similar in the different lines produced with the same transgene. This distribution differed in different transgenes. In C3-CAT transgenic mice, the CAT activity in any part of the intestine did not exceed one-third of the liver activity measured. In contrast, in eC3-A4-CAT transgenic mice, the level of CAT activity in the proximal and middle regions of the small intestine was similar to that in the liver. From each construct, two mouse lines exhibiting the highest CAT activity were further studied: lines V and W of C3-CAT transgenic mice and lines Zf and Ze of eC3-A4-CAT transgenic mice. The spatial pattern of expression of the transgenes in the intestine along the crypt-to-villus and cephalocaudal axes was further determined and compared with that of endogenous mouse apoC-III and apoA-IV genes (Fig. 2). CAT activity did not vary along the small intestine when CAT gene expression was controlled by the –890/+24 apoC-III promoter (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, CAT activity displayed a decreasing cephalocaudal gradient in eC3-A4-CAT mice (Fig. 2 A). This expression pattern mimicked that of endogenous mouse apoA-IV and apoC-III mRNAs (Fig.2 B). Transgenic expression along the crypt-to-villus axis in the intestine was analyzed by in situ hybridization (Fig.3). To demonstrate the specificity of the signal, an antisense and a sense CAT riboprobe were first hybridized to sections of nontransgenic and transgenic jejunum, respectively, as negative controls (Fig. 3, a and b). Using dark-field microscopy, a few scattered grains representing the background signal were seen with both probes. The CAT reporter gene driven by the human −890/+24 apoC-III promoter was expressed markedly in the crypt cells and lightly in the villus epithelial cells of the transgenic mice (Fig. 3 d). The endogenous mouse apoC-III gene was expressed similarly in the crypt and villus epithelial cells (Fig. 3 c). In contrast to C3-CAT transgenic mice, eC3-A4-CAT transgenic mice exhibited a pattern of CAT mRNA expression in the crypt-to-villus unit that was strikingly similar to that of the endogenous mouse apoA-IV mRNA (Fig. 3, e andf). These results suggest that the −700/+10 apoA-IV promoter contains a regulatory region that, in combination with the −500/−890 apoC-III enhancer, restricts the expression of the reporter gene to the villus, thus reproducing in the transgenic mice the crypt-to-villus gradient of expression that is observed for the endogenous apoA-IV gene. To determine which region of the apoA-IV promoter was responsible for the expression pattern along both the cephalocaudal and crypt-to-villus axes, we generated additional mouse lines expressing the reporter CAT transgene under the control of the –890/+24 apoC-III promoter fused to the –310/−700 apoA-IV distal promoter region (Fig. 1 B). Three founders were identified by polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed by Southern blotting (Fig. 1 C). As in C3-CAT transgenic mice, CAT activity was much higher in the liver than in the intestine of dA4-C3-CAT mice. However, in the latter, we observed a decreasing gradient of CAT activity from the proximal to the distal region of the intestine (Fig. 4). This pattern of expression differed from that of C3-CAT transgenic mice (Fig. 2). Thus, the addition of the –310/–700 apoA-IV distal promoter region to the –890/+24 apoC-III promoter restored the cephalocaudal pattern of expression observed for the endogenous apoC-III gene. The expression of the transgene in the crypt-to-villus unit was visualized by histochemical staining of the nuclei of CAT-expressing cells in the small intestine. No staining was observed in control mice (Fig. 5, a and a′) or in the lamina propria of transgenic mice (Fig. 5). CAT histochemistry revealed a pattern of expression similar to that observed previously by in situ hybridization. Crypt and villus nuclei were stained in C3-CAT transgenic samples (Fig. 5,b and b′), whereas staining was restricted to the villus in eC3-A4-CAT transgenic mice (c and c′) as well as in dA4-C3-CAT transgenic samples (d andd′). Thus, the addition of the −310/−700 apoA-IV distal promoter region restricted the expression of the dA4-C3-CAT transgene to the villus in a pattern similar to that of endogenous apoA-IV, but not of endogenous apoC-III. After double staining the villus epithelial cells from dA4-C3-CAT intestine, neither enteroendocrine cells, visualized by Grimelius staining (Fig. 6, a andb), nor the goblet cells, visualized by periodic acid-Schiff staining (Fig. 6 c), coincided with the specific staining of nuclei of CAT-expressing cells. These results suggest that the −310/−700 apoA-IV distal promoter region is sufficient to restrict gene expression to villus enterocytes along the cephalocaudal axis. A preliminary report has shown that the entire intergenic region between the apoC-III and apoA-IV genes directs a pattern of expression of the transgene similar to that of endogenous apoA-IV (17Lauer S.J. Simonet W.S. Bucay N. de Silva H.V. Taylor J.M. Circulation. 1991; 84 (abstr.): 1390Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This expression was abolished with shorter constructs lacking the apoC-III promoter region. Bisaha et al. (16Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) showed that the apoC-III enhancer, located at nucleotide –520 upstream from the transcription initiation site of the apoC-III gene, is sufficient to direct the intestinal expression of the apoA-I gene, the third gene of the apoA-I/C-III/A-IV cluster, but not to restrict its expression to the villus. This prompted us to decipher the regulatory regions responsible for the accurate expression of apoA-IV by combining the apoC-III enhancer and the apoA-IV promoter. In our present study, we found that a combination of the −890/−500 apoC-III enhancer and the −700/−310 apoA-IV distal promoter allowed the intestinal expression of the apoA-IV gene in transgenic mice, specifically in the villus enterocytes, with a cephalocaudal gradient. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the appropriate lineage-specific crypt-to-villus and cephalocaudal patterns of human apoA-IV expression in transgenic mouse intestine require both the apoC-III enhancer and the apoA-IV distal promoter. Our findings indicate that CAT activity in the intestine and liver in mice expressing the eC3-A4-CAT transgene reproduces the correct pattern of expression of endogenous mouse apoA-IV rather than that of human apoA-IV, which is predominantly expressed in the intestine. Laueret al. (17Lauer S.J. Simonet W.S. Bucay N. de Silva H.V. Taylor J.M. Circulation. 1991; 84 (abstr.): 1390Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported no expression of the human apoA-IV gene in the liver of transgenic mice expressing human apoA-IV genomic sequences containing 5′-flanking regions 0.3–7.7 kb long and a 3′-flanking region 1.5 kb long. These results, taken conjunction with our own, suggest that a hepatic silencer may reside downstream from nucleotide +24 of the human apoA-IV gene. It is possible that either a silencer in the human apoA-IV promoter or differences in the nuclear activities between humans and rodents may account for this difference in tissue-specific expression of the apoA-IV gene. Similarly, the weak ectopic expression of the C3-CAT and eC3-A4-CAT transgenes in tissues other than those of the liver and intestine may reflect the lack of tissue-specific silencers in the −890/+24 apoC-III and −700/+10 apoA-IV promoter regions. In vitro transfection assays in the Caco-2 cell line showed that the transcription of the apoA-IV gene is controlled by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), which binds to its proximal promoter region and requires the presence of other transcription factors that recognize elements of the apoC-III enhancer (19Ktistakis E.

Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, the transcription of apoA-I and apoC-III genes is driven through a synergy between HNF4 and others factors that bind the apoC-III enhancer (16Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I.

(16Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that a region of the apoC-III enhancer containing the HNF4-binding site is insufficient to drive in vivo the intestinal expression of the apoA-I gene. Nevertheless, this factor could actively participate in the determination of intestinal apoA-I/C-III/A-IV gene expression. An HNF4-binding site has also been described in the FABP-I proximal enhancer, which is essential for intestinal expression (35Rottman J.N. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11994-12002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the involvement of HNF4 in the onset of intestinal functions has been demonstrated by the interruption of intestine development under extinction of the HNF4 homolog in Drosophila (36Zhong W. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The eC3-A4-CAT transgene, which retains the −890/−500 apoC-III enhancer and −700/+10 apoA-IV promoter regions, was able to direct a pattern of CAT activity among intestinal segments that resembled both the pattern of endogenous mouse apoA-IV and that observed in rats and chickens (14Elshourbagy N.A. Boguski M.S. Liao W.S.L. Jefferson L.S. Gordon J.I. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8242-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Steinmetz A. Hermann M. Nimpf J. Aebersold R. Ducret A. Weinberg R.B. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10543-10549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of the reporter gene was restricted to villus cells in a manner similar to the expression pattern of the endogenous mouse apoA-IV gene and also to that observed in rats (38Rubin D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G853-G863PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the apoA-IV promoter contains an element prohibiting the transcription of the reporter gene in crypt epithelial cells and in the distal part of the small intestine. As already discussed, the apoC-III promoter region was not sufficient to restrict intestinal expression along the crypt-to-villus and cephalocaudal gradients. The addition of the −700/−310 apoA-IV distal promoter to the apoC-III enhancer allowed the expression of the reporter gene to mimic the cephalocaudal gradient displayed by endogenous mouse apoC-III. Furthermore, the −700/−310 apoA-IV promoter region retained the elements sufficient to restrict expression to villus-associated enterocytes. These findings indicate that the −310/−700 apoA-IV promoter region confers two suppressor functions, one prohibiting gene expression in the distal small intestine and the other prohibiting gene expression in crypt epithelial cells. The spatial patterns of gene expression in the intestine involve both positive and negative elements. This has also been reported for the rat FABP-I gene, the rat liver fatty acid-binding protein gene, and the sucrase-isomaltase gene (6Cohn S.T. Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Birkenmeir E.H. Gordon J.I J.

A. 1995; 92: 8685-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) identified a 20-nucleotide element in the FABP-I promoter that modulates the intestinal cellular and spatial expression of the FABP-I gene. This element acts as a suppressor of gene expression in the distal small intestine/colon, as a suppressor of gene activation in the crypt, and as a suppressor of gene expression in the Paneth cell lineage (10Simon T.C. Roberts L.J.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8685-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No sequence in the −700/−310 apoA-IV distal promoter significantly matched this 20-bp element. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that in both apoA-IV and FABP-I, a distinct element controls a similar appropriate pattern of gene expression. Whether these two different elements bind similar or different repressors of gene expression in crypts and the distal part of the intestine remains to be established.

Here, we explore domains of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor that are critical for ligand binding, using a novel series of fluorescent photolabile probes, receptor proteolysis, and rapid high resolution separation of peptide fragments by capillary electrophoresis. Each probe incorporated the same fluorophore and a photolabilep-benzoylphenylalanine at the amino terminus of the pharmacophoric domain (residue 24 of CCK-33) of CCK analogues representing full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist of this receptor.

Remarkable diversity exists for structures capable of high affinity binding and activation of G protein-coupled receptors. Understanding the molecular determinants of ligand binding provides important insights that may be useful in structure-based drug design and in understanding the basic mechanisms of receptor activation. Photoaffinity labeling provides the most direct way to identify sites of contact between residues in ligands and a receptor (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

In the present work, we have optimized and extended this to apply to extremely sparse, wild-type receptor molecules. We achieved this through the use of the combination of CE and detection by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).

We have applied this methodology to a series of novel probes of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor, and have demonstrated that the amino terminus of the pharmacophoric domain of peptide analogues, representing a full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist of the CCK receptor, resides in proximity to the same receptor domain, most likely representing the first extracellular loop, whereas the mid-region of a related agonist probe resides adjacent to a distinct receptor domain, representing the region in the third extracellular loop just outside of the seventh transmembrane domain (15Hadac E.M.

Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Gaisano H.Y. Klueppelberg U.G. Pinon D.I. Pfenning M.A. Powers S.P. Miller L.J. J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 357-362PubMed Google Scholar). The design of each probe was based on well established structure-activity information for CCK analogues (17Gaisano H.Y. Klueppelberg U.G.

The only difference from the fully characterized analogues was the addition of a fluorescent bodipy moiety with a glycine spacer at the amino terminus of the peptides, a position known to be fully tolerant of such a modification (19Pearson R.K. Powers S.P. Hadac E.M. Gaisano H. Miller L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These probes represent the following: Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist, Bodipy-Gly-Bpa-Gly-Asp-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2; Bodipy-Bpa24 -partial agonist, Bodipy-Gly-Bpa-Gly-Asp-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-phenylethyl ester; Bodipy-Bpa24 -antagonist, Bodipy-Gly-Bpa-Gly-Asp-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-(d-Trp)-Nle-Asp-phenylethyl ester; and Bodipy-Bpa29 agonist, Bodipy-Gly-Asp-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Bpa-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2. Each peptide was synthesized to the level of the photolabile Bpa residue, deprotected, and purified to homogeneity by HPLC. Then the remainder of the synthesis was performed in solution usingN-hydroxysuccinimide active esters and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protection. Completeness of conjugation was followed by HPLC, and deprotection was performed in 20% piperidine/dimethylformamide. Each peptide was then purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. An additional probe was synthesized that was fully analogous to the Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist, except that the fluorophore was replaced with a des-amino-tyrosyl moiety that is amenable to radioiodination (radioiodinatable-Bpa24 agonist, des-amino-Tyr-Gly-Bpa-Gly-Asp-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2). This was prepared in a manner fully analogous to that described above. This was radioiodinated oxidatively and purified to a specific radioactivity of 2,000 Ci/mmol using reversed-phase HPLC, in a manner analogous to that previously reported (21Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells that do not express endogenous type A or type B CCK receptors (21Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cell line stably expressing type A receptor (CHO-CCKR), which has been previously extensively characterized (21Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was obtained by transfecting these cells with rat type A CCK receptor cDNA. Receptors were expressed in density approximately 25 times that of the pancreatic acinar cell (125,000 sites per CHO-CCKR cell), bound ligands with appropriate structural specificity, and were appropriately coupled to signaling machinery (21Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on tissue culture plastic in Ham's F-12 medium in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were typically passaged twice weekly. Before use, cells were lifted mechanically and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 138 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl. Plasma membranes were prepared by nitrogen cavitation and discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Briefly, cells (about 5 × 107 cells from 10 tissue culture flasks) were suspended in 9 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and equilibrated at room temperature for 15 min under nitrogen at a pressure of 300 psi in a Kontes pressure homogenizer (Kontes, NJ). Upon the release of the pressure, the broken cell suspension was collected and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove intact cells and nuclei. The supernatant was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient that was followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3 h, as described previously (22Dong M. Penin F. Baggetto L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28875-28883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membranes at the interface between layers of 16 and 31% sucrose were diluted to 12 ml with Krebs-Ringers-Hepes (KRH) medium containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmKH2PO4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were suspended in 2.5 ml KRH medium, homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with 3 strokes, and stored at −80 °C. For covalent labeling of receptors, membranes from the CHO-CCKR cells (0.4 ml of plasma membranes containing approximately 100 μg of protein) were incubated with 1 nm Bodipy-conjugated probes in KRH buffer in the absence or presence of various concentrations of CCK (ranging from 0 to 0.1 μm). Incubations were performed for 1 h at room temperature or for 2.5 h at 4 °C, as indicated in the figure legends. The membranes were then photolyzed using a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500 Å lamps for 30 min at 4 °C. After being washed twice with KRH medium, the final pellets were suspended in 0.2 ml 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After photolysis, plasma membranes were adsorbed to C18-derivatized silica by agitation at room temperature for 30 min. CNBr digestion followed the procedure described by Kageet al. (23Kage R. Leeman S.E. Krause J.E. Costello C.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Resulting peptide fragments were eluted from the silica in 70% acetonitrile, 30% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot was directly analyzed by CE, and another aliquot was deglycosylated chemically using hydrogen fluoride, according to the method of Mort and Lamport (24Mort A.J. Lamport D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and Pearson et al. (25Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction lasted for 1 h before the hydrogen fluoride was removed by distillation, and the residue was washed with 70% acetonitrile, 30% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried in vacuo, and resuspended in the same medium for CE analysis. In a parallel series of studies performed with the radioiodinated-Bpa24 agonist, the intact, deglycosylated, and CNBr-digested receptor were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography, as we previously described (15Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CE separation was carried out on a Beckman P/ACE System 5500 with a laser-induced fluorescence detector (argon-ion laser, 3–4 mW, Beckman Instruments). The excitation wavelength on the CE was fixed at 488 nm, and the emission wavelength was 520 nm. Beckman System Gold software (version 8.1, Beckman) was used for system control and data collection and processing. All peak information was obtained through the System Gold software. CE was performed using conditions recently developed for the separation of fragments obtained from bacteriorhodopsin (5Dong M. Oda R.P. Strausbauch M.A. Wettstein P.J. Landers J.P. Miller L.J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, a polybrene-coated capillary (47-cm × 50-μm) was rinsed before sample injection under high pressure (20 psi, 138 kPa) for 2 min with separation buffer containing 1 m acetic acid and 10 mm hexanesulfonic acid. Samples were introduced by low pressure (0.5 psi, 3.45 kPa; 16 nl volume) for 10 s. Electrophoresis was performed at 15 kV under reversed polarity (cathode to anode) for 30 min. After each run, the capillary was washed for 30 s with 70% acetonitrile with 30% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and followed by rinsing with the separation buffer for 2 min. Capillaries were re-coated after every 20 runs because of slight shifts in elution positions and broadening of peaks. For this reason, coinjection experiments were performed for every pair of conditions thought to represent the same fluorescently labeled peaks. Five photolabile CCK analogues were synthesized and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phased HPLC. Structures were confirmed and quantified by amino acid analysis. Fig.1 shows the structures of the fluorescent ligands used in the present study. Three of these probes, representing full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist, had a photolabile Bpa at the amino terminus of the pharmacophoric domain of the peptide in the identical position of residue 24 of CCK-33 (standard numbering convention for CCK peptides). The fourth probe was also a fluorescent full agonist, but with the Bpa residue positioned in the middle of the peptide pharmacophoric domain, in the site of Gly29. The fifth probe was a radioiodinatable-Bpa24 agonist, fully analogous to one of the key fluorescent compounds in the series. Fig.2 shows a series of capillary electropherograms of the Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist obtained with 16-nl injections at various concentrations. The limit of detection with a 3-mW argon ion laser at 488 nm (defined as the mass of analyte injected to give a peak height no less than three times the standard deviation of the baseline; signal-to-noise ratio) was 1.6 attomoles. Similar detection of limits (1.5–2.0 attomoles) were also achieved for each of the other Bodipy-conjugated probes used in this study. Of note, the injection of 16 attomoles, representing 10 times the detection limit, provided an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, as shown in Fig.2 C. Fig. 3illustrates the CE elution profile of the CNBr digest of CHO-CCKR cell membranes affinity labeled with the Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist probe and the complete series of controls used with each probe to better understand the identity of the eluting peaks. The elution position of the probe itself and its photostability, as assessed by its photolysis for 30 min at 4 °C in a nonreceptor-containing solution, are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. Fig. 3 Cillustrates the typical CE elution profile of the CNBr digest of affinity labeled CHO-CCKR cell membranes, which includes a major peak representing the free probe (eluting at 8 to 9 min) and two additional fluorescent peaks (eluting at 13 to 14 min) that were absent when the same experiment was performed in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of competing CCK (Fig. 3 D). These were felt to represent probe-receptor adducts. They were appropriately absent from the CE elution profile of the CNBr digest of plasma membranes from control nonreceptor-bearing CHO cells incubated with this probe (Fig.3 E). When affinity labeling of the CHO-CCKR cell membranes was performed at 4 °C for 1 h, peaks migrating in a similar position were also observed, although having a decreased fluorescence intensity to reflect the slower kinetics of binding at this temperature (Fig. 3 F). These were absent under these conditions when using 100-fold molar excess CCK during binding (Fig. 3 G). At 4 °C, when affinity labeling was extended to 2.5 h, fluorescent ligand attached to CCK receptor fragments was better detected (see below and Fig. 7).Figure 7CE electropherograms of CNBr-cleaved fragments of the CCK receptor on CHO-CCKR cell membranes affinity labeled with the Bodipy-Bpa29 agonist probe in the absence (panel A) and presence (panel B) of competing nonfluorescent 0.1 μm CCK. In panel C, products of affinity labeling with this probe were coinjected with Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist, demonstrating a clear difference in CE migration of labeled fragments. This was also true of fragments labeled by partial agonist and antagonist probes (not shown). The affinity labeling was performed for 2.5 h at 4 °C instead of room temperature. CE conditions were the same as those described in Fig. 2. Results displayed are typical of six independently performed experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It should be noted that a peak migrating at 7 min, just before the fluorescent ligand peak, in Fig. 3, C, D, andE, and in the following figures probably represents the degradation of the probe when the sample was incubated at room temperature, because it was not present when affinity labeling was performed at 4 °C (Figs. 3, F and G, and 7). This peak was present in both the experimental and control-competition affinity-labeling samples, and also in affinity-labeled samples from non-CCK receptor-bearing preparations, indicating that it was not the type of saturable binding expected of a receptor fragment adduct. Probe degradation may also have contributed to the dual probe-receptor fragment adduct peaks that were often observed. Alternatively, these could also reflect the covalent labeling of the same receptor fragment at different positions. Fig. 4 shows capillary electropherograms of CNBr-cleaved CCK receptor fragments labeled by each of three fluorescent probes, Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist (Fig.4 A), Bodipy-Bpa24 partial agonist (Fig.4 C), and Bodipy-Bpa24 antagonist (Fig.4 E). The elution profiles for each were almost identical, with elution times in the 13- to 14-min range for the best candidate peaks to represent receptor fragment adducts. These migrated more slowly than the respective free probes (the second major peak in each profile). Like the labeling of the CCK receptor fragment with the agonist probe (Figs. 3 D and 4 B), labeling of CCK receptor fragments by the partial agonist probe and the antagonist probe were fully saturable, being completely eliminated in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of CCK (Fig. 4, D andF). The detected covalent receptor fragment adduct peaks in Fig. 4, A, C, and E represented 9.2, 3.1, and 5.0 attomole, respectively, based on extrapolation of areas under the fluorescent peaks (sum of relevant areas) to those of injections of standard amounts of probe. Fig. 5 illustrates representative CE elution profiles of competition experiments using the nonfluorescent receptor ligand, CCK, to interfere with the affinity labeling of CHO-CCKR cell membranes with the Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist probe. The fluorescence intensity of the CCK receptor fragment-probe adduct decreased as the concentration of competing CCK increased. The probe-bound CCK receptor fragments started to decrease when CCK was present in a concentration as low as 0.1 nm, and they were completely eliminated with 0.1 μm CCK. The last panel in Fig. 5 shows quantitation of results of experiments of a series of these experiments. This was analogous to competition binding analysis of a CCK radioligand to membranes from these cells (21Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Such competitive inhibition was also typical of experiments performed with the partial agonist and antagonist probes (data not shown). To address whether all three probes having the Bpa in position of residue 24 were attached to the same CCK receptor fragment, combinations of pairs of samples were coinjected for analysis by CE. As shown in Fig. 6, coinjection of CCK receptor fragments attached to the agonist probe and that with the partial agonist probe (Fig. 6 A) did not produce additional peaks; neither did the coinjection of CCK receptor fragments attached to the agonist probe and that with the antagonist probe (Fig.6 B), nor did that of fragments with the partial agonist probe and that with the antagonist probe (Fig. 6 C). Like CE of separate injection of each probe attached to CCK receptor fragments, the peaks eluted in a consistent position, suggesting all three ligands share the same binding domain of the CCK receptor. An additional fluorescent probe, the Bodipy-BPA29 agonist, having its site of covalent attachment in a different region of the probe, labeled a distinct receptor fragment with differential CE migration, as shown in Fig. 7. This probe, attached to CCK receptor fragments, migrated at 6–8 min (Fig.7 A) and also competed with 100-fold molar excess of nonfluorescent CCK (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, these distinct fragments migrated quite differently from the covalent adducts described above. As shown by the coinjection experiments, these fragments migrated much faster than the fragments attached to the Bodipy-Bpa24 agonist (Fig. 7 C). This was also observed with partial agonist and antagonist probes (data not shown). This suggests that the Bodipy-BPA29 agonist site of attachment to the CCK receptor was quite different from that of the other probes or at least has a markedly different charge-to-mass ratio allowing it to migrate quite differently in free solution CE. To better understand the identity of the receptor fragments labeled by the photolabile probes, the products of CNBr digestion of the labeled CCK receptor that had been purified on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel were separated by NuPAGE gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. The fragments theoretically generated by CNBr cleavage of the CCK receptor are shown in Fig.8 A. We recently demonstrated that photoaffinity labeling of the CCK receptor through position 29 of a CCK analogue probe covalently labeled His347 and Leu348 in the third extracellular loop just outside of the seventh transmembrane domain of the receptor (15Hadac E.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas labeling through position 33 of a similar probe covalently labeled Trp39 in the amino-terminal tail just outside of the first transmembrane domain of the receptor (1Ji Z.

Autoradiography of a representative SDS-polyacrylamide gel separating the products of photoaffinity labeling the CHO-CCKR cell membranes is shown in Fig.8 B.

This band was not seen when performing analogous labeling of the nonreceptor-bearing CHO cell membranes. Digestion of the gel-purified photoaffinity-labeled CCK receptor using CNBr resulted in the labeling of a predominant band migrating at approximate M r = 4,500. The migration of this band was not modified by deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F. This band was clearly distinct from the bands previously reported to be labeled through agonist CCK analogue probes having photolabile residues in position 29 (M r = 6,700 with no shift by deglycosylation) and position 33 (M r = 25,000 and 8,500 after deglycosylation) (1Ji Z.

Given the mass of the probe (1666.8 daltons, assuming it is desulfated under the acidic conditions used for CNBr cleavage) and the impact of CNBr cleavage, the receptor fragments most consistent with these data represent the portions of the first and second loops of the CCK receptor highlighted in black circles in Fig.8 A. The first loop domain best fits the data, because the calculated mass (M+H)+ of the covalent probe-fragment adduct is m/z 4601.3, and no shift with deglycosylation would be expected. The calculated mass (M+H)+ of the covalent probe second loop fragment adduct ism/z 4147.5, assuming that the consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation (NxS/T) is not used. If this fragment were glycosylated, its mass could better approach the observed mass, but a shift in its migration would have then been expected after deglycosylation. No such shift was observed. An understanding of the molecular basis of ligand binding to a receptor and of the conformational changes involved in achieving the active or inactive states of a receptor will be powerful tools to aid in the rational design of novel therapeutics. Most insights contributing to our current understanding of this area have been low resolution or indirect, such as those provided by receptor mutagenesis studies and by structure-activity relationships for receptor ligands (28Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling of active site domains and residues provides more direct information regarding the ligand binding pocket (29Galardy R.E. Jamieson J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 852-863PubMed Google Scholar). This technique, however, has not been applied to a broad sampling of receptors or to a large series of ligands or sites within a ligand for a specific receptor because of inherent difficulties. These include the need to synthesize special ligand probes that incorporate photolabile residues as well as an indicator moiety, such as a radiolabel or a fluorophore. Additionally, such sites of potential covalent labeling of the receptor should ideally include complementary chemistries and varied positions within the ligand. Beyond the specialized preparation of such probes, the sparsity and physicochemical characteristics of the highly hydrophobic serpiginous G protein-coupled receptors and the typical inefficiency of establishing a covalent bond between the ligand and receptor make the ultimate purification of the receptor and its labeled fragments, and characterization of the specific site of covalent attachment quite difficult and time consuming to accomplish. We have recently begun the systematic application of this approach to the natural peptide agonist-binding domain of the CCK receptor using a series of radioiodinated photolabile probes (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the first of this series to be successful, we incorporated a Bpa residue into the position of the carboxyl-terminal residue of CCK and demonstrated the specific covalent labeling of the Trp39 residue predicted to reside just outside of the first transmembrane domain (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently, we have also been able to demonstrate a second residue-residue interaction between a photolabile residue in the mid-region of a CCK analogue (residue 29 of CCK-33) and His347 and Leu348 in the third extracellular loop outside of the seventh transmembrane segment (15Hadac E.M.

As noted above, these efforts required the use of large amounts of radioactivity and the incorporation of extensive, difficult, and inefficient purification procedures. These sites of contact are being used as constraints in an evolving model of the peptide agonist-occupied CCK receptor (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the difficulties described above for the photoaffinity labeling with radiolabeled probes led to our development of the novel approach reported here. In this work, we have developed a rapid and sensitive method for the localization of ligand-binding domains of G protein-coupled receptors using photoaffinity labeling with fluorescent photolabile probes, receptor proteolysis, and capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection. We have applied this to a novel series of peptide probes of the CCK receptor, representing structurally related full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist, with each having its site of covalent attachment to the receptor through a photolabile Bpa residue at the amino terminus of the ligand pharmacophore. Despite very different biological effects at the CCK receptor, each probe covalently labeled the same CNBr fragment of the receptor. In contrast, another structurally related full agonist peptide probe having its Bpa sited in the middle of the pharmacophoric domain labeled a distinct CNBr fragment of the receptor. These insights were achieved rapidly, without extensive purification of the receptor or its fragments, relying on the unique fluorescent signal provided by the probe and the low attomole sensitivity provided by CE-LIF. The Bodipy fluorophore incorporated into the probes was particularly well suited for this approach, because it is insensitive to exposure to acid, which is necessary for the CNBr cleavage of the receptor. The photolabile Bpa residue incorporated into the probes also possesses near ideal characteristics for the efficient establishment of covalent bonds to a domain in approximation to this residue in the probe upon photolysis, using conditions that are not destructive or damaging to the receptor. The conditions for the capillary electrophoresis of the hydrophobic peptide fragments of the hydrophobic serpiginous receptors were carefully established and optimized using bacteriorhodopsin as a model protein (5Dong M. Oda R.P. Strausbauch M.A. Wettstein P.J. Landers J.P. Miller L.J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is particularly interesting that each of the series of biologically divergent, yet structurally analogous, probes labeled the same receptor domain. This is consistent with each using the same docking determinants, placing the noncritical amino terminus of these probes in a similar position relative to the receptor. This receptor domain is clearly distinct from those recently demonstrated to be adjacent to the carboxyl terminus and mid-region of the pharmacophore of CCK (1Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A.

A strong case is made for this to represent the first extracellular loop of the receptor, based on its apparent migration on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the absence of any apparent shift in its migration after its deglycosylation. Of interest, this domain has also been shown to be important for CCK binding in receptor mutagenesis studies (30Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As more extensive proteolysis and finer mapping techniques are applied to the labeled fragments, it will be possible to determine whether the same receptor residue is the site of labeling for each probe. This would not be surprising, because the key determinants for biological activity reside in other regions of the peptide pharmacophore (31Ondetti M.A. Rubin B. Engel S.L. Pluscec J. Sheehan J.T. Am. J. Dig. Dis. 1970; 15: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We are not aware of any other existing examples of the utilization of this type of series of biologically divergent probes having a similar site of photolability and covalent attachment to probe critical receptor domains. This should provide a powerful direct approach to probe the receptor domain occupied by the ligands with the receptor presumably in distinct conformations associated with active, inactive, and partially active states."

For the family of G proteins that activate the phospholipase C/inositol trisphosphate/calcium/PKC pathway, such modification could result in G protein autoregulation. To examine the potential regulation of members of the Gαq family by PKC phosphorylation, we expressed the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor in combination with Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, or Gα16 inXenopus oocytes and examined the regulation of signaling by PKC activators and inhibitors. For Gα16 and Gα15, the two family members of hematopoietic lineage, PKC activators reduce both the magnitude and the time course of TRH-mediated responses; PKC inhibitors have the opposite effect. The PKC-mediated effects are evident in measurements of GTPase activity, suggesting that the regulation is occurring early in the signaling pathway. In vivo phosphorylation experiments demonstrate that Gα16 is a substrate for PKC modification. By comparison, Gαq is not phosphorylated by PKC in vivo, and oocytes expressing Gαq are not functionally modulated by PKC. Repeated TRH stimulation of oocytes expressing Gα16 mimics the effects of PKC activators, and this functional regulation is correlated with an increase in Gα16 phosphorylation. A mutant Gα16 with four consensus PKC phosphorylation sites removed is not phosphorylatedin vivo, and TRH responses mediated through the mutant are not regulated by PKC.

All members are refractory for modification by pertussis toxin, although they differ with respect to their potency for activation of PLCβ and their tissue distribution. For example, the human clone Gα16 and its murine homolog Gα15 are specifically expressed in cells of hematopoietic lineage (15Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Pertussis toxin and cholera toxin associate with certain G protein α subunits to maintain them in an inactive state or render them constitutively active, respectively (21Ui M. Moss J. Vaughn M.

Recently, a family of proteins has been identified that act as GTPase-activating proteins of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits. Isoforms of these regulators of G protein signaling (RGS proteins) show specificity toward particular G protein α subunits and exert their effects by competing with downstream effectors for activated Gα subunit binding (24Koelle M.R.

Phosphorylation by PKC has been shown to regulate signaling through Gαz and Gα12 by preventing the association of the Gα subunit with Gβγ subunits (31Fields T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Although Gαq does not appear to be phosphorylated by PKC (32Kosaza T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12562-12567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the action of PKC on other members of the Gαq family is not known. Previously, we have characterized the signaling properties of members of the Gαq family expressed in Xenopus oocytes (20Quick M.W. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Simon M.I. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32021-32027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,33Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exploiting the fact that the oocyte has an endogenous Cl− channel that is normally activated by the PLC/IP3/Ca2+ pathway and that can be used as a sensitive tool for the electrophysiological characterization of G protein activity (33Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Miledi R. Parker I. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1984; 215: 491-497Google Scholar). In the present report, we used this system to evaluate the regulation of G proteins of the Gαqfamily by PKC phosphorylation. We find that signaling mediated by Gα15 and Gα16 is functionally regulated by PKC and that this change in function is correlated with the level of phosphorylation of the Gα subunit. These results suggest an important role for PKC in the regulation of G protein signaling in hematopoietic cells.RESULTSTo examine the role of PKC in the functional regulation of signaling mediated by the Gαq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, the TRH receptor was expressed in combination with various G protein α subunits in Xenopus oocytes, and the resulting TRH-mediated signal was measured (Fig.1). The oocyte provides an excellent system for functional analysis of signals mediated by the Gαq family because it contains an endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− channel that acts as a sensitive sensor for G protein/PLC/IP3/Ca2+-mediated changes that occur following receptor stimulation. We have demonstrated previously that the ligand-induced TRH receptor couples to endogenous Gαq in oocytes (33Quick M.W. Simon M.I. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30164-30172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that co-expression of the TRH receptor with different members of the Gαq family (Gαq, Gα11, Gα14, Gα15, and Gα16) results in increases in TRH-induced Cl− currents; these results indicate functional coupling of exogenously expressed Gα subunits to the TRH receptor in oocytes (20Quick M.W.

Under control conditions, application of 100 nm TRH to oocytes expressing the TRH receptor and either Gα16 (Fig. 1 A) or Gαq (Fig. 1 B) resulted in characteristic inward Cl− currents. Following PMA treatment, oocytes expressing Gα16 showed a reduction in both the peak amplitude and the time course of these TRH-mediated Cl−currents (Fig. 1 A); oocytes expressing Gαqwere unaffected by PMA treatment (Fig. 1 B).Summary data for oocytes expressing TRH receptor and each of the PLC-activating G proteins are shown in Fig. 1, C andD. PMA significantly reduced peak TRH-mediated Cl− currents in oocytes expressing Gα16(p < 0.05) and Gα15 (p< 0.05); PMA had no effect on oocytes expressing Gαq, Gα11, and Gα14 (Fig. 1 C). In addition to examining the effect on peak responses, we also investigated the effect of PMA on the response time course. Because the magnitude of the peak response could potentially influence the time course of the response, the post-PMA peak response data from Fig.1 C were examined; only peak Cl− currents that were of comparable size were included in the time course analyses. For oocytes showing comparable peak TRH-mediated Cl− currents following PMA treatment, only oocytes expressing Gα16 or Gα15 showed PMA-mediated decreases in response time course (Fig. 1 D). These results suggest that PKC regulates the cascade induced by TRH receptor activation only in the presence of Gα16 or Gα15 subunits.To elucidate further the PKC-dependent modulation of Gα16 signaling, TRH-induced currents were measured in the presence of PMA, staurosporine, or the inactive phorbol ester 4αPDD (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 A shows data from a single oocyte recorded first during control conditions and then 20 min after injection of PMA. These results, from a separate oocyte batch, reiterate the PMA effect shown in Fig. 1; TRH-mediated Cl− currents in oocytes injected with PMA exhibit a reduction in both the peak amplitude and the time course of the response. Treatment with staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, had the opposite effect; both the peak amplitude and the response time course of TRH-mediated currents were increased (Fig. 2 B). To rule out the possibility that the reduction in Gα16-mediated signaling seen with PMA treatment was due to desensitization of the TRH receptor (because of repeated applications of TRH), a subset of Gα16-expressing oocytes was recorded first during control conditions and then 20 min following injection of water. Neither peak currents nor the time course of the response were altered in these oocytes (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Activators and inhibitors of PKC alter the magnitude and kinetics of TRH-induced Cl− currents in oocytes expressing Gα16.Oocytes were injected with 0.2 ng of TRH receptor cRNA and 0.005 ng of Gα16 cRNA 48 h prior to measurement.

The values in parentheses above the bars denote the number of oocytes recorded in each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Data summarizing the modulation of the magnitude of the peak response are shown in Fig. 2 D. PMA injection caused a 56% reduction (p < 0.01) of peak Cl− currents in oocytes expressing TRH receptors and Gα16; staurosporine caused a 39% increase (p < 0.01). Neither injection of vehicle solution nor 4αPDD altered the TRH-mediated currents, which further supports the role of PKC in mediating this effect. Concentration-response data for both staurosporine and PMA are shown in Fig. 2 E and demonstrate that the modulation by PKC activators and inhibitors is saturable.Data summarizing the modulation of the response time course are shown in Fig. 2 F. Only peak Cl− currents presented in Fig. 2 D that were of comparable size, 490 nA ± 10% (across all conditions), were included in the time course analyses. In vehicle-injected or 4αPDD-injected oocytes expressing TRH receptors and Gα16, the length of time required for the TRH-induced response to decline to one-half its peak amplitude was approximately 13 s. In PMA-injected oocytes, this decline was significantly faster (4.5 s, p < 0.01). In staurosporine-injected oocytes, the decline was slowed to 24 s (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that agents which either activate or inhibit PKC regulate ligand-induced receptor-mediated Gα16 signaling by altering both the amplitude and the time course of the receptor response.The evidence that a PKC activator could inhibit signaling through Gα16, coupled with the fact that Gα16stimulation results in activation of PKC, suggested the hypothesis that Gα16 activation could autoregulate further Gα16 signaling via PKC activation. To test this possibility, we designed experiments in which Cl− currents were measured during repeated TRH stimulation in oocytes expressing TRH receptor and Gα16. Conditions were chosen to minimize homologous desensitization of the receptor upon repeated TRH applications. The results of one such experiment are shown in Fig.3 A. First, base-line TRH-mediated peak responses were obtained for oocytes in all conditions. Next, oocytes were injected with PMA, staurosporine, or vehicle. Twenty minutes later, oocytes were repeatedly challenged with 30-s applications of TRH at 4-min intervals. Repeated TRH stimulation of oocytes expressing Gα16 resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the peak response that approached the levels obtained in oocytes treated with PMA. Oocytes treated with PMA showed the characteristic reduction in peak currents that were insensitive to further reduction following repeated TRH stimulation. Oocytes treated with staurosporine showed the characteristic increase in peak currents but failed to show a decrease in peak response following repeated TRH application. Oocytes injected with Gαq, which is insensitive to PKC regulation, did not show a decrease in peak Cl− currents during repeated TRH stimulation. The evidence that repetitive stimulation caused a reduction in the TRH-induced response (i) only in the presence of Gα16, (ii) similar to that seen with PMA treatment, and (iii) under conditions in which receptor homologous desensitization was negligible suggests the possibility that the Gα16 cascade can be feedback-regulated.Figure 3Repeated TRH-induced stimulation of Gα16-mediated Cl−currents mimics the effects of PMA. A, oocytes (five per condition) were injected with 0.2 ng of TRH receptor cRNA and either 0.5 ng of Gαq or 0.005 ng of Gα16cRNA 48 h prior to measurement. Control peak Cl−currents were recorded at time 0 following application of 100 nm TRH. The measured oocyte was then water-injected or injected with 1 μm PMA or 100 nmstaurosporine. Twenty minutes after the first measurement, the oocyte was then stimulated with a 30-s application of 100 nm TRH in 4-min intervals. Peak Cl− currents were recorded and plotted as a percentage of the initial response. B, oocytes (six per condition) were injected with 0.2 ng of TRH receptor cRNA, 1 ng of 5HT2c cRNA, and either 0.5 ng of Gαq or 0.005 ng of Gα16 cRNA 48 h prior to measurement. TRH-induced currents were measured as in A except that 30-s applications of 10 nm 5HT were substituted at the 24-, 28-, and 32-min time points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To rule out further that desensitization of the receptor was contributing to the reduction in Gα16-mediated signaling during repetitive stimulation, we performed heterologous desensitization experiments using repetitive stimulation of multiple receptors that couple to Gα16 in oocytes (20Quick M.W. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Simon M.I. Aragay A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32021-32027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed similar to those discussed in Fig.3 A using oocytes expressing Gα16 and both TRH and 5HT2c receptors. These data are shown in Fig. 3 B. Once again, base-line TRH-mediated peak responses were obtained for oocytes in all conditions. Next, oocytes were injected with PMA or vehicle. Twenty minutes later, oocytes were re-tested with TRH and then repeatedly stimulated with 30-s applications of 5HT at 4-min intervals. After three applications of 5HT, the oocytes were re-tested with TRH. Oocytes expressing Gα16 showed decreases in TRH-mediated Cl− currents following repeated 5HT stimulation that were comparable to the decreases obtained in PMA-treated oocytes. Oocytes expressing Gαq did not show stimulation-mediated decreases in Cl− currents. Thus, repeated Gα16 stimulation, even through different receptors, is capable of down-regulating the Gα16-mediated signal. These data not only reinforce the possibility of Gα16-mediated autoregulation but suggest that this signaling cascade can be regulated by any pathway that activates PKC.Assuming that all of the components of the PLC/IP3/Ca2+ pathway are the same following activation by different members of the Gαq family, the data showing that only some members are modulated by PKC suggest that the action of PKC occurs at the level of G protein activation. To support this hypothesis further, two additional experiments were performed. First, to confirm that the regulation by PKC was not occurring at the level of the IP3 receptor or at the level of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel, TRH-mediated G protein activation was bypassed by direct injection of IP3 into the oocyte. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 A shows the responses of an oocyte-expressing TRH receptor and Gα16 before and after treatment with PMA. One minute after the PMA measurement, the oocyte was injected with IP3. The PMA-induced decrease in peak response following TRH stimulation was reversed by IP3 (Fig. 4 B,p < 0.05), suggesting that components of the signaling cascade downstream of IP3 are not the site of the regulation.Figure 4Injection of IP3 rescues the PMA-induced changes to the magnitude and kinetics of TRH-induced Cl− currents in oocytes expressing Gα16. Oocytes were injected with 0.2 ng of TRH receptor cRNA and 0.005 ng of Gα16cRNA 48 h prior to measurement.

These results are shown in Fig.5 A. Activation with TRH resulted in a greater than 20-fold increase in GTPase activity in oocytes expressing either Gα16 or Gαq over no-agonist control conditions. There was an approximately 4-fold increase in TRH-mediated GTPase activity in oocytes expressing the TRH receptor alone (data not shown), suggesting that the majority of the GTPase activity in the oocytes expressing either Gα16 or Gαq was due to overexpression of these G proteins. Pretreatment with PMA caused a reduction in GTPase activity in Gα16-expressing oocytes (p < 0.05) but not in Gαq-expressing oocytes. These results suggest that the action of PMA occurs at a step in the cascade that can affect GTP hydrolysis, either at the level of the G protein or at the level of G protein/receptor coupling.Figure 5PMA reduces TRH-induced GTPase activity in oocytes expressing Gα16. A, oocytes (five per condition) were injected with 0.2 ng of TRH receptor cRNA and either 0.005 ng of Gα16 cRNA or 0.5 ng of Gαq cRNA 48 h prior to assay of GTPase activity. Agonist-induced GTPase activity was determined by incubating cell lysates with 100 nm TRH with (filled bars) or without (open bars) a 10-min pretreatment with 1 μm PMA. No agonist control conditions (hatched bars) are shown for comparison. Low K m GTPase activities in each condition were determined by subtracting highK m activity (in the presence of 50 mmunlabeled GTP) from the total GTPase activity.

It has been suggested that the novel fungal metabolite adenophostin-A may be able to stimulate Ca2+ entry without stimulating Ca2+ release from stores. To test this idea further, we compared Ca2+release, SOCE, and the stimulation of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in Xenopus oocytes in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and adenophostin-A injection. IP3 stimulated an outward Cl−current, I Cl1-S, in response to Ca2+ release from stores followed by an inward current,I Cl2, in response to SOCE. In contrast, low concentrations of adenophostins (AdAs) activatedI Cl2 without activatingI Cl1-S, consistent with the suggestion that AdA can activate Ca2+ entry without stimulating Ca2+ release. However, when Ca2+ entry has been stimulated by AdA, Ca2+ stores are largely depleted of Ca2+, as assessed by the inability of ionomycin to release additional Ca2+. The Ca2+ release stimulated by AdA, however, was 7 times slower than the release stimulated by IP3, which could explain the minimal activation ofI Cl1-S; when Ca2+ is released slowly, the threshold level required for I Cl1-Sactivation is not attained.

Ca2+ signals regulate many cellular processes including cell growth, fertilization, gene transcription, and apoptosis (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels are produced both by Ca2+ released from internal stores and Ca2+influxed from the extracellular space. A major pathway for Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores is through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) 1The abbreviations IP3Rinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorsSOCstore-operated Ca2+ channelsSOCEstore-operated Ca2+ entryAdAadenophostins after stimulation of G-protein- or tyrosine kinase-coupled plasma membrane receptors linked to phospholipase C (2Clapham D.

The decrease in the Ca2+ content of the internal store then stimulates Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) by a process called store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) (5Barish M.E.

The mechanism by which a reduction in the content of store Ca2+ results in opening of SOCs remains unknown, but there are two major hypotheses. The conformational coupling hypothesis suggests that there is direct physical contact between IP3Rs and SOCs such that conformational changes in the IP3R occurring upon Ca2+ depletion of the internal store can affect the opening of SOCs (7Irvine R.F.

The diffusible messenger hypothesis suggests that the Ca2+ store (endoplasmic reticulum) produces a diffusible messenger that opens SOCs (9Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that in Xenopus oocytes, low concentrations of AdA stimulate Ca2+-activated Cl− currents that are activated by Ca2+ influx more than Cl−currents that are activated by Ca2+ released from stores. Based on these observations, DeLisle et al. (17DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggested that AdA may be capable of activating store-operated Ca2+entry without first stimulating Ca2+ release from stores. This is significant because it suggests that AdA may share structural features with the putative diffusible Ca2+ entry signal released by Ca2+-depleted endoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+-activated Cl− currents have been used for many years as real time indicators of sub-plasmalemmal Ca2+in Xenopus oocytes (18Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev.

Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but clearly Cl−currents are only indirect indicators of Ca2+concentration. Consequently, conclusions about cytosolic Ca2+ concentration derived from these measurements are subject to different interpretations. We have recently found that there are two Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in the oocyte that are selectively activated by Ca2+ released from stores and by Ca2+ influx (24Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Ca2+release-activated Cl− current (I Cl1-S) has an outwardly rectifying steady-state current-voltage relationship, whereas the Ca2+influx-activated Cl− current (I Cl2) has an inwardly rectifying steady-state current-voltage relationship (24Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This means that Ca2+-activated Cl−currents measured at constant negative membrane potentials, as was done in the experiments of DeLisle et al. (17DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), are relatively insensitive indicators of Ca2+ released from stores. In our experiments (16Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we measured I Cl1-S as an outward current at positive membrane potentials andI Cl2 as an inward current at negative membrane potentials to more clearly differentiate between Ca2+influx and Ca2+ release and to increase the sensitivity of detection of Ca2+ release. Using this protocol, IP3 activated both I Cl1-S(“Ca2+ release”) and I Cl2(“Ca2+ influx”), but low concentrations of AdA often activated only a tiny amount of I Cl1-S, even though I Cl2 was robustly activated. But, because we could not find a concentration of AdA which could activateI Cl2 without activating some small amount ofI Cl1-S, we concluded that AdA did not activate SOCE independently of Ca2+ release from stores. We hypothesized that AdA activated relatively littleI Cl1-S either because AdA released Ca2+ from stores very slowly or that AdA released Ca2+ from a subpopulation of stores which was tightly coupled to SOCs. The purpose of this paper was to examine further the mechanisms of AdA regulation of Ca2+-activated Cl− currents using confocal scanning microscopy of oocytes loaded with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators and two-microelectrode voltage clamp. Here we show that activation of SOCE following injection of low concentrations of AdA depends upon depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores. However, at low AdA concentrations the kinetics of Ca2+ release from stores was >7-fold slower than that observed with IP3. This slower mode of Ca2+ release is apparently not effective in activatingI Cl1-S. Therefore, different kinetics of Ca2+ release can differentially affect Cl−current activation. Stage V-VI oocytes were harvested from adult albino or normal Xenopus laevis females (Xenopus I) as described by Dascal (18Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 317-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Xenopuswere anesthetized by immersion in Tricaine (1.5 g/liter). Ovarian follicles were removed and digested in normal Ringer with no added calcium, containing 2 mg/ml collagenase type IA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), for 2 h at room temperature. The oocytes were extensively rinsed with normal Ringer, placed in L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and stored at 18 °C. Oocytes were usually used within 1–5 days after isolation. Xenopusoocytes were injected with 9 nl Ca-green-1 coupled to 70kd dextran (333 μm) for a final calculated oocyte concentration of ∼3 μm, and voltage-clamped with two-microelectrodes using a GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 1–4MΩ. Oocyte resting potentials were between −20 mV and −50 mV. Typically, the membrane was held at 0 mV and stepped to +40 mV for 1.5 s every 15 s to monitor I Cl1-S. Every 2.25 min, a 1.5-s duration pulse to −140 mV followed by a 1.5-s duration pulse to +40 mV was given to monitor I Cl2 andI Cl1-T, respectively. Images (256 × 256 pixels) were acquired 500 ms after the onset of each voltage pulse using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal box fitted to a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope using a Zeiss 10× objective (0.5 numerical aperature). The confocal aperture was set at the maximal opening, resulting in a focal section 1267 × 1267 × 35 μm. Image data was analyzed using the LSM 410 software or NIH image 1.60 on a Mac IIfx. Current data was analyzed on a Pentium PC using Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). For plots of Ca2+fluorescence, the fluorescence intensity of the entire confocal section was averaged and expressed as a ratio of the background fluorescence taken before IP3 injection. Experiments were performed at room temperature (22–26 °C). Normal Ringer solution contained 123 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; Ca2+-free Ringer solution was the same except that CaCl2 was omitted and, MgCl2 was increased to 5 mm. Oocytes were injected with IP3 using a Nanoject automatic oocyte injector (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA). The injection pipette was pulled from glass capillary tubing in a manner similar to the recording electrodes and then broken so that it had a beveled tip with an inside diameter <20 μm. Solutions of IP3 or AdA were prepared in Chelex resin-treated H2O. The Ca2+ concentration in this solution was not buffered, but injection of H2O produced no change in Ca-green fluorescence or membrane current. Levels of the IP3R were lowered by injection of 60 ng of the IP3R antisense primer (AACTAGACATCTTGTCTGACATTGCTGCAG) one day before the experiment as described by Kume et al. (25Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The reverse sense primer (CTGCAGCAATGTCAGACAAGATGTCTAGTT) was injected at the same level as a control. The protocol used to measure Ca2+-activated Cl− currents inXenopus oocytes in response to IP3 or AdA injection while simultaneously measuring cytosolic Ca2+with confocal microscopy and Ca-green dextran is shown in Fig.1. About 30 min after injection of Ca-green dextran, the oocytes were voltage-clamped at 0 mV and stepped to +40 mV every 15 s to monitor I Cl1-S.I Cl1-S (current at the end of the +40 mV pulse, Fig. 1 b) is an outward current at depolarizing potentials that is activated quickly (∼10 s) after IP3 injection by Ca2+ released from intracellular stores (16Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1286-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, once every 2.25 min, the oocyte was also stepped to −140 mV to monitor I Cl2 and then to +40 mV to monitorI Cl1-T. I Cl2 (current at the end of the −140 mV pulse, Fig. 1 c) is an inward current that is activated by Ca2+ entry through SOCs driven by the negative membrane potential. I Cl1-T is a transient outward current (peak outward current during the +40 mV pulse, Fig. 1 c) that was activated by a depolarizing pulse preceded by a hyperpolarizing pulse to stimulate Ca2+influx. The −140 mV pulse was given only once every 2.25 min to minimize Ca2+ influx (and store refilling) during the experiment. For a more detailed discussion of the Cl−currents see Hartzell and co-workers (24Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C161-C175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1, a–c, shows the response of Cl−currents after injection of large amounts of IP3 (estimated intra-oocyte concentration ∼20 μm). When saturating levels of IP3 were injected, I Cl1-S(filled squares) was activated immediately. As the stores became depleted of Ca2+ and SOCE developed,I Cl1-T (open triangles) andI Cl2 (open circles) were activated. Injection of IP3 caused a large increase in Ca2+ fluorescence at all potentials (Fig. 1 d) because of Ca2+ release from stores. Before the peak fluorescence was reached, the fluorescence was the same at all potentials, but afterward the fluorescence during the −140 mV pulse became greater than the fluorescence during the +40 mV pulse. The difference between the fluorescence at −140 mV and +40 mV is the voltage-dependent Ca2+ fluorescence, which we have shown is related to Ca2+ entry through SOCs (28Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of large amounts of AdA (estimated intra-oocyte concentration ∼2 μm; note that AdA is 10–100 times more potent than IP3 (13Hirota J. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Okura I. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) produced rather similar effects on the Cl− currents to those produced by IP3(Fig. 2, a–c). There was a striking difference, however, in the kinetics of the Ca2+fluorescence change produced by IP3 and by AdA. The Ca2+ fluorescence did not begin to increase for several min and peaked ∼8 min after injection of AdA (Fig. 2 d). By comparison, after IP3 injection, the Ca2+fluorescence peaked in less than 2 min (Fig. 1 d). It may seem surprising in Fig. 2 that the Ca2+ wave peaked so much more slowly than I Cl1-S. It should be noted that the 1-mm diameter oocyte is on the stage of an inverted microscope and that the injection takes place at the top, whereas the confocal image plane is <30 μm from the bottom. Cl−currents, which are measured from the entire surface of the oocyte, increase as soon as Ca2+ is released from stores near the injection site. However, the slow increase in Ca2+fluorescence partly reflects the very slow transit time of the Ca2+ wave from the injection site to the confocal image plane ∼1 mm away. There is some variability in the lag period between AdA injection and the increase in Ca2+ fluorescence. This variability is most likely related to the depth and position of the injection pipette in the oocyte. The Ca2+ waves induced by injection of smaller amounts of AdA moved even more slowly. In Fig.3 a, typical traces of Ca2+ fluorescence at +40 mV in response to injection of large amounts of IP3 (∼20 μm, filled squares), large amounts of AdA (∼2 μm, open circles), and small amounts of AdA (∼5 nm,open triangles) are superimposed. In the case of low concentrations of adenophostin, the time-to-peak of the Ca2+ fluorescence was ∼20 min. Fig. 3 b shows averages of the time-to-peak of the Ca2+ fluorescence to these injections. The time-to-peak for large concentrations of AdA was >2 times slower than for large concentrations of IP3, and the time-to-peak for small concentrations of AdA was >7 times slower than for large concentrations of IP3. It was not possible to measure the time-to-peak for small IP3 concentrations because small IP3 concentrations produced oscillating Ca2+ waves that exhibited no clear peak. The slowness of the Ca2+ wave is illustrated in a different way in the images in Fig. 3 c. After injection of AdA, the spread of the Ca2+ fluorescence is very slow relative to the spread of the IP3-induced wave of Ca2+ release. These data confirm our earlier suggestion that AdA causes release of Ca2+ from stores much more slowly than IP3does. These findings support the idea that small concentrations of AdA do not stimulate I Cl1-S because slow release of Ca2+ from stores does not elevate Ca2+ in the vicinity of the Cl− channels to an activating level. This could occur if efflux and/or local Ca2+ buffering removes free Ca2+ as rapidly as it is released, so that an effective Ca2+ concentration is not attained. Although Fig. 3 shows that low concentrations of AdA release Ca2+ from stores, the question remains whether the stimulation of Ca2+ entry by low concentrations of AdA is because of depletion of stores. For example, the AdA-stimulated Ca2+ release might be so slow that the stores refill. To examine this question, we measured the effects of low concentrations of AdA (∼5 nm) that did not activateI Cl1-S on Ca2+ store depletion. Fig.4 shows the results of a typical experiment. Injection of 10 nl of 0.5 μm AdA did not detectably stimulate I Cl1-S (Fig. 4,a–c), but both I Cl1-T andI Cl2 developed robustly.I Cl1-T and I Cl2 were dependent on extracellular Ca2+, and their activation corresponded to the activation of SOCE (16Hartzell H.C. Machaca K. Hirayama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ca2+fluorescence began to increase about 5 min after AdA injection and continued to increase for 20 min (Fig. 4 d). Voltage-dependent Ca2+ fluorescence (open circles), which reflects SOCE, developed shortly after Ca2+ release and remained at a high level for the duration of the experiment. To test whether stores were depleted of Ca2+, ionomycin in Ca2+-free Ringer was applied to release Ca2+ from any remaining stores. Ionomycin had only a very small effect on I Cl1-S and had no effect on the Ca2+ fluorescence at +40 mV. This showed that the stores had been virtually completely depleted of Ca2+by AdA. This result contrasts to that observed when small amounts of IP3 were injected (Fig. 5). Concentrations of IP3 that stimulated Ca2+influx, as determined by the presence of voltage-dependent Ca2+ fluorescence and activation ofI Cl1-T and I Cl2, inevitably stimulated I Cl1-S. In some cells, as in Fig. 5, the increase in I Cl1-S was not accompanied by a significant increase in Ca2+ fluorescence, because the IP3 effect was local and did not propagate into the region of the oocyte that was imaged. Both voltage-dependent Ca2+ fluorescence andI Cl1-T and I Cl2eventually declined to base line. Application of ionomycin at the end of the experiment evoked a large increase in Ca2+fluorescence and in I Cl1-S, showing that the stores were not completely depleted of Ca2+. To obtain a more quantitative measure of the extent of store depletion after injection of IP3 or AdA, we calculated the ratio of ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release to IP3- or AdA-induced Ca2+ release. This ratio gives a measure of the level of residual Ca2+ in intracellular stores after IP3R agonist injection. The results from these experiments are shown in Fig. 6. Injections of high IP3, high AdA, or low AdA all left the stores largely depleted of Ca2+. In contrast, low IP3concentrations were less effective in depleting the stores. These data show that concentrations of AdA that did not noticeably activateI Cl1-S were capable of depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores to similar levels as high concentrations of IP3. Thus, we conclude that AdA stimulates SOCE as a consequence of depletion of internal Ca2+ stores and not by some direct effect on SOCs. Furthermore, previous conclusions, based on Ca2+-activated Cl− current activation, which suggested that low concentrations of AdA stimulate SOCE without releasing Ca2+ from stores (17DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), can be explained by the observation that slow release of Ca2+ from stores is often insufficient to activate I Cl1-S. If this conclusion is correct, the effects of AdA on SOCE should depend on the ability of the IP3R to release Ca2+. Thus, treatments that suppress IP3R function should inhibit the effects of AdA injections. We suppressed IP3R function either by injecting the competitive inhibitor heparin (Fig.7) or by reducing IP3R expression by injection of antisense oligonucleotides to theXenopus IP3R (Fig.8).Figure 8Lowering IP3R levels blocks AdA and IP3 induced SOCE. Oocytes were injected with 60 ng of sense (a and c) or antisense (b and d) IP3R oligonucleotides (25Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and incubated for 1–2 days. Oocytes were injected with 10 nl of 0.5 μm AdA (a and b) or with 23 nl of 10 μm IP3 (c and d) as indicated by the arrow in each panel.Filled squares, I Cl1-S; open circles, I Cl2; and open triangles, I Cl1-T. n = 6–7 oocytes/panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Injection of heparin to block the IP3R significantly reduced I Cl2 and I Cl1-Tcurrents induced by small AdA injections (Fig. 7, a–b). In a similar fashion, heparin blocked the Cl− current response induced by IP3 (Fig. 7, c–d). Reducing IP3R levels by antisense oligonucleotides as described previously by others (25Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 29Kobrinsky E. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) also reduced the effects of IP3 and AdA treatments on I Cl1-T andI Cl2 (Fig. 8). The effects of antisense treatment were less pronounced than the effects of heparin, but it was clear that antisense had a significant effect. Note that although antisense treatment inhibited I Cl2 andI Cl1-T in response to IP3 injection, there was no decrease in levels of I Cl1-S (Fig.8 d). Actually, I Cl1-S was slightly potentiated as compared with sense-injected cells (Fig. 8 c). This observation could be explained if one assumes there are two distinct subpopulations of IP3 receptors with differential turnover rates of the IP3R. If we postulate the existence of subsets of stores, one close to the I Cl1-SCl− channels containing IP3Rs with a very slow turnover rate and a second located further from the Cl−channels containing an IP3R population that turns over rapidly, then injection of antisense IP3 oligonucleotides will reduce the levels of IP3Rs in the latter subset faster, resulting in sufficient Ca2+ release after IP3 injection to activate I Cl1-S but insufficient release from most of the stores to induce significant SOCE. In many cell types, release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores stimulates Ca2+ influx into the cytosol from the extracellular space through SOCs by a process termed SOCE. The mechanisms by which release of Ca2+ from stores stimulates SOCE is unknown, but one hypothesis states that the endoplasmic reticulum releases a diffusible chemical messenger that opens SOCs. The search for such a calcium influx factor has so far not been very fruitful, and the putative calcium influx factors that have been discovered have not found universal acceptance (9Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 10Gilon P. St J. Bird G. Bian X. Yakel J.L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8050-8055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When it was suggested that AdA could stimulate Ca2+ influx without stimulating Ca2+ release from stores (17DeLisle S. Marksberry E.W. Bonnett C. Jenkins D.J. Potter B.V.L. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9956-9961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), some hope was raised that clues to the structure of calcium influx factors would be learned from AdA. The suggestion that AdA could stimulate Ca2+ entry without depleting Ca2+ from stores was based on the observation that low concentrations of AdA did not stimulate Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and therefore did not release Ca2+ from stores but did stimulate Ca2+-activated Cl− currents in the presence of Ca2+ influx. The present studies using Ca2+imaging demonstrate, however, that even very low amounts of AdA (calculated oocyte concentration ∼5 nm) released Ca2+ from stores. Under these conditions, even thoughI Cl1-S was not activated, the stores were completely depleted of Ca2+ as demonstrated by the inability of ionomycin to increase Ca2+ fluorescence. We believe that the Ca2+ released from stores by low concentrations of AdA is unable to activateI Cl1-S because of its significantly slower rate of Ca2+ release (∼7 times slower than IP3). How do the kinetics of Ca2+ release from stores determine the response of the Cl− channels? It has been suggested that I Cl1-S responds to the rate-of-change of cytosolic Ca2+ (20Parker I. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) because the peak activation ofI Cl1-S corresponds to the maximum rate of change of cytosolic Ca2+ and because the amplitude ofI Cl1-S does not correlate with the steady-state levels of cytosolic Ca2+. However, we have shown (27Kuruma A. Hartzell H.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C161-C175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the turn-off of I Cl1-S is not explained by inactivation of the current as previously suggested (20Parker I. Yao Y. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that the Ca2+ concentration measured by cytosolic Ca2+ dyes (such as Ca2+-green dextran) does not reflect the concentration of Ca2+ just below the plasma membrane (measured by lipophilic Ca2+ dyes such as Ca-green C18) (28Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We have presented evidence that the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration changes much more quickly than does the Ca2+ concentration deeper in the cytosol because plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux systems can rapidly clear Ca2+ from the subplasmalemmal space. Consequently, we would predict that the subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentration would depend on the relative rates of Ca2+ release from stores and cytosolic Ca2+buffering and Ca2+ efflux from the oocyte. If Ca2+ release is slow, the concentration of Ca2+in the subplasmalemmal space may not rise sufficiently to activate Ca2+-activated Cl− channels. The different kinetics of Ca2+ release produced by AdA and IP3 are probably related to differences between AdA and IP3 activation of IP3Rs. First, the apparent diffusion coefficient of AdA or IP3 in the cytosol will depend on the fraction of molecules (κ) that are bound to the IP3R at any one time (D obs =D/κ). Because AdA has a 100-fold higher affinity for the IP3R than IP3 does, AdA diffusion will be slower because a larger fraction of the total AdA (compared with IP3) will be bound to IP3Rs. Second, AdA exhibits a higher cooperativity in activating IP3Rs than IP3 does. Hirota et al. 1995 (13Hirota J. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Okura I. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have shown that IP3 has a Hill coefficient of 1.8 for Ca2+release by the type 1 IP3R, whereas the Hill coefficient for AdA was 3.9. This implies that at least 2 molecules of IP3 and 4 molecules of AdA are needed to open an IP3R. This factor will also contribute to the slow movement of the Ca2+ release wave in response to small amounts of AdA. Accordingly, the elementary Ca2+ release events (“Ca2+ puffs”) induced by AdA have been shown by Marchant and Parker (30Marchant J.S. Parker I. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to be smaller and faster than those induced by IP3. Because Ca2+ waves are initiated by the summation of Ca2+ puffs, the smaller and faster puffs induced by AdA may contribute to the slower propagation of the AdA wave. However, the mechanisms by which AdA releases Ca2+from stores remains to be fully elucidated. Although low concentrations of AdA evoke a slow release of Ca2+ from stores and little or noI Cl1-S, high concentrations release Ca2+ only about 2-fold more slowly than IP3 and also evoke significant I Cl1-S. This finding that AdA activates different I Cl1-S responses depending upon the kinetics of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is interesting because it provides another example of how the temporal features of a Ca2+ signal contribute to its physiological consequences. Different receptors can induce different Ca2+ release kinetics depending on factors including spatial localization of the receptor and/or IP3-sensitive stores or the activation of different PLC isoforms (31Thorn P.

Expression activating elements in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) 1The abbreviations IgimmunoglobulinMARmatrix attachment regionsPCRpolymerase chain reactionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay locus (Fig. 1) have been identified and characterized in diverse ways. An enhancer lying in the VDJ-Cμ intron was originally detected by its capacity to stimulate transcription from linked reporter genes that were transfected into myeloma cell lines (1Banerji J. Olson L. Schaffner W. Cell. 1983; 33: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 2Gillies S.D. Morrison S.L. Oi V.T. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1983; 33: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Experiments using transgenic cell lines from which this enhancer could be deleted after transcription had been initiated indicated that the enhancer was required to maintain high level expression (3Grosschedl R. Marx M. Cell. 1988; 55: 645-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Porton B. Zaller D.M. Lieberson R. Eckhardt L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancer-bearing segment can be divided into two subregions on the basis of sequence motifs and protein-binding characteristics. Thus, multiple transcription factors that bind to characteristic motifs define a central core (Eμ) region; this region is flanked by matrix attachment regions (MARs) identified by their affinity for the nuclear matrix (reviewed in Refs. 5Ernst P. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 427-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and 6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both elements, Eμ and the MARs, are required for high level expression of IgH-derived transgenes in mice, albeit not in stably transfected cell lines (7Forrester W.C. van-Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The switch (S) regions were first recognized as repetitive DNA segments that lie 5′ of the exons encoding heavy chain constant regions and which are the sites of most of the breakage and rejoining events underlying the heavy chain isotype switch. These switch regions also harbor elements that stimulate expression of IgH-derived reporter genes in transgenic mice, but again this activity has not been detected in assays of stably transfected cell lines (8Gram H. Zenke G. Geisse S. Kleuser B. Burki K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 9Sigurdardottir D. Sohn J. Kass J. Selsing E. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2217-2225PubMed Google Scholar). That all three types of elements are required for high level expression in transgenic mice indicates that each element performs a different and necessary function in transcription. Evidence of the Eμ-MAR collaboration can also be seen in assays of chromatin accessibility (10Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Fernandez-Herrero L.A. Laible G. Dull M. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1997; 385: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and DNA demethylation (11Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat.

Thus, while the intronic MARs and Eμ core enhancer are not needed to maintain expression of the endogenous IgH locus in some B-cell lines (12Wabl M.R. Burrows P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2452-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Zaller D.M. Eckhardt L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Radbruch A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2473-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this difference is generally ascribed to the presence of other, functionally redundant, activating elements present in the IgH locus but absent from the transgenes, viz. the MARs that are located 5′ of the Cγ exons (16Cockerill P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and enhancers that are located 3′ of the Cα exons (reviewed in Ref. 17Saleque S. Singh M. Little R.D. Giannini S.L. Michaelson J.S. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4780-4787PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the capacity of the intronic elements to contribute to IgH expression can be observed under conditions that ablate this redundancy. Thus, targeted replacement of one of these 3′ Eα enhancers by the neo gene extinguishes IgH expression specifically in those myeloma cells that lack the intronic activating elements (18Lieberson R. Ong J. Shi X. Eckhardt L.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6229-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have previously described a related method of ablating redundancy in which introduction of the gpt cassette 3′ of the endogenous μ heavy chain gene of hybridoma cells apparently insulates the transcription unit from other activating elements and renders μ expression dependent on the intronic activating elements (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). That is, in this configuration, deletion of the 5′-MAR-Eμ-3′-MAR segment depresses μ expression to ∼2% the normal level (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which the gpt cassette renders the μ gene expression dependent on the intronic elements is unknown, this approach offers the possibility of examining how these elements function in a reproducible and nearly normal context. Thus, using this system we showed that recombinants that retain a substantial segment of the MARs maintain μ expression at a high (∼60% normal) level. In the context of models in which μ expression requires both MAR and Eμ functions, this result implies that other enhancers in the recombinant IgH locus can act on the μ gene, but that other MARs in the locus cannot. We have now tested this interpretation by examining the properties of the reciprocal recombinant that retained Eμ but lacked the MARs. As reported here, we have found unexpectedly that this recombinant also continued to express the μ gene at a high (∼50% the normal) level, a result that implies that other MARs in the recombinant IgH locus, but not other enhancers, can act on the μ gene. These observations then pose the paradox that high level μ expression in the recombinant hybridoma cells requires a MAR or an enhancer, even though the recombinant IgH locus can supply both of these functions. We present two models that might account for this puzzling combination of observations. We have previously described the Eμ+MAR+ recombinants (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig.1 illustrates the construction of the three targeting vectors, p0, pEμ, and pMM, used to generate the Eμ−MAR−, Eμ+MAR−, and Eμ−MAR+ recombinants, respectively. The targeting vectors are composed from seven DNA segments (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, theNcoI-NaeI segment A included the VDJ3 nucleotides of GenBankTM/EMBL accession number X56936. Segment B was specific for each recombinant, such that p0 lacked the entire 5′-MAR-Eμ-3′-MAR segment, while pEμ and pMM included the Eμ and 5′-MAR-3′-MAR segments, respectively, as illustrated in Fig.1 C. Segments D (bounded by restriction sitesSnaI-SphI) and F (bounded by restriction sitesBglII-NdeI) are included in entries MUSIGCD07-09. Segment C was derived from the multicloning site of two vectors and has the sequence: GCGGCCGCCTGCAGGTCGACCATATGGGAGAGCTCGGTACCCtaccagg, where the lowercase letters denote the sequence beginning in the 3′-half of the site denoted Sna1 (b) (Fig. 1 A). Segment E (bounded by restriction sites SphI-BamHI) was derived from pSV2gpt (19Mulligen R.C. Berg P. Science. 1980; 209: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Segment G corresponds to pGEM5 (Promega Biotech). The notation B/B indicates that segments E and F were joined by ligating the BamHI-generated end of E with the BglII-generated end of F. Segments A and C–G were obtained from the transfer vector “D” (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by digesting with NotI and either NaeI or its isoschizomer NgoMI and purified by gel electrophoresis. The insert segments denoted B were constructed by PCR using the primers defined below in which restriction sites were fused to sequences that would pair with specific regions of the intronic DNA. Thus, the Eμ insert was generated from plasmid pRSp6 (20Ochi A. Hawley R.G. Hawley T. Shulman M.J. Traunecker A. Kohler G. Hozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6351-6355Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers 5 and 6. Primers 7 and 8 were used to amplify the MARs-containing insert from plasmid pμΔ4, kindly provided by R. Grosschedl (7Forrester W.C. van-Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). TheNotI and NaeI/NgoMI sites in the primers are italicized. Previous publications have described the wild-type Sp6 (21Baumann B. Potash M.J. Kohler G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and mutant igm692 (22Baar J.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, targeted recombinants were identified by screening either for the correct 5′ junction using primers 1 and 2 (see below) or by testing culture fluid for the presence of normal IgM using a Cμ1-specific ELISA. Transfectants satisfying these criteria were further tested for both correct junctions using primers 3 and 4 (see below). To ensure that the recombinants had not acquired additional vector DNA, genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and analyzed by Southern blot probing with the Cμ1–2 (XbaI-BamHI) and Cμ3–4 (HindIII-HindIII) fragments. In most cases only the predicted bands were seen, and only recombinants with the correct structure were analyzed for μ mRNA production. DNA structure was analyzed by Southern blot and other methods, as described (24Oancea A.E. Shulman M.J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR amplifications were as follows. Primer 1, 5′-ACATGGATGTCCACAGCCTGAAAACA-3′ (5′ of VH homology region); primer 2, 5′-GGGTACCGAGCTCTCCCATATGGT-3′ (in multicloning site); primer 3, 5′-CGATACGGTGATTGGCTACCG-3′ (ingpt gene); primer 4, 5′-GTGGCAAGAGGCTAATCTTGTCATGT-3′ (3′ of homology region); primer 5, 5′-CGTCCTGCCGGCAATGTTGAGTTGGAGTCAAGAT-3′; primer 6, 5′-GCTGCAGCGGCCGCTCTCCAGTTTCGGCTGAATCCT-3′; primer 7, 5′-TGAGGGAGCCGGCTGAGAGAAGT-3′; primer 8, 5′-GCTGCAGCGGCCGCCGAAATAAGTCTAGATAAT-3′. RNA was analyzed by Northern blot, as described (24Oancea A.E. Shulman M.J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We have previously described a gene-targeting system to remove various intronic elements from the active IgH locus of a mouse hybridoma cell line, Sp6, which produces IgM(κ) specific for the hapten, trinitrophenyl (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Oancea A.E. Shulman M.J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This system makes use of a mutant hybridoma, igm692, which encodes a truncated immunoglobulin μ heavy chain lacking the Cμ1 and Cμ2 domains (Fig. 1). The targeting vector bears the bacterially derived gpt gene for guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, which allows cells to convert exogenous xanthine to XMP and to grow in medium containing xanthine and mycophenolic acid (MHX medium) (19Mulligen R.C. Berg P. Science. 1980; 209: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination between the targeting vector and the endogenous μ gene can restore the missing exons and render the recombinants gpt +, so that they can then be selected in MHX medium. This feature makes it possible to use an ELISA specific for the Cμ1 domain to detect targeted recombinants, if the recombinants express the μ gene at >0.1% the normal level. We have shown that recombinants bearing an intact 5′-MAR-Eμ-3′-MAR segment express the μ gene at the same level as the parental hybridoma (24Oancea A.E. Shulman M.J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As noted above, Forrester et al. (7Forrester W.C. van-Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) reported that high level μ expression in transgenic mice requires both Eμ and MARs. Consistent with their findings, our analysis of nested deletions that removed various segments of the JH-Cμ intron from the endogenous locus indicated that μ expression depends strongly on some component in the MAR-Eμ-MAR segment and that the level of μ expression was closely related to the extent of remaining MAR DNA (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of relating analyses of transgene and endogenous gene expression, we have followed their definition of these elements very closely. Accordingly we have constructed the pEμ, pMM, and p0 targeting vectors to generate the Eμ+MAR−, Eμ−MAR+, and Eμ−MAR− recombinants, respectively, such that these recombinants bear very nearly the same DNA segments that were used in the transgene expression study. Thus, the Eμ+MAR+, Eμ+MAR−, Eμ−MAR+ recombinants bear the complete 5′-MAR-Eμ-3′-MAR segment, the Eμ segment, and the 5′-MAR-3′-MAR segment, respectively (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that the deletion of the switch region does not alter the level of μ expression (25Oancea A.E. Tsui F.W.L. Shulman M.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5678-5683PubMed Google Scholar). To generate the recombinants we transfected linearized vector DNA into the igm692 recipient cells and plated these cells at limiting dilution in MHX medium (Table I). The initial MHXR recombinants which we generated with the p0 and pEμ vectors were identified by PCR amplification of the 5′-junction fragment (Fig. 1). These recombinants produced detectable levels (>0.1%) of normal IgM, as measured using a Cμ-specific ELISA, suggesting that these two screening methods might be used interchangeably. For this reason, most subsequent recombinants were identified by first testing culture fluid with the Cμ1-specific ELISA and then testing positive colonies for proper junctions by PCR. The recombinants were then subcloned at 0.1 cell/well. To assure that only a single copy of the vector had inserted into the recombinant loci, we analyzed the μ-gpt DNA by Southern blots of genomic DNA (results not shown). Multiple independent recombinants that yielded only the predicted bands were then studied further.Table IGeneration of targeted recombinantsVectorDNAMHXR/surviving input cell5′-PCR+/MHXRCμ1+/MHXRTargeted/5′-PCR+or Cμ1+Targeted/surviving input cellμgpMM300/8 × 106<1 × 10−74012/3.6 × 1065 /124 /51 × 10−6Eμ8035/1.1 × 1069 /350 /8<1 × 10−6120309/4.9 × 1062 /3091 /22 × 10−72502880/3 × 10721 /28807 /144 × 10−7p050244/1.2 × 1077 /206 /76 × 10−6Vector DNA (defined in Fig. 1) was linearized and transferred to igm692 cells by electroporation. The cells were then plated at limiting dilution (103–105 cells/well). Two days after transfection, MHX medium was added to the wells, and 10 days thereafter, the wells were scored for growth (MHXRtransformants). These colonies were tested either for the presence of the correct recombinant 5′-junction or for production of full-length μ chain using a Cμl-specific ELISA. Transfectants satisfying these criteria were further tested for proper targeting using a PCR assay for the expected 3′-junction and Southern blotting. From these measurements we calculated the frequency of properly targeted recombinants among the cells that survived electroporation.

Transfectants satisfying these criteria were further tested for proper targeting using a PCR assay for the expected 3′-junction and Southern blotting. From these measurements we calculated the frequency of properly targeted recombinants among the cells that survived electroporation. In principle, the structure of the intron in the targeted IgH locus could affect expression of the linked gpt gene. However, an effect that prevented growth in MHX medium would have been evident as a marked decrease in the frequency of targeted MHX-resistant transfectants. As shown in Table I, we recovered all recombinants at frequencies ranging from 2 × 10−7 to 5 × 10−6. We interpret this relatively consistent recovery frequency to mean that the selected phenotype was typical of the recombinant structure, i.e. the selected phenotype did not require a (rare) mutation in addition to recombination. To assess the importance of individual intronic elements in μ expression, we measured the level of μ mRNA in recombinants of each structure, as well as the level of actin mRNA, which is expected not to be affected by the intronic deletions. As a negative control for specificity we included RNA from the Sp6-derived mutant X10, which has a deletion of the entire μ gene (denoted Δμ) (23Connor A. Collins C. Jiang L. McMaster M. Shulman M.J. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Representative results for particular recombinants are shown in Fig.2. For each lane the indicated ratio of μ to actin mRNA levels was calculated and then expressed as the percent of the value obtained for one of the Eμ+MAR+ recombinants, Eμ+MAR+-R1; this percentage is listed below each lane of the blot. We have examined at least four independent recombinants of each deletion type in this same way. Also RNA was prepared and analyzed multiple times from most individual recombinants (blots not shown). From these data we calculated the level of μ production compared with the Eμ+MAR+ recombinant, and TableII lists the mean (± S.E.) obtained from these measurements of multiple independent recombinants. As reported previously (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Oancea A.E. Shulman M.J. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the Eμ+MAR+ recombinants produced approximately the same level of μ mRNA as the Sp6 parental hybridoma, while the Eμ−MAR−recombinants produced only ∼6% of the normal level of μ mRNA. The Eμ−MAR+ recombinant, which bears both 5′- and 3′-MARs produced ∼60% of the normal level of μ mRNA, thus comparable to what we found previously for a recombinant bearing only the 3′-MAR (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Eμ+MAR− recombinant produced a similarly high level of μ mRNA (∼50% normal). Our previous analysis of the Eμ−MAR− recombinants by nuclear run-on assays showed that their decreased μ mRNA content reflects decreased transcription (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The relatively high μ mRNA content of the Eμ+MAR− and Eμ−MAR+ recombinants therefore indicates that these elements were each sufficient to maintain transcription of the μ gene in the context of the recombinant IgH locus.Table IIμ mRNA content of recombinant hybridoma cell linesRecombinantRelative μ mRNAMean ± S.E.Eμ+MAR+90 ± 11R1100R479 ± 25Eμ−MAR+64 ± 8.5R274 ± 17R370 ± 1R961 ± 6R1152 ± 10Eμ+MAR−46 ± 8.9R542R754 ± 4R1734 ± 0R1841R6658 ± 1Eμ−MAR−6.8 ± 4.9R310R64.2 ± 1.2R104.3 ± 2.2R143.6 ± 3.1R4416.4 ± 6.6R652.2 ± 1Sp6 parental hybridoma85 ± 185Recombinants of the indicated structure were generated as described in the text and Table 1.

As summarized in the Introduction, high level expression of IgH-derived transgenes in mice requires both Eμ and MARs, indicating that these elements each provide different and necessary functions (7Forrester W.C. van-Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The repeated observation that these elements are not needed to maintain endogenous IgH expression in B cell lines has suggested either that the locus contains other, functionally redundant elements, or that continued expression of the heavy chain gene in these cell lines does not require enhancers or MARs of any type (12Wabl M.R. Burrows P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2452-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Zaller D.M. Eckhardt L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5088-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Aguilera R.J. Hope T.J. Sakano H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3689-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Klein S. Sablitzky F. Radbruch A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2473-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The finding that the 5′-MAR-Eμ-3′-MAR segment is in fact required for continued expression of a transgene in a pre-B cell line then argues that the normal IgH locus has activating elements that are redundant in B cell lines (3Grosschedl R. Marx M. Cell. 1988; 55: 645-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Porton B. Zaller D.M. Lieberson R. Eckhardt L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It might, however, be inappropriate to meld these experiments, as transgenes in mice and the endogenous IgH of cell lines have been subjected to ontogenetic effects that might not apply to transgenes introduced into cell lines. To investigate the role of the intronic activating elements under more uniform conditions, we have exploited our finding that insertion of thegpt cassette into the IgH locus renders expression of the endogenous μ gene dependent on at least one intronic element in the 5′-MAR-Eμ-3′-MAR segment (6Oancea A.E. Berru M. Shulman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2658-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These conditions have allowed us to analyze the role of the MARs and Eμ core enhancer in μ expression, using closely related targeted recombinants that present the μ gene in a constant chromosomal and cellular context. In contrast to the case of μ expression from transgenes in mice where both Eμand MARs are required, our analysis of μ expression in the recombinant IgH locus of hybridoma cells indicates that high level μ expression required either Eμ or the MARs. Thus, for both the Eμ+MAR− and Eμ−MAR+ targeted recombinant cell lines, μ expression was much higher than the case of the Eμ−MAR− locus, and each of the single element loci was roughly comparable with the complete Eμ+MAR+ locus. These observations lead to an interesting paradox, as follows. On the one hand, the large difference in μ expression between the Eμ+MAR− and Eμ−MAR− recombinants indicates that μ expression required the Eμ function, i.e. that Eμ function could not be supplied to the Eμ−MAR− locus by elements elsewhere in the locus. Similarly, the large difference between the Eμ−MAR+ and Eμ−MAR− recombinants indicates that μ expression required the MAR function and that this function could not be supplied by the locus. Thus, these results indicate that μ expression required both the MAR and Eμ functions, because the locus could supply neither function. On the other hand, the relatively small (∼2-fold) difference between the Eμ+MAR+, Eμ+MAR−, and Eμ−MAR+ recombinants recombinants leads to the contrary conclusion, namely that μ expression required neither MAR nor Eμ function, because the locus could supply both functions. We propose two models to account for this apparent paradox. One possibility is that maintenance of μ expression does not in fact require both Eμ and MAR functions, as it should be noted that the experiments that tested for continued transgene expression in pre-B cell lines examined the effects of deleting a segment which bore both elements and did not test deletions of each element separately (3Grosschedl R. Marx M. Cell. 1988; 55: 645-654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Porton B. Zaller D.M. Lieberson R. Eckhardt L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That is, the role of Eμ and MARs in initiating expression might be different from their role in maintaining expression. For example, initiation might require demethylation of some special site in the IgH locus, and both Eμ and a MAR might be required to render that site a substrate for demethylation. Conversely, maintenance might be abrogated by methylation, and either Eμ or a MAR might be sufficient to prevent specific methylation. A second possibility, suggested by the seemingly complementary actions of Eμ and MARs, is that μ expression always requires both an enhancer and MARs, but that one element in or near the transcription unit can collaborate with another (complementary) element elsewhere in the locus. Thus, either Eμ or a MAR would be sufficient to maintain expression of the μ gene in the endogenous locus, because by hypothesis Eμ can collaborate with a MAR, or, alternatively, a MAR in the JH-Cμ intron can collaborate with an enhancer. The IgH locus is known to include other enhancers 3′ of Cα; as well, other MARs lie between Cδ and Cγ3 genes and 5′ of the V region promoter (16Cockerill P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Webb C.F. Das C. Eneff K.L. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5206-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To explain why these other enhancers and MARs do not collaborate to activate transcription in the Eμ−MAR−recombinants, we suppose that the functional unit must be properly situated, as noted above. Experiments using a MAR derived from the interferon β gene have also led to the conclusion that the capacity of a MAR to stimulate transcription depends strongly on its position relative to the promoter (27Schubeler D. Mielke C. Maass K. Bode J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11160-11169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although the “distance,” 1.5 kilobases between the μ promoter and the intronic MARs, is in the range for which the interferon β MAR was inhibitory. MARs are found both outside and within transcription units, and those MARs within transcription units are often co-localized with enhancers (28Boulikas T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162A: 279-388PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this association exists because the functioning of these elements requires their collaboration (29Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Thus, MARs might facilitate promoter-enhancer contacts or sequester the enhancer in the vicinity of transcription factors (30Bode J. Stengert-Iber M. Kay V. Schlake T. Dietz-Pfeilstetter A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1996; 6: 115-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Eμ and the MARs can function, although there are no (recognizable) complementary elements in their immediate vicinity. Initiation and maintenance of expression might each require both an enhancer and MARs but differ in their dependence on linkage,e.g. initiation might require close linkage between the enhancer and the MARs, while more separated elements might suffice to maintain expression. That is, the two models proposed above are not mutually exclusive. To judge from the well studied IgH and β-globin loci, transcriptional activating elements might often be redundant in normal chromosomal genes. As reviewed in the Introduction, the finding that IgH expression was maintained at a high level in B-cell lines that had lost the enhancer needed for transgene expression was an early suggestion that the locus contained other, normally redundant activating elements. Similarly, in the case of the β-globin locus, several DNase hypersensitive sites that are required for high level transgene expression can be deleted from the endogenous locus without greatly altering β-globin gene expression (31Martin D.I.K. Fiering S. Groudine M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The redundant elements, which permit transcription in the mutant globin and IgH loci, have not been identified. It might be expected that functionally redundant elements would resemble each other, and, indeed, the aforementioned 3′ enhancers in the IgH locus are good candidates for the elements that maintain expression in the enhancerless mutant B-cell lines. However, our finding that the MARs and Eμ, two elements that differ substantially in their biochemical properties and activities, are functionally redundant in their capacity to maintain IgH expression underscores the general possibility that redundant elements might appear dissimilar."
https://openalex.org/W1991113162,"We previously showed that an oncogenic Cbl mutant (70Z) is constitutively active in transcriptional activation of nuclear factor at activated T cells (NFAT). However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Here we analyzed the effects of 70Z mutations at an amino-terminal loss of function site (Gly-306) and at carboxyl-terminal potential tyrosine or serine phosphorylation sites on association with signaling proteins and on NFAT activation. Mutation at Gly-306 of 70Z disrupted its association with Zap-70 and almost completely abolished its ability to induce NFAT activation under basal and ionomycin-stimulated conditions. However, mutations at potential tyrosine or serine phosphorylation sites had little effect. In fact, expression of 70Z with Tyr-700, Tyr-731, or Tyr-774 mutated to Phe increased NFAT activity in comparison with unmutated 70Z. These findings suggest that an amino terminus-mediated interaction of 70Z with Zap-70 plays a positive role and that a carboxyl terminus-mediated, phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction with their binding proteins plays a negative role in 70Z-mediated NFAT activation. In support of this notion are the observations that 70Z reduced T cell receptor-induced NFAT activation and that wild-type Cbl further inhibited this event, suggesting that both 70Z and wild-type Cbl employ a similar mechanism by which Cbl proteins dually regulate T cell receptor-mediated signaling.

Activation of Lck and/or Fyn leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the intracellular domains of CD3 and ζ subunits, resulting in the subsequent recruitment and activation of Zap-70 and Syk. The activated PTKs in turn propagate activation signals by phosphorylating multiple intracellular proteins, eventually leading to T cell activation, lymphokine production, and proliferation.

The association of Zap-70 with Cbl is activation-dependent and is mediated by a Tyr(P)-binding (PTB) domain in the amino-terminal region of Cbl (28Lupher M.L.J. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y.

Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8867-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), respectively, as the Cbl PTB-binding motif. Interestingly, the Tyr-292 of Zap-70 was reported to negatively regulate T cell activation and was postulated to be a binding site for a negative regulatory protein (31Kong G. Dalton M. Wardenburg J.B. Straus D. Kurosaki T. Chan A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Zhao Q. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6765-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion is the observation that Cbl binds and inhibits the kinase activity of Syk (33Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast to Cbl, a mutated form of Cbl (70Z) with a 17-amino acid deletion near the amino-terminal region of a Ring finger domain is transforming in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (34Blake T.J. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 757-762PubMed Google Scholar, 35Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that 70Z binds and enhances the kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (36Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (37Bonita D. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We presented data showing that 70Z is constitutively active in the transactivation of NFAT promoter (38Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a critical component of the interleukin-2 gene and other cytokine genes (39Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The 70Z-induced NFAT activation synergizes with ionomycin treatment and is dependent on a functional Ras (38Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism underlying the 70Z-mediated signal leading to NFAT activation remains unclear. Exploration of this mechanism will be critical in understanding the functional role of Cbl and its oncogenic mutants in T cell activation and leukemogenesis. Our hypothesis is that 70Z-induced NFAT transactivation is mediated via complex(es) formation of 70Z with its binding partners. To test this hypothesis, we systematically constructed a series of point-mutated 70Z mutants at an amino-terminal loss of function (Gly-306) site and at carboxyl-terminal potential Tyr(P) or phosphoserine sites and analyzed their interactions with respective binding partners and effects on NFAT activation. We demonstrated that expression of the G306E mutant, which disrupted the interaction with Zap-70, abolished 70Z-induced NFAT activation under both basal and ionomycin-stimulated conditions. However, mutations at Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774, but not at other single tyrosine or serine residues, enhanced the basal and ionomycin-treated activation of NFAT. Our results suggest that the interaction of the amino-terminal PTB domain of 70Z with Zap-70 plays a positive role and that the interactions of its carboxyl-terminal Tyr(P) residues with potential binding partners such as PI3-K and Crk-L can play a negative role in this event. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Cbl (c-15), anti-Crk-L, anti-TCR ζ chain, and anti-Zap-70 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibody 4G10, anti-Vav monoclonal antibody, and anti-p85 subunit of PI3-K polyclonal antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-14-3-3 monoclonal antibody was described previously (22Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A.

An anti-CD3ε (OKT3) was purified from ascites fluid by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham. cDNAs encoding HA-tagged wild-type Cbl, 70Z, in pEFneo (42Liu Y.-C.

HA-tagged 70Z subcloned into pGEM11Z was used for point mutations with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuickChange; Stratagene) with a pair of sense and antisense primers of 20–23 mer around the targeting site. The mutated sequences were verified by direct DNA sequencing. The following mutations were constructed (Fig. 1): 1) 70Z point tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations including the potential Tyr(P) residues in its carboxyl terminus (Tyr-552, Tyr-674, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, Tyr-735, and Tyr-774, single site; Tyr-700/774 and Tyr-869/871, double site) or a mutant with all eight tyrosine residues mutated (Y8F); 2) point serine to alanine mutation at the Ser-619 single site and the Ser-619/639 double site, which are within the 14-3-3 binding sites (23Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); and 3) a loss of function glycine to glutamic acid mutation at Gly-306. cDNAs encoding mutated 70Z constructs were subcloned back into pEFneo. The NFAT-luciferase reporter construct was provided by Dr. G. Crabtree. Simian virus 40 T antigen (TAg)-transfected human leukemic Jurkat T cells (Jurkat-TAg) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For protein expression in Jurkat-TAg T cells, cells were transfected with the appropriate amount of plasmids (usually 5–10 μg, total) by electroporation as described previously (23Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended (2 × 107cells/ml) in 0.5 ml of medium, equilibrated at 37 °C for 5 min, and activated with OKT3 (4 μg/ml) for 5 min. Stimulation was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 2× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 4 mm Na3VO4, and 20 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin). Cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g (4 °C for 10 min). For luciferase assays, cells were washed, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fetal calf serum, and incubated for 4–6 h in 24-well plates. The cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with either OKT3 ascites (1:500) or purified OKT3 (3 μg/ml), ionomycin (100 ng/ml), or both ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (50 ng/ml) for another 8–10 h. Lysates (1 × 107 cells) were mixed with antibodies for 2 h, followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A/G Plus-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional hour at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and boiled in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli's buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies (usually 1 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were washed and visualized with an ECL detection system (Amersham). When necessary, membranes were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 1 h at 70 °C with constant agitation, washed, and then reprobed with other antibodies as indicated. The luciferase assay to determine the activation of reporter genes was described previously (38Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate and expressed as arbitrary units (AU). The standard deviation among triplicates was ≤10%, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. We previously showed that 70Z induces the transactivation of NFAT in synergy with a Ca2+ signal (38Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. To understand this mechanism, we first made several Tyr to Phe mutations at Tyr-700, Tyr-731, Tyr-774, or Tyr-700/774, which are shown to be the binding sites for Vav, PI3-K, and Crk-L (both Tyr-700 and Tyr-774), respectively (16Reedquist K.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and reconfirmed their respective roles for protein-protein interaction. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the Y700F or Y774F single mutation had only a partial effect on Crk-L interaction. However, a Y700/774F double mutation completely abolished its interaction with Crk-L, indicating that both tyrosine residues are required for the Crk-L interaction (18Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar). A Y731F mutation disrupted the interaction with p85, consistent with our previous observation (38Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, we did not detect Vav/70Z interaction as reported previously for Vav/Cbl interaction (21Marengere L. Mirtsos C. Kozieradzki I. Veillette A. Mak T. Penninger J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 70-76PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a Vav/70Z interaction is relatively weaker than that of 70Z with Crk-L or PI3-K. Next we examined whether these mutants affect 70Z-mediated NFAT transactivation. Plasmids containing 70Z or its mutants were cotransfected into Jurkat-TAg cells with the NFAT-luc reporter gene. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with OKT3 or ionomycin and assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2 B, 70Z induced NFAT activation under resting conditions, which synergized with ionomycin treatment, consistent with our previously published result (38Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, OKT3 stimulation did not enhance but rather reduced the luciferase activity in comparison with cells transfected with the empty vector under the same conditions, suggesting that OKT3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 70Z and its recruitment of other binding molecules may play a negative role in the TCR-mediated NFAT activation. This suggestion is supported by the observation from the point-mutated 70Z proteins. Increases in the NFAT-driven luciferase activity, albeit to slightly different degrees, were observed in cells transfected with Y700F, Y731F, Y774F, or Y700/774F under unstimulated conditions or OKT3- or ionomycin-stimulated conditions as compared with unmutated 70Z. The increases in NFAT activation were more obvious in ionomycin-treated samples. These results suggest that these tyrosine residues are not responsible for the observed ability of 70Z in NFAT transactivation. Rather, interactions of 70Z with its binding partners such as PI3-K or Crk-L via these residues may play a negative role in this event. Although the tyrosine residues at 700, 731, and 774 are known to be responsible for the protein-protein interactions, as also shown above, there are other potential tyrosine residues whose nature of tyrosine phosphorylation or potential role in protein-protein interactions are unclear. Therefore, we made additional point mutations at Tyr-552, Tyr-674, and Tyr-735, a double mutant at Tyr-869 and Tyr-871, or a mutant with all eight tyrosine residues mutated to phenylalanine (Y8F). These mutants were expressed in Jurkat-TAg cells and analyzed for their interactions with PI3-K and Crk-L. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Y552F, Y735F, or Y869/871F did not have any effect on their interactions with PI3-K and Crk-L. However, Y8F completely disrupted the interactions with PI3-K and Crk-L. A single Y674F mutant did not express well and was not included in those experiments. These mutants were then analyzed for their ability to induce NFAT transactivation. As shown in Fig. 2 D, Y552F, Y735F, and Y869/831F showed only slightly enhancing effects on NFAT transactivation as compared with 70Z under unstimulated conditions or OKT3- or ionomycin-stimulated conditions. OKT3. However, Y8F, a mutant with all eight carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues mutated, markedly enhanced its ability to activate NFAT under unstimulated or stimulated conditions. This result suggests that tyrosine residues at 552, 735, 869, and 871 are not critical for 70Z-mediated NFAT transactivation. The observed effect of Y8F may represent a synergy of the Y700F, Y731F, and Y774F mutations. We previously demonstrated that Cbl interacts with 14-3-3 in an activation-dependent manner via two phosphoserine-containing motifs in Cbl (22Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Of these motifs, Ser-619 and Ser-639 have been predicated to be the serine phosphorylation sites responsible for the binding (23Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 43Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). We then constructed a S619A single mutant and a S619/639A double mutant in 70Z and analyzed their interaction with 14-3-3. As shown in Fig.3 A, a mutation at Ser-619 reduced both basal and stimulation-induced interaction with 14-3-3; mutation at both the Ser-619 and Ser-639 sites abolished stimulation-induced 14-3-3 binding, although a residual basal level of 70Z/14-3-3 association remained. Next, we examined the effects of these two mutants on NFAT activation. Mutations at either single site (S619A) or double sites (S619/639A) showed only a slightly higher activation of NFAT as compared with 70Z under either unstimulated conditions or OKT3- or ionomycin-stimulated conditions (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of cell lysates with anti-HA revealed comparable amounts of proteins among all the samples (Fig. 3 C). Although 14-3-3 may still have some effects on 70Z in these mutants because of remaining basal level interaction, this result suggests that an OKT3-stimulated, enhanced 70Z/14-3-3 interaction is not critical in 70Z-induced NFAT activation. Previous studies have shown that a point mutation (G306E) in v-Cbl, which corresponds to a loss of function mutation in Sli-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans Cbl homologue, disrupts its interaction with PTKs including Zap-70 (28Lupher M.L.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and ablates v-Cbl-induced cell transformation (37Bonita D. Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H.

Subsequent studies, including our own, demonstrated that this region contains a PTB domain that interacts with a N(D)XY motif in Zap-70 (29Lupher M.L. Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33140-33144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Syk (30Deckert M. Elly C. Altman A. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8867-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that this Cbl/PTK binding can play an important role in Cbl-mediated signaling. In support of this suggestion is the observation that Cbl inhibits Syk activity by directly binding the latter (33Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To understand whether 70Z-mediated NFAT activation involves a similar mechanism, we made a G306E mutation in 70Z and transfected this mutant plasmid plus NFAT-luc into Jurkat-TAg cells. G306E completely abrogated 70Z-induced NFAT activation under resting conditions (Fig. 4). OKT3 stimulation of the cells overexpressing G306E induced further inhibition of NFAT activation by G306E as compared with 70Z. More importantly, this mutant also abolished ionomycin-induced NFAT activation by 70Z. This result provides further evidence for an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which 70Z exerts its biological function via the interaction of its amino-terminal PTB domain with upstream PTKs, most likely Syk/Zap-70. In addition, the increased inhibition of NFAT activation by G306E under OKT3 stimulation could be explained by a Tyr(P)-mediated negative signaling, in agreement with the aforementioned observations (Fig.2). We have previously shown that the interaction of the Cbl PTB domain with the Syk Tyr-316 residue is required for maximal tyrosine phosph"
https://openalex.org/W2083996981,"We previously reported that substitution of Arg258 within the switch 3 region of Gsα impaired activation and increased basal GDP release due to loss of an interaction between the helical and GTPase domains (Warner, D. R., Weng, G., Yu, S., Matalon, R., and Weinstein, L. S. (1998) J Biol. Chem. 273, 23976–23983). The adjacent residue (Glu259) is strictly conserved in G protein α-subunits and is predicted to be important in activation. To determine the importance of Glu259, this residue was mutated to Ala (Gsα-E259A), Gln (Gsα-E259Q), Asp (Gsα-E259D), or Val (Gsα-E259V), and the properties of in vitrotranslation products were examined. The Gsα-E259V was studied because this mutation was identified in a patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. S49 cyc reconstitution assays demonstrated that Gsα-E259D stimulated adenylyl cyclase normally in the presence of GTPγS but was less efficient with isoproterenol or AlF4−. The other mutants had more severely impaired effector activation, particularly in response to AlF4−. In trypsin protection assays, GTPγS was a more effective activator than AlF4− for all mutants, with Gsα-E259D being the least severely impaired. For Gsα-E259D, the AlF4−-induced activation defect was more pronounced at low Mg2+ concentrations. Gsα-E259D and Gsα-E259A purified fromEscherichia coli had normal rates of GDP release (as assessed by the rate GTPγS binding). However, for both mutants, the ability of AlF4− to decrease the rate of GTPγS binding was impaired, suggesting that they bound AlF4− more poorly. GTPγS bound to purified Gsα-E259D irreversibly in the presence of 1 mm free Mg2+, but dissociated readily at micromolar concentrations. Sucrose density gradient analysis ofin vitro translates demonstrated that all mutants except Gsα-E259V bind to βγ at 0 °C and were stable at higher temperatures. In the active conformation Glu259interacts with conserved residues in the switch 2 region that are important in maintaining both the active state and AlF4− in the guanine nucleotide binding pocket. Although both Gsα Arg258 and Glu259 are critical for activation, the mechanisms by which these residues affect Gsα protein activation are distinct.

The α-subunits, which are distinct for each G protein, bind guanine nucleotide and modulate the activity of specific downstream effectors. For Gs, these include the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and modulation of ion channels (4Yatani A. Codina J. Imoto Y. Reeves J.P. Birnbaumer L. Brown A.M.

Upon receptor activation, the α-subunit undergoes a conformational change resulting in the exchange of GTP for GDP and dissociation from βγ. While GTP is bound, the α-subunit interacts with and regulates specific effectors. An intrinsic GTPase activity within the α-subunit hydrolyzes bound GTP to GDP, returning the G protein to the inactive state. Analogs of GTP, such as GTPγS and GDP-AlF4−, lock the G protein in the active state. guanine nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory G protein Gs α-subunit -E259A, -E259Q, and -E259V, Gsα mutant with Glu259 substituted to aspartate, alanine, glutamine, and valine, respectively mixture of 10 μm AlCl3 and 10 mmNaF guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) wild type guanine nucleotide-binding protein stimulatory G protein Gs α-subunit -E259A, -E259Q, and -E259V, Gsα mutant with Glu259 substituted to aspartate, alanine, glutamine, and valine, respectively mixture of 10 μm AlCl3 and 10 mmNaF guanosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) wild type X-ray crystal structures reveal that G protein α-subunits have two domains, a ras-like GTPase domain, which includes the regions for guanine nucleotide binding and effector interaction, and a helical domain, which may prevent release of GDP in the inactive state (6Noel J.P.

Comparison of the crystal structures of inactive (GDP-bound) and activated (GTPγS- or AlF4−-bound) α-subunits demonstrates three regions (named switches 1, 2, and 3), the conformation of which changes upon switching from the inactive to active state. The movement of switches 1 and 2 is directly related to the presence of the γ-phosphate group, whereas switch 3 has no direct contact with bound guanine nucleotide. Upon activation, switches 2 and 3 move toward each other, and the two regions form multiple interactions that presumably stabilize the active state (7Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 10Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Switch 3 residues also make contacts with the helical domain that are important for high affinity guanine nucleotide binding (10Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 15Warner D.R. Weng G. Yu S. Matalon R. Weinstein L.S. J Biol.

Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21673-21676Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that substitutions of the switch 3 residue Arg258 impairs activation by receptor or AlF4−(15Warner D.R. Weng G. Yu S. Matalon R. Weinstein L.S. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23976-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 2All numbering is based on the Gsα-1 sequence reported by Kozasa et al. (17Kozasa T. Itoh H. Tsukamoto T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). 2All numbering is based on the Gsα-1 sequence reported by Kozasa et al. (17Kozasa T. Itoh H. Tsukamoto T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The latter effect was the direct result of decreased GDP binding due to loss of contacts between the Arg258 side chain and residues within the helical domain. The adjacent residue (Glu259) is invariant in all known G protein α-subunits and is predicted to be important in activation, because it makes interactions with switch 2 residues in the active state (7Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 12Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Moreover, this residue is mutated to a valine in a patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (16Ahmed S.F. Dixon P.H. Bonthron D.T. Stirling H.F. Barr D.G.B. Kelnar C.J.H. Thakker R.V. Clin. Endocrinol. 1998; 49: 525-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we provide evidence that substitution of Glu259also leads to impaired activation, particularly by receptor or AlF4−. However, impaired activation of these mutants by AlF4− is not the result of decreased GDP binding (as is the case for the Arg258mutants) but rather is the result of a decreased ability to bind the AlF4− moiety. The crystal structure of GTPγS-bound Gsα reveals interactions between the acidic side chain of Glu259 and basic residues within switch 2 that are important in maintaining the active state and in binding of AlF4− (12Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J.G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Although adjacent switch 3 residues in Gsα (Arg258 and Glu259) are both critical for activation, the mechanisms by which mutations of these residues result in defective activation are distinct. To generate Gsα Glu259 mutants, polymerase chain reaction was performed as described previously (15Warner D.R. Weng G. Yu S. Matalon R. Weinstein L.S. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23976-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using linearized vector containing wild type Gsα cDNA as template. The upstream primer was 5′-GACAAAGTCAACTTCCACATGTTTGACGTGGGTGGCCAGCGCGATGAACG-3′, and the downstream mutagenic primers were as follows: 5′-GAGCCTCCTGCAGGCGGTTGGTCTGGTTGTCCACCCGGATGACCATGTTG-3′ for E259V, 5′-GAGCCTCCTGCAGGCGGTTGGTCTGGTTGTCCGCCCGGATGACCATGTTG-3′ for E259A, 5′-GAGCCTCCTGCAGGCGGTTGGTCTGGTTGTCCTGCCGGATGACCATGTTG-3′ for E259Q, and 5′-GAGCCTCCTGCAGGCGGTTGGTCTGGTTGTCGTCCCGGATGACCATGTTG-3′ for E259D. Each polymerase chain reaction product was digested withHincII andSse8387I and ligated into the transcription vector pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that contained wild type human Gsα cDNA (splice variant Gsα-1, Ref. 17Kozasa T.

Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, and synthesis of full-length Gsα from each construct was confirmed by immune precipitation of in vitro translated products with RM antibody, directed against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of Gsα (18Simonds W.F.

Wild type and mutant Gsα in vitro transcription/translation products (10 μl of translation medium) were reconstituted into 25 μg of purified S49 cyc plasma membranes and tested for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in the presence of various agents as indicated in Table I (15Warner D.R.

Limited trypsin digestion ofin vitro translated Gsα was performed as described previously (15Warner D.R. Weng G. Yu S. Matalon R. Weinstein L.S. J Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1718-1727PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of in vitrotranslated [35S]methionine-labeled Gsα was incubated in incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with or without 100 μmGTPγS or 10 mm NaF/10 μm AlCl3at various temperatures for 1 h and then digested with 200 μg/ml tosyl-l-phenylyalanine chloromethyl ketone-trypsin for 5 min at 20 °C. In some experiments, GDP was also included in the preincubation, and in other experiments the MgCl2concentration was varied. Reactions were terminated by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Digestion products were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the amount of 38-kDa protected fragment was measured by phosphorimaging. The percentage of protection is the signal in 38-kDa protected band divided by the signal in the undigested full-length Gsα band × 100. [35S]Methionine-labeled Gsα was synthesized, and rate zonal centrifugation was performed on linear 5–20% sucrose gradients (200 μl) as described previously (19Warner D.R. Gejman P.V. Collins R.M. Weinstein L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1718-1727PubMed Google Scholar, 22Basi N.S. Rebois R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Gradients were prepared in 20 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Lubrol-PX. Six-μl fractions were obtained and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the relative amount of Gsα in each fraction was quantified as described previously (19Warner D.R. Gejman P.V. Collins R.M. Weinstein L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1718-1727PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the ability of Gsα to bind to Gβγ, in vitro translation products were preincubated for 1 h at 0 °C in the presence or absence of Gβγ (20 μg/ml) prior to centrifugation. In order to optimize separation between free α-subunit and heterotrimer, 0.15% (w/v) CHAPS was substituted for Lubrol-PX in the preincubations and gradients, and the samples were centrifuged at 120,000 rpm (627,000 × g at the maximum radial distance from the center of rotation (R max) in a TLA-120.2 rotor (Beckman). Gβγ was isolated from bovine brain (23Roof D.J. Applebury M.L. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16242-16249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pQE60, containing the long form of bovine Gsα cDNA with a hexa-histidine extension at the carboxyl terminus, was a generous gift of A. G. Gilman and R. K. Sunahara. The Glu259 residue was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange kit (Statagene). Each mutated cDNA was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and to rule out polymerase chain reaction artifacts. After transformation into E. coli strain JM109, cultures were grown, Gsα expression was induced, and Gsα proteins were purified as described previously (15Warner D.R. Weng G. Yu S. Matalon R.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), except that [GDP] was only 10 μm in the storage buffer. Assays measuring the rate of binding of GTPγS were performed as described previously (15Warner D.R. Weng G. Yu S. Matalon R. Weinstein L.S. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23976-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Carty D.J. Iyengar R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 pmol of purified Gsα was incubated at 37 °C in a final volume of 2 ml containing 1 μm[35S]GTPγS (5,000–10,000 cpm/pmol) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.01% Lubrol-PX with or without 10 mmNaF/10 μm AlCl3. At various times, 50-μl aliquots were removed and diluted with 2 ml of ice-cold stop solution (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2, and 100 μm GTP) and maintained on ice until all samples were collected. Samples were then filtered under vacuum through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) and washed twice with 10 ml of stop solution without GTP, and filters were dissolved in 10 ml of scintillation mixture. To determine the effect of Mg2+on the rate of GTPγS dissociation, ∼2.5 pmol of purified Gsα was loaded with [35S]GTPγS at 30 °C for 45 min in the presence of various free Mg2+concentrations. After addition of 100 μm cold GTPγS, bound [35S]GTPγS was determined at various time points as described above. k off for GTPγS dissociation was determined by fitting the data to the functiony = ae −kt +b using the software GraphPad Prism, version 2.01. Free Mg2+ concentrations were calculated as described (26Skooge D.A. West D.M. Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry. Saunders College Publishing, Philadelphia, PA1982: 276-303Google Scholar). Gsα Glu259substitution mutants were cloned into the transcription vector pBluescript, and the in vitro transcription/translation products were compared with those of Gsα-WT in various biochemical assays. We substituted Glu259 with valine (Gsα-E259V) because a mutation encoding this substitution has been identified in a patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (16Ahmed S.F. Dixon P.H. Bonthron D.T. Stirling H.F. Barr D.G.B. Kelnar C.J.H. Thakker R.V. Clin. Endocrinol. 1998; 49: 525-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a human disorder associated with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of Gsα (27Patten J.L. Johns D.R. Valle D. Eil C. Gruppuso P.A. Steele G. Smallwood P.M. Levine M.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1412-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 28Weinstein L.S. Gejman P.V. Friedman E. Kadowaki T. Collins R.M. Gershon E.S. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8287-8290Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because the presence of an amino acid with a bulky and branched side chain (valine) may introduce nonspecific steric effects, we also generated and analyzed additional mutants in which Glu259 was replaced by alanine (Gsα-E259A), glutamine (Gsα-E259Q), or aspartate (Gsα-E259D). In Gsα-E259A, the acidic side chain was removed, whereas in Gsα-E259Q it is converted to a residue in which the carboxyl group is replaced by a neutral amide group. In Gsα-E259D, the charge of the residue at position Glu259 is maintained, but the length of the side chain is shortened by one methylene group. After reconstitution of translation products into purified S49 cyc membranes (which lack endogenous Gsα), Gsα-E259V had markedly decreased ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase in the presence of GTPγS, AlF4−, or activated receptor (isoproterenol + GTP) (Table I). For Gsα-E259A and -E259Q, the ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase was moderately reduced in the presence of GTPγS (∼40% of Gsα-WT) and more markedly reduced in the presence of AlF4− or activated receptor. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by Gsα-E259D was normal in the presence of GTPγS but moderately reduced in the presence of AlF4− or activated receptor. Although the severity of the defect varied depending on which specific residue replaced Glu259, for each Gsα-Glu259 mutant, GTPγS was the most effective activator and AlF4− the least effective activator. We next examined the ability of AlF4− or GTPγS to protect each mutant from trypsin digestion, which measures the ability of each agent to bind to Gsα and induce the active conformation (29Miller R.T. Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Beiderman B. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the inactive, GDP-bound state, two arginine residues within switch 2 (most likely Arg228 and Arg231, based upon sequence homology with transducin) are sensitive to trypsin digestion, leading to the generation of low molecular weight fragments. When Gsα attains the active conformation, these residues are inaccessible to trypsin digestion (7Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and therefore trypsinization of activated Gsα generates a partially protected 38-kDa product. Gsα-WT was well protected by AlF4− or GTPγS at temperatures up to 37 °C (Fig. 1, TableII). At 30 °C, Gsα-E259V, -E259A, and -E259Q showed little protection by GTPγS and no protection by AlF4−(Fig. 1). In contrast, both GTPγS and AlF4− were able to protect Gsα-E259D, with GTPγS being a more efficient activator than AlF4− (Fig. 1, Table II).

Compared with known globins from unicellular organisms, the Ynl234wp polypeptide is characterized by an unusual structure. In this protein, a central putative heme-binding domain of about 140 amino acids is flanked by two sequences of about 160 and 120 amino acids, respectively, which share no similarity with known polypeptides. Northern analysis indicates thatYNL234w transcription is very low in cells grown under normal aerobic conditions but is induced by oxygen-limited growth conditions and by other stress conditions such as glucose repression, heat shock, osmotic stress, and nitrogen starvation. However, the deletion of the gene had no detectable effect on yeast growth. The Ynl234wp polypeptide has been expressed in Escherichia coli, and the hemoprotein nature of the recombinant protein was demonstrated by heme staining after SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and spectroscopic analysis.

Hemoglobins (Hbs) 1The abbreviations HbhemoglobinPCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are widely distributed in many organisms, including higher plants, protozoa, fungi, and bacteria (1Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In contrast to their vertebrate counterparts, the nonvertebrate globins exhibit an extensive variability of their structural organization (1Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Vinogradov S.D. Walz B. Pohajdak L. Moens O. Kapp H. Suzuki T. Trotman C.N.A. Comp. Biochem.

In bacteria and yeasts, Hbs are found as bifunctional proteins in which the N-terminal globin domain is linked to a second domain with a different activity (see Fig. 1). The C-terminal region can be either a FAD/NAD(P)H-binding domain with oxidoreductase activity (flavohemoglobins) or a kinase domain, as in the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhizobium meliloti (5Gilles-Gonzales M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The heme-binding domains of the flavohemoglobins share substantial sequence similarity with the single-domain Hb of the purple bacterium Vitreoscilla, which works in association with an NADPH reductase encoded by a different gene (6Dikshit R.P. Dikshit K.L. Liu Y. Webster D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the function of these proteins is still unclear, oxygen appears to play a role in the expression of at least some of them. For example, growth in limiting concentrations of oxygen induces the synthesis of theVitreoscilla Hb (7Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Webster D.A. Nature. 1986; 322: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and of the Bacillus subtilis(8Lacelle M. Kumano M. Kurita K. Yamane K. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Alcaligenes eutrophus (9Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7349-7354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) flavohemoglobins. In contrast, transcription of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeflavohemoglobin, encoded by the YHB1 gene, is enhanced under oxygen-replete conditions via the heme-dependent activation of the HAP1 and HAP2/3/4 transcription factors (10Crawford M.J. Sherman D.R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6991-6996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that this flavohemoglobin might play a role in the oxidative stress response in yeast (11Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25131-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but discrepancies in the results between different laboratories do not allow this conclusion (12Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9527-9533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however, the results of phenotypic studies onYHB1-deleted or overexpressing strains suggest a complex relationship between Yhb1p function and cell defense against various stresses (12Buisson N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9527-9533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). hemoglobin polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Here we report the study of a gene located on chromosome XIV ofS. cerevisiae that encodes a new putative hemoglobin, showing peculiar structural characteristics in comparison with known hemoglobins. Gene YNL234w was identified during the sequencing of the entire S. cerevisiae genome (13Pandolfo D. De Antoni A. Lanfranchi G. Valle G. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It encodes a 426-amino acid-long polypeptide that is characterized by the presence of a central domain of about 140 amino acids, showing a significant similarity to the globin family. This domain is flanked by two sequences of about 160 and 120 amino acids, respectively, that share no similarity with known protein domains or motifs (see Fig.1). We show here that a recombinant, heterologously expressed Ynl234wp polypeptide actually binds heme and that expression of the YNL234w gene in yeast is induced by hypoxia and other stress conditions. Escherichia coli strains INVαF′ (Invitrogen), used for amplification of the plasmids, and BL21 (DE3) (hsdS,gal [λcIts857 ind1Sam7 nin5 lacUV5-T7 gene1]), used for expression and purification of the recombinant protein, were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% Difco bacto tryptone, 0.5% Difco yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl). S. cerevisiae strains W303–1B/A (MATa, ade2–1, his3–11, 15, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, ura3–1, can1–100) (14Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), W3/H (MATa, hem1::HIS3) (15Chantrel Y. Gaisne M. Lions C. Verdière J. Genetics. 1998; 148: 559-569PubMed Google Scholar) and FY73 (MATα, his3Δ200, ura3–52) (16Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) were used for RNA preparations, and strain FY1679 (MATa/ MATα, ura3–52/ura3–52, his3Δ200/HIS3, leu2Δ1/LEU2, trp1Δ63/TRP1) (16Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) was used for the gene disruption experiments. Cosmid 14-5 was provided by P. Philippsen (University of Basel). This cosmid contains a 38.8-kilobase pair DNA fragment from chromosome XIV of the S. cerevisiae strain FY1679. Cells of strain W303–1B/A were grown aerobically at 28 °C in YPGal medium (1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, 2% galactose, 20 mg/ml adenine) supplemented with 0.2% Tween 80 and 30 mg/l ergosterol (Sigma) up to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Then half of the cells were allowed to grow aerobically to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml and subsequently harvested for analysis (AIR), and the other half was transferred to an air-tight flask as described in Ohaniance et al. (17Ohaniance L. Chaix P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 128: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and shifted to anaerobic conditions by vigorous bubbling of ultrapure N2 for 30 min. The latter culture was shaken under N2 pressure until it reached a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml; then, before opening, the flasks were transferred to ice and chilled for 30 min, and the cells were harvested for analysis (N2). Cells of wild type W303–1B/A and of W3/H mutant (hem1) were grown in YPGal medium supplemented with 0.18 mg/l 5-aminolevulinic acid (Sigma) at 28 °C to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells of strain FY73 were grown at 30 °C in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone) supplemented with 2% glycerol and 1% ethanol until theA 600 reached 0.8, whereupon one-third of the cells were harvested for analysis (Fig. 3 C, lane 1). The remaining cells were washed in sterile distilled water, resuspended in an equal volume of YP containing 2% glucose (YPD), and grown for 60 min at 30 °C. Half of these cells were harvested for analysis (Fig. 3 C, lane 2), whereas the remaining cells were harvested after a further 24 h of growth (Fig.3 C, lane 3). Cells of strain FY73 were grown at 30 °C in GYNB (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 4% glucose, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine) until the A 600 reached 0.8. One-third of these cells was harvested for analysis (control at 30 °C; Fig.3 C, lane 4). The second third of these cells was washed in sterile distilled water, resuspended in two volumes of GYNB without ammonium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 4% glucose, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine), and starved for 2 h at 30 °C (nitrogen starvation;Fig. 3 C, lane 5). NaCl was added (0.7m final concentration) to the final third of cells, which were harvested after 60 min at 30 °C (osmostress; Fig.3 C, lane 6). Cells of strain FY73 were grown at 23 °C in GYNB to an A 600 of 0.8, whereupon half of the cells were taken for analysis (control at 23 °C; Fig. 3 C,lane 7). The other half was incubated at 36 °C for 30 min before harvesting (heat shock; lane 8). Total RNA was prepared by a phenol extraction procedure as described previously (18Brown A.J.P. Evans I. Methods in Yeast Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 269-276Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis in a formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gel as described in Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridization was performed either at 42 °C in 0.7 m NaCl, 0.05 mNa2HPO4, 4 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, pH 7.2 (Fig. 3, A and B) or at 65 °C in 0.5 m Na2HPO4, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2 (Fig. 3 C). Filters were washed in 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 15 min at 65 °C and then in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. DNA fragments of the YNL234w andACT1 genes were 32P-labeled to specific activities greater than 5 × 108 dpm/μg of DNA by random-priming, whereas the end-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-CCTCCGCTTATTGATATGCTTAAG (20Lillehaug J.R. Kleppe K. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was used to probe the 25 S rRNA gene. Hybridization signals were quantified by direct two-dimensional phosphorimaging of Northern membranes using the Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imager® system. The YNL234w gene disruption was performed by the PCR-based method of Wach et al. (21Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). The diploid yeast strain FY1679 was transformed by the lithium acetate procedure (22Daniel Gietz R. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 335-360Google Scholar) with a PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing the kanMX4module (conferring resistance to geneticin) of plasmid pFA6-kanMX4 (21Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) flanked by two 40-base pair S. cerevisiae sequences corresponding to regions located immediately upstream and downstream of the YNL234w coding sequence. Haploid ynl234wmutants were obtained by sporulation of heterozygous diploids, and selection of spores was performed on geneticin-containing medium. The correct chromosomal insertion of the kanMX4 module was verified by PCR amplification using primers specific for the disruption cassette and the chromosome XIV DNA regions flanking theYNL234w gene. 2G. Sartori, G. Mazzotta, S. Stocchetto, A. Pavanello, and G. Carignani, manuscript in preparation. For the phenotypic analysis, several dilutions of fresh stationary-phase cultures of mutant strains were spotted together with the corresponding wild-type strains on YP plates (1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone) containing different carbon sources (2% glucose, 2% galactose, 3% glycerol). The growth was followed for 5 days at three different temperatures (16, 28, and 36 °C). For the heat shock experiments, cells were grown in YPD medium at 25 °C until exponential phase, when half of the cells were exposed to 38 °C for 20 min in a water bath, whereas the remaining cells were left at 25 °C. Cells were then diluted, plated on YPD, and incubated at 25 °C for 5 days, when sizes of the colonies and percentage of survivors were determined. A DNA fragment corresponding to the YNL234w coding sequence lacking the 87 last nucleotides at the 3′ end has been amplified by PCR from DNA of cosmid 14–5 using primers A (5′-GCTGGTTGCATATGACAGGA-3′) and B (5′-ATTACTTTCGTCGACGGTAC-3′). These introduce, respectively, an NdeI site by the ATG codon of the gene and a SalI site 29 codons upstream of the stop codon. DNA amplification was performed using a Pfu(Stratagene) and Taq (Life Technologies, Inc.) DNA polymerase mix in a 1:5 ratio. The product of amplification was digested with NdeI and SalI restriction enzymes and cloned into the expression vector pET-20b(+) (Novagen). The resulting plasmid, pYNL234-His6 allows the synthesis in a bacterial T7 expression system (23Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4831) Google Scholar) of a recombinant 46-kDa Ynl234wp protein with a C-terminal tag of six histidines. The sequence of the cloned fragment was verified by automated dideoxy sequencing (ABI373 DNA sequencer, Applied Biosystem). Cells of the E. coli strain BL21(DE3), transformed with the recombinant plasmid, were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 mm 5-aminolevulinic acid at 37 °C until an A 600 nm of 0.5–0.6, when the temperature was shifted to 20 °C and transcription of theYNL234w coding sequence was induced by addition of 0.4 mm isopropylβ-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Induction at the usual 37 °C temperature resulted in higher yields but also in a prevalent insoluble form of the protein. After 5–7 h of further incubation, cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of SB (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0)/g of wet pellet and sonicated. Purification of the recombinant protein was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol by an affinity column containing nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Quiagen). Recombinant YNL234wp was eluted with 10 ml of SB containing 100 mmimidazole. Orange-colored fractions were collected and dialyzed against SB (without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at pH 7.5. The purity of the preparation was assessed by SDS/PAGE according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For N-terminal sequencing, the recombinant polypeptide was electroblotted after SDS-PAGE to the PVDF membrane (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems), visualized with Coomassie Blue, and analyzed by automated Edman degradation. Heme staining of purified Ynl234wp recombinant protein was carried out with tetramethylbenzidine after SDS-PAGE was performed without the addition of sulfhydryl reducing agents according to Thomaset al. (25Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The proteins were loaded in different amounts because of the lower sensitivity of the staining method for human Hb. Spectrophotometric measurements were made using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 5 UV/VIS spectrophotometer at room temperature. Absolute spectra were recorded by scanning the purified protein preparation against the protein buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) before and after the addition either of an excess of potassium ferricyanide or of few grains of sodium dithionite. The CO difference and absolute spectra were obtained by bubbling CO directly in the cuvette for a few seconds immediately before measurements (26Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 426-amino acid-long sequence of the polypeptide encoded by theYNL234w gene was compared with protein data bases, and a weak but significant similarity was found with several hemoglobin chains (13Pandolfo D. De Antoni A. Lanfranchi G. Valle G. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the amino acid sequence of the Ynl234wp central region matches fairly well to the amino acid sequence template established by Moens et al. (27Moens L. Vanfleteren J. dePeer Y.V. Peeters K. Kapp O. Czeluzniak J. Goodmann M. Blaxter M. Vinogradov S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) based on the alignment of nonvertebrate hemoglobin sequences. It matches also, but with a higher penalty score, to the template based on vertebrate sequences established by Bashford et al. (28Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The alignment of the central part of the Ynl234wp polypeptide (amino acids 164–301) with five hemoglobin domains from unicellular organisms is shown in Fig.2. The α helical motifs (A-H) known to compose the globin structure around the heme group have been identified on the basis of the nonvertebrate template (27Moens L. Vanfleteren J. dePeer Y.V. Peeters K. Kapp O. Czeluzniak J. Goodmann M. Blaxter M. Vinogradov S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Residues known to be important in establishing contacts with heme or in controlling the ligand binding are indicated (for a review, see Bolognesi et al. (29Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)). These comparisons identify the central part of the Ynl234wp polypeptide as a putative heme-binding domain. The remaining NH2- and C-terminal regions (163 and 125 amino acids, respectively) do not show any significant homology to known proteins; nevertheless these regions might represent functionally distinct domains. The overall structural organization of Ynl234wp makes this protein unique among known hemoglobins from vertebrate or nonvertebrate organisms (see Fig. 1). Expression of the YNL234w gene in yeast cells was shown by Northern blot analysis. A weak band of about 1.4 kilobases, which is in agreement with the size of the gene, indicates that theYNL234w gene is expressed at low levels in cells grown under normal aerobic conditions. Transcription of the gene, however, is significantly enhanced in cells grown under hypoxia (Fig.3 A) and under different stress conditions as glucose repression, nitrogen starvation, osmostress, and heat shock (Fig. 3 C and Ref. 30Planta R.J. Brown A.J.P. Cadahia J.L. Cerdan M.E. De Jonge M. Gent M.E. Hayes A. Kolen C. P. A.M. Lombardia L.J. Sefton M. Oliver S.G. Thevelein J. Tournu H. Dvan elft Y.J. Verbart D.J. Winderickx J. Yeast. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These data identifyS. cerevisiae YNL234w as a hypoxic and a stress-responsive gene. Hypoxic gene expression in yeast is regulated by two different systems. The first involves the heme molecule and, in the majority of the cases, the transcriptional regulators Hap1p and Rox1p; the second is heme-independent, but little is known about its mechanism (31Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zitomer R.S. Carrico P. Deckert J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Preliminary results indicate that expression of the YNL234wgene is moderately increased in heme-depleted cells in comparison to wild-type cells (Fig. 3 B). However, as the increase ofYNL234w transcription in the case of the absence of heme is moderate (about 3-fold) in comparison with the one observed in the case of hypoxia (about 20-fold), it is conceivable that regulation ofYNL234w transcription by oxygen is mediated both by the heme molecule and by a heme-independent mechanism. The mechanism of the general stress response in yeast has not been fully elucidated; however, it is known that, in response to diverse stress conditions, two homologous zinc finger proteins, Msn2p/Msn4p, activate gene transcription by binding to the stress response element STRE (33Marchler G. Schüller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 14: 1997-2003Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schüller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F.

The induction of YNL234w transcription by several stress conditions is in agreement with the presence of two STRE sequences at positions −68 (5′-CCCCT) and −182 (5′-AGGGG) from the first ATG codon. Examples of yeast genes whose transcription is controlled both by oxygen and by different stress conditions are the iso-2-cytochromec gene CYC7 (36Pillar T.M. Bradshaw R.E. Curr.

It has recently been shown that Rox3p is a component of the multiprotein complex “mediator,” which is part of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (39Gustafsson C.M. Myers L.C. Li Y. Redd M.J. Lui M.

We believe that a better understanding of the mechanisms that control YNL234w expression, and in particular, of the relationships existing between oxygen starvation and other stress conditions in inducing its transcription could give some interesting insights into the function of this new putative hemoglobin in the yeast cell. The YNL234w gene was deleted in the yeast strain FY1679 using the PCR-based technique described by Wach et al. (21Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) (this work was performed under the Eurofan I Biotech Program 2G. Sartori, G. Mazzotta, S. Stocchetto, A. Pavanello, and G. Carignani, manuscript in preparation.). A preliminary analysis of the disrupted haploid strains was performed by growing them at different temperatures on solid media containing different carbon sources, but no significant phenotypic differences between the wild-type and the mutant strains were observed. The sensitivity of the mutant strains to heat shock treatment was tested by shifting exponentially growing cultures from 25 to 38 °C and then determining the percentage of survivors on YPD plates, but also in this case, a clear difference between the wild-type and the mutant strains was not observed. However, if the role of the YNL234w gene, as suggested by the transcription data, is to mitigate cellular damage in different stress conditions, more accurate analysis seems to be required to highlight a phenotype of the YNL234w-deleted strains. To facilitate the characterization of the Ynl234wp protein, which is normally poorly expressed in yeast, we decided to purify a heterologously expressed protein. A PCR-fragment corresponding to the nucleotide sequence encoding a Ynl234wp polypeptide lacking the 29 C-terminal residues was obtained by amplification of the genomic DNA ofS. cerevisiae strain FY1679. The fragment was cloned in the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible pET-20b(+) E. coli expression vector, upstream of and in-frame with a short plasmidic sequence coding for eight amino acids (DKLAAALE) followed by six residues of histidine (His-tag). Nucleotide sequencing of the cloned fragment confirmed its identity with the wild-type sequence. E. coli cells transformed with this plasmid were grown in liquid culture supplemented with the heme precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid to increase de novo heme synthesis (40Nishimoto M. Clark J.E. Siler Masters B.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 32: 8863-8870Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After induction with isopropylβ-d-thiogalactopyranoside, a prominent protein band of the expected 46 kDa was visible in bacterial extracts. This was purified to near homogeneity by a single-step affinity chromatography utilizing the chelating ligand nitrilotriacetic acid charged with Ni2+ ions. The identity of the 46-kDa band present in the orange-colored fractions with the recombinant Ynl234wp polypeptide was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, which revealed the expected TGEKI sequence. The purified recombinant Ynl234wp protein was analyzed by benzidine heme staining after SDS-PAGE (25Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). This method allows detection of very low levels of heme-associated peroxidase activity. Furthermore, the denaturing conditions of electrophoresis led to a loss of heme from hemoproteins in which the prosthetic group is noncovalently bound and the free heme appears as a diffuse band with a mobility similar to that of the bromphenol blue dye. By this simple method, it is possible to distinguish between hemoproteins with covalently and noncovalently bound heme. Intense staining of Ynl234wp and the presence in the same electrophoretic lane of abundant free heme clearly indicate that this protein does bind heme and that the prosthetic group is noncovalently bound (Fig.4). The absolute visible spectrum of purified recombinant Ynl234wp protein at pH 7.5 is shown in Fig.5 A, trace 1. The spectrum shows the characteristics of a hemoprotein, with an intense Soret band positioned at 411 nm, but the α and β peaks are not well resolved. This profile is not modified by the addition of potassium ferricyanide (data not shown), indicating that the hemoprotein is already in its oxidized form. After the addition of sodium dithionite, the optical spectrum is characterized by a Soret peak shifted to 426 nm, a minor β peak centered at 530 nm, and a major α peak at 559 nm (Fig. 5 A, trace 2). These spectroscopic profiles are characteristic of hemichromes (41Drabkin D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1942; 146: 605-617Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 42Rachmilewitz E.A. Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. J.

Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and suggest that the major part of the protein, probably obtained in the form of high spin met form, has been converted to low spin hemichromes. This hypothesis is confirmed by the CO difference spectrum (Fig. 5 B, trace 3) in which the trough present at the same wavelength of the α peak (559 nm) has the characteristics of low spin heme molecules; however, the intensity of the trough is not as pronounced as those observed for true low spin hemoproteins (43Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that the heme molecule bound to Ynl234wp may be present as a mixture of low and high spin states, as already observed for the heterologously expressed Hb of the unicellular alga Clamydomonas eugametos (44Couture M. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and for the Hb from the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune (45Thorsteinsson M.C. Beva D.R. Ebel R.E. Weber R.E. Potts M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The susceptibility to autoxidation and hemichrome formation varies with different Hbs, and the rates of the two processes are relatively rapid for some Hbs, as is the case of the myoglobin isolated from Paramecium caudatum (46Tsubamoto Y. Matsuoka A. Yusa K. Shikama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The knowledge of the real redox state of the heme molecule bound to Ynl234wp, together with the role played by the two regions flanking the heme-binding domain, will be necessary elements to understand the function of this protein in the yeast cell. The results presented here arouse the interest in this new hemoprotein of S. cerevisiae, whose expression is induced in cells grown under hypoxia and other stresses and that is probably necessary to the cell under these severe conditions. The two regions flanking the heme-binding domain, which have no apparent homologs in the yeast cell, might actually represent new functions or, more likely, be docking domains responsible for the recruitment of proteins whose activation (or inactivation) is necessary to the cell grown under these particular conditions. We thank Jacqueline Verdière for her suggestions and for kindly providing the heme-depleted strain and Luc Moens for making for us an independent alignment of the Ynl234wp central domain, which confirmed the results shown in Fig. 2. We are very grateful to Paolo Ascenzi for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."

The reaction resulted in the formation of a free carbonyl on the N-terminal α-carbon (α-ketoamide) and was catalytic with respect to nickel. This oxidative deamination was confirmed by13C NMR, 1H NMR, mass spectrometry, and chemical tests. No evidence of modification of histidine was found. It was demonstrated that the nickel-dependent N-terminal oxidative deamination also occurred in His-2 peptides using potassium peroxymonosulfate (oxone) as an oxidant. When oxone was used, oxygen was not required for the deamination to proceed. The results suggest that both nickel-catalyzed reactions (sulfite and oxygen, and oxone) produce an imine intermediate that spontaneously hydrolyzes to form the free carbonyl. These findings may provide a physiologically relevant model for oxidative carbonyl formation in vivo, as well as a useful method for producing a site-specific carbonyl on peptides and proteins.

Nickel salts are physiologically redox-inactive, and therefore nickel toxicity in vivo is inferred to involve activation by coordination with peptides and proteins.

They postulate in situ formation of monoperoxysulfate, a strong oxidant, as an active intermediate in the damaging effect. We have recently reported on the identification of a unique Ni(II) binding site on hemoglobin that, in the presence of monoperoxysulfate, produces N-terminal oxidative deamination, as well as intramolecular cross-linking, both specific to the β-globins (15Levine J.

In the present study, we have employed small model peptides in order to verify the structural assignment of oxidative deamination, as well as to identify the minimal sequence requirements for reaction susceptibility. Additionally, we have tested a system that substitutes sulfite (SO32−) and oxygen (O2) for potassium peroxymonosulfate (oxone). 1The abbreviations oxonepotassium peroxymonosulfateAQC6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydoxysuccinimidyl carbamateDNP2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyLC-MSHPLC interfaced directly to mass spectrometry Our findings show clearly that histidine at position 2 is a fundamental requirement for Ni(II)-catalyzed oxidative N-terminal deamination and that sulfite and ambient oxygen can readily substitute for the potent peroxyl oxidant oxone. Furthermore, by contrasting some of the differences between products produced by the sulfite/oxygen and the oxone reactions with Ni(II) peptides, we can exclude the formation of diffusible monoperoxysulfate (HSO5−) as a mediator in SO32−/O2-promoted deamination. potassium peroxymonosulfate 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydoxysuccinimidyl carbamate 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine high performance liquid chromatography HPLC interfaced directly to mass spectrometry Sodium sulfite was purchased from Fluka Biochemika. Ammonium sulfite, potassium peroxymonosulfate (oxone), nickel chloride, butylated hydroxyanisole, tert-butyl alcohol, EDTA, mannitol, ethanol, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium phosphate (as mono- and dibasic salts), and thiourea were from Sigma. The peptides bursin (KHG-amide), carnosine (β-alanyl-histidine), and homocarnosine (γ-amino butyryl-histidine) were purchased from Sigma. KGH-amide was synthesized by SynPep Corp. All other peptides were purchased from Bachem Bioscience Inc. and used without repurification. Unless otherwise noted, reaction mixtures contained 30 mm peptide and 5 mm nickel chloride, to which sodium sulfite was added from a 10× stock to a final concentration of 60 mm, all in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 8.2. 300-μl reactions were maintained at room temperature for 24 h under ambient air in 16 × 100-mm glass test tubes protected from light. Reactions were quenched by addition of 1: 10 (v/v) of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8, and then diluted 1:10 into 2% formic acid in water and placed at 4 °C until analysis by reversed phase chromatography. Initial reaction mixtures contained 30 mm peptide and 30 mmnickel chloride in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.2, to which oxone, also in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.2, was added as a 10× stock to a final concentration of 30 mm. After approximately 5 min at room temperature, the oxone reactions were quenched by the addition of (at 1:10 (v/v)) 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8, and then diluted 1:10 into 2% formic acid in water and placed at 4 °C until analysis by reversed phase chromatography. With time, optimized conditions for the oxone reactions were established. Where noted as optimized oxone conditions, the peptides, NiCl2, and oxone stocks were made up in 0.2 msodium bicarbonate, pH 8.2. Additionally, under optimized conditions, the oxone was added in five equal increments 2 min apart, rather than as a single bolus. Peptides were subjected to gas phase hydrolysis at 165 °C for 1 h in the presence of HCl containing 1% phenol, using a Savant AP100AminoPrep Hydrolyzer. Amino acids were analyzed using precolumn derivatization with AQC as described previously (16Apostol I. Levine J. Lippincott J. Leach J. Hess E. Glascock C.B. Weickert M.J. Blackmore R. J. Biol.

Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed using a Finnigan Mat LCQTM ion trap mass spectrometer interfaced with an HP1090M HPLC. The LCQ™ spectrometer was calibrated as per the manufacturer's recommendations, which provide for a specified accuracy of 0.01% for m/z masses of 100–2000 Da. Peptides were separated at room temperature using a Zorbax 300SB C18 column with a gradient of 1–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water (v/v) in 20 min at 1 ml/min, following an initial 4-min isocratic (1%) hold. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Varian VXR-300S instrument. Peptides were dissolved in either deuterium oxide or deutero-Me2SO. Chemical shifts are reported relative to DSS for deuterium oxide samples or tetramethylsilane for deutero-Me2SO samples. 1H chemical shift versus pH studies were performed using a D2O-phosphate system. No corrections of pH measurement for D2O content were made. Reaction of the tripeptide Ala-His-Ala with Ni(II) and oxone under initial standard conditions resulted in >60% modification of the peptide. The modified peptide eluted as a broad, asymmetric peak several minutes later than the parent peptide peak when analyzed by reversed phase C18 HPLC (Fig.1, A and B). The modified peptide displayed significantly increased absorption at 245 nm. Also, the modified peptide displayed a mass of 296.1 Da when analyzed by in-line mass spectrometry. This represents a discrete loss of 1 Da when compared with the parent peptide (296.1 versus297.1 Da for the parent peptide). MS2 fragmentation mapped the 1-Da loss to the A2, B2, and B3fragment ions (Fig. 2, A andB). Y-type ions were not detected in either case. The ion ofm/z 227, which can be attributed to Y2structure, was instead assigned to loss of the C-terminal Ala residue from the AHA tripeptide (17Thorne G.C. Ballard K.D. Gaskell S.J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 1: 249-257Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ion fragment assignments were confirmed by MS3. A significant recovery of the histidine immonium fragment ion was observed (of m/z 110), which further indicated that the histidine residue was unaffected. These findings all suggested that the 1-Da mass loss was located on the the N-terminal alanine, and the histidine residue remained unchanged.Figure 2MS2 fragmentation spectra.

Annotation of fragment ions refers to parent peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The modified peptide was blocked to Edman protein sequencing, suggesting that a chemical modification had occurred at the N terminus. This finding was corroborated by a lack of reactivity with AQC reagent, which was used to probe for the presence of primary or secondary amines. Amino acid analysis of the modified peptide showed approximately one-half of the yield of alanine relative to histidine that was observed for the parent peptide. Also in contrast to the parent peptide peak, the modified peptide peak reacted quantitatively with DNP, yielding a derivatized peptide with 400 nm absorbance and mass of 476.1 Da (Fig. 3). This represents a mass gain of 180 Da, which is characteristic of a dinitrophenylhydrazone product and therefore indicative of the presence of a free carbonyl on the modified peptide. The presence of a free carbonyl, the apparent loss of free amino group reactivity, and the 1-Da mass decrease all indicated that the modified peptide was oxidatively deaminated at the N terminus, thus resulting in an α-ketoamide peptide (Reaction FRI).Figure FRIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 1H and 13C NMR analyses of the modified peptide peak were used to further verify this structural assignment. The 1H spectrum of the (putative) oxidatively deaminated peptide displayed a shift of the N-terminal alanine methyl group downfield from 1.23 to 2.32 ppm along with a resonance splitting change from a doublet to a singlet, consistent with formation of a ketone at the α-carbon of Ala-1 (Table I). The C-1 vinyl proton of the histidine imidazole ring was observed to be significantly deshielded relative to the parent peptide. However, an additional study that examined the effect of pH versus 1H chemical shift of the histidine C-2 vinyl proton demonstrated no significant change in pK a of the imidazole group following Ni(II)/oxone oxidation, yielding further evidence that the histidine side chain was not modified in the reaction (Fig. 4). 13C NMR also indicated the presence of an intact histidine imidazole ring, two amide carbons, one carboxylic acid carbon, and a downfield ketone carbonyl resonance at 196 ppm, all in agreement with oxidative deamination (Table II).Table I1H NMR results1H NMR of parent AHA in Me2SO1.22 ppm (3H, d, J = 7.32 Hz); 1.23 ppm (3H, d, J = 6.84 Hz); 2.94 ppm (2H, d, J = 5.86 Hz); 3.61 ppm (1H, q,J = 6.84 Hz); 4.00 ppm (1H, dq, J = 7.32, 7.08 Hz); 4.44 ppm (1H, dt, J = 7.81, 5.86 Hz); 6.75 ppm (1H, s); 7.54 ppm (1H, s); 8.16 ppm (1H, d, J = 7.08 Hz); 8.43 ppm (1H, d, J = 7.81 Hz).1H NMR of oxidized AHA (Ni) in Me2SO (α-ketoamide)1.29 ppm (3H, d,J = 7.33 Hz); 2.32 ppm (3H, s); 3.06 ppm (1H, dd,J = 15.14, 8.79 Hz); 3.21 ppm (1H, dd, J = 15.38, 4.88 Hz); 7.33 ppm (1H, s); 4.59 ppm (1H, dt, J = 8.79, 8.55 Hz); 7.33 ppm (1H, s); 8.39 ppm (1H, d, J = 7.08 Hz); 8.57 ppm (1H, d, J = 8.79 Hz); 8.96 ppm (1H, s).1H NMR of oxidized AHA (no Ni) in Me2SO (oxime)1.30 ppm (3H, d, J = 7.33 Hz); 1.85 ppm (3H, s); 3.07 ppm (1H, dd, J = 7.94, 15.75 Hz); 3.17 ppm (1H, dd,J = 5.25, 15.26 Hz); 4.23 ppm (1H, dq, J = 7.08, 7.32 Hz); 4.71 ppm (1H, m); 7.31 ppm (1H, s); 7.83 ppm (1H, d,J = 8.30 Hz); 8.49 ppm (1H, d, J = 7.08 Hz); 8.95 ppm (1H, s); 11.86 ppm (1H, s).1H NMR of oxidized and reduced AHA (6.8 min) in Me2SO (α-hydroxyamide)8.98 ppm (1H, s); 8.37 ppm (1H, d, J = 8.78 Hz); 7.83 ppm (1H, d,J = 9.03 Hz); 7.34 ppm (1H, s); 4.66 ppm (1H, dt,J = 4.88, 8.78 Hz); 4.23 ppm (1H, m); 3.95 ppm (1H, q,J = 6.84 Hz); 3.15 ppm (1H, dd, J = 15.26, 4.88 Hz); 2.98 ppm (1H, dd, J = 15.14, 8.79 Hz); 1.30 ppm (3H, d,J = 7.33 Hz); 1.10 ppm (3H, d, J = 6.84 Hz).1H NMR of oxidized and reduced AHA (7.3 min) in Me2SO (α-hydroxyamide)8.98 ppm (1H, s); 8.41 ppm (1H, d,J = 7.33 Hz); 7.83 ppm (1H, d, J = 8.79 Hz); 7.34 ppm (1H, s); 4.63 ppm (1H, m); 4.22 ppm (1H, m); 3.99 ppm (1H, q,J = 6.71 Hz); 3.13 ppm (1H, dd, J = 15.14, 5.37 Hz); 3.01 (1H, dd, J = 14.77, 7.81 Hz); 1.30 ppm (3H, d,J = 7.33 Hz); 1.16 ppm (3H, d, J = 6.71 Hz).

Open table in a new tab Sodium cyanoborohydride treatment of the modified peptide peak yielded quantitative reduction of the Ni(II)/oxone-oxidized AHA peptide, resulting in a species that eluted earlier in the reversed phase gradient as a doublet of two apparent diastereomers, both exhibiting mass gains of 2 Da (Fig. 1 C). These peaks were structurally assigned as diastereomeric alcohols derived from reduction of the α-keto carbonyl. MS2 fragmentation (Fig. 2 C), as well as 1H NMR analysis of these peaks, confirmed this assignment. AQC derivatization of the AHA deamination reaction mixture analyzed by LC-MS yielded evidence of free ammonia released in the reaction. The amount detected was commensurate with the amount of peptide oxidatively modified, showing that deamination was concomitant with the proportional release of free ammonia. The same oxone reaction on the AHA tripeptide in the absence of added Ni(II) was tested. It was found that when Ni(II) was left out of the reaction, under otherwise identical conditions, about 50% of the peptide was modified. The modified species exhibited an increased absorbance at 250 nm and eluted during the reversed phase HPLC gradient as a sharp, symmetrical peak later than either the parent peptide or the oxidatively deaminated species (Fig. 1 D). LC-MS analysis of this peak showed a mass gain of 14 Da over the parent peptide mass (311.1 versus 297.1 Da for the parent). This modified peak was found to be blocked to Edman chemistry sequencing, suggesting that a chemical modification had occurred at the N terminus. In contrast to the oxidatively deaminated AHA peptide peak, this modified peptide peak was unreactive with DNP, suggesting the absence of any free carbonyl group. MS2 ion trap fragmentation mapped the 14-Da gain to the A2, B2, and B3 fragment ions (Fig. 2 D). From these findings, we postulated that this modification was likely the result of chemical oxidation of the terminal amine nitrogen to an oxime (18March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). 1H proton NMR analysis confirmed this assignment. The N-terminal methyl resonance was shifted downfield from 1.23 to 1.85 ppm and resonated as a singlet. Also observed was the appearance of a single, sharp resonance far downfield at 11.86 ppm, which is consistent with an oxime proton. Muller et al. (13Muller J.G. Hickerson R.P. Perez R.J. Burrows C.J.

Commun. 1989; 159: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we decided to test for indications of peroxymonosulfate formation from sulfite autooxidation on a peptide with histidine at position 2. The tripeptide Ala-His-Ala was incubated with sodium sulfite in the presence of nickel under the standard conditions described above. This treatment was observed to produce modification of >60% of the peptide. The modified species displayed the same elution time, 1-Da mass loss, and MS2 fragmentation pattern by LC-MS analysis as the oxidatively deaminated α-ketoamide species produced using oxone. Additional chemical tests, including Edman sequencing, DNP, and AQC reactivity, as described above for the modified product of AHA using Ni(II) and oxone (excepting proton NMR analysis), confirmed that an identical oxidatively deaminated AHA peptide was produced using Ni(II), sulfite, and ambient oxygen. The sulfite reaction with AHA in the absence of added nickel was tested. It was found that in contrast to the oxone reaction, no oxime formation was observed. In fact, when nickel was omitted from the reaction of the AHA tripeptide with sulfite, no detectable modification of any kind was observed. We have previously postulated that histidine at position 2 is an essential part of an oxidatively reactive Ni(II) binding site on the β-chain of human hemoglobin (15Levine J. Weickert M. Pagratis M. Etter J. Mathews A. Fattor T. Lippincott J. Apostol I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13037-13046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a comparison with the AHA peptide, we examined the reactivity of the tripeptide AAA. Reaction of the AAA tripeptide with Ni(II) and oxone under standard conditions also resulted in >60% modification of the peptide. This modified peptide eluted primarily as a sharp, symmetrical peak several minutes later than the unmodified parent peptide peak when analyzed by reversed phase C18 HPLC (Fig. 5, A andB). The modified peptide displayed increased absorption at 250 nm and a discrete mass gain of 14 Da when analyzed by LC-MS compared with the parent peptide (245.1 versus 231.1 Da for the parent peptide.) This species was found to be blocked to Edman sequencing. MS2 fragmentation also indicated that the modification was located on the N-terminal amino acid. Based on these findings, we concluded that this modification was an oxime on the N-terminal nitrogen. When nickel was omitted from the oxone reaction with the Ala-Ala-Ala tripeptide, an identical product was observed (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, oxime formation appears to be entirely non-nickel-dependent. Reaction of the tripeptide Ala-Ala-Ala with Ni(II) and sodium sulfite under standard (SO32−) conditions produced no detectable modification of any kind. This finding suggests that in the case of the Ala-Ala-Ala tripeptide, no peroxymonosulfate-like species is generated by that peptide in the presence of Ni(II), SO32−, and ambient oxygen. Histidine at position 2 therefore appears to be required for both susceptibility to oxidative deamination, as well as the apparent ability to generate a peroxymonosulfate-like species from sulfite and oxygen. To further delineate sequence effects and requirements for susceptibility to oxidative deamination, we studied reactions of Ni(II) and a series of small peptides with either SO32−/O2 or oxone as the oxidant. We examined the reactions for any evidence of modification of the parent peptide. The results of these experiments are shown in TableIII.Table IIIAmino acid sequence effects on oxidative modificationsPeptide(s)Primary productNi/SO32−/O2Ni/oxoneAAANo reactionN-terminal oximeAHAOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationAHKOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationEHGOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationGHOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationGHGOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationGGHNo deamin./other modif.Decarboxylation/degradationKGHaC-terminal amide.No deamin./other modif.DegradationKHGaC-terminal amide.Deamination leading to intramolecular Schiff's baseDeamination leading to intramolecular Schiff's baseCarnosineNo reactionTrace of oximeHomocarnosineNo reactionTrace of oximeHLNo reactionN-terminal oximeIHOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationLH, LHLOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationLH + AAALH, oxidative deamination; AAA, no reactionLH, oxidative deamination; AAA, N-terminal oximeLL, LLLNo reactionN-terminal oximeMHMethionine sulfoxideMethionine sulfoxide and oxidative deaminationMLMethionine sulfoxideMethionine sulfoxidePHACyclic imineCyclic imineVHOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationVHLTPOxidative deaminationOxidative deaminationVLNo reactionN-terminal oximeYHNo oxidative deamination, sulfo-peptide formationTrace of oxidative deamination/degradationa C-terminal amide. Open table in a new tab Almost all of the peptides with histidine at position 2 demonstrated significant susceptibility to oxidative deamination under both sets of conditions, whereas none of the peptides lacking histidine at position 2 demonstrated any oxidative deamination under either condition. It should be noted that in the cases of both AHA and GHG, a significant amount of the deaminated product from reaction at 30 mmpeptide was found to be in the form of apparently diastereomeric pairs of relatively stable dimers (exhibiting a mass of 592 Da in the case of AHA peptide). These dimers were not observed when the SO32−/O2 reaction was performed at a peptide concentration of 3 mm, indicating that their formation was (peptide) concentration-dependent. Further characterization of the dimer by 1H NMR indicated it to be a product of aldol condensation of two molecules of α-ketoamide (data not shown). These dimers were not observed when oxone was used as the oxidant. Unlike Ala-His, the dipeptides carnosine (β-alanyl-histidine) and homocarnosine (γ-amino butyryl-histidine) were found to be nonreactive to Ni(II)/SO32−/O2-promoted deamination. These results suggest that only α-amines are susceptible to this pathway of deamination. Interestingly, these peptides showed very little oxime formation in the reaction with oxone. Peptides with proline as the first residue also produced noticeably different results. N-terminal proline, being a secondary amine, is not likely to be as susceptible to the oxidative release of ammonia as other amino acids. No released ammonia in either reaction with PHA was detected, and in both cases, a modified peptide that was formed demonstrated a loss of 2 Da (321 versus 323 Da for the parent peptide). The modified peptide was unreactive with AQC, indicating that the secondary amine was no longer present. This result would be consistent with formation of a cyclic imine species that was stable against spontaneous hydrolysis. Peptides GGH and KGH-amide with a histidine residue in position 3 were also tested. Under similar conditions, these peptides have been shown by Muller et al. (13Muller J.G. Hickerson R.P. Perez R.J. Burrows C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1501-1506Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and others (12Brown K.C. Yu Z. Burlingame A.L. Craik C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4397-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Liang Q. Ananias D.C. Long E.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 248-257Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Gill G. Richter-Rusli A.A. Ghosh M. Burrows C. Rokita S.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to produce radicals capable of causing DNA damage and protein cross-linking. No deamination of either the GGH or the KGH-amide peptides were detected in reactions with Ni(II)/SO32−/O2. The KGH-amide peptide was modified in the reaction to an earlier eluting product exhibiting a mass gain of 80 Da, consistent with the displacement of one proton by an SO3H group. This product was not further characterized. In the reactions with oxone, decarboxylation of GGH and other peptide degradation of both peptides were observed, none of which appeared to include deamination. By contrast, the tripeptide KHG-amide (bursin) appeared to readily N-terminally deaminate with both Ni(II)/SO32−/O2 and Ni(II)/oxone. However, the ketoamide product appeared to spontaneously form an intramolecular Schiff's base with the ε-amine of the lysyl side chain (Reaction FRII). This was confirmed by LC-MS, Edman sequencing, and reaction with DNP. Under these conditions, no evidence of ε-amino side chain deamination was found. Peptides with methionine and tyrosine as the N-terminal residues also appeared to present exceptions to susceptibility to oxidative deamination. The lack of reactivity of MH using sulfite is possibly due to sulfoxide formation acting as a “sink” for oxidative modification, although no substantial difference in the amount of methionine sulfoxide formed was seen relative to ML with either oxidant (20Schoneich C. Zhao F. Wilson G.S. Borchardt R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1158: 307-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that other chemical and electronic properties of the sulfur atom of the methionine side chain could affect the reaction pathway. The lack of deamination of the dipeptide YH is less clear. Stable tyrosine radicals have been reported in proteins (22Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 23Dean R.T. Fu S. Stocker R. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). However, no evidence of dityrosine, a known product of oxidative degradation of tyrosine involved in protein cross-linking, was detected (12Brown K.C. Yu Z. Burlingame A.L. Craik C.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4397-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and no evidence of tyrosine radical was found by EPR or found to be trappable by the method of Fenwick and English (24Fenwick C.W. English A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12236-12237Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, with an increased excess of sulfite, we noticed significant accumulation of a product of the YH reaction, which exhibited a mass of 354 Da (gain of 36 Da). Under standard conditions, except using 4:1 ratio of sulfite over peptide, the reaction resulted in a 30% yield of this modification. Mass gain, MS2 fragmentation, and Edman protein sequencing were all consistent with C-terminal decarboxylation followed by the attachment of the SO3H group forming a sulfo-peptide (Reaction FRIII). We believe that such a product would most likely be formed through a radical type of reaction, potentially promoted by the tyrosine side chain (25Davies M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Analogous products were detectable with other first residue side chains in dipeptides containing His-2, but with yields at least 1 order of magnitude lower. The YH sulfo-peptide product was not observed when Ni(II) was omitted from the reaction. The Ni(II)/oxone reaction with YH produced a small but detectable yield of oxidative deamination. Additionally, a significant amount of other uncharacterized degradation occurred including formation of a yellow precipitate. In all cases, oxone produced a significant yield of oxime in peptides lacking histidine at position 2. This finding provided us with a means to look for evidence of the generation of a diffusible peroxymonosulfate species from peptide/Ni(II) reactions with sulfite. This could be tested by including the AAA tripeptide in reactions with His-2-containing peptides and monitoring for oxime formation. These conditions resulted in substantial deamination of the susceptible peptides, as was seen with oxone addition. No trace of oxime formation was detectable on the AAA tripeptide when it was combined with the LH dipeptide during standard Ni(II)/SO32−/O2 conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the oxidative deamination reaction did not generate any appreciable quantities of diffusible peroxymonosulfate. However, in the case of all His-2 peptides, anin situ formation of a peroxymonosulfate-like species, which is either constrained from diffusing or consumed in a subsequent reaction too quickly to do so, is plausible. A nickel titration study of the SO32−/O2 reaction was conducted using the dipeptide LH under standard conditions. The results showed that in the absence of nickel, no oxidative deamination occurred. At a Ni(II) to peptide ratio of 1:10, about 40% of the parent peptide was deaminated (i.e. 4 equivalents of deaminated peptide per 1 equivalent of Ni(II)), indicating a catalytic turnover of 4. Using a 1:10 ratio of nickel, and 4 equivalents of sulfite, the catalytic turnover of Ni(II) increased to about 8.5. Increasing the Ni(II)/peptide ratio above 1:5 did not have a significant effect on the yield of deamination (Fig.6). Therefore, a 1:5 ratio of Ni(II):peptide was selected as an optimal for the standard deamination reaction with sulfite. A similar Ni(II) titration study using the LH dipeptide was conducted with oxone. In contrast to the SO32−/O2 system, under initial conditions, maximal oxidative deamination required nearly 1:1 Ni(II):peptide when oxone was used. However, under optimized conditions for the oxone reaction, the oxone was added to the reaction in five equal increments, rather than as a single bolus. In this case, 30% deamination was achieved using approximately 1:5 Ni:peptide (catalytic turnover of 1.5), suggesting that redox cycling of Ni(II) can be achieved in the oxone reaction as well (Fig. 6). Chromatograms of this “optimized” oxone reaction, along with a standard condition sulfite reaction, both with the LH dipeptide at 1:5 Ni(II):peptide, are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from these that the sulfite reaction results in significantly decreased degradative side products compared with oxone. It appeared that when nickel was limiting, oxime formation was a potentially competing side reaction. We therefore purified the LH oxime species and re-reacted it with Ni(II) and oxone under standard conditions. No evidence of oxidative deamination was observed, although significant heterogeneous, uncharacterized peptide degradation occurred. This finding suggested that oxime formation may be a competitive and kinetically relevant “dead-end” side reaction when Ni(II) is limited during reaction with oxone. Studies were conducted to examine the kinetics of oxidative deamination of the LH dipeptide comparing the use of either SO32−/O2 or oxone (with sequential addition) as oxidants (Fig.8). As can be seen, the oxidative deamination using oxone as the oxidant was completed within (at most) several minutes of initiation. By contrast, the reaction using SO32− and ambient oxygen displayed a distinctly lower initial rate of deamination, which appeared to be relatively constant during the first 40 min of reaction. No further increase in deamination was observed beyond 6 h (up to 1 week). When this reaction was repeated under an oxygen-enriched head space (>95% O2 at approximately 2 atm), no difference in the rate of peptide modification was observed. This finding suggested that oxygen diffusion is not rate-limiting under the standard conditions with sulfite. However, when oxygen was strictly excluded from the sulfite reaction (under argon), no peptide modification was observed. By contrast, exclusion of oxygen from the oxone reaction did not inhibit oxidative deamination. Further studies were conducted to examine the effect of the addition of various compounds on the yields of oxidative modification in the LH/Ni(II) reactions using either sulfite or oxone. These additives included known chelating agents, radical scavengers, and different anions. The results of these experiments tabulated as percentage of inhibition of LH deamination under the respective standard conditions are listed in Table IV.Table IVInhibition of oxidative deamination of LH dipeptide by additivesReaction conditionsInhibitionNi/SO32−/O2Ni/oxone%30 mm EDTA10010030 mm ethanol0030 mmmethanol0030 mm t-butyl alcohol0<530 mm BHAa181630 mm thiourea>95100100 mmmannitol001 mg/ml catalase<5<5100 mm HCO3− (Na+)65015 mm CN− (K+)959510 mm DMPO5112BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide. Open table in a new tab BHA, butylated hydroxyanisole; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide. The lack of inhibition observed in the presence of ethanol, methanol,tert-butyl alcohol, or mannitol argues strongly against the involvement of diffusible SO·̄4 or OH⋅ radicals mediating the oxidative deamination in either reaction (2Neta P. Huie R.E. Environ. Health Perspect. 1985; 64: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Mottley C. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The inability of catalase to inhibit either reaction suggests that it is unlikely that oxidative deamination in either case proceeds through formation of diffusible H2O2 followed by a Fenton-type reaction, as in a mechanistic scenario for oxidative protein carbonyl formation proposed by Stadtman (27Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). However, no test was conducted to determine whether this enzyme was inactivated by the reaction conditions, as has been reported for sulfite inactivation of several copper-dependent monooxygenases (28Merkler D.J. Kulathila R. Francisco W.A. Ash D.E. Bell J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The complete inhibition of oxidative deamination by the metal chelating agent EDTA would suggest that sequestration of nickel away from the peptide is the mode of action by which it precludes the reactions. The mechanism for inhibition exhibited by thiourea is less clear, but the differential effects of CN− and HCO3−on reactions using SO32−/O2 versus using HSO5− begins to suggest that these may act by perturbing the coordination structure of the reactive nickel complexes (29Shiemke A.K. Kaplan W.A. Hamilton C.L. Shelnutt J.A. Scott R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7276-7284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such differential effects also begin to suggest that the reactive complex that produces an actively oxidizing species from SO32− may differ from the one involved in the reaction with preformed HSO5− (oxone). Titration studies under standard conditions using oxone as the oxidant showed that approximately 1:1 oxone:peptide was sufficient to approach maximal deamination of the LH dipeptide (Fig. 9). It was also observed that ≥2:1 oxone:peptide resulted in significant, heterogeneous, uncharacterized degradation of the peptide (much worse than the 1:1 shown in Fig. 7). By contrast, titration with SO32− under standard conditions reproducibly showed that significantly more than 1 equivalent of SO32− to peptide was required to approach maximal deamination. With 3 equivalents of sulfite, more than 60% of the peptide was oxidatively deaminated, with less than 20% of degradative side-products observed. Reactions with the LH dipeptide/Ni(II) system using oxone or sulfite/O2were examined for effects of reaction pH, the results of which are shown in Fig. 10. Although the oxone reaction showed inhibition below pH 6.5, both reactions displayed a high relative yield of oxidative deamination over the physiologically relevant pH range of 6.5–8.5. This finding lends support to the possibility that this model system for oxidative peptide modification may be relevant to mechanisms of nickel and sulfite toxicities in vivo (1Athar M. Hasan S.K. Srivastava R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Reed G.A. Curtis J.F. Mottley C. Eling T.E. Mason R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7499-7502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have shown that the reaction of peptides containing histidine at position 2 with Ni(II) and oxone produces oxidative deamination of the peptides with a minimum of other significant modifications of the peptide, and we found no evidence of modification of the histidine residue (up to 1 equivalent of oxone, above which other degradative modifications occur). When Ni(II) was omitted from the reaction, oxime formation on the N-terminal nitrogen was produced instead. In peptides lacking histidine at position 2, only oxime formation was observed, regardless of whether Ni(II) was present or not."

Furthermore, after proteolytic cleavage of the subunit proteins cross-linked with radiolabeled nascent RNA chains at the 3′ termini, we proceeded to locate the contact sites of the growing RNA 3′-ends on the primary sequences of the two large subunits of S. pombe RNA polymerase II. RNA polymerase II was purified from S. pombe by either the standard procedure in this laboratory (24Azuma Y. Yamagishi M. Ishihama A.

Mixtures of complementary oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 were heated for 2 min at 95 °C, incubated for 10 min at 65 °C, and then allowed to attain ambient temperature for annealing. Annealed full-length duplexes were separated from shorter, incomplete chains and unannealed oligonucleotides by non-denaturing 20% PAGE 1The abbreviations PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDTTdithiothreitol and recovered from gel slices by diffusion in 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2). The duplexes were concentrated by repeated extraction withn-butanol, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in water. DNA concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis dithiothreitol SOCl2 (1 ml) was added dropwise to 5-ml methanol solutions of γ-aminobutyric acid, ε-aminocaproic acid, or ω-aminocaprylic acid (2 mmol each), which are the precursors of analogues 2, 3, and 4, respectively (see Fig. 1). Methyl ethers of the corresponding acids thus obtained were evaporatedin vacuo, dissolved in the mixture of acetonitrile (5 ml) and triethylamine (1 ml), and treated overnight withN-hydroxysuccinimide ether ofp-azidotetrafluorobenzoic acid (334 mg, 1 mmol) which was prepared according to the published procedure (25Kaena J.F.W. Cai S.X. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3640-3647Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The products were separated by flash chromatography on SiO2(hexane:chloroform:methanol, 5:5:1). The compounds obtained were dissolved in methanol (4 ml) and treated with NaOH (1 ml of 10m solution) for 2.5 days. The reaction mixtures were acidified by adding 2 n HCl to pH below 1 and extracted three times with equal volumes of chloroform. The chloroform solutions were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated. The derivatives of p-azidotetrafluorobenzoic acid with the attached residues of linear amino acids obtained were converted intoN-hydroxysuccinimide ethers. Compounds were dissolved in 6.5 ml of dry CH2Cl2 and treated with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (206 mg, 1 mmol) andN-hydroxysuccinimide (115 mg, 1 mmol) overnight. The products were purified by chromatography on silica gel (hexane:chloroform:methanol, 5:5:1). Fractions containing the product were pooled and evaporated in vacuo. 5-(Aminopropenyl-1)uridine-5′-triphosphate was synthesized as described (26Langer P.R. Waldrop A.A. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6633-6637Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The photoreactive derivatives were obtained by overnight treatment of this compound with an excess amount ofN-hydroxysuccinimide ethers ofp-azidotetrafluorobenzoic acid derivatives described above in a solvent of dimethylformamide:water (3:1) mixture in the presence of triethylamine added as a catalyst. The products were subjected to chromatography on DEAE-cellulose DE52 (250 × 10 mm) and eluted with a 0–0.3 m linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.0). The final step of purification was achieved by reverse phase chromatography (Lichroprep RP-18, 250–10 mm) with a 0–50% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05 mtriethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.0). The products were evaporated, dissolved in the minimum volume of water, and precipitated with 2% LiClO4 in acetone. [α-32P]CTP and [α-32P]GTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNasin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, subtilisin, and papain were products of Takara (Japan), Sigma, Boehringer Mannheim (Germany), and Sigma, respectively. Benzonase and RNase T1 were from Sigma and TCN Biomedicals, respectively. γ-Aminobutyric acid, ε-aminocaproic acid, and ω-aminocaprylic acid were products of Sigma. All other chemicals used in this work were commercially available products of the highest quality. Transcription assay was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mm (NH4)2SO4, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm DTT, 5 mm spermidine, 2 μm template I or II, 0.4 mm each of ATP, CTP, UTP or UTP analogues, 0.05 mm GTP, 0.15 μCi/μl [α-32P]GTP, 2 units/μl RNasin, and 0.04 μg/μl RNA polymerase II. After the reaction, an equal volume of 2× formamide loading buffer (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was added followed by heat treatment for 2 min at 95 °C. RNA products were analyzed on 13.5% PAGE in the presence of 6 murea. RNA polymerase II (3 μg) was incubated for 4 min at 37 °C in 40-μl reaction mixtures containing 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mm(NH4)2SO4, 6 mmMgCl2, 0.15 mm DTT, 5 mmspermidine, 0.4 mm ATP, 0.4 mm one of the photoreactive UTP derivatives, 0.4 mm GTP, and 6 μm template I or II. The transcription mixture was then UV-irradiated at 100 μJ/cm2/s for 1 min with Funa UV Linker (λ = 256 nm). After the addition of 1 μl of [α-32P]CTP (10 μCi/μl, final concentration 0.25 μCi/μl), the incubation was continued for 15 min at 37 °C, and then 10 μl of 10% SDS and 2.6 μl of 1 m DTT were added to make final concentrations of 2% and 60 mm, respectively. The mixtures were heated 6 min at 95 °C and immediately cooled on ice. The reaction products were treated with a mixture of nucleases (benzonase, 1.5 u/μl; RNase A, 0.02 mg/ml; and RNase T1, 7.5 u/μl) for 3 h at 37 °C to hydrolyze RNA. After addition of 56 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (22Riva M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Grachev M.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16498-16503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mixtures were heated for 3 min at 100 °C and analyzed on SDS-7.5% PAGE. Gel pieces containing radioactive RNA polymerase II subunits were excised and subjected to peptide mapping by limited proteolysis essentially according to the procedure of Cleveland (28, and see Ref. 21Asano Y. Mizumoto K. Maruyama T. Ishihama A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gel pieces containing labeled subunits were soaked for at least 1 h in the equilibration buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 42.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Each gel slice was put on the bottom of a sample well of SDS-15% PAGE, and then the overlay buffer (0.125m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.1% SDS, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 42.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was added. Finally, 20 μl of a freshly diluted protease solution in the equilibration buffer was overlaid. Electrophoresis for sample stacking was performed at low voltage (1.5–2 V/cm) during the first several hours and then at 15 V/cm for sample separation. Proteolysis took place during the initial period when the labeled subunits and proteases remain in 4.5% stacking gel. The duration of the proteolytic cleavage was 4 h for S. aureus V8 protease, 2.5 h for papain, and 3 h for subtilisin. After electrophoresis, the peptides generated were transferred onto ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems), and the membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Electroblotting was fulfilled at a constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2 at room temperature overnight using a semi-dry blotting system. The peptide bands were excised and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing with a protein sequencer (model 491, Applied Biosystems). To map the catalytic site of RNA polymerization in S. pombe RNA polymerase II, photoreactive nucleotide analogues were added only to the 3′ termini of growing RNA chains, and then transcription elongation complexes containing such transcripts were exposed to UV light for cross-linking. In this study, we used four types of photoreactive base-substituted analogues of UTP with spacers of different lengths (1.5–3 nm) connecting the base and the photoreactive arylazido group (Fig. 1 A). The synthesis of these nucleotide analogues was fulfilled starting from 5-(aminopropenyl-1) uridine-5′-triphosphate (26Langer P.R. Waldrop A.A. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6633-6637Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). This compound was allowed to react with excess amounts of four differentN-hydroxysuccinimide ethers ofp-azidotetrafluorobenzoic acid, each containing an aliphatic chain (X) of different length. Reactions proceeded quantitatively in the presence of triethylamine as a catalyst and dimethylformamide:water (3:1) as a solvent. The products were purified by ion-exchange and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by NMR spectra (data not shown). The substances have several characteristic features. First, the photoreactive groups are attached at position C-5 of uracil which is not involved in hydrogen bonding with adenine. The substitution may not give significant effects in the conformation of ribose moiety, and therefore the modified UTP derivatives may function as substrates in RNA synthesis. Second, upon exposure to UV irradiation, thep-azidotetrafluorobenzoyl group is able to generate the highly active intermediate particle, singlet nitrene, which can react with any molecules in surroundings. The generation of singlet nitrene proceeds very rapidly, and full decomposition of the photoreactive groups takes place within only 1 min upon exposure at 256 nm at an energy 100 μJ/cm2/s. Probably aromatic nitrenes will be rearranged to form inactive 7-atomic ring. The substitution of all protons in benzene ring by fluorine atoms allows the avoidance of this undesirable side reaction. Third, since the efficiency of affinity labeling often depends on the structure of nucleotide analogues, the use of spacers (X) with different lengths allows us to choose the best compound characteristic of the enzyme to be cross-linked. In order to incorporate photoreactive UTP analogues only at 3′-ends of transcripts, we constructed two kinds of 40-base pair-long DNA duplexes that consist of two segments, 3′-proximal segment with a sequence of TC mixtures and 5′-proximal segment of G clusters, both being connected by a single A residue (Fig.2; for detailed sequences see “Materials and Methods”). The two single A templates carried essentially the same sequence except that one containing A in the middle (I) and the other near the 3′-end (II). For use as templates for transcription in vitro, an extra sequence of 10 C residues was attached to the 3′-ends of the template strands. On such templates, transcription is preferentially initiated within the single-stranded protruded region (29Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 3–5 residues upstream from the junction between single-stranded and double-stranded regions (30Gnatt A. Fu J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30799-30805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, transcripts should carry heterogeneity in the number of 5′-terminal G residues arising from the initiation at variable positions on the single-stranded C tail. Since both templates contain a single A residue, UTP should be incorporated only at this unique site. In both templates, this unique A is followed by three G residues that are absent in the upstream regions. Thus, in the absence of CTP, transcription should be stalled after the incorporation of UMP or UMP analogues. To test the above possibilities, RNA synthesis was carried out using the template I and in the presence of ATP, UTP, and [α-32P]GTP. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of transcripts indicated that in the absence of CTP, transcription complexes become stalled after UMP incorporation, resulting in the formation of transcripts (RNAST) of 25–30 nucleotides in length (Fig. 1 B, −CTP lane), whereas in the presence of CTP, template-sized read-through transcripts (RNART) were synthesized (Fig. 1 B, +CTP lane). When UTP analogues were used in place of UTP, RNA synthesis was also stalled, forming stalled transcripts with apparently the same sizes as the transcripts observed with UTP (Fig. 1 B, +UTP analogue lanes). To confirm the incorporation of UTP analogues into the RNA products, the single nucleotide addition experiment was performed (Fig.1 C), in which RNA synthesis was carried out in the presence of ATP and [α-32P]GTP (without UTP) to form the stalled complexes, and then UTP or UTP analogues were added to allow the addition of a single U residue. The incorporation of nucleotide derivatives bearing arylazido groups into RNA significantly decreases the mobility in gel electrophoresis (31Safronov I.V. Scherbik N.V. Khodyreva S.N. Wlassoff W.A Dobrikov M.I. Shishkin G.V. Lavrik O.I. Russian J. Bioorg. Chem. 1997; 23: 531-539Google Scholar). We then analyzed RNA products under improved conditions of gel electrophoresis. In fact, we could distinguish RNA products with regular UMP and UMP analogues based on the difference in the mobility on PAGE (Fig. 1 C; thearrow indicates RNAs with modified UTP analogues). The efficiency of UTP analogue incorporation was higher for analogues 1 and 4 (the difference in the incorporation of UTP analogues is discussed below). For efficient cross-linking of 3′ growing ends of nascent RNA molecules to RNA polymerase II, transcription of the test template I was carried out in the presence of three nucleotides, ATP, [α-32P]GTP, and photoreactive UTP analogues. After addition of CTP, however, not all the stalled transcripts were elongated to the template-sized read-through transcripts (data not shown), indicating that portions of the stalled complexes tend to isomerize into dead-end complexes that are inactive in restart of RNA synthesis after CTP is added. In order to achieve specific cross-linking of RNA within the catalytically active elongation complexes, the first-step RNA synthesis was carried out in the presence of ATP, GTP, and photoreactive UTP derivatives, and the stalled complexes thus formed were exposed to UV light. Transcription was then continued by adding [α-32P]CTP. Restart of RNA synthesis by the catalytically active transcription complexes could be detected by measuring the incorporation of radioactive CMP into stalled RNA chains. By using this approach of catalytically competent labeling technique, we carried out the cross-linking of nascent RNA chains to RNA polymerase II and analyzed the cross-linked subunits by PAGE. Since the presence of RNA chains cross-linked to the enzyme might lead to change in the mobility of labeled subunits and thus interfere with the identification of subunits, we tried to remove ribonucleotide moieties by nuclease treatment of the cross-linked samples prior to SDS-PAGE. In the course of RNA hydrolysis, the radioactive 5′-phosphate of CMP remained attached to the 3′-hydroxy group of the UMP analogue cross-linked to the enzyme (data not shown). This immediately indicated that [α-32P]CTP was indeed polymerized into the stalled RNA at the site next to the UMP analogues. The cross-linking was found to take place with only two large subunits, Rpb1 and Rpb2, even though the cross-linking efficiency was different between the two subunits depending on the UTP analogues because of the difference in spacer length and/or hydrophobicity of the reactive moieties (Fig. 3). Without UV exposure, the radioactivity was not detected in any RNA polymerase II subunits (data not shown). The labeling of Rpb2 was expected because the catalytic site of RNA polymerization in RNA polymerases is located on the second largest subunit (prokaryotic β subunit or eukaryotic homologues). The labeling of Rpb1 clearly indicates that this subunit also participates in the formation of the catalytic site of RNA polymerization or at least it is located close to the active site on Rpb2. The most intensive patterns of labeling were obtained with the use of analogues 4 and 1, in good agreement with the relative level of RNA synthesis (see Fig. 1 C). Since the catalytic site of DNA polymerase is known to be located in hydrophobic surroundings (32Allen D.J. Darke P.L. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4601-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the analogues with higher hydrophobicity should be more preferable substrates for RNA polymerases. In concert with this prediction, the intensity of Rpb2 labeling increased with the increase in hydrophobicity of UTP derivatives (2 → 3 → 1 → 4). When the regular UTP was used in place of the UTP analogues or when the reaction was carried out in the absence of GTP, we detected no radioactivity associated with the RNA polymerase II subunit bands (data not shown). For identification of the cross-linking site(s) of nascent RNA on the two large subunits of RNA polymerase II, we attempted to locate proteolytic cleavage segments with cross-linked RNA on the primary sequences of these subunit polypeptides. For this purpose, we first performed limited digestion of isolated Rpb1 and Rpb2 with six different proteases, i.e. chymotrypsin, elastase, papain, subtilisin, trypsin, and V8 protease, among which the controlled cleavage was possible only for three proteases, papain, subtilisin, and V8 protease. The limited proteolysis at various protease concentrations led to the generation of mixtures of different peptides, as observed after SDS-PAGE analysis (Figs. 4 and5). Since some peptides with similar sizes co-migrate on SDS-PAGE, the complete separation of all peptides was not always possible. Peptides thus separated were transferred onto ProBlot membranes and subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing. Based on the sequence knowledge, we could locate the peptides on the primary sequence of Rpb1 and Rpb2 subunits (Figs.6 and 7; the numbering of peptides was only for those sequenced). Controlled cleavage of proteins by proteases often generates domains that exist in intact proteins. Even in the presence of SDS at the concentrations used, only limited sites among all potential cleavage sites were cleaved by the proteases, indicating that some structures are retained under the conditions employed. For instance, among all the possible cleavage sites by V8 protease (shown by vertical lines on the primary sequences of Rpb1 and Rpb2 in Figs. 6 A and7 A), only 10% sites were cleaved by V8 under such partially denatured conditions. Taking the cleavage patterns with three different proteases together, we concluded that Rpb2 consists of 7 domains, each being connected by a linker that is relatively sensitive to proteolytic cleavage. In most cases the sites of cleavage are located in the spacers between the regions conserved among various RNA polymerases from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (see Fig. 10). Under the proteolytic cleavage conditions employed, we never observed the peptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal part of Rpb2 down to about residues 200, probably because its NH2terminus carries a blocked structure. The specificities of proteases in polyacrylamide gels containing SDS were different from those in solutions without SDS. For instance, V8 protease cleaved preferentially after Asp, whereas the specificity of papain became broader, with nonspecific cleavage activities at Ala, Gly, Leu and Thr.Figure 5Proteolytic cleavage of the Rpb1 subunit. Rpb1 was isolated from purified S. pombe RNA polymerase II by 0.1% SDS-7.5% PAGE. Gel pieces containing the Rpb1 were mixed with a solution containing the indicated concentrations of V8 protease (A), papain (B), or subtilisin (C), subjected to 0.1% SDS-15% PAGE, and digested in the stacking gel for 4 h (A), 2.5 h (B), or 3 h (C). After electrophoresis, proteolytic fragments were transferred onto ProBlott membranes and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Migration positions of the marker proteins are indicated on the right side, and the Rpb1 fragments are marked between the lines.
