https://openalex.org/W1590974871,"A nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor interactive monoclonal antibody (192-IgG) which enhances beta-NGF binding to PC12 cells has been produced. The hybridoma clone was obtained by fusing Sp2/0- Ag14 myeloma cells with splenocytes from Balb/C mice which had been immunized with n-octyl glucoside solubilized proteins from isolated PC12 cell plasma membranes. The antibody is an IgG, which does not bind beta-NGF. It binds to the same number of sites on PC12 cells at low temperature as does beta-NGF. The 192-IgG increases the apparent affinity of beta-NGF binding to fast receptors on PC12 cells at low temperature by a factor of 2.5- to 4-fold and enhances the photoactivatable cross-linking of beta-NGF to the same receptor while decreasing the cross-linking of beta-NGF to the slow NGF receptor. At 37 degrees C 192-IgG partially inhibits the regeneration of neurites from primed PC12 cells. The 192-IgG also reduces the rate of appearance of binding to slow NGF receptors and increases the proportion of beta-NGF bound to fast receptors at 37 degrees C. These results implicate the slow receptor as the mediator of the biological response. This antibody provides a tool for examining steps in the mechanism of action of beta-NGF after binding to the receptor."

A., and Hakomori, S. (1973) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 54, 1039-1045; Keenan , T. W., Schmid, E., Franke , W. W., and Wiegandt , H. (1975) Exp. Cell Res. 92, 259-270). With the availability of purified growth factors and serum-free culture conditions in recent years, we have been able to examine this phenomenon in mouse Swiss 3T3 cells in greater detail with the following results. 1) Cell growth (cell number increase) in serum-free medium was specifically inhibited by the presence of GM1 and to a lesser extent by GM3, but not by NeuAcnLc4 , although the gangliosides were incorporated equally well into cell membranes. GM3 inhibited both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- and epidermal growth factor-stimulated mitogenesis determined by thymidine incorporation, while GM1 could only inhibit PDGF-stimulated mitogenesis. NeuAcnLc4 had no effect on mitogen-stimulated thymidine incorporation. 2) The concentration-dependent binding of 125I-PDGF binding to cells indicated that cells whose growth was inhibited by GM1 or GM3 showed an increased affinity for PDGF as compared to cells grown without addition of ganglioside, while the total number of receptors stayed the same. Addition of ganglioside did not affect the binding of 125I-EGF. 3) No direct interaction was observed between gangliosides and growth factors as evidenced by the lack of competition by ganglioside-containing liposomes for cellular binding of 125I growth factors. 4) GM1 and GM3, but neither NeuAcnLc4 nor Gb4 , inhibited the PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation by membrane preparations of a 170,000 molecular weight protein, which is probably the PDGF receptor. Thus, the level of gangliosides GM1 and GM3 in membranes may modulate PDGF receptor function by affecting the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation and may alter the affinity of the receptor for PDGF."

https://openalex.org/W1592243888,"A gamma-aminobutyrate/benzodiazepine receptor complex has been purified from bovine cerebral cortex by an improved procedure using a zwitterionic detergent. A high affinity binding site for the chloride ion channel-blocking ligand [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate ( TBPS ) was co-purified with the high affinity binding sites for gamma-aminobutyrate and benzodiazepines. The latter two have previously been shown to reside on the same physical structure ( Sigel , E., Stephenson , F.A., Mamalaki , C., and Barnard , E. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6965-6971). The dissociation constants, as measured in assay medium containing zwitterionic detergent were 90 +/- 20 nM for TBPS and 11 +/- 4 nM for [3H]flunitrazepam, whereas the binding of [3H]muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyrate agonist, showed a more complex binding behavior with more than one site. If the same preparation was assayed in a medium containing instead Triton X-100 as the detergent, the binding of TBPS was strongly inhibited, [3H]flunitrazepam binding was unaffected, and [3H]muscimol bound to a single class of sites with a dissociation constant of 33 +/- 3 nM. Regulatory interactions were retained in the complex isolated by the improved method: [3H]flunitrazepam binding was stimulated by gamma-aminobutyrate or by pentobarbital, and in a dose-dependent manner. The same two subunit types of Mr = 53,000 and 57,000 are present in the purified receptor complex as previously reported."

https://openalex.org/W1483795916,"Apolipoprotein (apo-) E3, when combined with the phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), binds avidly to apo-B,E (low density lipoprotein) receptors on human fibroblasts. Apolipoprotein E2 isolated from type III hyperlipoproteinemic subjects, which differs from apo-E3 by the presence of cysteine instead of arginine at residue 158, possesses only about 1% of the receptor binding activity of apo-E3. Modification of apo-E2 with cysteamine, which converts the cysteine at position 158 to a positively charged lysine analogue, activates receptor binding approximately 13-fold. In the present experiments, thrombin was used to cleave apo-E2 into two fragments (Mr = 22,000 and Mr = 10,000). The larger fragment, which has been shown to possess the receptor binding domain, displayed binding activity up to 12-fold greater than intact apo-E2 or equivalent to apo-E2 treated with cysteamine. When the Mr = 22,000 fragment was modified with cysteamine and combined with DMPC, receptor binding was further enhanced, attaining the level of activity of normal apo-E3 X DMPC, a 100-fold increase over apo-E2 X DMPC binding. When the cysteamine modification was reversed by incubation with beta-mercaptoethanol, the Mr = 22,000 fragment retained most of its binding activity. However, when the same sample was tested 24 h later, the level of binding activity dropped significantly. The receptor binding of apo-E2-containing beta-very low density lipoproteins could also be activated by cysteamine treatment, with the same retention of enhanced binding activity occurring after the reversal of the modification. These results indicate that apo-E2 can attain full binding activity by the removal of the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the molecule and the addition of a positive charge at residue 158 of the molecule. The retention of enhanced binding after the reversal of the cysteamine modification indicates that the enhanced binding is probably due to conformational changes induced in the binding domain (and maintained by the phospholipid) and not merely to the presence of the positive charge at residue 158."
https://openalex.org/W1492825700,"Previous study shows that human erythrocytes when exposed, in an isotonic suspension, to an electric field that generated 6-15 mV of transmembrane potential induced a Rb+ uptake that was sensitive to ouabain, a potent inhibitor of (Na,K)-ATPase ( Serpersu , E. H., and Tsong , T. Y. (1983) J. Membr . Biol. 74, 191-201). Here we present evidence that this uptake indeed involved the activity of (Na,K)-ATPase. Transport of Rb+, K+, and Na+ were carefully monitored during the voltage stimulation. It is shown that the electric field stimulated only the ouabain-sensitive influx of Rb+, and this uptake was against a chemical concentration gradient. The rate of the stimulated Rb+ uptake was measured under different intracellular Na+ and extracellular Rb+ concentrations. The Km for the stimulated Rb+ uptake was, respectively, 7 mM for the intracellular Na+ and 1.7 mM for the extracellular Rb+, consistent with the values for the red cell (Na,K)-ATPase. Yet, the voltage-sensitive Rb+ uptake did not depend on the intracellular ATP level. Neither did the voltage stimulation cause an elevation of ATP concentration in the red blood cells as was observed in mitochondrial and chloroplast ATP synthetase systems under higher electric field conditions. Since only Rb+ uptake was stimulated by the voltage, it follows then that the Na+ and the K+ pumping activities of the (Na,K)-ATPase could be decoupled, and the K+ pumping activity may derive from the electrogenic component of the enzyme action. In the present case, the applied electric field could polarize the membrane to provide membrane potential required for the electrogenic transport of Rb+. Data also show that vanadate at 180 microM completely inhibited the ATP-dependent Na+ and Rb+ pumping activities of the enzyme, but only reduced the voltage-stimulated Rb+ uptake to 50% level. This represents the first systematic study of the activation of a transport ATPase by an externally applied electric field."

https://openalex.org/W1629574441,"Previously, cytochrome c oxidase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been thought to be composed of seven different polypeptide subunits. Four of these are small polypeptides (4,000-15,000 daltons), subunits IV-VII, which are encoded by nuclear DNA. Studies described here reveal the presence of two new polypeptides in this size range. These polypeptides, designated as subunits VIIa and VIII, co-migrate with subunit VII (R.O. Poyton and G. Schatz (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 752-761) on low resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels, can be partially resolved on high resolution SDS polyacrylamide gels, and can be completely separated from one another by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. In order to determine the sequences of each of these six nuclear-coded polypeptides (subunits IV, V, VI, VII, VIIa, and VIII), we have developed new methods for the large scale purification of the holoenzyme and have employed a new strategy for the isolation of each polypeptide. By using octyl-Sepharose chromatography to isolate holocytochrome c oxidase and by extracting the holoenzyme with aprotic organic solvents and fractionating these extracts by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, it is possible to isolate several milligrams of each of these subunits. Each subunit preparation gives a single peak during reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, a single band during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single NH2-terminal sequence, and a unique amino acid composition and tryptic peptide map. Since each purified subunit preparation gives close to a 100% yield of its NH2-terminal amino acid during quantitative Edman degradation, we conclude that no subunit has a blocked NH2 terminus and that no subunit preparation contains either blocked or unblocked contaminating polypeptides. Thus, each consists of a single unique polypeptide species. Together, these results demonstrate that yeast cytochrome c oxidase contains six, rather than four, small subunit polypeptides. Thus, it appears that these polypeptides, in combination with the three polypeptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA, constitute a holoenzyme which contains nine subunits, instead of seven as proposed earlier."

https://openalex.org/W1521738707,"The activity of purified Ca2+, Mg2+-dependent endonuclease was inhibited when the enzyme was incubated in a system containing poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, NAD+, Mg2+, and DNA. All four ingredients were essential to mediate ADP-ribosylation and to demonstrate inhibition of the endonuclease. In the absence of Mg2+, ADP-ribose transferring activity of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase was stimulated by the addition of purified endonuclease to the reaction mixture in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of the reaction product showed that the endonuclease was ADP-ribosylated. The average chain length of the initial oligo(ADP-ribose) attached to the enzyme was about 5.9 residues. The oligomer was found to be extensively elongated during the chase experiment using unlabeled NAD+ and Mg2+. The present finding suggests that Mg2+ is essential for the extensive elongation of the oligo(ADP-ribose). The DNA-binding affinity of the modified endonuclease was significantly lower than that of unmodified enzyme. Also, free poly(ADP-ribose) was not an effective inhibitor of the endonuclease. These findings suggest that the observed inhibition of the endonuclease induced by ADP-ribosylation is probably due to an electrostatic repulsion between the substrate (DNA) and poly(ADP-ribose) covalently linked to the endonuclease. Histone H1 and H2B stimulated endonuclease activity and were acceptors of ADP-ribose; however, their capacity to stimulate endonuclease activity remained unchanged after ADP-ribosylation."

https://openalex.org/W1599864785,"Abstract The gene that codes for xylose isomerase in Escherichia coli has been cloned by complementation of a xylose isomerase-negative E. coli mutant. The structural gene is 1320 nucleotides in length and codes for a protein of 440 amino acids. An additional 209 nucleotides 5' and 82 nucleotides 3' to the structural gene were also sequenced. To verify that the cloned gene encodes E. coli xylose isomerase, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity and the sequence of the first 25 amino acid residues was determined by a semimicromanual Edman procedure. These results establish that the NH2-terminal methionine of xylose isomerase is specified by an ATG which is 7 nucleotides downstream from a Shine-Dalgarno sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2132573692,"We have isolated and characterized a rat gene coding for spot 14 mRNA: a hepatic product induced rapidly by thyroid hormone. This gene is present in a single copy/haploid genome, but encodes two mRNA species differing by 170 nucleotides in length. Through S1 nuclease analyses, the difference was mapped to the 3'-end of the mRNA with one species extending 170 nucleotides beyond the 3'-end of the other mRNA. The putative poly(A) addition signals AUUAAA and AAUAAA are found to precede the sites of polyadenylation in the shorter and longer mRNA, respectively. The mRNA codes for a protein of 150 amino acids with a molecular weight of 17,010. The protein-coding region is located closer to the 5'-end of the mRNA, leaving a relatively long 3'-untranslated region, which contains the only intron of 3,150 base pairs within the gene. At approximately 27 base pairs upstream from the start site of the mRNA, a sequence homologous to the TATA box, TAGAAAT , was found."
https://openalex.org/W2082966799,"Dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) induced eumelanin synthesis in hair bulb melanocytes of recessive yellow (e/e) mice in vitro, whereas alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) did not. In contrast, the melanocytes of lethal yellow (Ay/a) mice produced eumelanin in response to both dibutyryl cyclic AMP and alpha-MSH. These results suggest that the e locus controls a mechanism that determines the function of an alpha-MSH receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1548707319,"The binding of iodinated epidermal growth factor (125I-EGF) to membrane preparations from the livers of euthyroid and hypothyroid rats was examined to determine if thyroid hormones regulate EGF receptors. Binding in membrane preparations from hypothyroid livers was only 30-40% compared to that of euthyroid controls. Treatment of hypothyroid animals with a single dose of L-T3 96 h prior to sacrifice restored EGF binding nearly to the control levels. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that the decrease in EGF binding in hypothyroid membranes was due to a decrease in the number of the receptors. Affinity labeling/cross-linking of 125I-EGF to hepatic membranes with disuccinimidyl suberate followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed a prominent band of Mr = 170,000, which was decreased in hypothyroid samples to the same extent as EGF binding. EGF-stimulated receptor kinase activity in detergent extracts of hepatic membranes also revealed a major phosphorylated protein species of Mr = 170,000, which was also decreased in samples from hypothyroid animals to approximately the same degree as EGF binding. Binding, affinity labeling/cross-linking, and phosphorylation measurements thus indicate that the levels of hepatic EGF receptor are regulated by thyroid status. These results raise the possibility that some in vivo affects of thyroid hormones may be mediated by alterations in EGF receptor levels."

https://openalex.org/W2077765579,"Intracellular sodium activities, (Na)c, were determined in Necturus small intestine before and after addition of galactose to the mucosal bathing solution. In the absence of galactose, (Na)c averaged 12 millimoles per liter. Within 2 minutes after the addition of galactose to the mucosal solution, (Na)c increased to a mean value of 20 millimoles per liter and then declined, in parallel with an increase in transcellular sodium transport, to a value that did not differ significantly from that observed in the absence of the sugar. The final steady state in the presence of galactose was characterized by a three- to fourfold increase in the rate of transcellular Na+ transport in the absence of a significant increase in (Na)c. Thus, the increase in steady-state basolateral pump activity cannot be attributed to an increase in the intracellular sodium transport pool."
https://openalex.org/W1516570497,"We have constructed and isolated a cardiac myosin heavy chain (HC) cDNA clone, pMHC alpha 81, with mRNA from ventricular heart muscle of hyperthyroid rabbits. The clone encodes approximately 480 amino acids of the COOH terminus of light meromyosin and all of the 3' nontranslated region of the corresponding mRNA. Nuclease S1 analyses indicated that the clone is transcribed in hyperthyroid, but not in hypothyroid ventricles and, therefore, corresponds to ventricular alpha-HC mRNA. With probes from the more divergent 3' non-translated region of pMHC alpha 81 and also from selected portions of two previously characterized rabbit cDNA clones ( pMHC alpha 252 and pMHC beta 174), we analyzed the myosin HC mRNAs of atrial, fast skeletal, and slow skeletal muscles by nuclease S1 mapping. In atrial muscle, only one major transcript was detected. The sequence of this transcript was indistinguishable from ventricular alpha-HC mRNA in the 3' nontranslated region and in two coding segments. In contrast, the sequence divergence between the ventricular alpha-HC mRNA and the mRNAs of ventricular beta, fast skeletal, and slow skeletal myosin HCs was clearly detected. There appeared to be, however, considerable homology between coding sequences of ventricular beta and slow skeletal myosin HC mRNAs. The results strongly suggest that rabbit atrial and ventricular alpha-HCs are encoded by the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1568692844,"Both newly formed and long-term culture-generated substratum adhesion sites, generated by EGTA-mediated detachment of Balb/c SVT2 cells, were extracted with an eta-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside buffer containing salt and several protease inhibitors under conditions which result in maximal solubilization of the sulfate-radiolabeled proteoglycans. Because of the functional importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the fibronectin-dependent cell-substratum adhesion processes of these cells, these proteoglycans were fractionated on affinity columns of octyl-Sepharose or of the heparan sulfate-binding proteins platelet factor 4 or plasma fibronectin. These affinity matrices resolved a number of both binding and nonbinding classes of heparan sulfate proteoglycan from both types of adhesion sites. In particular, the platelet factor 4 column could resolve several proteoglycans with differing binding affinities. Approximately twice as much heparan sulfate proteoglycan from newly formed sites bound to all three matrices as proteoglycan from longterm sites. The proteoglycan which bound to one matrix was then tested for binding to a second matrix; this approach resolved a number of biochemically distinct species. For example, one-half of the fibronectin-Sepharose-binding fraction from the long-term sites could also bind to platelet factor 4-Sepharose; however, over 90% of the fibronectin-binding fraction from newly formed sites could bind to platelet factor 4. A major portion of the octyl-Sepharose-binding fractions of the original extracts could bind to fibronectin-Sepharose. These studies indicate that some of these proteoglycans have overlapping affinities for fibronectin, platelet factor 4, and octyl-Sepharose and that a portion of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan from these adhesion sites cannot bind to any of these affinity matrices. These results are discussed with regard to the functional significance of these various heparan sulfate proteoglycans in mediating adhesion to extracellular matrices containing fibronectin or platelet factor 4."
https://openalex.org/W1602213795,"To obtain insight into the role of lipids in the translocation of extramitochondrially synthesized proteins, we studied the ability of apocytochrome c to pass lipid bilayers. With polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the digestion of externally added apocytochrome c by trypsin, enclosed in lipid vesicles, was followed. The experiments demonstrate that apocytochrome c is able to pass a lipid barrier and this process shows both a lipid- and protein specificity. The most probable molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2151865116,"Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase from Nitrosomonas europeae catalyzes the oxidative conversion of NH2OH to NO-2. The enzyme, Mr = 220,000, has an (alpha beta)3 subunit structure with each alpha beta subunit containing 7-8 c-type hemes and one unusual prosthetic group, termed P-460. The P-460 is also found in a Mr approximately equal to 17,000 protein (P-460 fragment). Mossbauer spectra of the reduced P-460 groups, in hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and the fragment, exhibit nearly identical quadrupole doublets with an unusually large splitting, delta EQ = 4.21 mm/s (no ferrous heme protein is known with delta EQ greater than 2.75 mm/s). The observed isomer shift, delta = 0.96 mm/s at 4.2 K, shows that the P-460 iron is high spin ferrous. Treatment of oxidized hydroxylamine oxidoreductase with H2O2 followed by reduction or exposure of the native sample to CO led to the disappearance of both the characteristic 460 nm absorption band (epsilon = 89 mM-1 cm-1) and the delta EQ = 4.21 mm/s doublet. The iron of the oxidized P-460 fragment is high spin ferric, with Mossbauer and EPR parameters very similar to those of metmyoglobin. Optical spectra of the reduced P-460 fragment show long wavelength bands at 650 and 688 nm which are sensitive to treatment of the fragment with reagents which react with P-460. These bands were, however, not detected in hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. The spectroscopic and chemical evidence obtained to date suggests strongly that the P-460 iron resides in a heme-like macrocycle although the presumed porphyrin must have some unusual features."
https://openalex.org/W1563739734,"Abstract Rapid kinetic and scanning techniques were employed to observe the reaction of dioxygen with fully reduced cytochrome oxidase at room temperature following stopped flow flash photolysis of the CO compound of the enzyme. The initial product of the reaction was an compound with a spectral profile quite similar to that of the cytochrome oxidase-CO compound. The second order rate constant for formation of the primary compound was 1.1 X 10(8) M-1 S-1 at pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C. With an off rate constant of 1.9 X 10(3) S-1, the calculated dissociation constant was 1.8 X 10(-5) M. The apparent activation energy was 16.7 kJ/mol. The primary compound underwent further reaction which was independent of concentration with a rate constant of 1.2 X 10(3) S-1, and the product was Intermediate III ( Orii , Y. (1982) in Oxygenases and Oxygen Metabolism ( Nozaki , M., Yamamoto, S., Ishimura , Y., Coon , M. J., Ernster , L., and Estabrook , R., eds) pp. 137-149, Academic Press, New York), an oxidized species presumably identical to the oxygen pulsed oxidase. Thus, this reaction was ascribed to intramolecular electron transfer to the in the compound. The energy of activation was 49.8 kJ/mol below 18 degrees C but above that the rate constant was independent of temperature, and a tunneling mechanism was suggested for the intramolecular electron transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1516648662,"The reactions catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme, fructose-6-P,2-kinase and fructose 2,6- bisophosphatase , were studied. Fructose-6-P,2-kinase catalyzes the isotope exchange of ADP with ATP in the absence of fructose-6-P at about 3% of the rate of the overall reaction. The Km values for ATP and ADP for the reaction are 120 and 66 microM, respectively. No isotope exchange between fructose-6-P with fructose-2,6-P2 in the absence of adenine nucleotide was observed. The ADP-ATP exchange is not inhibited by the presence of 25 microM (1.6 X Km) fructose-6-P and less than 20% inhibition was observed at higher concentrations. Fructose-6-P,2-kinase catalyzes the reversal of the reaction at a rate approximately one-half that of the forward direction. The fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase reaction is not inhibited by 1 to 20 mM ADP. Plots of the reciprocal of the concentration of either substrate versus the reciprocal of the concentration of the other substrate yield intersecting lines for both forward and reverse reactions. The Michaelis constants for ATP and fructose-6-P are 150 and 16 microM, respectively, while those values for ADP and fructose-2,6-P2 are 62 and 8 microM, respectively. ADP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP with an inhibition constant of 0.6 mM. All other product inhibition patterns including ADP versus fructose-6-P and fructose-2,6-P2 versus ATP and fructose-6-P are noncompetitive. Fructose-6-P,2-kinase also catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP at about 10% of the rate of the overall reaction. There is no detectable burst of ADP formation upon incubating ATP with a stoichiometric amount of the enzyme. Similarly no burst of fructose-6-P formation is observed by reacting fructose-2,6-P2 with fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase. These results demonstrate that (a) the fructose-6-P,2-kinase reaction is consistent with a sequential mode of substrate addition rather than a ping-pong mechanism, (b) phosphorylenzyme , if formed, is not likely a kinetically important intermediate, and (c) no common phosphorylenzyme intermedite between fructose-6-P,2-kinase and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase seems to exist."
https://openalex.org/W1576429697,"By means of an in situ autoradiographic assay for the base-exchange reaction of phospholipids with L-serine in Chinese hamster ovary cell colonies immobilized on filter paper ( Esko , J.D. and Raetz , C.R.H. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 1190-1193), a mutant (designated 89.1) was isolated in which the specific activity of the serine-exchange enzyme was about 2-fold less than in the parent. Unexpectedly, it was demonstrated that in extracts of the mutant the specific activities of both ATP:choline phosphotransferase (choline kinase) (EC 2.7.1.32) and the enzyme that catalyzes the base-exchange of phospholipids with choline (choline-exchange enzyme) were strikingly reduced (3- to 4-fold and 10- to 15-fold, respectively), while the specific activities of other enzymes of phosphatidylcholine synthesis were normal. Several lines of evidence presented here suggested that the partial defect of serine-exchange activity in this mutant was due to a decrease of acceptor phospholipid(s) for the reaction. The growth rates and phospholipid compositions of the mutant and parent were quite similar. However, mutant 89.1 exhibited a significant defect in its ability in vivo to synthesize phosphatidylcholine. The fact that the mutant was also defective in phosphorylcholine biosynthesis in vivo, together with the finding of an enzymatic lesion of the mutant in choline kinse in vitro as described above, clearly demonstrated that with respect to the reduced phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis the primary defect was at the level of choline kinase. In addition to the decreased synthetic rate of phosphatidylcholine, the turnover rate of phosphatidylcholine was also reduced approximately 2-fold in this mutant. These decreased rates of both synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylcholine probably account for the identical phosphatidylcholine contents between the mutant and parent. As a conclusion, it may be given that strain 89.1 is a pleiotropic mutant which possesses several alterations in phosphatidylcholine metabolism, and such mammalian mutants have not been isolated previously."
https://openalex.org/W1573035118,"Phosphorylation site stoichiometries were determined for skeletal muscle glycogen synthase purified from control, alloxan-diabetic, and epinephrine-treated rabbits. One method of analysis was direct determination of the total in vivo phosphate content of each site after reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography separation of a complete tryptic digest of the purified synthase. The second method of analysis, in vitro phosphorylation, was based on the premise that in vitro 32P incorporation into each site would be inversely related to the in vivo phosphate content of that site. Glycogen synthase from control rabbits had the following distribution of in vivo phosphate (mole of phosphate/mol of site): site 1a, 0.29 +/- 0.08; site 5, 0.62 +/- 0.07; site 3, 0.46 +/- 0.06; site 1b, 0.23 +/- 0.03; and site 2, 0.43 +/- 0.07. Synthase from diabetic rabbits had 2-fold elevations of in vivo phosphate contents of sites 2 and 3. Epinephrine resulted in increased phosphorylation in vivo of site 1b (2.0-fold), site 2 (2.0-fold), and site 3 (1.5-fold). The in vitro phosphorylation analysis showed decreased 32P incorporation in vitro (indicative of increased in vivo phosphorylation) as follows: epinephrine, site 1a, site 3, site 1b, site 2; diabetic, site 3, site 2. The effect of diabetes on the in vitro phosphorylation of sites 2 and 3 was reversed by insulin treatment. We conclude that the major effect of epinephrine, phosphorylation of sites 1a, 1b, and 2, is mediated by the activation of the cAMP-dependent kinase. The mechanisms accounting for the phosphorylation of site 3 in response to epinephrine and phosphorylation of sites 2 and 3 in the diabetic state are under investigation."

The apparent molecular weight was 42,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels but varied on molecular weight columns due to the type of detergent. Receptor inactivated by iodination had an apparent molecular weight of 21,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. The purified receptor did not bind to concanavalin A-agarose or Lens culinaris-agarose."
https://openalex.org/W1605065814,"A low Km cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase was purified to homogeneity from microsomes of bakers' yeast. Intact enzyme, purified from microsomes prepared in the presence of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, had a specific activity of 0.6 mumol/min/mg of protein (30 degrees C, pH 8.0, 1 microM cyclic AMP), a pI of 6.65 +/- 0.15, and a molecular weight of 61,000 determined by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Gel filtration of native enzyme suggested it is a monomer. When phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was omitted, a product (nicked enzyme) was obtained with a specific activity of 1.2 mumol/min/mg of protein, the same pI, and a similar amino acid composition; but gel electrophoresis now showed two bands, with molecular weights of 45,000 and about 17,000, together with a small amount of the 61,000 band. Apart from the higher specific activity of the nicked enzyme, no difference was found between the catalytic properties of the two enzyme forms. Between 40 nM and 1 microM cyclic AMP, an apparent Km of 170 nM was observed at pH 8.0, but at higher cyclic AMP concentrations (2-30 microM), Hofstee plots curved upwards. Cyclic deoxy-AMP was a substrate, but cyclic GMP was not and did not affect the activity towards cyclic AMP. Both enzyme forms contained tightly bound zinc. The metal chelators, 8-hydroxyquinoline and orthophenanthroline , caused progressive partial inactivation of the enzyme and a decrease in its affinity for cyclic AMP. Dialysis against Zn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, or Mn2+ (but not Mg2+ or Ni2+) reversed these changes."
https://openalex.org/W1600265889,"Active nonphosphorylated fructose bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) was purified from bakers' yeast. After chromatography on phosphocellulose, the enzyme appeared as a homogeneous protein as deduced from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing. A Stokes radius of 44.5 A and molecular weight of 116,000 was calculated from gel filtration. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate resulted in three protein bands of Mr = 57,000, 40,000, and 31,000. Only one band of Mr = 57,000 was observed, when the single band of the enzyme obtained after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate was eluted and then resubmitted to electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Amino acid analysis indicated 1030 residues/mol of enzyme including 12 cysteine moieties. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was estimated by gel electrofocusing to be around pH 5.5. The catalytic activity showed a maximum at pH 8.0; the specific activity at the standard pH of 7.0 was 46 units/mg of protein. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase b, the less active phosphorylated form of the enzyme, was purified from glucose inactivated yeast. This enzyme exhibited maximal activity at pH greater than or equal to 9.5; the specific activity measured at pH 7.0 was 25 units/mg of protein. The activity ratio, with 10 mM Mg2+ relative to 2 mM Mn2+, was 4.3 and 1.8 for fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase a and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase b, respectively. Activity of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase a was 50% inhibited by 0.2 microM fructose 2,6-bisphosphate or 50 microM AMP. Inhibition by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate as well as by AMP decreased with a more alkaline pH in a range between pH 6.5 and 9.0. The inhibition exerted by combinations of the two metabolites at pH 7.0 was synergistic."
https://openalex.org/W1777599757,"Beta h0 and beta h1 are two beta-like globin genes in the mouse beta-globin gene cluster whose functions have not previously been established. Transcripts of both beta h0 and beta h1 are found in yolk sac-derived erythroid cells from mouse embryos and in the murine erythroleukemic cell line GM979. S1 nuclease analysis shows that beta h1 is the more abundant of the two transcripts in both embryonic erythroid cells and the cell line GM979. Hybridization of a beta h1-specific probe to RNA from erythroid cells of 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, and 14-day-old mouse embryos indicates that levels of beta h1 mRNA are high at 10 and 11 days and then decline during further fetal development. The in vitro translation product of hybrid-selected beta h1 mRNA was analyzed by acid/urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The beta h1 translation product has the electrophoretic mobility expected for the z chain. We conclude that beta h1 is a fully functional gene which codes for the embryonic z chain."
https://openalex.org/W1512043258,"Abstract Carboxylmethylation of several preparations of cAMP phosphodiesterase by the enzyme protein O- carboxylmethyltransferase and S-adenosylmethionine reduces the extent to which the enzyme was activated by native calmodulin. In contrast, carboxylmethylation of calmodulin produced only a slight reduction in the ability of calmodulin to activate cAMP phosphodiesterase. The effect of carboxylmethylation of calmodulin was most prominent at subsaturating calmodulin concentrations, whereas the reduction in the activation of carboxylmethylated cAMP phosphodiesterase was independent of calmodulin concentration. Kinetics and stoichiometric analysis of calmodulin carboxylmethylation indicated that less than 5% of calmodulin was methylated and that the Km of protein O- carboxylmethyltransferase for calmodulin was approximately 350 microM. The extent of calmodulin carboxylmethylation was not affected by either EGTA or Ca2+. When homogeneous bovine brain phosphodiesterase was carboxylmethylated , a rapid decrease in calmodulin-induced stimulation was noted, occurring within 30 s of incubation. Acidic sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of bovine brain phosphodiesterase revealed a major band of 60,000 daltons which contained radio-activity after carboxylmethylation . Stoichiometric analysis revealed that approximately 20% of the phosphodiesterase was carboxylmethylated . Thus, although calmodulin can serve as a substrate for carboxylmethylation , it appears that carboxylmethylation has a greater effect on calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase activity when the target enzyme, rather than calmodulin, is carboxylmethylated ."
https://openalex.org/W1497794724,"Poly(A) polymerases purified from rat liver nuclei consisted of two distinct species, a predominant enzyme of Mr = 38,000 and a minor one of Mr = 48,000. Prior to extensive purification, the minor enzyme constituted approximately 1% of the total liver poly(A) polymerase. Poly(A) polymerase purified from a rat tumor, Morris hepatoma 3924A, was comprised of a single species of Mr = 48,000 which was identical to the minor liver enzyme with respect to chromatographic and immunological characteristics. Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 using 0.3 M NaCl for elution showed that the major liver poly(A) polymerase had a molecular weight of 156,000, which corresponded to a tetramer of the 38-kDa polypeptide, whereas the hepatoma and minor liver 48-kDa species existed as dimers with a molecular weight of 96,000. Fractionation by Sephacryl S-200 resulted in complete loss of both liver poly(A) polymerase activities which could be restored by exogenous N1-type protein kinase. Following CNBr cleavage, the 48-kDa poly(A) polymerase from liver and hepatoma exhibited nearly identical peptide maps which were distinct from that of the major liver enzyme (38 kDa). Antibodies raised against tumor poly(A) polymerase reacted with the 48-kDa polypeptide but not with the 38-kDa liver enzyme. Immune complex formation was observed between seven of the eight CNBr cleavage products derived from the 48-kDa polypeptide of both liver and hepatoma. It is concluded that distinct genes in rat liver code for two structurally and immunologically unique nuclear poly(A) polymerases, one of which is identical to the enzyme from the hepatoma."
https://openalex.org/W1602641653,"The postnatal development of skeletal muscle is accompanied by an increased capacity for glycogenolysis and anaerobic glycolysis. In the present study, regulatory features of cAMP synthesis were examined in neonatal and adult rabbit sarcolemmal membranes. Adult sarcolemma exhibited a 3-, 6-, and 10-fold greater adenylate cyclase activity than neonate for basal, NaF, and isoproterenol plus GTP, respectively. The Km for activation by isoproterenol was 1.4 X 10(-8) M and 6 X 10(-8) M for GTP. The number of beta-receptors was similar (0.9-1.2 pmol/mg). 10 microM GTP shifted isoproterenol EC50 from 1 X 10(-8) M to 1 X 10(-7) M in adult; neonatal agonist affinity was unaffected by GTP. Cholera toxin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity 2-fold and catalyzed 32P ribosylation of a Mr = 42,000 peptide in adult sarcolemma; both activities were low or absent in neonate. Isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity was elevated 4-fold in adult compared to neonatal sarcolemma. Mn2+ ion-stimulated basal activity, an indicator of catalytic function of adenylate cyclase, was also elevated in adult. Together, these findings suggest that the development of catecholamine-sensitive cAMP synthesis in muscle is governed by the coordinate expression of the regulatory and catalytic proteins of adenylate cyclase, but not the beta-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1586918950,"The TraJ protein encoded by the conjugative plasmid F has been designated an Escherichia coli K-12 envelope protein that participates in a mechanism of gene regulation. We have purified the TraJ protein, using an Flac::lambda traJ lysogen that overproduces the protein after heat induction of the prophage. Sufficient TraJ protein was synthesized within 40 min after induction to follow the purification by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Our purification exploited the observation that the TraJ protein remains insoluble after repeated Triton X-100/EDTA extractions of crude envelope fractions. The protein was then solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate at 60 degrees C and fractionated further by gel filtration and hydroxylapatite chromatography, both in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. After hydroxylapatite chromatography, the protein was greater than 95% pure. The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by analysis of its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, which was the same as that predicted from the partial nucleotide sequence of the traJ gene (Thompson, R., and Taylor, L. (1982) Mol. Gen. Genet. 188, 513-518). This analysis also indicated that the TraJ protein is localized in the cell without proteolytic modification of its NH2-terminus. We discuss the possible significance of these observations with respect to the cellular functions of the TraJ protein."
https://openalex.org/W1569503749,"A mutant of Escherichia coli which contained no detectable AMP nucleosidase activity (EC 3.2.2.4) was produced by treatment with nitrosoguanidine and identified by a colorimetric assay for AMP nucleosidase in individual colonies from agar plates. Conjugation experiments indicated a close linkage between the AMP nucleosidase locus (amn) and his. Assays for AMP nucleosidase in E. coli strains with deletions in the his region established that amn is not located between attP2H and mgl . Transduction experiments with bacteriophage P1 were used to construct a linkage map in the his and amn region of the 100-min chromosome map of E. coli, which places amn at 43.3 min. A Rec- strain of E. coli ( FP4102 ) which carries the uvrC to his region (42.1-44.1 min) as an F' episome was used to confirm this location. The episome from FP4102 was used as the source of DNA for cloning amn. BamHI restriction fragments of the episome were inserted into the homologous site of pBR322 and used to transform the Amn- strain of E. coli to Amn+. The transforming plasmid contained a 9-kb (kilobase) insert. Partial restriction of plasmid with ClaI and religation gave a plasmid with a 6-kb insert which retains the amn gene. Restriction mapping of the plasmid has identified ClaI and PstI sites which appear to be within the amn locus. E. coli (Rec-) which contains the 9-kb plasmid of pBR322 containing amn overproduces AMP nucleosidase when grown in the presence of ampicillin. The specific activity of AMP nucleosidase increases from 0.016 mumol/min/mg of protein to 0.32 mumol/min/mg of protein in extracts of the wild type and the plasmid-bearing strains, respectively. A simple purification procedure yields 10 mg of homogeneous AMP nucleosidase from 25 g of packed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1519257605,"Removal of the heme iron from cytochrome c to generate porphyrin cytochrome c relieves the quenching of porphyrin fluorescence and enhances the fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue and the 4 tyrosine residues. The intensity of the porphyrin fluorescence is not perturbed by denaturation of the protein at neutral pH using either urea or guanidine hydrochloride. However, the amplitude of tryptophan fluorescence is increased by these denaturants from 5 to about 85% of a model tryptophan residue using solutions of 2 microM tryptophan. In contrast to cytochrome c, the tryptophan fluorescence amplitude of denatured porphyrin cytochrome c is independent of pH over the range pH 3.0 to 7.4. Acidification of solutions of either native or denatured porphyrin cytochrome c markedly alters both the visible absorbance and fluorescence of the protein consistent with protonation of two pyrrole nitrogens on the porphyrin. Preliminary analysis of the spectral changes occurring in the acid transition suggests the presence of an intermediate form having only one of these two pyrrole nitrogens protonated."
https://openalex.org/W1597756135,"Gene 28 of bacteriophage SPO1 encodes an RNA polymerase sigma factor sigma gp28, which replaces the host Bacillus subtilis sigma subunit sigma 55, to alter the promoter recognition specificity of RNA polymerase. A fragment of SPO1 DNA containing gene 28 was placed under the control of the PL promoter of bacteriophage lambda in an Escherichia coli expression vector. When transcription of gene 28 was induced by derepression of PL, the sigma gp28 synthesized constituted several per cent of total cellular protein. Sigma gp28 purified from these cells was able to confer specificity for SPO1 middle gene promoters upon B. subtilis core RNA polymerase, and also enabled E. coli core RNA polymerase to recognize and initiate transcription from an SPO1 middle gene promoter."
