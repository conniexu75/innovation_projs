https://openalex.org/W1969842104,"By equilibrium competition experiments, the dissociation constant (K(RD)) of lac repressor for E. coli DNA carrying a deletion of the lac operon was measured at a variety of salt concentrations. These data are used in the consideration of several aspects of protein-DNA interaction: Quantitative estimates of specificity are made. Specificity changes only slightly with salt concentration. We calculate that in vivo, 98 percent or more of repressor is bound to DNA predominately at sites other than the lac operator. Inducers shift repressor from operator to nonoperator DNA, but do not free it from DNA. The general affinity of repressor for E. coli DNA is sufficient to support a model where repressor slides along DNA for significant distances. The effective dissociation constant of repressor for operator (K(eff)) is very sensitive to the total DNA concentration. We propose that ""junk"" DNA in eucaryotes functions to maintain total DNA at an optimum concentration. We consider the lac operon in the nucleus of a lymphocyte, point out that severe difficulties would be encountered, and suggest possible solutions."
https://openalex.org/W1534020842,"Bovine and human retinol-retinol-binding protein (RBP) were iodinated to high specific activity. At least 34% of the iodinated material was native and retained its retinol chromophore as judged by its characteristic ability to bind to plasma prealbumin. Bovine and human retinol-125I-RBP were found to bind specifically to intact isolated pigment epithelium cells from bovine eyes. The specific binding was complete in about 1 min with an estimated second order rate constant of about 10-8 M-minus 1 S-minus 1 (at 22 degrees). The specific binding was temperature dependent with the binding at 0 degrees being some 7-fold slower than at 22 degrees. The specific binding of both human and bovine retinol-125I-RBP was a linear function of the number of binding sites (number of cells) and was saturable with respect to retinol-125I-RBP. Bound iodinated retinol-RBP was rapidly displaced by the addition of unlabeled retinol-RBP, indicating that the specific binding process was a surface phenomenon and was not due to endocytosis. At saturation about 3.7 to 5.2 times 10-4 molecules of either bovine or human retinol-125I-RBP bound to one bovine pigment epithelium cell. The dissociation constant for the binding between retinol-125I-RBP and pigment epithelium receptor was estimated to be about 5 times 10-minus 12 M. Addition of human prealbumin (thyroxine-binding prealbumin) did not affect the binding of either human or bovine retinol-125I-RBP to pigment epithelium cells. Retinol-125I-RBP did not bind specifically to isolated bovine rod photoreceptor outer segments. Human apo-RBP was less effective in displacing bound retinol-125I-RBP than either native or reconstituted human retinol-RBP. These results suggest a mechanism whereby, after delivering its retinol to the cell, apo-RBP is displaced from the specific receptor on pigment epithelium cell by another retinol-RBP molecule. This postulated mechanism makes it possible to control the delivery of retinol to the target cell by the relative plasma concentrations of apo- and retinol-RBP and their relative affinities for the specific receptor binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2052951922,"INDIVIDUAL tumour-associated transplantation antigens (TATA) of chemically induced tumours and histocompatibility antigens (HA) share the ability of inducing transplantation immunity, and have other properties in common, such as the high degree of polymorphism1–3 and a similar cell surface behaviour4. A reciprocal relationship between the quantitative expression of TATA and H-2 antigens has been observed5–6, suggesting the existence of common mechanisms either in their synthesis or in the control of their phenotypic expression. Such indirect similarity prompted us to study the existence of cross reactions between TATA and HA. We therefore determined whether 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcomata possess TATA-containing allogeneic histocompatibility determinants. Here we report data from two BALB/c fibrosarcomas, ST-5 and B-2."

https://openalex.org/W1479934482,"Collagen has been prepared from steer glomerular basement membrane by controlled pepsin solubilization. Four collagen polypeptides of potential alpha chain size have been isolated following denaturation and reduction with mercaptoethanol. Purification was obtained through sequential chromatography by gel filtration on agarose and by ion exchange on carboxymethyl- and diethylaminoethylcellulose and confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions A and B resemble interstitial alpha chains in apparent molecular weight by gel filtration (93,000). Fractions C and D were released from a single high molecular weight fraction (II) by reduction with mercaptoethanol and had a larger apparent molecular weight by gel filtration (140,000). Amino acid composition of all fractions demonstrated that they are closely interrelated by generally distinctive from interstitial collagens. Cysteine was present in all fractions except Fraction A. Prior to reduction, all mercaptan groups were inaccessible to iodoacetate and p-chloromercuribenzoate but became completely titrable after treatment with mercaptoethanol. The starting material and all fractions contained large amounts of hexose. Glucose and galactose predominated; but mannose, glucosamine, and galactosamine were also present in substantial amounts. Small amounts of fucose and sialic acids were found in starting material only."

https://openalex.org/W1540173405,"A steady state kinetic study of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I has been carried out using poly[d(A-T)] as the template-primer substrate. The results of substrate saturation and product inhibition kinetic studies suggest an altered Ordered Bi Bi mechanism for the enzyme. The Michaelis constants for polymer, d-atp, and dTTP are 5 nM (3'-OH ends), 1 muM, and 2 muM, respectively. The apparent equilibrium constant for the reaction, Keq equals [PPi]/[dNTP], was estimated as greater than or equal to 500. No quaternary complex of enzyme, template, and both deoxynucleoside triphosphates was detected. Single turnover experiments at 4 degrees indicated that the enzyme functions non-processively under the specified conditions, that is, dissociates after each catalytic step. The results at higher temperature were consistent with dissociation within 30 steps. Furthermore, at 4 degrees a burst of incorporation stoichiometric with the amount of enzyme was observed upon initiation of the reaction, indicating that the rate-limiting step in the steady state occurs after phosphodiester bond formation. There is a linear Arrhenius dependence of the initial reaction on temperature in the range 4-40 degrees, with an apparent Ea equals 17 kcal/mol. The rate equations appropriate for template-dependent polymerases which dissociate after each catalytic step have been derived."

https://openalex.org/W1525655870,"The enzyme 7, 8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine to transaminate the biotin precurson 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid and form the next intermediate in the pathway, 7, 8-diaminopelargonic acid. The enzyme has been purified nearly 1000-fold from an extract of a regulatory mutant of Escherichia coli which is derepressed for the enzymes of the biotin operon. The extract was treated with protamine sulfate, ammonium sulfate, and subjected to acid and heat treatments. Subsequently, the enzyme was chromatographed on columns of DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, hydroxylapatite, and two Sephadex G-100. The resulting purified preparation was judged 86% homogeneous by the scanning of of a stained disc gel. The enzymatic activity was associated with the major band in gels run at two different gel concentrations and two different pH values. The cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate, can be resolved from the enzyme in the presence of phosphate buffer after incubation with the amino donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine. A molecular weight estimation of 94,000 plus or minus 10, 000 has been obtained by gel filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation studies. Gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, shows a single subunit with a molecular weight of 47, 000 plus or minus 3, 000 indicating a dimeric enzyme. A neutral compound was detected in the acidified reaction mixture which was derived from the methionine moiety of S-adenosyl-L-methionine and was present in amounts equivalent to the 7, 8-diaminopelargonic acid produced in the reaction mixture. It is suggested that the keto product of the reaction, i.e. S-adenosyl-2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid, may decompose nonenzymatically under the conditions of the reaction to form 5'-methylthioadenosine and the neutral compound, 2-oxo-3-butenoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1486502097,"Abstract We have studied the nuclease activities present in preparations of Escherichia coli RNase III and the factor responsible for specific processing of several RNA species. RNase III preparations contain three activities: one which solubilizes stable RNA:RNA duplexes; one which solubilizes the RNA of DNA:RNA hybrids; and one which processes the polycistronic mRNA of bacteriophage T7 in a manner identical with sizing factor. We show that the activity against the RNA of DNA:RNA hybrids can be removed, but that the activity which cleaves RNA:RNA duplexes and that responsible for specific processing of phage T7 polycistronic mRNA appear to be identical by several biochemical criteria. In addition, partially purified enzyme fractions from mutants lacking these two activities contain substantial amounts of activity against the RNA of DNA:RNA hybrids. We have also defined several properties of the two activities solubilize RNA:RNA duplexes and RNA of DNA:RNA hybrids. Average oligonucleotide chain length in an exhaustive digest of double-stranded RNA is about 15 bases, while that in a digest of the RNA in DNA:RNA hybrids is less than 10 bases. Direct analysis shows that both activities cleave RNA chains to yield 5'-phosphate and 3'-hydroxyl termini. All four bases can reside at the 5' end of the resulting oligonucleotides, although both activities show a mild preference for certain bases. These results and previous findings allow us to specify the probably size and structure of potential cleavage sites for these enzymes in biological RNA molecules."

These DNAs were cleaved by the purified restriction endonuclease Eco TI from Escherichia coli. Normally modified DNA (Glc+, MeAde+) was not attached. The Eco RII and the hemophilus enzymes Hin dII and Hin dIII do not attack Glc-, MeAde- T DNA, possibly due to the presence of 6-hydroxymethylcytosine. Eco RI produces approximately 40 specific fragments from Glc- DNA ranging in molecular weights from 0.3 to 10.5 X 10-6."

In this report, it is shown that these molecules replicate as double-branched circles, similar to those observed during replication of the bacteriophage lambda and Escherichia coli chromosomes. A normal rate of replication of these DNA circles requires the function of a nuclear gene, cdc 8."

https://openalex.org/W1583204441,"Decay of pre-existing ribonucleic acid was studied in Escherichia coli cells subjected to high temperature or to starvation for nitrogen, phosphate, amino acids, or a carbon source. In these studies a series of mutants affected in ribonucleic I(RNase I, EC 3.1.4.22) polynucleotide phosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.8) or ribonuclease II (RNase II, EC 3.1.4.23) were used. Degradation of total RNA and the disappearance of 23 S and 16 S rRNA were followed. The results obtained indicated that, by and large, decay of 23 S and 16 S RNA parallels that of total RNA. Decay of RNA depended on the nuclease content of the cells as well as on the treatment of applied. It was most pronounced during carbon starvation and least in cells deprived of phosphate ions. It was most effective in strains containing all three nucleases and least in the strain defective in all three. The exonucleases polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase II did not seem to affect the extent of 23 S and 16 S RNA disappearance. Strains with modified exonucleases did accumulate low molecular weight RNA species during treatments which induced considerable degradation of 23 S and 16 S RNA. Based on the above date and previous observations, we suggest that during various starvations a similar mechanism is operative. The 23 S and 16 S RNAs are degraded endonucleolytically, and this is the rate-limiting step during starvation. The exonucleases polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase II seem to participate primarily in the decay of the low molecular weight RNA species formed by the endonuclease(s), not as yet identified."
https://openalex.org/W2042922197,Surface cultures of 15–19 day old fetal mouse brain that do not initially express the Thy 1 antigen develop the antigen between 4 and 11 days in culture. The antigen can be detected by immunofluorescence of live cells on the culture plate on two morphologically distinct types of cells. Both neuronal-looking cells and a more general category of cells which includes fibroblastic cells can express the Thy 1 antigen. The antigen is not expressed on certain cells of the glial type. This method enables one to distinguish between different types of brain cells in culture both morphologically and immunologically at the same time.
https://openalex.org/W1599764862,"The transamination of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid by 7, 8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase of Escherichia coli requires S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the amino donor. Initial velocity studies of this reaction revealed a parallel pattern of reciprocal plots characteristic of a ping-pong mechanism. m-Keto-8-aminopelargonic acid showed strong substrate inhibition which was competitive with S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The Michaelis constants determined for S-adenosyl-L-methionine and 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid were 0.20 mM and 1.2 muM, respectively. The Vmax of 0.16 mumol/mg/min corresponds to a turnover number for the enzyme of only 17 molecules/molecule enzyme/min. The Km values for the interaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate with the apoenzyme were determined to be 32 muM and 21 muM, respectively. Two classes of inhibitors were observed: (a) those which showed competitive inhibition with respect to S-adenosynd (b) those which showed noncompetitive inhibition with respect to both substrates. In the former group were S-adenosyl-L-(2-hydroxy-4-methylthio)butyric acid and adenosine. In the latter were S-adenosyl-L-ethionine, adenine, and 8-keto-7-aminopelargonic acid. L-Methionine, S-methyl-L-methionine, inosine, and hypoxanthine were not significantly inhibitory. Certain conformations of the substrates in the active site of the enzyme have been proposed which explain: (a) the requirement for the sulfonium ion of S-adenosyl-L-methionine for activity but not for binding to the enzyme, and (b) the ability of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid to bind to the pyridoxal form of the enzyme as a potent substrate inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1576700228,"Intracistronic alpha-complementation between a cyanogen bromide digest of beta-galactosidase and an extract of the lac Zminus operator-proximal deletion mutant M15 was used to monitor the purification of a cyanogen bromide peptide (CB2) responsible for the complementation. Key steps in the purification were ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose and sulfopropyl-Sephadex in the presence of urea, and Sephadex gel filtration. CB2 contains residues 3 to 92 of beta-galactosidase. Its sequence is: Ile-Thr-Asp-Ser-Leu-Ala-Val-Val-Leu-Gln-Arg-Arg-Asp-Trp-Glu-Asn-Pro-Gly-Val-Thr-Gln-Leu-Asn-Arg-Leu-Ala-Ala-His-Pro-Pro-Phe-Ala-Ser-Trp-Arg-Asn-Ser-Glu-Glu-Ala-Arg-Thr-Asp-Arg-Pro-Ser-Gln-Gln-Leu-Arg-Ser-Leu-Asn-Gly-Glu-Trp-Arg-Phe-Ala-Trp-Phe-Pro-Ala-Pro-Glu-Ala-Val-Pro-Glu-Ser-Trp-Leu-Glu-Cys-Asp-Leu-Pro-Glu-Ala-Asp-Thr-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Ser-Asn-Trp-Gln-Met.

https://openalex.org/W1506076499,"The restriction endonuclease from Escherichia coli K specifically cleaves foreign DNA in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine, ATP, and Mg2+. The role of S-adenosylmethionine in this reaction has been studied by following the specific binding of the enzyme to unmodified DNA. The results indicate that S-adenosylmethionine acts as an allosteric effector. However, the rate-limiting step in the activation of the enzyme is not the binding of the effector itself, but an event subsequent to it. The interaction of the S-adenosylmethionine with two mutant K restriction endonucleases isolated previously has also been investigated. One of them, which is defective in restriction, can be activated in a manner similar to the wild type enzyme, while the other one, which lacks both restriction and modification activities (due to a mutation in the subunit responsible for DNA recognition), shows no such effect."
https://openalex.org/W1515056425,"Ribonuclease III-deficient strains of Escherichia coli accumulate a RNA species. Kinetic analysis of label incorporated into rRNA species shows, however, that 30 S RNA is not the major precursor to the 16 S and 23 S RNA species is in 7- to 10-fold excess over that into 30 S RNA. The 30 S RNA species turns over with a half-life of about 2.5 min, which could account for no more than one-tenth of the incorporation into 16 S plus 23 S RNA. Thus, under these conditions RNase III-strains of E. coli do not cut rRNAs from an intact tandem precursor molecule but rather from the elongating nascent transcript, possibly by an alternate pathway not involving RNase III."
https://openalex.org/W1557658712,"An improved purification of Escherichia coli K12 tryptophanase is presented. It is shown that the apoenzyme crystals, oxidized by exposure to air, can be reactivated by treatment with a reducing agent. The titration of sulfhydryl groups shows that four --SH groups are exposed and two are masked per protomer. The influence of two effectors, monovalent cations and the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, on the reactivity of --SH groups and the enzymatic activity was investigated. The --SH groups react more slowly in holo- than in apoenzyme in the presence of potassium ions. If these ions are replaced by sodium ions, the reactivity becomes the same. Potassium and ammonium ions, both activators, give sigmoidal activation curves. The sodium ion is a Michaelian inhibitor of potassium activation. The binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was examined by kinetics and at equilibrium. The kinetics are shown to be very slow; the rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions have been measured. The binding equilibrium, examined with 3H-labeled pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, gives one site per protomer with a K-D value of (3.2 plus or minus 0.8) times 10-7 M. The K-m for pyridoxal-P was determined by activity measurements. The binding equilibrium is attained after several hours, giving a value of 4.2 times 10-7 M, being nearly identical with the dissociation constant and 5 times smaller than previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1590476098,"A protein which binds both glutamate (K-D = 0.8 muM) and aspartate (K-D = 1.2 muM) has been purified to homogeneity (290-fold) from the periplasmic fraction released from Escherichia coli W3092 by the cold osmotic shock procedure. The apparent molecular weight of the glutamate-aspartate binding protein is approximately 31,000 as judged by gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation; and the protein has a pI of 9.69. This protein contains 2 half-cystine residues and is dependent on a dithiothreitol-sensitive component for renaturation to an active conformation following urea or guanidine treatment. Of the natural amino acids only the L isomers of glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, asparagine, and alanine were inhibitors of either [C]glutamate or [14C]aspartate binding and the inhibitions were competitive. Only one binding site is indicated per molecule of protein. Antibody prepared against the glutamate-asparate binding protein does not cross-react with purified glutamine binding protein or any other component of osmotic shock fluid. The antibody does cross-react with osmotic shock fluids obtained from E. coli strains B and W and Salmonella typhimurium OT2. The glutamate-aspartate binding protein-antibody complex does not bind either glutamate or aspartate. The protein may be similar to the glutamate binding activity detected in the periplasmic fraction released from E. coli strain B (Miner, K.M., and Frank, L. (1974) J. Bacteriol. 117, 1093-1098) and strain K12 CS (Barash, H., and Halpern, Y.S. (1971) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 45, 681-688). This protein appears to function in the transport of glutamate by E. coli strain W cultured in minimal medium with succinate as the carbon source (Willis, R.C., and Furlong, C.E. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 2581-2586."
https://openalex.org/W1607750614,"Isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli B grown on DL-alanine-glycerol carry out amino acid active transport coupled to D-alanine oxidation by a membrane-bound dehydrogenase. Several other D-amino acids are substrates for this D-alanine dehydrogenase and also drive concentrative uptake of solutes. Additionally, L-alanine and L-serine can energize solute transport by virtue of conversion to oxidizable D isomers by a membrane-bound alanine racemase. No other physiological L-amino acids were effective. Both membrane enzymes and consequent solute transport are markedly reduced in vesicles from glucose-grown cells. Respiratory chain uncouplers abolish the racemase-dehydrogenase-supported transport activity. When amino-oxyacetate at 10-4 M is added to the vesicles, the racemase activity and transport driven by L-alanine and L-serine is specifically and reversibly inhibited. D-Alanine-driven transport is unaffected. Similarly beta-chloro-L-alanine is an irreversible inactivator of the bound racemase but not the D-alanine dehydrogenase. Both the D and L isomers of beta-chloroalanine support oxygen uptake by the vesicles and initially stimulate L-(14C)proline active transport. However, oxidation of the beta-chloro-D-alanine rapidly uncouples active transport from substrate oxidation. This transport inactivation can be protected partially by dithiothreitol, putatively scavenging a reactive product of chloroalanine oxidation. Authentic beta-chloropyruvate produces the same transport uncoupling. When beta-chloro-L-alanine is employed as a substrate, no such transport inactivation is observed. This difference may stem from the possibility that the alanine racemase eliminates HCl from beta-chloro-L-alanine producing pyruvate, not the beta-chloropyruvate that would arise from racemization and then dehydrogenation. We have shown that exogenous pyruvate is oxidized by the vesicles and will also stimulate active transport of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1928690216,"Digestion of reconstituted complexes of 16 S RNA and ribosomal protein S4 with pancreatic ribonuclease, followed by resolution of the products on polyacrylamide gels of low ionic strength, gives rise to a protected ribonucleoprotein fragment with a mobility of 7 S. Fingerprinting of the RNA moiety indicates the presence of sequences covering the 5' one-third of the 16 S RNA. After its extraction from the acrylamide gels, the protected RNA from the complex can be separated into two components by sedimentation in sucrose gradients. One of these retains the ability to reassociate specifically with S4, as judged from its stoichiometry of binding in the presence of excess S4 and from its selection of S4 alone from a mixture of unfractionated 30S ribosomal proteins. It spans the same regions of the 16 S RNA as the total protected RNA, but lacks an internal sequence of about 120 nucleotides. This component contains a number of nicks which give rise to discrete bands upon electrophoresis in urea. The principal subfragments include Sections L through F (230 nucleotides), B through I'' (160 nucleotides), and part of section C'' (35 to 40 nucleotides). It is proposed that the binding site for S4 lies within these noncontiguous sequences, in support of the hypothesis that S4 makes multiple contacts with the 16 S RNA."

If a limited amount of tRNA-Ile is supplied to a mixture of free enzyme and enzyme-bound [14c]isoleucyl adenylate in a medium containing spermine, ATP, and [3H]isoleucine, almost none of the resultant isoleucyl tRNA is derived from preformed enzyme-bound [14C]isoleucyl adenylate. Almost all of the isoleucyl tRNA formed results directly from reaction of free enzyme, ATP, and isoleucine with tRNA.

https://openalex.org/W1536158427,"A comparison has been made of the ability of the formylated and unformylated initiator tRNAs of Escherichia coli and rabbit liver to participate in a number of model reactions of protein synthesis. These reactions include: (a) formation of a ternary complex composed of the initiator tRNA, GTP, and initiation factor MP; (b) ApUpG-directed binding of the initiator tRNA to 40 S subunits with initiation factor Ml; (c) formation of the artificial dipeptide, methionylpuromycin; (d) formation of the natural initial globin dipeptide, methionylvaline; and (e) synthesis of sheep alpha and betaB-globin chains on reticulocyte polysomes from a type BB sheep. The results of these studies indicate that although the prokaryotic initiator tRNA species function efficiently in the partial reactions which involve only binding, the methionine donated by the prokaryotic tRNA is not incorporated efficiently into peptide linkage. This suggests that the initial high level of binding of the E. coli initiator tRNAs may be nonspecific, and that the structure of the tRNA itself is important for specific recognition by eukaryotic initiation factors. The effect of formylation on the effectiveness of the initiator tRNA is not clear; it reduces activity in ternary complex formation, does not affect ApUpG-directed binding to 40 S subunits, and increases the rate or extent of incorporation of methionine, or both, into methionylpuromycin and globin chains."

Purified material was completely dissociated with mercurials and the relative amounts of catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits were determined by three methods: (a) quantitative cellulose acetate electrophoresis; (b) Lowry analysis after separating the catalytic and regulatory subunits by sucrose gradient centrifugation; (c) dissociation of the species with sodium dodecyl sulfate and determination of the relative amounts of catalytic and regulatory chain by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. All three methods gave consistent results, indicating that the molecule consists of 75% (by weight) catalytic chain and 25% regulatory chain. The molecular weight determined by gel filtration, sedimentation velocity, and sedimentation equilibrium experiments was found to be approximately 270,000. These observations establish that this species has the structure C6R4, and is produced by the release of a single regulatory dimer R2 from the intact aspartate transcarbamylase complex. This protein (C6R4) contains 20 cysteines and four zinc ions, consistent with the proposed subunit structure. The purified intermediate C6R4 contains no mercury. The parent molecule C6R6 can be reconstituted from C6R4 by incubation with isolated regulatory subunit (R2) in the presence of zinc and beta-mercaptoethanol. Titration of C6R4 yields an end point which corresponds to the addition of 1 mol of regulatory subunit (R2) per mol of C6R4. The intermediate is quite stable at neutral pH but tends to disproportionate into aspartate transcarbamylase and catalytic subunit after prolonged storage or at elevated pH. The kinetic properties of this species have been investigated. The specific activity of C6R4 is virtually identical with that of the native enzyme but the regulatory properties are substantially reduced. Both homotropic and heterotropic interactions are reduced but not abolished, indicating that the intact structure C6R6 is not required for the allosteric transitions involved in regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1492898688,"Abstract Escherichia coli cells cultured with succinate as the carbon source display apparent K-m values for the uptake of L-glutamate of 10 muM in the absence of added sodium ion and 0.7 muM in the presence of an optimal level of sodium ion (15 to 50 mM). The glutamate transport system of the succinate cultured cells is noncompetitively inhibited by L-aspartate. A protein which binds glutamate and aspartate with K-D values of 0.7 and 1.2 muM, respectively, is released from the succinate cultured cells by osmotic shock or with the formation of spheroplasts during the preparation of membrane vesicles. The membrane vesicles of succinate cultured cells do not retain the whole cell capacity for L-glutamate uptake, but do retain much of the whole cell capacity for L-aspartate uptake. Culture of E. coli cells with glucose as carbon source causes a 2- to 3-fold repression of glutamate-aspartate binding protein but does not affect the velocity component of glutamate transport. As shown by other workers, the glutamate transport system of glucose cultured cells displays a sodium affected K-m value (FRANK, L., AND HOPKINS, I. (1969) J. Bacteriol. 100, 329-336) and is noncompetitively inhibited by L-aspartate (HALPERN, Y. S., AND EVEN-SHOSHAN, A. (1967) J. Bacteriol. 93, 1009-1016). Membrane vesicles prepared from glucose cultured cells retain the whole cell capacity for the uptake of glutamate (LOMBARDI, J. F., AND KABACK, H. R. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7844-7857). The glutamate transport system of E. coli strain W appears to be conditionally dependent on the presence of the osmotic shock-releasable glutamate-aspartate binding protein. The results are interpreted to suggest that the binding protein-ligand complex acts as a substrate which is competitive with unbound substrate(s) for a sodium affected translocation process; the organization and specificity of which are dependent on the carbon source of the culture."
https://openalex.org/W1603970759,"Most work on human erythrocyte interaction with drugs and other compounds has been reported on the basis of total concentrations. Total concentrations alone do not reveal numbers of molecules bound per cell, v. This paper emphasizes determination of v and of binding isotherms, in conjunction with changes in cell morphologies and in hypotonic shock behavior as v is varied. Four drugs and five other compounds were studied, with fresh erythrocytes. The principal findings are: (1) the intact erythrocyte engages in two kinds of binding mechanisms, statistical binding and cooperative binding, depending on the compound. In the case of a detergent, dodecylbenzene sulfonate, the binding is nearly quantitative. (2) The compounds often induce considerable protection against hypotonic hemolysis. However, the binding levels at which maximum protection occurs are rather close to the levels, vL, that occur upon complete conversion to the first distorted morphology. Therefore, the maximally protected erythrocyte may be a distorted erythrocyte. (3) The value n is the apparent total number of sites from Scatchard plotting for compounds which bind in a statistical manner. Levels vp and vw characterize maxima in cooperative binding behavior, also from Scatchard plotting of the data. Despite the wide diversity of over-all levels at which compounds exert their effects, the critical binding levels of and numbers of sites fall into a narrow range:n, vL, vP, and vw are all between 1 and 8 times 10-7 molecules or sites per cell. Most of our data, and that from some other laboratories, indicate that about 2 plus and minus 1 times 10-7 sites per erythrocyte are available for compound binding by the intact cell. Beyond that level, the cell in suspension almost always will be forced into the first obvious morphology change, as seen by phase contrast microscopy. (4) Once stoichiometries are established, the total binding capacity of erythrocytes for such compounds, in blood, can be estimated. An intruding organic molecule would encounter about 6 times as many plasma albumin sites as erythrocyte sites, if the plasma albumin sites were free. However, because albumin in vivo usually forms a complex with one to two fatty acids, the erythrocyte itself is rather likely to act as a transport particle for such compounds."
https://openalex.org/W197604344,"Treatment of Escherichia coli with colicin Ia leads to an inhibition in the active transport of exogenously supplied proline, thiomethyl-beta-D-galactoside and potassium ion. Furthermore, the addition of colicin Ia to cells preloaded with these substances leads to their almost immediate efflux. In contrast, colicin tia treatment enhances by as much as 10-fold the level of accumulation of alpha-methyl-D-glucoside. The colicin Ia-induced stimulation of glucoside accumulation is mediated by the phosphotransferase system. Cells treated with colicin Ia exhibit an increased rate of respiration when glucose is the substrate and a decreased rate when glycerol or succinate is the substrate; The decreased rate of succinate-dependent respiration is probably due to the failure of Ia-treated cells to accumulate succinate."
https://openalex.org/W1556750954,"Porcine beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and angiotensin II were examined as acceptors in the reaction catalyzed by arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase. Both inhibited enzymatic transfer of [14C]arginine from tRNA to bovine albumin. Inhibition was competitive with albumin and the K-i values were, respectively, 15 and 0.8 muM. The expected arginylated compounds were isolated and characterized. Beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and its arginylated product had identical activities in the frog epithelium bioassay. In contrast, the biological activity of angiotensin II was diminished by enzymatic arginylation. The pressor effect of the arginylated derivative on anesthetized rats and its activity on the isolated rat uterus were, respectively, approximately 60% and 20% of those found for the unmodified peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1506699506,"The nucleotide sequence of T4 species I RNA, one of several stable RNA's specifically coded for by bacteriophage T4, has been determined using 32-P-labeled material from T4-infected cultures of Escherichia coli. The purified RNA species which has been sequenced has been shown to hybridize well to T4 DNA (Wilson J.H., Kim, J.S., and Abelson, J.N. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 71, 547-556). The sequence is: pCGAUUCGAGGAAAUAUCUUUGCCGUAAGCCGAGUAGCGUUUUUGACGGAACGUUCGGAUAUGGUUGAGAUAUGGCCUUUUAAAAUAUUGAGUAGCGUCAACUACUUAAUAACCGGGUUCGAAUCCCGGCGUUUCGU-CAA-OHACA-OH. Species I RNA which is 140 nucleotides long is also found to occur in shorter versions with 135 to 136 nucleotides which terminate with a 3'-phosphate. The molecule can be arranged in a secondary structure which shows some striking similarities to the classic cloverleaf pattern of a tRNA. The molecule is specifically cleaved by an E. coli nuclease into three segments by cleavage at a double-stranded region in the molecule. The function of species I RNA is unknown, but evidence presented elsewhere (Paddock, G.V., and Abelson, J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4207-4219) indicates that the gene for this RNA molecule has been preserved in evolution. The position of a mutation within species I RNA has been determined. This mutation results in incorrect processing of the RNA and lower relative yields of the RNA are present."

https://openalex.org/W1491233919,The relationship between the rate of RNA accumulation and the level of guanosine triphosphate was examined. Cells auxotrophic for guanine show a 6-fold drop in the intracellular level of GTP in response to the exhaustion of the exogenous guanosine supply. Contraction of the GTP pool results in a 2.5-fold reduction in the rate of RNA synthesis and the cessation of RNA accumulation. The decrease in the rate of RNA synthesis is seen to occur at the level of chain elongation. Analysis of RNA made in guanine-starved cells by competition-hybridization and sucrose gradient sedimentation suggests that the turnover of newly synthesized ribosomal RNA accounts for the observed failure of RNA to accumulate.
https://openalex.org/W1479814593,The transcription of Azotobacter phage A21 DNA by Escherichia coli or Azotobacter vinelandii RNA polymerase differs from that of some other DNAs in its inhibition by moderate concentrations of KCl. This characteristic results in an apparent low template activity for this DNA as compared with T4 DNA under standard assay conditions. From an analysis of the dependence of the various steps in initiation on KCl it is concluded that the effect is exerted on an equilibrium between an inactive polymerase-DNA complex and an active preintitiation complex. This salt-sensitive equilibrium favors the inactive complex at a lower KCl concentration than with other templates. It can be approached from other low or high salt concentrations at a measurably slow rate.
https://openalex.org/W2054488748,"Analysis of folded chromosomes prepared from amino acid-starved E. coli cells of from a dnaC initiation mutant indicates that a unique structure is associated with completion or near completion of rounds of chromosome replication in E. coli. Chromosomes remain associated with portions of the bacterial cell envelope throughout the DNA replication cycle, but become more rapidly sedimenting as replication proceeds in the absence of reinitiation. Before reinitiation of chromosome replication occurs after restoring required amino acids to amino acid-starved cells or after lowering the temperature in a thermosensitive dnaC mutant, sedimentation velocities of the membrane-associated folded chromosomes decrease substantially. The decrease in sedimentation velocity does not depend on renewed DNA synthesis, but does require the activity of at least the dnaC gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1484318985,"Treatment of the tetrameric alpha2 beta2 protein succinic thiokinase of Escherichia coli with dimethylsuberimidate (DMS) yielded five protein species detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These five protein species had estimated molecular weight values of 29,500, 41,000, 73,000, 117,000, and 132,000, and corresponded to alpha monomer, beta monomer, alpha beta dimer, alpha2 beta trimer and alpha2 beta2 tetramer, respectively. In all cases, the cross-linking produced predominantly the 73,000 molecular weight dimer with respectively lesser amounts of the tetramer and trimer. Succinic thiokinase was also cross-linked by reaction with N, N'-o-phynylenedimaleimide or with N, N'-P-phenylenedimaleimide. In these instances, treatment produced the alpha beta dimer as the only oligomeric species. Ammonolysis of isolated tetramer, trimer, and dimer produced by DMS treatment gave the 29,500 molecular weight monomer (alpha monomer) and the 38,500 molecular weight monomer (beta monomer). The absence of dimers of like subunits and the predominance of the dimer of unlike subunits are consistent with a quaternary structure of the native enzyme in which unlike subunits are closely associated but like subunits are not. Under certain conditions, an additional dimer of approximately 60,000 molecular weight was produced. This appeared to result from cleavage of the beta chain of an alpha beta dimer. Phosphorylation of native succinic thiokinase with [gamma-32P]ATP and [gamma-32P]GTP showed radioactivity only in the alpha monomer. Phosphorylation of enzyme before or after cross-linking showed radioactivity in all cross-linked bands except the beta monomer. Experiments in which the enzyme was titrated with [14C]DMS and trinitrobenzenesulfonate revealed that approximately half of the available amino groups reacted with the diiminoester, but that a small fraction of these (smaller than 20%) had reacted bifunctionally"
https://openalex.org/W1553886131,"The effect of the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase on the rate and asymmetry of the in vitro transcription of Escherichia coli and Azotobacter vinelandii phage DNAs has been studied with purified E. coli and A. vinelandii RNA polymerases and hybrid enzymes containing the core subunits of one enzyme and sigma from the other. The effect of sigma on the rate of transcription is characteristic of the template and not of the enzyme and depends on ionic strength. The rate of transcription of A. vinelandii phage A21 DNA is decreased by sigma at high ionic strength, but shows the more characteristic stimulation at KCl concentrations below 0.05 M. In contrast, the stimulation by sigma of T4 DNA transcription increased with an increase in the KCl concentrations. All combinations of core and sigma subunits behaved similarly with respect to stimulation or inhibition by sigma and with respect to asymmetric transcription of S13 replicative form (RF)DNA. However, the heterologous, but not the homologous combinations of core and sigma transcribed A21 symmetrically. S13 RF DNA in the superhelical, but not in the relaxed configuration, is transcribed asymmetrically by the A. vinelandii core enzyme. A role for the core subunits in specific site recognition is indicated by this observation."
https://openalex.org/W1579522520,"Tetrahydrouridine, a cytidine deaminase inhibitor, prevents periplasmic degradation of deoxycytidine by Escherichia coli B. It does not inhibit deoxycytidine transport and therefore allows an accurate determination of deoxycytidine transport. Data obtained using tetrahydrouridine show that deoxycytidine is transported in E. coli B as the intact nucleoside by an active transport process, with a K-m of 6 times 10-minus 6 M. Cytidine and deoxyadenosine inhibit transport competitively, whereas guanosine has no effect on transport. Arsenate or KCN greatly reduces transport. In a mutant resistant to the nucleoside antibiotic, showdomycin, the active transport of deoxycytidine is lost, and residual slow uptake occurs by passive diffusion. Uracil is accumulated in E. coli B by an active transport process with a K-m of 5 times 10-minus 7 M."
