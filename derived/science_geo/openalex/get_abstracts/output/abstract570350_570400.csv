Bella et al. show that coating the cells with a water-proof fluorinated polymer that contains pigments to absorb ultraviolet light and re-emit it in the visible range can boost cell efficiency and limit photodegradation. The performance and stability of inorganic-organic perovskite solar cells are also limited by the size of the cations required for forming a correct lattice. Saliba et al. show that the rubidium cation, which is too small to form a perovskite by itself, can form a lattice with cesium and organic cations. Solar cells based on these materials have efficiencies exceeding 20% for over 500 hours if given environmental protection by a polymer coating. Science , this issue pp. 203 and 206"
https://openalex.org/W2522417827,"We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell."

We show that rapid light-induced free-radical polymerization at ambient temperature produces multifunctional fluorinated photopolymer coatings that confer luminescent and easy-cleaning features on the front side of the devices, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The luminescent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard illumination. Coated devices reproducibly retain their full functional performance during prolonged operation, even after a series of severe aging tests carried out for more than 6 months."
https://openalex.org/W2511555727,"Efficient exfoliation of graphite in solutions to obtain high-quality graphene flakes is desirable for printable electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and composites. Graphite oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2523411869,"Hybrid lead halide perovskites exhibit carrier properties that resemble those of pristine nonpolar semiconductors despite static and dynamic disorder, but how carriers are protected from efficient scattering with charged defects and optical phonons is unknown. Here, we reveal the carrier protection mechanism by comparing three single-crystal lead bromide perovskites: CH3NH3PbBr3, CH(NH2)2PbBr3, and CsPbBr3. We observed hot fluorescence emission from energetic carriers with ~102-picosecond lifetimes in CH3NH3PbBr3 or CH(NH2)2PbBr3, but not in CsPbBr3. The hot fluorescence is correlated with liquid-like molecular reorientational motions, suggesting that dynamic screening protects energetic carriers via solvation or large polaron formation on time scales competitive with that of ultrafast cooling. Similar protections likely exist for band-edge carriers. The long-lived energetic carriers may enable hot-carrier solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit."
https://openalex.org/W2523989131,"Aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is a metabolic hallmark of activated T cells and has been implicated in augmenting effector T cell responses, including expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), via 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)-mediated mechanisms. Here, we show that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is induced in activated T cells to support aerobic glycolysis but promotes IFN-γ expression independently of its 3'UTR. Instead, LDHA maintains high concentrations of acetyl-coenzyme A to enhance histone acetylation and transcription of Ifng Ablation of LDHA in T cells protects mice from immunopathology triggered by excessive IFN-γ expression or deficiency of regulatory T cells. These findings reveal an epigenetic mechanism by which aerobic glycolysis promotes effector T cell differentiation and suggest that LDHA may be targeted therapeutically in autoinflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2523905541,"INTRODUCTION Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and leads to slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity, and, in the later stages of PD, cognitive impairment. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and neurites. There is degeneration of neurons throughout the nervous system, with the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to the major symptoms of PD. RATIONALE In the brains of PD patients, pathologic α-synuclein seems to spread from cell to cell via self-amplification, propagation, and transmission in a stereotypical and topographical pattern among neighboring cells and/or anatomically connected brain regions. The spread or transmission of pathologic α-synuclein is emerging as a potentially important driver of PD pathogenesis. The underlying mechanisms and molecular entities responsible for the transmission of pathologic α-synuclein from cell to cell are not known, but the entry of pathologic α-synuclein into neurons is thought to occur, in part, through an active clathrin-dependent endocytic process. RESULTS Using recombinant α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) as a model system with which to study the transmission of misfolded α-synuclein from neuron to neuron, we screened a library encoding transmembrane proteins for α-synuclein-biotin PFF–binding candidates via detection with streptavidin-AP (alkaline phosphatase) staining. Three positive clones were identified that bind α-synuclein PFF and include lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), neurexin 1β, and amyloid β precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1). Of these three transmembrane proteins, LAG3 demonstrated the highest ratio of selectivity for α-synuclein PFF over the α-synuclein monomer. α-Synuclein PFF bind to LAG3 in a saturable manner (dissociation constant = 77 nM), whereas the α-synuclein monomer does not bind to LAG3. Co-immunoprecipitation also suggests that pathological α-synuclein PFF specifically bind to LAG3. Tau PFF, β-amyloid oligomer, and β-amyloid PFF do not bind to LAG3, indicating that LAG3 is specific for α-synuclein PFF. The internalization of α-synuclein PFF involves LAG3 because deletion of LAG3 reduces the endocytosis of α-synuclein PFF. LAG3 colocalizes with the endosomal guanosine triphosphatases Rab5 and Rab7 and coendocytoses with pathologic α-synuclein. Neuron-to-neuron transmission of pathologic α-synuclein and the accompanying pathology and neurotoxicity is substantially attenuated by deletion of LAG3 or by antibodies to LAG3. The lack of LAG3 also substantially delayed α-synuclein PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. CONCLUSION We discovered that pathologic α-synuclein transmission and toxicity is initiated by binding to LAG3 and that neuron-to-neuron transmission of pathological α-synuclein involves the endocytosis of exogenous α-synuclein PFF by the engagement of LAG3 on neurons. Depletion of LAG3 or antibodies to LAG3 substantially reduces the pathology set in motion by the transmission of pathologic α-synuclein. The identification of LAG3 as an α-synuclein PFF–binding protein provides a new target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies. LAG3 deletion or antibodies to LAG3 delay α-synuclein PFF transmission. Compared with wild-type neurons, binding and endocytosis of α-synuclein PFF is dramatically reduced with antibodies to LAG3 or when LAG3 is deleted, resulting in delayed pathologic α-synuclein transmission and toxicity.

Using 835 inventories covering 4660 species of woody plants, we show marked floristic turnover among inventories and regions, which may be higher than in other neotropical biomes, such as savanna.

Asylum seekers who have higher employability, have more consistent asylum testimonies and severe vulnerabilities, and are Christian rather than Muslim received the greatest public support. These results suggest that public preferences over asylum seekers are shaped by sociotropic evaluations of their potential economic contributions, humanitarian concerns about the deservingness of their claims, and anti-Muslim bias. These preferences are similar across respondents of different ages, education levels, incomes, and political ideologies, as well as across the surveyed countries.

https://openalex.org/W2522261353,"In vitro, some RNAs can form stable four-stranded structures known as G-quadruplexes. Although RNA G-quadruplexes have been implicated in posttranscriptional gene regulation and diseases, direct evidence for their formation in cells has been lacking. Here, we identified thousands of mammalian RNA regions that can fold into G-quadruplexes in vitro, but in contrast to previous assumptions, these regions were overwhelmingly unfolded in cells. Model RNA G-quadruplexes that were unfolded in eukaryotic cells were folded when ectopically expressed in Escherichia coli; however, they impaired translation and growth, which helps explain why we detected few G-quadruplex-forming regions in bacterial transcriptomes. Our results suggest that eukaryotes have a robust machinery that globally unfolds RNA G-quadruplexes, whereas some bacteria have instead undergone evolutionary depletion of G-quadruplex-forming sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2523250432,"When confronted with an adaptive challenge, such as extreme temperature, closely related species frequently evolve similar phenotypes using the same genes. Although such repeated evolution is thought to be less likely in highly polygenic traits and distantly related species, this has not been tested at the genome scale. We performed a population genomic study of convergent local adaptation among two distantly related species, lodgepole pine and interior spruce. We identified a suite of 47 genes, enriched for duplicated genes, with variants associated with spatial variation in temperature or cold hardiness in both species, providing evidence of convergent local adaptation despite 140 million years of separate evolution. These results show that adaptation to climate can be genetically constrained, with certain key genes playing nonredundant roles."

https://openalex.org/W2522045642,"Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used 14C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil carbon by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2524248040,"INTRODUCTION Cancer arises from clonal expansion of a single cell. Yet, most human cancers are characterized by extensive intratumor heterogeneity and comprise various subpopulations of cells with distinct phenotypes and biological properties. Intratumor heterogeneity poses major challenges in understanding cancers, managing patients, and designing effective treatment strategies. Functional heterogeneity within individual tumors is partly due to the presence of genetically distinct subclonal cell populations. Furthermore, interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment can alter the phenotype of cancer cells via nongenetic mechanisms. The combination of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic changes occurring during tumor growth generates functionally distinct subsets of cells that differentially contribute to tumor maintenance. RATIONALE In many cancers, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity can be mapped to distinct differentiation states, suggesting that cellular hierarchies established during tumor growth may affect the long-term proliferative potential of cancer cells. To shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the generation of these hierarchies, we searched for epigenetic mechanisms that determine which cancer cells can preserve unlimited proliferative potential, and thus the ability to drive long-term tumor growth, and which cells lose this ability through a differentiation process. RESULTS We found that, in several cancer types, individual tumors exhibit high heterogeneity of the major chromatin protein linker histone H1.0, showing strongly reduced H1.0 levels in cells characterized by long-term self-renewal ability and tumorigenic potential and higher levels in nontumorigenic cells. Combined analysis of pan-cancer patient data sets and experimental alteration of the H1F0 locus in tumor cells revealed that heterogeneous H1.0 expression patterns are partly due to differential methylation of an enhancer region that dynamically modulates H1.0 expression within tumors. Using a controlled system to model functional intratumor heterogeneity, we showed that maintenance of cell tumorigenic potential required silencing of H1.0 to avoid loss of unlimited proliferative capacity through differentiation. Mechanistically, absence of H1.0 led to destabilization of nucleosome-DNA interactions in AT-rich genomic regions and coordinated derepression of large sets of neighboring genes, resulting in activation of transcriptional programs that support cancer cell self-renewal. Gene expression changes induced by H1.0 loss were reversible, and epigenetic states restricting cell proliferative potential were reestablished upon H1.0 reexpression. In multiple cancer types, in agreement with the observed inhibition of cancer cell self-renewal by H1.0, patients expressing overall strongly reduced levels of H1.0 showed a significantly worse outcome than patients expressing higher H1.0 levels. CONCLUSION Intratumor heterogeneity has emerged as a general feature of cancer, but the molecular features underlying functionally diverse cellular phenotypes have been elusive. Our results uncover epigenetic determinants of tumor-maintaining cells and identify an integral component of chromatin as an important regulator of cell differentiation states within tumors. We propose that only cells insensitive to extracellular differentiation cues, capable of permanently silencing H1.0, can act as self-renewing tumor-maintaining cells and that such a mechanism supports maintenance of several types of cancer. Our results suggest that intervention aimed at restoring high levels of H1.0 in all cancer cells may enhance the differentiation process that naturally occurs during tumor growth and may be beneficial for therapeutic purposes.

Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8-moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates.

https://openalex.org/W2528438592,"In spite of a high prevalence of HIV infection among adolescents and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa, uptake of HIV testing and counseling among youth in the region remains sub-optimal. The objective of this study was to assess factors that influence uptake of HIV testing and counseling among youth aged 15-24 years in sub-Saharan Africa.This study used the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from countries that represent four geographic regions of sub-Saharan Africa: Congo (Brazzaville), representing central Africa (DHS 2011-2012); Mozambique, representing southern Africa (DHS 2011); Nigeria, representing western Africa (DHS 2013); and Uganda, representing eastern Africa (DHS 2011). Analyses were restricted to 23,367 male and female respondents aged 15-24 years with complete data on the variables of interest. Chi-square tests and logistic regression models were used to assess predictors of HIV testing. Statistical significance was set at p< 0.01.The analysis revealed that a majority of the respondents were female (78.1%) and aged 20-24-years (60.7%). Only a limited proportion of respondents (36.5%) had ever tested for HIV and even fewer (25.7%) demonstrated comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. There was a significant association between HIV testing and respondents' gender, age, age at sexual debut, and comprehensive knowledge of HIV in the pooled sample. Older youth (adjusted OR (aOR) = 2.19; 99% CI = 1.99-2.40) and those with comprehensive knowledge of HIV (aOR = 1.98; 1.76-2.22) had significantly higher odds of ever being tested for HIV than younger respondents and those with limited HIV/AIDS knowledge respectively. Furthermore, men had lower odds of HIV testing than women (aOR = 0.32; 0.28-0.37).Reaching youth in sub-Saharan Africa for HIV testing continues to be a challenge. Public health programs that seek to increase HIV counseling and testing among youth should pay particular attention to efforts that target high-risk subpopulations of youth. The results further suggest that these initiatives would be strengthened by including strategies to increase HIV comprehensive knowledge."

https://openalex.org/W2558984237,"The pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) is a pTα-β heterodimer functioning in early αβ T cell development. Although once thought to be ligand-autonomous, recent studies show that pre-TCRs participate in thymic repertoire formation through recognition of peptides bound to major histocompatibility molecules (pMHC). Using optical tweezers, we probe pre-TCR bonding with pMHC at the single molecule level. Like the αβTCR, the pre-TCR is a mechanosensor undergoing force-based structural transitions that dynamically enhance bond lifetimes and exploiting allosteric control regulated via the Cβ FG loop region. The pre-TCR structural transitions exhibit greater reversibility than TCRαβ and ordered force-bond lifetime curves. Higher piconewton force requires binding through both complementarity determining region loops and hydrophobic Vβ patch apposition. This patch functions in the pre-TCR as a surrogate Vα domain, fostering ligand promiscuity to favor development of β chains with self-reactivity but is occluded by α subunit replacement of pTα upon αβTCR formation. At the double negative 3 thymocyte stage where the pre-TCR is first expressed, pre-TCR interaction with self-pMHC ligands imparts growth and survival advantages as revealed in thymic stromal cultures, imprinting fundamental self-reactivity in the T cell repertoire. Collectively, our data imply the existence of sequential mechanosensor αβTCR repertoire tuning via the pre-TCR."

This record indicates that Po2 declined by 7 per mil (0.7%) over the past 800,000 years, requiring that O2 sinks were ~2% larger than sources. This decline is consistent with changes in burial and weathering fluxes of organic carbon and pyrite driven by either Neogene cooling or increasing Pleistocene erosion rates.

Membrane vesicle transport assays are widely used to study interactions with these proteins. Since albumin has been found to affect the kinetics of metabolic enzymes in similar membrane preparations, we investigated whether albumin affects the kinetic parameters of efflux transport. We found that albumin increased the Vmax of 5(6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (CDCF) and estradiol-17-β-D-glucuronide uptake into MRP2 vesicles in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) by 2 and 1.5-fold, respectively, while BSA increased Lucifer yellow uptake by 30% in BCRP vesicles. Km values increased slightly, but the change was not statistically significant. The effect of BSA on substrate uptake was dependent on the vesicle amount, while increasing BSA concentration did not significantly improve substrate uptake. These results indicate a minor effect of albumin on MRP2 and BCRP, but it should be considered if albumin is added to transporter assays for example as a solubilizer, since the effect may be substrate or transporter specific."
https://openalex.org/W2529573314,"MAGI-1 is a multidomain cytosolic scaffolding protein that in the kidney is specifically located at the podocyte slit diaphragm, a specialized junction that is universally injured in proteinuric diseases. There it interacts with several essential molecules, including nephrin and neph1, which are required for slit diaphragm formation and as an intracellular signaling hub. Here, we show that diminished MAGI-1 expression in cultured podocytes reduced nephrin and neph1 membrane localization and weakened tight junction integrity. Global magi1 knock-out mice, however, demonstrated normal glomerular histology and function into adulthood. We hypothesized that a second mild but complementary genetic insult might induce glomerular disease susceptibility in these mice. To identify such a gene, we utilized the developing fly eye to test for functional complementation between MAGI and its binding partners. In this way, we identified diminished expression of fly Hibris (nephrin) or Roughest (neph1) as dramatically exacerbating the effects of MAGI depletion. Indeed, when these combinations were studied in mice, the addition of nephrin, but not neph1, heterozygosity to homozygous deletion of MAGI-1 resulted in spontaneous glomerulosclerosis. In cultured podocytes, MAGI-1 depletion reduced intercellular contact-induced Rap1 activation, a pathway critical for proper podocyte function. Similarly, magi1 knock-out mice showed diminished glomerular Rap1 activation, an effect dramatically enhanced by concomitant nephrin haploinsufficiency. Finally, combined overexpression of MAGI-1 and nephrin increased Rap1 activation, but not when substituting a mutant MAGI-1 that cannot bind nephrin. We conclude that the interaction between nephrin and MAGI-1 regulates Rap1 activation in podocytes to maintain long term slit diaphragm structure."

To study the properties of the hydrophobins, we used N-terminal and C-terminal GFP as a fusion partner. Transient expression of the hydrophobin fusions in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed large variability in accumulation levels, which was also reflected in formation of protein bodies. In two-phase separations, only HFBII and HFBIV were able to concentrate GFP into the surfactant phase from a plant extract. The separation efficiency of both tags was comparable to HFBI. When the accumulation was tested side by side, HFBII-GFP gave a better yield than HFBI-GFP, while the yield of HFBIV-GFP remained lower. Thus we present here two alternatives for HFBI as functional fusion tags for plant-based protein production and first step purification."

Although the White House has grasped the urgency of scientific responses to the unprecedented change gripping the Arctic, we think the ministerial delegates could aspire to address “What science needs to be done?” and “How is it done?” There are opportunities to better shape aspects of the science that should be focused on the needs of Arctic policy and management, in addition to fundamental curiosity-driven science. Also critical is the question of how decisions the ministers make should be actualized, whether through the Arctic Council (AC), the most formalized body for Arctic cooperation, or through other existing or new mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2529079476,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) is thought to be a tumor suppressor gene, as indicated by a mutational analysis of pituitary somatotroph adenomas. However, the physiological significance of AIP inactivation in somatotroph cells remains unclear. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we identified a GH3 cell clone (termed GH3-FTY) in which Aip was genetically disrupted, and subsequently investigated its character with respect to growth hormone (Gh) synthesis and proliferation. Compared with GH3, GH3-FTY cells showed remarkably increased Gh production and a slight increase in cell proliferation. Gh-induced Stat3 phosphorylation is known to be a mechanism of Gh oversecretion in GH3. Interestingly, phosphorylated-Stat3 expression in GH3-FTY cells was increased more compared with GH3 cells, suggesting a stronger drive for this mechanism in GH3-FTY. The phenotypes of GH3-FTY concerning Gh overproduction, cell proliferation, and increased Stat3 phosphorylation were significantly reversed by the exogenous expression of Aip. GH3-FTY cells were less sensitive to somatostatin than GH3 cells in the suppression of cell proliferation, which might be associated with the reduced expression of somatostatin receptor type 2. GH3-FTY xenografts in BALB/c nude mice (GH3-FTY mice) formed more mitotic somatotroph tumors than GH3 xenografts (GH3 mice), as also evidenced by increased Ki67 scores. GH3-FTY mice were also much larger and had significantly higher plasma Gh levels than GH3 mice. Furthermore, GH3-FTY mice showed relative insulin resistance compared with GH3 mice. In conclusion, we established a somatotroph cell line, GH3-FTY, which possessed prominent Gh secretion and mitotic features associated with the disruption of Aip."
https://openalex.org/W2527737734,"Layer Vb pyramidal cells are the major output neurons of the neocortex and transmit the outcome of cortical columnar signal processing to distant target areas. At the same time they contribute to local tactile information processing by emitting recurrent axonal collaterals into the columnar microcircuitry. It is, however, not known how exactly the two types of pyramidal cells, called slender-tufted and thick-tufted, contribute to the local circuitry. Here, we investigated in the rat barrel cortex the detailed quantitative morphology of biocytin-filled layer Vb pyramidal cells in vitro, which were characterized for their intrinsic electrophysiology with special emphasis on their action potential firing pattern. Since we stained the same slices for cytochrome oxidase, we could also perform layer- and column-related analyses. Our results suggest that in layer Vb the unambiguous action potential firing patterns ""regular spiking (RS)"" and ""repetitive burst spiking (RB)"" (previously called intrinsically burst spiking) correlate well with a distinct morphology. RS pyramidal cells are somatodendritically of the slender-tufted type and possess numerous local intralaminar and intracolumnar axonal collaterals, mostly reaching layer I. By contrast, their transcolumnar projections are less well developed. The RB pyramidal cells are somatodendritically of the thick-tufted type and show only relatively sparse local axonal collaterals, which are preferentially emitted as long horizontal or oblique infragranular collaterals. However, contrary to many previous slice studies, a substantial number of these neurons also showed axonal collaterals reaching layer I. Thus, electrophysiologically defined pyramidal cells of layer Vb show an input and output pattern which suggests RS cells to be more ""locally segregating"" signal processors whereas RB cells seem to act more on a ""global integrative"" scale."
https://openalex.org/W2557499880,"Exact prediction of Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) epidemics must improve to establish effective preventive measures in China. A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was applied to establish a highly predictive model of HFRS. Meteorological factors were considered external variables through a cross correlation analysis. Then, these factors were included in the SARIMA model to determine if they could improve the predictive ability of HFRS epidemics in the region. The optimal univariate SARIMA model was identified as (0,0,2)(1,1,1)12. The R2 of the prediction of HFRS cases from January 2014 to December 2014 was 0.857, and the Root mean square error (RMSE) was 2.708. However, the inclusion of meteorological variables as external regressors did not significantly improve the SARIMA model. This result is likely because seasonal variations in meteorological variables were included in the seasonal characteristics of the HFRS itself."
https://openalex.org/W2564086839,"The impact of variation in mating system on genetic diversity is a well-debated topic in evolutionary biology. The diploid sexual race of Cyrtomium falcatum (Japanese holly fern) shows mating system variation, i.e., it displays two different types of sexual expression (gametangia formation) in gametophytes: mixed (M) type and separate (S) type. We examined whether there is variation in the selfing rate among populations of this species, and evaluated the relationship between mating system, genetic diversity and effective population size using microsatellites. In this study, we developed eight new microsatellite markers and evaluated genetic diversity and structure of seven populations (four M-type and three S-type). Past effective population sizes (Ne) were inferred using Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). The values of fixation index (FIS), allelic richness (AR) and gene diversity (h) differed significantly between the M-type (FIS: 0.626, AR: 1.999, h: 0.152) and the S-type (FIS: 0.208, AR: 2.718, h: 0.367) populations (when admixed individuals were removed from two populations). Although evidence of past bottleneck events was detected in all populations by ABC, the current Ne of the M-type populations was about a third of that of the S-type populations. These results suggest that the M-type populations have experienced more frequent bottlenecks, which could be related to their higher colonization ability via gametophytic selfing. Although high population differentiation among populations was detected (FST = 0.581, F’ST = 0.739), there was no clear genetic differentiation between the M- and S-types. Instead, significant isolation by distance was detected among all populations. These results suggest that mating system variation in this species is generated by the selection for single spore colonization during local extinction and recolonization events and there is no genetic structure due to mating system."
https://openalex.org/W2523883945,"All good things must come to an end, and so it will be on 30 September when the Rosetta spacecraft makes its planned soft landing onto the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the culmination of 2 years of close-up studies. Solar power has waned as 67P9s orbit takes it and Rosetta farther from the sun, and so the mission team decided to go on a last data-gathering descent before the lights go out. This last data grab is a bonus after a mission that is already changing theorists9 views about how comets and planets arose early in the solar system. Several Rosetta observations suggest that comets form not from jolting mergers of larger cometesimals, meters to kilometers across, but rather from the gentle coalescence of clouds of pebbles. And the detection of a single, feather-light, millimeter-sized particle—preserved since the birth of the solar system—should further the view of a gentle birth."
https://openalex.org/W2524676297,"Four years ago, under Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Canada rewrote the nation9s rules for assessing the environmental impacts of projects such as mines, dams, and pipelines. The 2012 rewrite of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) cut the number of mandatory reviews from thousands to a handful, reduced input from independent experts and the public, and shifted some oversight from national to provincial governments. Harper said the changes were needed to modernize the rules and spur economic growth. But many of the nation9s environmental scientists were dismayed, saying the changes snubbed science and put key ecosystems at risk. Now, under new Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, researchers are getting a chance to help rewrite the rules again. This month, an expert panel appointed by Trudeau9s government launched a 3-month-long, nationwide listening tour to collect ideas for revising the CEAA. Its goal is to issue recommendations on how Trudeau can fulfill his promises to restore confidence in Canada9s environmental reviews and ensure that decisions on major projects are based on science, facts, and evidence. The effort—part of Trudeau9s broader push to revamp Canada9s environmental policies—is likely to fuel fierce debate."

https://openalex.org/W2521074474,"For decades, astronomers have suspected that planetary nebulae—dazzlingly colorful shrouds of gas cast off by dying stars—owe their weird but often symmetrical shapes to the sculpting magnetic forces of two stars orbiting each other at the nebula9s center. Now, a study has helped confirm theorists9 picture that many nebulae are the handiwork of binary stars in which the companions orbit each other so closely that they share the same atmosphere. There are more than a thousand known planetary nebulae, and few have the simple, spherical shape that would be expected from a solitary star expelling its outer layers in dying gasps. Instead, they often look like hourglasses or butterflies. The new study identifies eight star systems where the orbital axis for a binary pair lines up with the long axis of symmetry for the nebula—suggesting that theorists were right all along."
https://openalex.org/W2521342291,"The necklaces are tiny: beads of animal teeth, shells, and ivory no more than a centimeter long. But they provoked an outsized debate that has raged for decades. Found in the Grotte du Renne cave at Arcy-sur-Cure in central France, they were reportedly found in the same layers as fossils from Neandertals. Some archaeologists credited the artifacts, described as part of the Châtelperronian culture, to our archaic cousins. But others argued that Neandertals were incapable of the kind of symbolic expression reflected in jewelry and insisted that modern humans must have been the creators. Now, a pioneering study uses ancient proteins to identify Neandertal bone fragments from Grotte du Renne for direct radiocarbon dating. The team finds that the link between the archaic humans and the artifacts is real."
https://openalex.org/W2521524288,"According to Aboriginal myth, the first person to come to Australia was a woman named Warramurrungunji. She emerged from the sea and then headed inland, where she created children and put each one in a specific place on the landscape, giving each a specific language as she did so. That myth describes the complexities of Australia9s linguistic landscape, which linguists have long struggled to unravel. In recent years they have begun to borrow methods used in biology to derive evolutionary trees to tease apart the history of language. This week the approach takes a major step forward with a combined genetic and linguistic study that paints a picture of how people entered and spread across Australia, giving birth to new languages as they went. It9s a modern version of Warramurrungunji9s story, and marks a milestone in collaboration between geneticists and linguists, offering a detailed vision of Australia9s prehistory."
https://openalex.org/W2522340699,"Depending on how you count, there are roughly a dozen subduction zones around the globe, regions where ocean crust is dragged down into Earth along plate boundaries, leading to large earthquakes and melting in the mantle that causes magma to burble up. Subduction zones not only pose a threat to humans, but also act as critical gears in the rock cycle, recycling crust into Earth's interior and pumping up new volcanic rock. Scientists are now cooking up a plan for a major new research program: the Subduction Zone Observatory (SZO). Just where the SZO will be located, what instruments it will include, and what it might cost will come into focus during a National Science Foundation (NSF)–sponsored workshop next week. But many think the observatory could be NSF's next major investment in earth science research, following the $200 million EarthScope project, which began in 2003."

Forming the backbone of the center, slated for completion in 2023, will be a powerful synchrotron—the Beijing Advanced Photon Source—a supercomputer, and two other big-ticket facilities that will together cost $1.4 billion to build. More such laboratories are on the drawing board."
https://openalex.org/W2524477549,"Next week, the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics will be announced, and many scientists expect it to honor the detection of ripples in space called gravitational waves, reported in February by scientists working with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). If other prizes are a guide, the Nobel will go to the troika of physicists who 32 years ago conceived of LIGO: Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and Ronald Drever and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. But some influential physicists, including previous Nobel laureates, say the prize, which can be split three ways at most, should include somebody else: Barry Barish, a particle physicist at Caltech. Barish didn't invent LIGO, but he made it happen. The hardware at LIGO's two observatories in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana; the structure of the collaboration; even the big-science character of gravitational wave research—all were molded by Barish, who is now 80. Without Barish, some physicists say, there would have been no discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2526054931,"Earlier this year, the Cassini spacecraft screwed up an orbital maneuver at Saturn because of a problem with its radio connection to Earth. The incident was one of several recent glitches in the Deep Space Network (DSN), NASA's complex of large radio antennas in California, Spain, and Australia. For more than 50 years, the DSN has been the lifeline for nearly every spacecraft beyond Earth's orbit, relaying commands from mission control and receiving data from the distant probe. On 30 September, in a meeting at NASA headquarters, officials will brief planetary scientists on the network's status. Many are worried, based on anecdotal reports, that budget cuts and age have taken a toll that could endanger the complex maneuvers that Cassini and Juno, a spacecraft now at Jupiter, will require over the next year."
