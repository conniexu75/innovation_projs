These involve reengagement of memory B cell (MBC) clones, the diversity and specificity of which determine the breadth and effectiveness of the ensuing antibody response. Using prime-boost models in mice, we find that secondary responses are characterized by a clonality bottleneck that restricts the engagement of the large diversity of MBC clones generated by priming. Rediversification of mutated MBCs is infrequent within secondary germinal centers (GCs), which instead consist predominantly of B cells without prior GC experience or detectable clonal expansion. Few MBC clones, generally derived from higher-affinity germline precursors, account for the majority of secondary antibody responses, while most primary-derived clonal diversity is not reengaged detectably by boosting. Understanding how to counter this bottleneck may improve our ability to elicit antibodies to non-immunodominant epitopes by vaccination.

Understanding how to counter this bottleneck may improve our ability to elicit antibodies to non-immunodominant epitopes by vaccination. One of the hallmarks of adaptive immunity is that the potency of immune responses increases, often dramatically, with repeated exposure to an antigen. This is most evident in the humoral response, where antibodies generated the second time an antigen is encountered are both more abundant and of higher average affinity than those produced during the first encounter (Gray, 1993Gray D. Immunological memory.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 49-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This progressiveness is widely exploited by vaccination and underlies the need for booster doses to acquire and maintain the high serum antibody titers required for protection. Enhanced secondary antibody responses are partly explained by the generation, by primary immunization, of a population of memory B cells (MBCs) (Gray, 1993Gray D. Immunological memory.Annu. Rev.

Unique requirements for reactivation of virus-specific memory B lymphocytes.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At least a fraction of MBCs have undergone somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs) formed during the primary response, which in general endows them with higher affinity for antigen when compared to their unmutated precursors (Berek et al., 1987Berek C.

This increased affinity synergizes with the efficiency with which MBCs differentiate into PCs to generate the high titers typical of the secondary response. Whereas the formation and reactivation of MBCs have been studied in detail at the population level (Kurosaki et al., 2015Kurosaki T. Kometani K. Ise W. Memory B cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, Weisel and Shlomchik, 2017Weisel F. Shlomchik M. Memory B Cells of Mice and Humans.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 35: 255-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), less is understood about how the clonal diversity of responding B cells, and ultimately of the PC compartment, is affected by the transition from primary to recall response. For example, our recent work shows that early GCs triggered by immunization with the model antigen chicken gamma globulin (CGG) contain on average 80–90 independently rearranged B cell clones per GC (Tas et al., 2016Tas J.M. Mesin L. Pasqual G. Targ S. Jacobsen J.T. Mano Y.M. Chen C.S. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Browne E.P. et al.Visualizing antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers.Science. 2016; 351: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Given that MBC generation in mice has been shown to occur most efficiently prior to or early during the GC reaction, when clonal diversity is at its peak (Weisel et al., 2016Weisel F.J. Zuccarino-Catania G.V. Chikina M. Shlomchik M.J. A Temporal Switch in the Germinal Center Determines Differential Output of Memory B and Plasma Cells.Immunity. 2016; 44: 116-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the MBC repertoire is expected to be highly diverse. Notwithstanding, previous studies suggest that only a small number of B cell clones—usually mutated and affinity matured—are productively engaged by booster immunization, at least in the stereotypical (and a priori low diversity) responses of mice to haptens (Blier and Bothwell, 1987Blier P.R.

Clarifying these dynamics may help explain immunological phenomena such as immunodominance and “original antigenic sin” (Fazekas de St. Groth and Webster, 1966aFazekas de St. Groth Webster R.G.

Wilson P.C. Germinal center selection and the antibody response to influenza.Cell. 2015; 163: 545-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to rapidly differentiating into PCs, at least some populations of MBCs have the ability to reenter GC reactions upon recall immunization. The rules controlling GC reentry are currently a topic of interest (Dogan et al., 2009Dogan I. Bertocci B. Vilmont V. Delbos F. Mégret J. Storck S. Reynaud C.A. Weill J.C.

Immunol. 2014; 15: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) have the potential to reenter GCs when adoptively transferred into different types of recipient mice. However, with one exception (McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2015McHeyzer-Williams L.J. Milpied P.J. Okitsu S.L. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Class-switched memory B cells remodel BCRs within secondary germinal centers.Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), these studies do not address whether this potential is realized under non-transfer conditions, where numbers of memory B and T cells as well as preexisting antibody titers could all play a role. Critically, none of these studies address the relative contribution to secondary GCs of naive-derived B cells, which could potentially compete with MBC-derived clones, restricting their ability to rediversify in secondary responses. Resolving this issue will be important for any attempts to elicit the expansion and hypermutation of B cell clones with defined specificities by iteratively recalling MBCs to sequential GC reactions, as is thought to be required for the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza and HIV by vaccination (Burton et al., 2012Burton D.R. Ahmed R. Barouch D.H. Butera S.T. Crotty S. Godzik A. Kaufmann D.E. McElrath M.J. Nussenzweig M.C. Pulendran B. et al.A Blueprint for HIV Vaccine Discovery.Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12: 396-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To clarify these points, we carried out a clonal analysis of the response to protein boosting in mice primed either by protein immunization or by influenza virus infection. We show that, contrary to our expectations, recall GCs are composed overwhelmingly of clones without prior GC experience, likely naive in origin, and rediversification of previously matured MBCs in secondary GCs is rare and restricted to a small contingent of clones. Although a larger fraction of secondary PCs and plasmablasts (PBs) is MBC derived, these compartments are also limited to few clones, while most primary-derived diversity can be found within a pool of largely IgM+ MBCs that is not productively engaged by boosting. These findings identify hurdles that may need to be overcome when attempting to elicit highly mutated antibodies to non-immunodominant epitopes, as is thought to be required for effective vaccination against influenza and HIV. To investigate the clonal dynamics of the recall B cell response, we first immunized mice subcutaneously (s.c.) in the right hind footpad (FP) with the model antigen CGG in alum adjuvant to generate a primary GC in the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN). Thirty days later, when primary GCs have largely subsided (Figure 1B), we boosted the contralateral FP of the same mouse with the same protein and adjuvant combination to generate a recall response (Figure 1A). This anatomical segregation ensures that the recall response is generated de novo from circulating MBCs, rather than by reactivation of B cells still present in residual GCs in the primary lymph node (LN). GCs in the recall (left) pLN are readily detectable at 6 days and reach peak size at 9 days post-boost (Figure 1B). As classically described for the secondary response (Liu et al., 1991Liu Y.J. Zhang J. Lane P.J. Chan E.Y. MacLennan I.C. Sites of specific B cell activation in primary and secondary responses to T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens.Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2951-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), boost-derived GCs reached higher peak size and decayed more rapidly than those formed by primary immunization (Figure 1C), confirming the anamnestic nature of the response. We began by determining the clonal composition of recall GCs in this model. We hypothesized that, if recall GCs rely primarily on MBCs generated from the most expanded and affinity-matured clones of the primary response, they would be enriched in larger clones, with higher SHM load, and that would be present across multiple GCs in the boosted pLN. Using in situ photoactivation to isolate B cells from individual GCs by flow cytometry (Tas et al., 2016Tas J.M. Mesin L. Pasqual G. Targ S. Jacobsen J.T. Mano Y.M. Chen C.S. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A.

Germinal center dynamics revealed by multiphoton microscopy with a photoactivatable fluorescent reporter.Cell. 2010; 143: 592-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), we sequenced the Ig genes (Tiller et al., 2009Tiller T. Busse C.E. Wardemann H. Cloning and expression of murine Ig genes from single B cells.J. Immunol. Methods. 2009; 350: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) of single B cells from two GCs per pLN obtained at 6 days after boost (Figure 1D). For reference, we compared these data to our previously published analysis of day 6 primary GCs under similar conditions (Tas et al., 2016Tas J.M. Mesin L. Pasqual G. Targ S. Jacobsen J.T. Mano Y.M. Chen C.S. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Browne E.P. et al.Visualizing antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers.Science. 2016; 351: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Counter to our prediction, secondary GCs were at least as clonally diverse as primary GCs (mean Chao1 estimated richness = 94 versus 118 clones per GC, Gini index (a measure of the unevenness of expansion across clones) = 0.26 versus 0.24 for primary and recall GCs, respectively) (Figures 1D and 1E). The fraction of clones present in both GCs from the same pLN was lower in the recall than in the primary response (mean 17% versus 4.1% of clones also found in the neighboring GC in primary and recall responses, respectively), suggesting that most of the precursors of secondary GC B cells were not present in multiple copies prior to boosting (Figures 1D and 1E). B cells in recall GCs had SHM loads (Figure 1F) that were much lower than those of B cells sorted from the residual primary GCs still present in the right pLN at day 36 post-priming (mean VH nucleotide SHM = 1.8 versus 9.2, respectively) and only slightly higher than those of early primary GC B cells (mean = 1.5), possibly because our earlier data were obtained from mice with only one intact copy of activation-induced deaminase (AID) (Tas et al., 2016Tas J.M. Mesin L. Pasqual G. Targ S. Jacobsen J.T. Mano Y.M. Chen C.S. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Browne E.P. et al.Visualizing antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers.Science. 2016; 351: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, the clonal diversity and SHM load of early recall GCs resemble those of early primary GCs, rather than those of more recently generated memory. Rediversification of heavily mutated and expanded MBC clones is therefore not a prominent feature of the secondary GC response in this setting. Our photoactivation experiments showed that recall GCs consisted primarily of B cells with few if any signs of previous GC experience. To test this formally, we fate-mapped B cells activated during the primary response using the AicdaCreERT2/+.Rosa26Confetti/Confetti (AID-Confetti) mouse model, in which recombination of a “Brainbow” multicolor fate-mapping allele is induced in B cells expressing AID (encoded by Aicda) upon administration of tamoxifen (Dogan et al., 2009Dogan I.

Treatment with tamoxifen by gavage at days 4, 6, and 8 after primary immunization (which spans the late-pre-GC and early GC stages; Schwickert et al., 2011Schwickert T.A. Victora G.D. Fooksman D.R. Kamphorst A.O. Mugnier M.R. Gitlin A.D. Dustin M.L. Nussenzweig M.C. A dynamic T cell-limited checkpoint regulates affinity-dependent B cell entry into the germinal center.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) led to recombination of ∼70% of all GC B cells, as measured 7 days after the final tamoxifen dose. Imaging of explanted pLNs at 6 days post-boost revealed that fate-mapped B cells were relatively rare in recall GCs. One-third of these structures (34%) were entirely devoid of fate-mapped B cells, and another 46% had <10% labeled B cells (Figures 2B and 2C). By contrast, fate-mapped cells were abundant in the LN medullary region, where LN-resident PBs are expected to accumulate (Figure 2D). Quantification of fate-mapped cells by flow cytometry (as detailed in Figure S1) confirmed these observations: whereas on average 70% of primary GC B cells were labeled at day 15 after immunization and 35% of cells were still labeled in residual GCs at day 30, only 3.8% of B cells in recall GCs were labeled at 6 days after boost (Figure 2E). As suggested by the concentration of fluorescent cells in the LN medulla, an average of 47% of local PBs were fate-mapped when assayed by flow cytometry (Figure 2E). Thus, the scarcity of fate-mapped clones in recall GCs was not due to a failure to generate recallable fate-mapped MBCs. Identical results were obtained with a different fate-mapping system where the GC-specific and highly efficient S1pr2-CreERT2 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic strain (Shinnakasu et al., 2016Shinnakasu R. Inoue T. Kometani K. Moriyama S. Adachi Y. Nakayama M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama H. Okada T. Kurosaki T. Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment.Nat.

We performed a series of controls to rule out that inefficient recruitment of GC-experienced MBCs to recall GCs was due to our choice of prime-boost protocol (Figure 2G). These included: omitting the primary immunization (while maintaining the tamoxifen treatment) to ascertain that labeled cells in the recall were indeed primary derived; omitting the adjuvant from the boost; changing both prime and boost adjuvants to a squalene-based formulation (Addavax) or to a more potent form of alum (alhydrogel) (Cain et al., 2013Cain D.W. Sanders S.E. Cunningham M.M. Kelsoe G. Disparate adjuvant properties among three formulations of “alum”.Vaccine. 2013; 31: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); and changing immunogen from CGG to a recombinant cysteine-stabilized trimeric form of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) H1 A/Puerto Rico/08/1934 (H1PR8) (Figure S2), none of which substantially increased the participation of fate-mapped cells in secondary GCs. Boosting the same LN used for primary immunization resulted in GCs that contained twice the frequency of fate-mapped cells as contralateral boosting (8.6% versus 3.8%), possibly because any recruitment of naive or MBCs in this node is superimposed on a refueling of the ongoing GC reaction by the boost (Schwickert et al., 2009Schwickert T.A. Alabyev B. Manser T. Nussenzweig M.C. Germinal center reutilization by newly activated B cells.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 2907-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Shulman et al., 2013Shulman Z. Gitlin A.D. Targ S. Jankovic M. Pasqual G. Nussenzweig M.C. Victora G.D. T follicular helper cell dynamics in germinal centers.Science. 2013; 341: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Priming by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection increased participation of fate-mapped cells in recall GCs to 11%, suggesting that increasing the number of GC-experienced MBCs generated in the primary response can have a marginal effect on their participation in recall GCs. However, because i.p. priming often induces GCs also in pLNs (unpublished data), a contribution from an ongoing GC reaction in the pLN prior to boosting cannot be ruled out. Thus, predominance of non-fate-mapped cells in secondary GCs is robust to common variations in the prime-boost protocol. Previous work in humans has shown that MBCs may be refractory to reentering GCs for a period of time after their generation (Lau et al., 2017Lau D. Lan L.Y. Andrews S.F. Henry C. Rojas K.T. Neu K.E. Huang M. Huang Y. DeKosky B. Palm A.E. et al.Low CD21 expression defines a population of recent germinal center graduates primed for plasma cell differentiation.Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2: 2Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, delaying boosting from 1 to 3 months after priming yielded secondary GCs with similarly low proportions of fate-mapped B cells (Figures 2H and S1B), indicating that such a restriction cannot account for our findings. The unlabeled majority of B cells in recall GCs could derive either from naive B cells or from early MBCs generated prior to GC formation, which may never have expressed Aicda or S1pr2 while proliferating (Kaji et al., 2012Kaji T. Ishige A. Hikida M. Taka J. Hijikata A. Kubo M. Nagashima T. Takahashi Y. Kurosaki T.

A Temporal Switch in the Germinal Center Determines Differential Output of Memory B and Plasma Cells.Immunity. 2016; 44: 116-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities, we immunized wild-type (WT) mice (the “primary” mouse) either i.p. or in one FP with CGG in alum and, 4 weeks later, joined these mice parabiotically to an allelically marked unimmunized partner (the “recall” mouse, Figure 2I). Because the recall mouse was never in contact with antigen prior to parabiosis, all CGG-specific MBCs, including any early memory, must have derived from the primary mouse. Boosting the recall mouse invariably generated GCs that contained a proportion of primary mouse-derived cells close to that found in the naive B cell compartment of the same pLN, regardless of site of priming (Figures 2J and 2K). In contrast, secondary PBs were strongly skewed toward the primary mouse, indicating that detectable B cell memory was generated and confirming that secondary PBs are mostly MBC derived (Figures 2J and 2K). Of note, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells were also skewed toward the primary mouse (Figures 2J and 2K); therefore, inefficient participation in recall GCs applies only to MBCs and not to memory T cells, as classically predicted by prime-boost experiments (Liu et al., 1991Liu Y.J. Zhang J. Lane P.J. Chan E.Y. MacLennan I.C. Sites of specific B cell activation in primary and secondary responses to T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens.Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2951-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Together, our data show that secondary GCs, while allowing reentry of a small contingent of MBCs, are seeded primarily by B cells without prior GC experience or strong evidence of clonal expansion, which supports a model in which they arise directly from naive precursors. Following the abundance of fate-mapped B cells in recall GCs (generated as in Figure 2A) by flow cytometry over time showed no discernible increase in the overall proportion of fate-mapped cells, neither in the short term (day 9) nor in the longer term (day 20) (Figure 3A). While memory-derived clones occasionally showed signs of burst-like positive selection—the largest MBC expansion reaching an estimated 60% of the total GC population (Figures 3B"

Recent studies have suggested that this ability is not equally distributed among hepatocytes but concentrated in a small subset of hepatocytes acting like stem cells, located around the central vein or distributed throughout the liver lobule and exhibiting active WNT signaling or high telomerase activity, respectively. These findings were obtained by utilizing components of these growth regulators as markers for genetic lineage tracing. Here, we used random lineage tracing to localize and quantify clonal expansion of hepatocytes in normal and injured liver. We found that modest proliferation of hepatocytes distributed throughout the lobule maintains the hepatocyte mass and that most hepatocytes proliferate to regenerate it, with diploidy providing a growth advantage over polyploidy. These results show that the ability to proliferate is broadly distributed among hepatocytes rather than limited to a rare stem cell-like population.

These results show that the ability to proliferate is broadly distributed among hepatocytes rather than limited to a rare stem cell-like population. Hepatocytes are unique among differentiated cells because they provide many vital functions and also can proliferate extensively, which allows efficient liver regeneration after injury. It is increasingly appreciated that hepatocytes are a heterogeneous cell population—depending on where they are located in the liver lobule, hepatocytes have different functions; they also differ in ploidy. Recently, hepatocyte heterogeneity was shown to extend to proliferation. In the normal liver, hepatocytes bordering on the central vein were found to harness WNT signaling to proliferate more than other hepatocytes, making them the main source of new hepatocytes (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Another study showed that rare hepatocytes with high telomerase activity distributed throughout the liver lobule dominate both liver homeostasis and regeneration (Lin et al., 2018Lin S. Nascimento E.M. Gajera C.R. Chen L. Neuhöfer P. Garbuzov A. Wang S. Artandi S.E. Distributed hepatocytes expressing telomerase repopulate the liver in homeostasis and injury.Nature. 2018; 556: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the hepatocyte mass is maintained and restored by clonal expansion of a small subset of hepatocytes acting like stem cells. However, it is currently not known which of the 2 hepatocyte stem cell models is correct or if both are, and the relative contribution of other hepatocytes to liver homeostasis and regeneration has not been addressed. In addition, these findings were obtained using lineage tracing disrupting endogenous Axin2 or Tert genes, potentially altering how readily and extensively cells respond to growth signals (Minear et al., 2010Minear S. Leucht P. Jiang J. Liu B. Zeng A. Fuerer C. Nusse R. Helms J.A. Wnt proteins promote bone regeneration.Sci. Transl. Med. 2010; 2: 29ra30Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Sarin et al., 2005Sarin K.Y. Cheung P. Gilison D. Lee E. Tennen R.I. Wang E. Artandi M.K. Oro A.E. Artandi S.E. Conditional telomerase induction causes proliferation of hair follicle stem cells.Nature. 2005; 436: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To address these questions, we used random lineage tracing—capturing a representative sample of all hepatocytes—to localize and quantify their clonal expansion in normal and injured liver. We permanently labeled hepatocytes throughout the liver lobule at a neutral genetic locus with 1 of 3 fluorophores by intravenously injecting AAV8-TBG-Cre into adult heterozygous Rosa26-Rainbow Cre reporter (R26Rrb/wt) mice (Figure 1A); the mice were housed under standard barrier conditions and any health problems were recorded (Table S1). Lineage tracing was active by 2 weeks after vector injection (Figures 1B and S1A). As previously reported for adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids (Davidoff et al., 2003Davidoff A.M. Ng C.Y. Zhou J. Spence Y. Nathwani A.C. Sex significantly influences transduction of murine liver by recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors through an androgen-dependent pathway.Blood. 2003; 102: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), including the AAV8 capsid (Greig et al., 2018Greig J.A. Nordin J.M.L. Draper C. McMenamin D. Chroscinski E.A. Bell P. Gray J.T. Richman L.K. Wilson J.M. Determining the minimally effective dose of a clinical candidate AAV vector in a mouse model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome.Mol. Ther. Methods Clin. Dev. 2018; 10: 237-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the labeling efficiency was higher in males than females and varied with weight (data not shown). Therefore, we doubled the dose in females and adjusted it to each mouse’s weight (Table S1). We used decreasing vector doses to induce high-, medium-, and low-density lineage tracing (Figure S1A; Table S1). The labeling efficiency gradually decreased along the central to portal axis, a characteristic of the AAV8 capsid (Bell et al., 2011Bell P. Wang L. Gao G. Haskins M.E. Tarantal A.F. McCarter R.J. Zhu Y. Yu H. Wilson J.M. Inverse zonation of hepatocyte transduction with AAV vectors between mice and non-human primates.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2011; 104: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). We used heterozygous mice to distinguish diploid from polyploid hepatocytes based on expression of 1 or ≥2 fluorophores, respectively. Accordingly, we found that lineage-traced hepatocytes expressing only 1 fluorophore were enriched for mononucleated cells, whereas those expressing ≥2 were enriched for binucleated cells (Figure S1C). We started our investigation of hepatocyte proliferation in the normal liver by analyzing 2D clusters in mice after long-term lineage tracing. We found no or only modest expansion of labeled hepatocytes 9.5–17 months after AAV vector injection; we did not see large clusters or hepatocytes that streamed across the lobule (Figures 1C–1E). Moreover, the distribution of labeled hepatocytes appeared similar to that at 2 weeks after AAV vector injection, with denser labeling in the pericentral zone of the lobule (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Had pericentral hepatocytes replenished the midlobular and periportal zones with new hepatocytes, the density of labeled cells in these zones should have increased. Because 2D imaging of hepatocyte clusters might omit cells that lie beyond the plane of the section, we imaged 3D hepatocyte clones by confocal microscopy of liver tissue cleared using a modified CUBIC protocol (Susaki et al., 2015Susaki E.A. Tainaka K. Perrin D. Yukinaga H. Kuno A. Ueda H.R. Advanced CUBIC protocols for whole-brain and whole-body clearing and imaging.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10: 1709-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to image up to 150 μm deep through several hepatocyte layers, which confirmed absence of large clones or streaming of hepatocytes 13.5 or 17 months after injection of high (Video S1A) or medium (data not shown) AAV vector doses. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/7fa8c995-379f-48b4-82c1-e81ebd6c4992/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Hepatocyte clones vary by cell number, size, and arrangement of cells within a clone. Nuclei are identified by DAPI staining (white). Scale bar, 100 μm. (G) Liver of a female R26Rrb/wt mouse injected with low-dose AAV8-TBG-Cre analyzed 4 days after 12 doses of CCl4 showing 2 large hepatocyte clones expressing mCerulean (light blue) or mCherry (magenta) streaming from the midlobular zone toward the central vein. Autofluorescent spots in the mOrange and mCherry channels are due to cell debris. Nuclei are identified by DAPI staining (white). Scale bar, 50 μm. Next, we focused on the mice that received the low AAV vector dose. 2 to 3 weeks after injection, virtually all (457/467) labeled hepatocytes were single cells (Figure 1F; Video S1B). We rarely saw 2 differently colored clones next to each other (Figure S1D) and almost never 2 adjacent clones sharing a border (Video S1B). Few (10/467) clones that consisted of 2 cells expressing the same fluorophore were likely hepatocytes that proliferated between the time of AAV vector injection and analysis because they share a substantial cell border (Figure S1D) and because the probability of 2 different clones expressing the same fluorophore is only 1/3 or even less if cells are polyploid. Therefore, we used the mice that received the low AAV vector dose to quantify the size of individual clones. We did not find large clones or streaming of hepatocytes 9.5–15 months after AAV vector injection when we imaged 5–23 fields (each containing at least 1 portal vein and 1 central vein and ∼1,600 hepatocytes) from each of the left, median, right anterior, and right posterior lobe or the median or left lobe of each mouse (Videos S1C and S1D; Table S1). Specific analysis of 458 clones from at least 1 field per mouse at 9.5–9.7 months showed that 84.1% of hepatocytes did not proliferate but remained single cells, 14.0% of hepatocytes divided once and gave rise to 2-cell clones, and 1.7% gave rise to 3- to 4-cell clones; only 1 (0.2%) clone was larger, consisting of 6 cells. Similarly, of 978 clones analyzed in mice at 13.6–13.7 months, 90.1% were single cells, 9.0% were 2-cell clones, 0.7% were 3- to 4-cell clones, and 0.2% consisted of 5–7 cells (Figure 1F; Videos S1C–S1E). Clones >2 cells were mostly located in the midlobular zone; pericentral and periportal clones almost exclusively consisted of 1 or 2 cells (Figure 1F). Hepatocytes proliferated more in females than in males, particularly in the midlobular zone, which was associated with higher baseline levels of CCND1 (Alvarado et al., 2016Alvarado T.F. Puliga E. Preziosi M. Poddar M. Singh S. Columbano A. Nejak-Bowen K. Monga S.P. Thyroid hormone receptor β agonist induces β-catenin-dependent hepatocyte proliferation in mice: implications in hepatic regeneration.Gene Expr. 2016; 17: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; Figures S1E–S1I). Clones ≥4 cells expressed only 1 fluorophore but at <1% were too rare to establish a growth advantage of diploid hepatocytes (Figure S1J). In accord, overall clonal expansion followed a Poisson distribution (Figure S1K), suggesting that hepatocyte proliferation occurs randomly in liver homeostasis. To exclude that AAV vector transduction affected hepatocyte proliferation, we devised a lineage tracing strategy that let us compare the proliferation of transduced and untransduced cells. We intravenously co-injected adult Cre and Flp double-reporter (R26RtdRFP/ZG) mice with AAV8-TBG-Cre and AAV9-TTR-Flp at doses that activate Cre-dependent tdRFP in all but a few sparsely distributed hepatocytes and Flp-dependent EGFP in a small fraction of hepatocytes (Figures 1G and S1L; Table S1). Because Cre- and Flp-mediated reporter activation is very efficient in the normal liver (Schaub et al., 2018Schaub J.R. Huppert K.A. Kurial S.N.T. Hsu B.Y. Cast A.E. Donnelly B. Karns R.A. Chen F. Rezvani M. Luu H.Y. et al.De novo formation of the biliary system by TGFβ-mediated hepatocyte transdifferentiation.Nature. 2018; 557: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Yanger et al., 2014Yanger K. Knigin D. Zong Y. Maggs L. Gu G. Akiyama H. Pikarsky E. Stanger B.Z. Adult hepatocytes are generated by self-duplication rather than stem cell differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 340-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), hepatocytes negative for both tdRFP and EGFP can be assumed to not have been transduced with either AAV vector. When we examined the number of hepatocytes in individual 2D clusters 2 weeks and 9.7 months after AAV injection, we found that hepatocytes not transduced with AAV vectors and hepatocytes labeled by AAV9-TTR-Flp expanded similarly at the 2 time points (Figures 1H and S1M), demonstrating that AAV transduction did not affect hepatocyte proliferation. Further analysis of the untransduced clusters confirmed our initial finding of modest hepatocyte proliferation in all 3 zones, with more proliferation occurring in the midlobular zone, and absence of streaming of hepatocytes (Figures 1I and S1N). We also investigated clonal expansion of hepatocytes in the injured liver. After intravenously injecting low- or high-dose AAV8-TBG-Cre into adult R26Rrb/wt mice, we specifically injured their pericentral or periportal hepatocytes by intraperitoneal injection of 1 dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or 2 doses of allyl alcohol (AA), respectively (Figures S2A and S2B). We found that these acute injuries—depleting ∼1/2 or ∼1/4 of the hepatocyte mass, respectively—induced proliferation of hepatocytes adjacent to the injured area, leading to mostly 2- to 3-cell clones extending into the necrotic area (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D ). In addition to this localized repair, we saw compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes in zones further away from the injury (Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, S2C, and S2D). Next, we modeled chronic liver injury by repeating CCl4 application as soon as hepatocyte regeneration was complete (Figures S2E and S2F). After 3 doses of CCl4, we found that 84.9% ± 2.2% of lineage-traced hepatocytes in all zones divided, with 65.9% ± 2.2% dividing at least twice, giving rise to clones consisting of ≥3 cells (Figures 2C and 2D; Video S1F). Hepatocyte proliferation was similar between males and females and uniform across the lobule (Figures 2C and 2D). Clone morphology ranged from single enlarged cells—characteristic of hepatocyte hypertrophy, as after partial hepatectomy (Miyaoka et al., 2012Miyaoka Y. Ebato K. Kato H. Arakawa S. Shimizu S. Miyajima A. Hypertrophy and unconventional cell division of hepatocytes underlie liver regeneration.Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: 1166-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)—to clones consisting of several small cells that streamed along the portal to central axis or formed nodules (Figure 2E; Video S1F). Although many 1-cell clones were enlarged after either chronic or acute injury (54.6% ± 2.0% of 69–102 clones each in 2 males and 2 females for 3 × CCl4, 28.0% ± 2.0% of 25–30 clones each in 1 male and 2 females for 1 × CCl4, and 35.2% ± 4.7% of 32–48 clones each in 2 males and 1 female for AA), proliferation was the predominant mechanism of hepatocyte regeneration (Figure 2D). Applying additional CCl4 doses promoted the expansion of hepatocyte clones throughout the lobule. After 6 doses of CCl4, we found large clones (∼7 cells in 2D) in the periportal and midlobular zones that converged to form regenerative patches (Figures 2C and S2G). Most hepatocytes in these clones were small, but large cells could also be found within a clone, suggesting that hepatocytes can switch from proliferation to hypertrophy (Figure 2F). After 12 doses of CCl4, we saw very large clones (∼20 cells in 2D), some of which covered the distance from the portal vein to the central vein (Figures 2C, 2G, and S2H). In addition, we saw large clones in the midlobular zone, both right next to and further away from the pericentral zone (Figure S2H; Video S1G). 1- or 2-cell clones were rare but could still be found; the cells were large and elongated (Figure 2G). However, most lineage-traced hepatocytes divided markedly after 6 or 12 doses of CCl4 (Figures 2C, 2G, S2G, and S2H). Diploid hepatocytes proliferated more efficiently than polyploid hepatocytes—in normal liver, most (69.4% ± 10.3%) clones, independent of size or location, were polyploid, whereas after 12 doses of CCl4, most (71.9% ± 7.0%) large clones were diploid (Figures 2H and 2I). In summary, our random lineage tracing of hepatocytes in the normal liver does not show predominant proliferation of pericentral hepatocytes, leading to large hepatocyte patches streaming toward the periportal zone, as was shown by lineage tracing of Axin2-expressing hepatocytes (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We did not find that the dose of tamoxifen used for Axin2 lineage tracing significantly induces clonal expansion of hepatocytes (Figure S2I), suggesting genetic or environmental differences, e.g., Axin2 haploinsufficiency or diet and housing, as potential reasons for the discrepant results. In accord with results from lineage tracing of hepatocytes exhibiting high Tert expression (Lin et al., 2018Lin S. Nascimento E.M. Gajera C.R. Chen L. Neuhöfer P. Garbuzov A. Wang S. Artandi S.E. Distributed hepatocytes expressing telomerase repopulate the liver in homeostasis and injury.Nature. 2018; 556: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we found that hepatocyte proliferation occurs throughout the liver lobule, with a slight predominance of the midlobular zone. Our results differ in how much each lineage-traced hepatocyte proliferates: high-Tert lineage tracing showed an average clone size of 4.2 cells at 6 months, with 64% of clones being >2 cells; expansion of lineage-traced hepatocytes from 3%–5% to 30% suggests an average clone size of 6–10 cells at 1 year (Lin et al., 2018Lin S. Nascimento E.M. Gajera C.R. Chen L. Neuhöfer P. Garbuzov A. Wang S. Artandi S.E. Distributed hepatocytes expressing telomerase repopulate the liver in homeostasis and injury.Nature. 2018; 556: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We found an average clone size of 1.1 cells at 13.6–13.7 months, with 9.9% of lineage-traced hepatocytes proliferating and 0.9% of clones being >2 cells (average clone size of 3.9 cells). To confirm that our strategy captured a representative sample of all hepatocytes, we ascertained that it was not biased against cells highly expressing Tert or Axin2 (Figures S2J–S2N). Our results show that modest proliferation of hepatocytes in all zones maintains the hepatocyte mass, which is consistent with most hepatocytes being long lived as suggested by isotope labeling (Arrojo E Drigo et al., 2019Arrojo E Drigo R. Lev-Ram V. Tyagi S. Ramachandra R. Deerinck T. Bushong E. Phan S. Orphan V. Lechene C. Ellisman M.H. Hetzer M.W. Age mosaicism across multiple scales in adult tissues.Cell Metab. 2019; 30: 343-351.e3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our findings were similar for how the hepatocyte mass is restored in the injured liver. Acute loss of pericentral or periportal hepatocytes is repaired by proliferation of adjacent hepatocytes, aided by proliferation of hepatocytes located further away from the injury. Repeated pericentral injury leads to clonal expansion of as many as ∼85% of hepatocytes in all zones. As clones derived from midlobular hepatocytes moving into the pericentral injury zone continue to be depleted, periportal hepatocytes give rise to large clones that stream along the portal to central axis (Font-Burgada et al., 2015Font-Burgada J. Shalapour S. Ramaswamy S. Hsueh B. Rossell D. Umemura A. Taniguchi K. Nakagawa H. Valasek M.A. Ye L. et al.Hybrid periportal hepatocytes regenerate the injured liver without giving rise to cancer.Cell. 2015; 162: 766-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although diploidy does not have a significant effect on hepatocyte proliferation in the normal liver, it affords a selective growth advantage in the chronically injured liver (Wilkinson et al., 2019Wilkinson P.D. Delgado E.R. Alencastro F. Leek M.P. Roy N. Weirich M.P. Stahl E.C. Otero P.A. Chen M.I. Brown W.K. Duncan A.W. The polyploid state restricts hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in mice.Hepatology. 2019; 69: 1242-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Diploid clones may derive from pre-existing diploid hepatocytes or form by ploidy reversal of polyploid hepatocytes (Duncan et al., 2010Duncan A.W. Taylor M.H. Hickey R.D. Hanlon Newell A.E. Lenzi M.L. Olson S.B. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. The ploidy conveyor of mature hepatocytes as a source of genetic variation.Nature. 2010; 467: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Collectively, our findings show that the ability to proliferate is not concentrated in rare stem cell-like hepatocytes but distributed among hepatocytes in liver homeostasis and regeneration, with type of injury and ploidy affecting location and extent of proliferation. Because hepatocytes are constantly exposed to exogenous and endogenous toxins, it is conceivable that this principle of broad distribution of proliferation evolved to reinforce regeneration and minimize cancer risk.

Mammalian somatic cells typically have diploid genomes, but polyploid cells with more than two sets of chromosomes are found abundantly in tissues such as the liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and bone marrow (Pandit et al., 2013Pandit S.K. Westendorp B. de Bruin A. Physiological significance of polyploidization in mammalian cells.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23: 556-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Physiological polyploidization occurs in a developmentally programmed manner in hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, and megakaryocytes (Øvrebø and Edgar, 2018Øvrebø J.I. Edgar B.A. Polyploidy in tissue homeostasis and regeneration.Development. 2018; 145: dev156034Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Polyploidization is also enhanced in some disease conditions, such as liver cirrhosis and myocardial infarction (Gjelsvik et al., 2019Gjelsvik K.J. Besen-McNally R. Losick V.P. Solving the Polyploid Mystery in Health and Disease.Trends Genet. 2019; 35: 6-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Øvrebø and Edgar, 2018Øvrebø J.I. Edgar B.A. Polyploidy in tissue homeostasis and regeneration.Development. 2018; 145: dev156034Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Given that polyploidy is known to have advantages for evolution and adaptation in plants, fungi, and insects (Schoenfelder and Fox, 2015Schoenfelder K.P. Fox D.T. The expanding implications of polyploidy.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Van de Peer et al., 2017Van de Peer Y. Mizrachi E. Marchal K. The evolutionary significance of polyploidy.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2017; 18: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), polyploidy in mammalian somatic cells may also be beneficial. However, it is still unclear exactly how polyploid cells are involved in mammalian physiology. The hepatocyte, the main liver parenchymal cell, is one of the cell types that most frequently exhibit polyploidy. More than 50% and 90% of hepatocytes in human and rodent adult liver are polyploid, respectively (Duncan et al., 2012bDuncan A.W. Hanlon Newell A.E. Smith L. Wilson E.M. Olson S.B. Thayer M.J.

The polyploid state restricts hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in mice.Hepatology. 2019; 69: 1242-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Polyploidization of hepatocytes occurs mainly through cytokinesis failure and starts around weaning in mice (Duncan, 2013Duncan A.W. Aneuploidy, polyploidy and ploidy reversal in the liver.Semin.

Maillet V. Paradis V. Couton D. L’Hermitte A. Panasyuk G. Fromenty B. Celton-Morizur S. Desdouets C. Oxidative stress promotes pathologic polyploidization in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.J. Clin.

It has been hypothesized that polyploidy in hepatocytes may enhance metabolism and protein synthesis/secretion (Orr-Weaver, 2015Orr-Weaver T.L.

Physiological significance of polyploidization in mammalian cells.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23: 556-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Polyploid hepatocytes may also buffer hepatic dysfunction by generating aneuploid progeny genetically adapted to stress (Duncan et al., 2012aDuncan A.W. Hanlon Newell A.E. Bi W. Finegold M.J. Olson S.B. Beaudet A.L. Grompe M. Aneuploidy as a mechanism for stress-induced liver adaptation.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 3307-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, redundant genomes of polyploids are thought to be less affected by genotoxic damage (Pandit et al., 2013Pandit S.K. Westendorp B. de Bruin A. Physiological significance of polyploidization in mammalian cells.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23: 556-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Some advantages of polyploids, such as adaptation and genomic damage insensitivity, are well established in non-mammalian organisms (Schoenfelder and Fox, 2015Schoenfelder K.P. Fox D.T. The expanding implications of polyploidy.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 209: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, polyploid cells could potentially contribute to tissue regeneration by proliferation. In some cell types, polyploidization induces cell cycle arrest or cellular senescence (Ganem and Pellman, 2007Ganem N.J. Pellman D. Limiting the proliferation of polyploid cells.Cell. 2007; 131: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and can be involved in terminal cell differentiation (Pandit et al., 2013Pandit S.K. Westendorp B. de Bruin A. Physiological significance of polyploidization in mammalian cells.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23: 556-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Conversely, other polyploid cell types, including hepatocytes and fibroblasts, can proliferate (Guidotti et al., 2003Guidotti J.E. Brégerie O. Robert A. Debey P. Brechot C. Desdouets C.

Brown W.K. Duncan A.W. The polyploid state restricts hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration in mice.Hepatology. 2019; 69: 1242-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that polyploid hepatocytes can undergo many rounds of cell division after transplantation into Fah−/− mice (Overturf et al., 1997Overturf K. al-Dhalimy M. Ou C.N. Finegold M. Grompe M. Serial transplantation reveals the stem-cell-like regenerative potential of adult mouse hepatocytes.Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1273-1280PubMed Google Scholar, Overturf et al., 1999Overturf K. Al-Dhalimy M. Finegold M. Grompe M. The repopulation potential of hepatocyte populations differing in size and prior mitotic expansion.Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 2135-2143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have also shown previously that polyploid hepatocytes can reduce their ploidy via multipolar mitosis (Duncan et al., 2010Duncan A.W. Taylor M.H. Hickey R.D. Hanlon Newell A.E. Lenzi M.L. Olson S.B. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. The ploidy conveyor of mature hepatocytes as a source of genetic variation.Nature. 2010; 467: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This multipolar reductive mitosis might enhance effective organ regeneration by generating more than two cells in one cell division. On the other hand, some studies have shown that polyploid hepatocytes exhibit senescence-associated changes following one or two rounds of cell division (Gentric et al., 2012Gentric G. Celton-Morizur S. Desdouets C. Polyploidy and liver proliferation.Clin. Res. Hepatol. Gastroenterol. 2012; 36: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Sigal et al., 1999Sigal S.H. Rajvanshi P. Gorla G.R. Sokhi R.P. Saxena R. Gebhard Jr., D.R. Reid L.M. Gupta S. Partial hepatectomy-induced polyploidy attenuates hepatocyte replication and activates cell aging events.Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1260-G1272PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been suggested that diploid hepatocytes adjacent to the central vein of the liver lobule act as stem cells during homeostasis and injury response (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is still controversial whether polyploids proliferate continuously to regenerate the chronically damaged liver. It also remains unknown whether the multipolar reductive mitoses seen in tissue culture and during transplantation play a part in physiologic regeneration. In the present study, to evaluate the contribution of polyploids and their ploidy reduction to organ regeneration, we established a mouse model to genetically label polyploid cells using multicolored reporter mice. Tracing polyploid hepatocytes in various chronically injured livers showed that polyploid hepatocytes did not only proliferate via multiple cycles of cell division while remaining polyploid but also generated ploidy-reduced cells with extensive proliferative potential. Those ploidy-reduced cells underwent re-polyploidization in the process of regeneration, indicating dynamic ploidy alterations during injury responses. We also found that reporter chromosomes did not segregate randomly but distributed in a manner that genetically resembles completion of cytokinesis followed by mitosis. Our findings shed light on the role of polyploids and ploidy dynamics in organ regeneration. No evidence of a diploid population of stem/progenitor cells was found. To trace the fate of polyploid hepatocytes in vivo, Rosa-Confetti multicolor reporter mice (Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G. Sato T. van Es J.H. van den Born M. Kroon-Veenboer C. Barker N. Klein A.M. van Rheenen J. Simons B.D. Clevers H. Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.Cell. 2010; 143: 134-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) were used. The Rosa-Confetti allele consists of a floxed stop cassette followed by four different reporter genes: the nuclear GFP (nGFP), cytoplasmic yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cytoplasmic red fluorescent protein (RFP), and membrane-bound cyan fluorescent protein (mCFP) (Figure 1A). After Cre recombination, only one fluorescent protein is stochastically expressed from each Rosa-Confetti allele. In germline heterozygous Rosa-Confetti mice, one of the two sets of chromosomes (2c) harbors a Rosa-Confetti allele, and, thus, diploid cells can express only one reporter, whereas polyploids can be labeled by co-expressing multiple colors (Figure 1A). To induce temporally controlled Cre recombination, Rosa-Confetti mice were crossed with Ubc-CreERT2 transgenics that express tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. Tamoxifen was administered to heterozygous Ubc-CreERT2/Rosa-Confetti+/− mice after the physiological polyploidization period of hepatocytes at 4–8 weeks of age (Gentric and Desdouets, 2014Gentric G. Desdouets C. Polyploidization in liver tissue.Am. J. Pathol. 2014; 184: 322-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). No labeled cells were detectable without tamoxifen administration (data not shown), confirming strictly regulated Cre activity by tamoxifen. After a 3-week tamoxifen washout period, hepatocytes were stochastically labeled with YFP, RFP, or mCFP, whereas almost no hepatocytes were labeled with nGFP (Figure 1B). This scarcity of nGFP-labeled cells is consistent with previous reports (Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G. Sato T. van Es J.H. van den Born M. Kroon-Veenboer C. Barker N. Klein A.M. van Rheenen J. Simons B.D. Clevers H. Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.Cell. 2010; 143: 134-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) and might result from GFP-specific cytotoxicity (Taghizadeh and Sherley, 2008Taghizadeh R.R. Sherley J.L. CFP and YFP, but not GFP, provide stable fluorescent marking of rat hepatic adult stem cells.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2008; 2008: 453590Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Of note, many hepatocytes were co-labeled with multiple colors (Figures 1B and 1C). Flow cytometry analysis of isolated hepatocytes showed that all multicolored hepatocytes were polyploid, whereas diploids were monocolored (Figures 1D–1F). Multicolored hepatocytes were preferentially located in pericentral zone 3 compared with periportal zone 1, which is consistent with a biased distribution of diploid hepatocytes to the periportal area (Figures S1A and S1B; Tanami et al., 2017Tanami S. Ben-Moshe S. Elkayam A. Mayo A. Bahar Halpern K. Itzkovitz S. Dynamic zonation of liver polyploidy.Cell Tissue Res. 2017; 368: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Importantly, multi-color labeling was seen not only in hepatocytes but was also found in many other cell types, including pancreatic acinar cells, cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and salivary gland epithelia (Figures 1G and S2A). In contrast, intestinal epithelium and brain cortex neurons, which are mostly diploid, were exclusively monocolored (Figures 1G and S2A). Interestingly, multicolored polyploid hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells were observed more than 18 months after tamoxifen administration (Figures 1H and S2B). This proves that polyploid epithelial cells generated in young animals can persist for their entire lifespan. Together, these findings show that mice heterozygous for a multicolor reporter allele can be used to trace polyploids in vivo and that polyploidy status can be tracked based on genetic labeling of multiple reporter genes. We previously followed the fate of bulk populations of polyploid hepatocytes during transplantation (Duncan et al., 2010Duncan A.W. Taylor M.H. Hickey R.D. Hanlon Newell A.E. Lenzi M.L. Olson S.B. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. The ploidy conveyor of mature hepatocytes as a source of genetic variation.Nature. 2010; 467: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), but clonal analysis was lacking. To study the behavior of individual polyploid hepatocytes, YFP+RFP+ multicolored polyploid hepatocytes from Ubc-CreERT2/Rosa-Confetti+/− mice were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and transplanted into Fah−/− recipient mice in low numbers (<10,000 cells per mouse; Figures 2A and 2B ). Because mCFP was too dim to be detected by flow cytometry, it was not used as a marker for FACS. Many large single-cell-derived clones (200+ cells) consisting of YFP+RFP+ multicolored cells were detected in the repopulated livers, indicating that polyploid hepatocytes underwent multiple cycles of cell division while remaining polyploid. Importantly, YFP+ and RFP+ monocolored clones were frequently found directly adjacent to YFP+RFP+ bicolored nodules. These monocolored satellites derived from pure bicolored populations are suggestive of ploidy reduction (Figure 2C). Of note, in livers transplanted with YFP+RFP+ 8c hepatocytes, some repopulated nodules stochastically co-expressed mCFP, and clonal proliferation of tricolored 8c cells was seen (Figures 2D and S3). Immediately adjacent to the tricolored clones, bicolored and monocolored nodules were found (Figures 2D and S3). This indicates that even octaploid cells can clonally proliferate and that ploidy-reduced hepatocytes contribute to liver regeneration. Flow cytometric analysis also detected many YFP+ or RFP+ monocolored cells emerging in the repopulated livers (Figures 2E–2G). The ploidy of these monocolored cells was distributed from 2c to 8c and more (Figure 2H). The loss of reporter expression suggests that transplanted polyploid cells underwent ploidy reduction during proliferation. The close similarity between the frequencies of YFP+ and RFP+ monocolored cells is consistent with the feature of reductive mitosis generating ploidy-reduced daughters in pairs (Duncan et al., 2010Duncan A.W. Taylor M.H. Hickey R.D. Hanlon Newell A.E. Lenzi M.L. Olson S.B. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. The ploidy conveyor of mature hepatocytes as a source of genetic variation.Nature. 2010; 467: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Contamination of the original bicolored donor cell population with small amounts of monocolored cells could be an alternative explanation for the emergence of monocolored cells if these contaminants proliferated more than the bicolored cells. In fact, although we strictly excluded doublet cells using pulse-width gating in FACS, the average purity of sorted cells validated by reporter gene expression on flow cytometry and microscopy was only 98.8% ± 1.8% and 98.5% ± 1.5%, respectively. To evaluate the proliferation efficiency of bicolored and monocolored cells, the size of each regenerative clone was examined. The ratio of the average size of YFP+ or RFP+ monocolored clones to that of bicolored clones in the same mouse was only 0.75 ± 0.33 (6 mice), dismissing the possibility that monocolored cells overgrew during repopulation. To further assess the potential influence of contamination, we intentionally contaminated multicolored polyploids with sex-mismatched monocolored cells before transplantation (Figure S4A). In mice repopulated with mixtures of YFP+RFP+ male polyploids (85%) and YFP+ and RFP+ monocolored female cells (5% and 10%, respectively), the proportion of YFP+ and RFP+ monocolored cells increased up to 24.2% ± 4.5% and 29.8% ± 4.2%, respectively (Figure S4B). qPCR for Y chromosome DNA extracted from sorted cells revealed that 76.1% ± 14.4% and 63.4% ± 9.4% of those YFP+ and RFP+ monocolored cells were male (Figure S4C). This proves that the majority of the monocolored cells originated from the male bicolored polyploids and not from female contaminating monocolored cells. The same result was found when the polyploid cells were female and the monocolored cells were male (Figures S4D and S4E). Taken together, these findings confirmed that polyploid hepatocytes generated ploidy-reduced cells with proliferative capacity during liver regeneration. In the Fah−/− recipient livers transplanted with YFP+RFP+ 4c cells, most (96.6% ± 0.9%) of their monocolored derivatives exhibited polyploidy after repopulation. This suggests that ploidy-reduced cells underwent re-polyploidization during subsequent mitoses. To directly examine whether ploidy-reduced cells undergo re-polyploidization, we sorted YFP+ or RFP+ monocolored diploid cells from mice repopulated by YFP+RFP+ bicolored polyploids and serially transplanted them into secondary Fah−/− recipients (Figure 3A). Flow cytometry analysis showed that most of the cells derived from donor diploids re-polyploidized during repopulation (Figure 3B). To examine the proliferative capacity of these re-polyploidized cells, we administered tamoxifen to secondary recipient mice in the middle of the repopulation period (Figure 3A). Because Cre recombination of the Rosa-Confetti allele is reversible, re-polyploidization generates a second chromosome that can be recombined de novo. A second pulse of tamoxifen can generate a second color in previously monocolored cells. Microscopic analysis indeed showed clonal repopulation by multicolored cells (Figures 3C and 3D), demonstrating the abundant proliferation potential of re-polyploidized hepatocytes even in the presence of competing diploid donors. The re-polyploidized cells frequently had binucleated as well as large polyploid nuclei, suggesting that re-polyploidization resulted from incomplete cytokinesis, as in physiological hepatocyte polyploidization (Figures 3E and 3F). Taken together, these findings revealed that ploidy-reduced cells undergo re-polyploidization during proliferation and that re-polyploidized cells also contribute to liver regeneration along with diploids. Our previous studies of hepatocyte ploidy kinetics (Duncan et al., 2009Duncan A.W. Hickey R.D. Paulk N.K. Culberson A.J. Olson S.B. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. Ploidy reductions in murine fusion-derived hepatocytes.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000385Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Duncan et al., 2010Duncan A.W. Taylor M.H. Hickey R.D.

To determine whether similar phenomena (proliferation of polyploids and ploidy reduction) also play a role in hepatic injury responses in situ, we performed lineage tracing using multicolor reporter mice in the context of different liver injury models. Heterozygous Rosa-Confetti mice were injected with low-dose AAV8-Ttr-Cre (≤5 × 108 vector genomes [vg]) to induce sparse single-cell labeling specifically of hepatocytes (Figures 4A and 4B ). Flow cytometry analysis showed that 1.7% ± 1.1% of hepatocytes were labeled with YFP and/or RFP, and most (≈98.8%) of the labeled cells exhibited polyploidy under this condition (Figure 4C). Mice were then subjected to liver injury starting 2 weeks after hepatocyte labeling. In livers chronically damaged by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), labeled cells, including multicolored cells, proliferated for up to 12 weeks and were detectable as clonal areas (Figure 4D). Clonal expansion of each labeled hepatocyte was further evaluated by 3D image analysis of thick sections (>150 μm) to eliminate sampling bias caused by thin sections (Figure 4E). Although the average volume of a single labeled hepatocyte before injury was 1.1 × 104 μm3 (SD 0.9 × 104), the median volume of each clone derived from a single labeled cell was 4.0 × 104 μm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.0–6.9 × 104) after 4-week CCl4 injury (Figures 4F and 4G). Although the extent of expansion of each clone varied from clone to clone, the majority (57.3%, 382 of 666) of labeled clones had a volume more than 3 times as large as that of a single hepatocyte. YFP+RFP+ bicolored cells alone also exhibited a similar expansion profile of clonally proliferating cells (Figure 4G). These findings suggested that many polyploid hepatocytes underwent multiple cycles of cell division and proliferated continuously to regenerate chronically injured liver. To further examine the involvement of polyploids in liver regeneration, sparsely labeled hepatocytes were also traced in three additional chronic damage models: Fah deficiency (Grompe et al., 1993Grompe M. al-Dhalimy M. Finegold M. Ou C.N. Burlingame T. Kennaway N.G. Soriano P. Loss of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is responsible for the neonatal hepatic dysfunction phenotype of lethal albino mice.Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2298-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), thioacetamide (TAA)-induced injury (Schnur et al., 1999Schnur J. Nagy P. Sebestyén A. Schaff Z. Thorgeirsson S.S. Chemical hepatocarcinogenesis in transgenic mice overexpressing mature TGF beta-1 in liver.Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 1842-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-induced injury (Preisegger et al., 1999Preisegger K.H. Factor V.M. Fuchsbichler A. Stumptner C. Denk H. Thorgeirsson S.S. Atypical ductular proliferation and its inhibition by transforming growth factor beta1 in the 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine mouse model for chronic alcoholic liver disease.Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 103-109PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cells, including multicolored cells, clonally proliferated in all of these damage models (Figure S5A). 3D image analysis confirmed that proliferation was not restricted to a rare subset but occurred in the majority of labeled cells (Figures S5B and S5C). Although proliferation of polyploid hepatocytes was seen in all four models of liver injury examined here, their mechanisms of hepatotoxicity are quite different (Liu et al., 2013Liu Y. Meyer C. Xu C. Weng H. Hellerbrand C. ten Dijke P. Dooley S. Animal models of chronic liver diseases.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2013; 304: G449-G468Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Not unexpectedly, clonal analysis of polyploid hepatocytes also revealed injury-specific differences. Ki67+ proliferating hepatocytes, including multicolored cells, were predominantly located in pericentral areas in CCl4-damaged livers, whereas they were distributed across all lobular zones in TAA injury (Figures 4H, S5D, and S5E). Morphological analysis of the 3D images showed that regenerating clones expanded in a prolate (sausage-like) ellipsoidal shape in CCl4- and TAA-induced liver injuries, whereas they had an oblate (disc-like) ellipsoidal shape in DDC-induced liver injuries (Figure S5F). Consistently, regenerating hepatocytes tended to proliferate along hepatic cords in CCl4- and TAA-damaged livers (Figure S5G). These findings suggest that polyploid hepatocytes are an important source of liver regeneration and that their clonal characteristics are influenced by injury-specific local signals. Given continuous cell division of polyploid hepatocytes in various liver injury models, we next sought to examine whether ploidy reduction occurs not only during liver repopulation after transplantation but also during physiologic damage responses. Interestingly, although 26.4% ± 2.1% of labeled cells were bicolored (YFP+RFP+) in the sparsely labeled liver without injury (Figure 4C), YFP+RFP+ clones were noticeably less frequent (11.1% ± 1.2%) after 4-week CCl4 injury. This decrease in bicolored cells is consistent with allele segregation during ploidy reduction. In addition, 14.8% ± 3.3% of proliferating multicolored clones in livers injured with CCl4 for 4 weeks contained monocolored"
https://openalex.org/W2996142803,"The brain is a vulnerable metabolic organ and must adapt to different fuel conditions to sustain function. Nerve terminals are a locus of this vulnerability, but how they regulate ATP synthesis as fuel conditions vary is unknown. We show that synapses can switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism, but to do so, they rely on activity-driven presynaptic mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to accelerate ATP production. We demonstrate that, whereas mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake requires elevated extramitochondrial Ca2+ in non-neuronal cells, axonal mitochondria readily take up Ca2+ in response to small changes in external Ca2+. We identified the brain-specific protein MICU3 as a critical driver of this tuning of Ca2+ sensitivity. Ablation of MICU3 renders axonal mitochondria similar to non-neuronal mitochondria, prevents acceleration of local ATP synthesis, and impairs presynaptic function under oxidative conditions. Thus, presynaptic mitochondria rely on MICU3 to facilitate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during activity and achieve metabolic flexibility."

Microtubules are dynamic, μm-scale polymers of α/β-tubulin heterodimers. In addition to forming a structural scaffold that defines cellular morphology (Kirschner and Mitchison, 1986Kirschner M. Mitchison T.

The γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) is a macromolecular assembly that nucleates microtubules in vitro and is essential for proper microtubule network formation in eukaryotes (Knop et al., 1997aKnop M.

The tubulin-like GTPase γ-tubulin, initially discovered in Aspergillus nidulans (Oakley and Oakley, 1989Oakley C.E. Oakley B.R. Identification of gamma-tubulin, a new member of the tubulin superfamily encoded by mipA gene of Aspergillus nidulans.Nature. 1989; 338: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), localizes to the centrosome and associates with at least five other proteins to form ∼32S (∼2 MDa) “ring”-shaped complexes (Stearns et al., 1991Stearns T.

Nucleation of microtubule assembly by a gamma-tubulin-containing ring complex.Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), but the precise identity and stoichiometry of components within the native γ-TuRC are still debated (Kollman et al., 2011Kollman J.M. Merdes A. Mourey L. Agard D.A. Microtubule nucleation by γ-tubulin complexes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, despite ∼30 years of research since the discovery of γ-tubulin (Oakley and Oakley, 1989Oakley C.E. Oakley B.R. Identification of gamma-tubulin, a new member of the tubulin superfamily encoded by mipA gene of Aspergillus nidulans.Nature. 1989; 338: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), how this complex assembles from a heterogeneous set of components to facilitate microtubule nucleation remains unclear. The question of composition is further complicated by the finding that cytoplasmic γ-TuRCs are not only recruited to canonical sites of microtubule assembly, such as the centrosome (Stearns et al., 1991Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Gamma-tubulin is a highly conserved component of the centrosome.Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), but also to diverse acentrosomal locations, such as meiotic spindles (Schuh and Ellenberg, 2007Schuh M. Ellenberg J. Self-organization of MTOCs replaces centrosome function during acentrosomal spindle assembly in live mouse oocytes.Cell. 2007; 130: 484-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), Golgi outposts (Rivero et al., 2009Rivero S.

Debec A. Maiato H. Microtubule cytoskeleton remodeling by acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers at the entry and exit from mitosis in Drosophila somatic cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2796-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This recruitment depends on a variety of γ-TuRC-associated “attachment factors,” which can copurify with native γ-TuRCs (Hutchins et al., 2010Hutchins J.R.A. Toyoda Y. Hegemann B. Poser I. Hériché J.-K. Sykora M.M. Augsburg M. Hudecz O.

Cell. 2010; 21: 3963-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several attachment factors have been identified, including the pericentriolar protein CDK5Rap2 (Fong et al., 2008Fong K.-W. Choi Y.-K. Rattner J.B. Qi R.Z. CDK5RAP2 is a pericentriolar protein that functions in centrosomal attachment of the gamma-tubulin ring complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), which can enhance the microtubule nucleating activity of purified γ-TuRCs in vitro (Choi et al., 2010Choi Y.-K. Liu P. Sze S.K. Dai C. Qi R.Z. CDK5RAP2 stimulates microtubule nucleation by the gamma-tubulin ring complex.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that recruitment of γ-TuRCs to sites of microtubule assembly leads to γ-TuRC “activation” (Kollman et al., 2011Kollman J.M. Merdes A. Mourey L. Agard D.A. Microtubule nucleation by γ-tubulin complexes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), but such models have been difficult to test given the current lack of structural data for the native complex. Our understanding of γ-TuRC structure comes mainly from studies of heterotetramers of γ-tubulin complex protein 2, or GCP2, GCP3, and γ-tubulin, also termed the γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC) (Oegema et al., 1999Oegema K. Wiese C. Martin O.C. Milligan R.A. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Zheng Y. Characterization of two related Drosophila γ-tubulin complexes that differ in their ability to nucleate microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the γ-TuSC is a Y-shaped complex whose base is composed of laterally associated N-terminal domains of GCP2 and GCP3 (Kollman et al., 2008Kollman J.M. Zelter A. Muller E.G.D. Fox B. Rice L.M. Davis T.N. Agard D.A. The structure of the γ-tubulin small complex: implications of its architecture and flexibility for microtubule nucleation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Notably, in the presence of a fragment of the spindle pole body factor Spc110, recombinant S. cerevisiae γ-TuSCs have a propensity to self-assemble into helical oligomers of varying length in vitro (Kollman et al., 2010Kollman J.M. Polka J.K. Zelter A. Davis T.N. Agard D.A. Microtubule nucleating gamma-TuSC assembles structures with 13-fold microtubule-like symmetry.Nature. 2010; 466: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, negative stain electron tomography and metal shadowing studies have indicated that D. melanogaster γ-TuRCs, which are biochemically similar to the human complex, assemble into finite, lock washer-shaped structures (Moritz et al., 2000Moritz M. Braunfeld M.B. Guénebaut V. Heuser J. Agard D.A. Structure of the gamma-tubulin ring complex: a template for microtubule nucleation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In addition to GCP2 and GCP3, human γ-TuRCs also contain the proteins GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6 (Hutchins et al., 2010Hutchins J.R.A. Toyoda Y. Hegemann B. Poser I. Hériché J.-K. Sykora M.M. Augsburg M.

Cell. 2010; 21: 3963-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, structural models for human γ-TuRC subcomponents in the context of the native complex are not available. Whether the human γ-TuRC assembles from a helical oligomer of γ-TuSCs and how the finite size of the complex might be established are open questions. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of the native human γ-TuRC at ∼3.8 Å overall resolution. Our reconstruction reveals an asymmetric cone-shaped structure assembled from at least 26 polypeptides. We build pseudo-atomic models for the core γ-TuRC components, including GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6, which we find form distinct Y-shaped assemblies of GCP4/GCP5 and GCP4/GCP6 that structurally mimic human GCP2/GCP3 subcomplexes. We also identify an unanticipated structural bridge that includes an actin-like protein and spans >300 Å across the γ-TuRC lumen. Our structure reveals how the human γ-TuRC arranges γ-tubulin into a helical geometry poised to nucleate microtubules. To examine the architecture of human γ-TuRCs, we first sought to purify the native complex. Several previously reported purification strategies were explored (Murphy et al., 2001Murphy S.M. Preble A.M. Patel U.K. O’Connell K.L. Dias D.P. Moritz M. Agard D. Stults J.T. Stearns T. GCP5 and GCP6: two new members of the human γ-tubulin complex.Mol. Biol.

Nucleation of microtubule assembly by a gamma-tubulin-containing ring complex.Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). We found that isolation of the native γ-TuRC from HeLa S3 cytoplasmic extracts via its affinity for the centrosomin motif 1 (CM1) domain of CDK5Rap2, also termed the γ-TuRC-mediated nucleation activator (γ-TuNA) (Choi et al., 2010Choi Y.-K. Liu P. Sze S.K. Dai C. Qi R.Z. CDK5RAP2 stimulates microtubule nucleation by the gamma-tubulin ring complex.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), reliably yielded a complex containing core components whose proportions matched previous qualitative estimates (Murphy et al., 2001Murphy S.M. Preble A.M. Patel U.K. O’Connell K.L. Dias D.P. Moritz M. Agard D. Stults J.T. Stearns T. GCP5 and GCP6: two new members of the human γ-tubulin complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3340-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), as judged by SDS-PAGE and iBAQ analysis of mass spectrometry data (Figures S1A and S1B; Tables S1 and S2; see STAR Methods for purification details) (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011Schwanhäusser B. Busse D. Li N. Dittmar G. Schuchhardt J. Wolf J. Chen W. Selbach M. Global quantification of mammalian gene expression control.Nature. 2011; 473: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4059) Google Scholar). γ-TuRCs purified in this manner were also capable of nucleating microtubule assembly in vitro in a standard turbidity-based assay (Figure S1C), consistent with previous results (Murphy et al., 2001Murphy S.M. Preble A.M. Patel U.K. O’Connell K.L. Dias D.P. Moritz M. Agard D. Stults J.T. Stearns T. GCP5 and GCP6: two new members of the human γ-tubulin complex.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3340-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We determined the structure of the native human γ-TuRC using cryo-EM to an overall resolution of ∼3.8 Å (Figures 1A and S1D–S1G; see STAR Methods for details). The γ-TuRC structure revealed a conical shape ∼30 nm in diameter and ∼20 nm in height (Figure 1A). Fourteen similarly sized (∼4 nm-wide) globular densities line the open face of the cone, each supported by a stalk-like structure. Both the globular domains and the lower parts of the stalk-like structures make substantial lateral contacts with one another, while leaving several narrow gaps in the conical wall of the complex (Figure 1A). Additionally, a substantial density appears to extend down and obstruct the opening found at the base of the γ-TuRC (the “plug” in Figure 1A). Each pair of neighboring stalk-like densities along with their two associated globular domains closely resembles a previous description of the Y-shaped γ-TuSC (Kollman et al., 2008Kollman J.M. Zelter A. Muller E.G.D. Fox B. Rice L.M. Davis T.N. Agard D.A. The structure of the γ-tubulin small complex: implications of its architecture and flexibility for microtubule nucleation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). The human γ-TuRC cone shape is therefore made of 14 individual subunits that could form 7 γ-TuSC-like subcomplexes (Figures 1A–1C). We numbered the individual stalk-like subunits, starting at the base of the γ-TuRC cone and finishing at subunit 14, which partially overlaps with the first subunit (the “overlap” region; Figures 1B and 1C). This organization suggests apparent helical symmetry in the complex. However, the γ-TuRC exhibits at least three features that reveal structural asymmetry. First, an externally protruding density appears only at positions 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the complex (“protruding density”; Figure 1A), suggesting that a set of 4 similar γ-TuSC-like subcomplexes, each with one protruding density, occupies these positions. Second, the remaining 3 γ-TuSC-like subunits at positions 9 to 14, which do not exhibit protruding densities, deviate from a helically symmetric geometry, conferring ellipticity to the γ-TuRC cone shape (“helical deviation”; Figures 1A and 1B). Third, a substantial (∼10 × 2 × 4 nm) density is situated in the lumen of the cone structure and contacts the stalk-like densities from positions 2–10 (“lumenal density”; Figures 1A and 1B). These results suggest that the human γ-TuRC adopts an asymmetric conical structure composed of heterogeneous γ-TuSC-like subunits. The γ-TuRC density map, which was generated from ∼460,000 particles (Figure S2; Table S3), displayed a broad range of local resolution (3.0 Å–12 Å; Figure S1F), revealing a degree of structural “breathing” of this large complex (further discussed below). To improve the local resolution across the γ-TuRC and gain detailed insight into its molecular features, we processed different parts of the complex separately in a “divide and conquer” strategy that employed the use of particle subtraction (Scheres, 2016Scheres S.H.W. Chapter Six - Processing of Structurally Heterogeneous Cryo-EM Data in RELION.in: Crowther R.A. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, 2016: 125-157Google Scholar) (Figure S2; see STAR Methods for processing details). In brief, signal in raw particles not corresponding to desired segmentation regions in the γ-TuRC was subtracted. Signal-subtracted particles were then subjected to focused 3D classification and refinement. The resulting locally refined, segmented maps had more homogeneous resolution (FSC0.146 ranged from 3.4 to 4.5 Å for 6 of the 7 maps and 6.6 Å for the one map corresponding to the “overlap” region; Figure S2). These maps revealed clearly defined side chain densities across a majority of the complex and were used to generate a molecular model of the core γ-TuRC structure, which included 26 assigned and at least 5 tentatively assigned subunits (Figures 1D–1E; Table S4 and S5; Video S1; see STAR Methods for details regarding model building and subunit assignment criteria). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJhOGFiMGM2Y2JjZDkxNWMxZjZjMzQzYzExOGNlMThmNyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3ODE5NjcxfQ.U-4FRy9Bal6ZbEevzxup5AigG-V7x-m7v0Y3XSiursm8y3uR_BUKMzGd63VcSeesoiMRkNG7yVCAPP-jMIIX6yPNjBChTPajBYI1QFw-WCfQQSyiye6Rloq4n-sVOlQk-VSdBK9eibucJF6VOObh9iqLDeZ6Lqpqw36zNv6hDmlR0xwqn9f5NtyV5Nj9OU6c-nlUXwPBqXnLZbkiOEkJq29TJt7StO1_pTTSUcwv6TOR0saN5XsHczMX5FyWcNBfy6GVfTyKTLto3leb68n43O0FMuGfYFfLS9Cez_yxhfKcHYmtPzWOh5xhDGAXQKD-sukZNNDnx9hjn_HFWk6LLg Download .mp4 (15.6 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Surface Representation of the Native Human γ-TuRC Model, Related to Figure 1Subunits are colored according to the legend in Figure 1A. The structure of γ-tubulin in the context of the γ-TuRC is not currently known. Previous high-resolution structural models for γ-tubulin come from crystallographic studies of the monomeric human protein (Aldaz et al., 2005Aldaz H. Rice L.M. Stearns T. Agard D.A. Insights into microtubule nucleation from the crystal structure of human gamma-tubulin.Nature. 2005; 435: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Rice et al., 2008Rice L.M. Montabana E.A. Agard D.A. The lattice as allosteric effector: structural studies of alphabeta- and gamma-tubulin clarify the role of GTP in microtubule assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5378-5383Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We rigid-body fitted a crystallographic model for human γ-tubulin into globular densities at positions 1–13 at the open face of the cone (Figure 1A; PDB: 3CB2 [Rice et al., 2008Rice L.M. Montabana E.A. Agard D.A. The lattice as allosteric effector: structural studies of alphabeta- and gamma-tubulin clarify the role of GTP in microtubule assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5378-5383Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar]). After refinement, these densities clearly accommodated γ-tubulin side chains, as well as a guanine nucleotide (Figures 1F and 1G). A 14th γ-tubulin subunit could be placed into the globular density at position 14 (Figures 1D and 1E), although it did not meet our criteria for assignment (see STAR Methods). The conformations of hallmark structural features (α helices H6–H7 and the intermediate β sheet) of the refined γ-tubulin models at positions 1–13 closely resembled the original crystallographic model (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] = 1.0 Å; Figures S3A–S3C) (Aldaz et al., 2005Aldaz H. Rice L.M. Stearns T. Agard D.A. Insights into microtubule nucleation from the crystal structure of human gamma-tubulin.Nature. 2005; 435: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, Rice et al., 2008Rice L.M. Montabana E.A. Agard D.A. The lattice as allosteric effector: structural studies of alphabeta- and gamma-tubulin clarify the role of GTP in microtubule assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5378-5383Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These data suggest that, under our purification conditions (see STAR Methods), assembly into the native human γ-TuRC does not induce significant structural changes in γ-tubulin, in contrast with a recent study of a recombinant yeast γ-TuSC (Brilot and Agard, 2018Brilot A.F. Agard D.A. The Atomic Structure of the Microtubule-Nucleating γ-Tubulin Small Complex and its Implications for Regulation.2018Crossref Google Scholar). Such structural differences could reflect the possibility of multiple conformational states of γ-tubulin within different γ-TuRC assemblies. Our results also provide details about the γ-tubulin:γ-tubulin interface, which includes interactions between helix H2″ and H3 of one γ-tubulin with helix H6 and H9 of the subsequent γ-tubulin (Figures 1H and 1I). We observed two repeating arrangements of these interfaces; in one, the neighboring γ-tubulins are ∼9 Å apart (between positions 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 9 and 10, and 11 and 12), and in the other, neighboring γ-tubulins are farther (∼15 Å) apart (between positions 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, 10 and 11, and 12 and 13) (Figures S3D and S3E). We note that this alternating variation in the inter-γ-tubulin interfaces would be consistent with different spacings within and between Y-shaped subcomplexes in the γ-TuRC. Next, we turned our attention to the stalk-like densities that are located below each γ-tubulin and together wrap around the cone-shaped structure. These densities have a characteristic overall organization comprising two bundles each built from ∼7 consecutive α helices. The lower (N-domain) bundle adopts an elongated (∼8 × ∼2 nm) fold while the upper (C-domain) bundle, which contacts γ-tubulin, is more compact (∼5 × ∼4 nm) and displays a prominent (>2 nm) two-helix hairpin on the outer face of the γ-TuRC cone (Figures 2A–2C). The general topology of the stalk-like structures resembles a previously described crystallographic model for GCP4, the only human GCP subunit with available structural data. GCP4 is organized into two α-helical bundles (HBs). One corresponds to the conserved γ-TuRC interacting protein motif 1 (GRIP1, corresponding to the N-domain) domain; the other corresponds to the γ-TuRC interacting protein motif 2 (GRIP2; C-domain) domain (Guillet et al., 2011Guillet V. Knibiehler M. Gregory-Pauron L. Remy M.-H. Chemin C. Raynaud-Messina B. Bon C. Kollman J.M. Agard D.A. Merdes A. Mourey L. Crystal structure of γ-tubulin complex protein GCP4 provides insight into microtubule nucleation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 915-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Notably, GCP4 has also been proposed to form part of a γ-TuSC-like subcomplex at the γ-TuRC overlap (i.e., at or near positions 1 or 14) (Farache et al., 2016Farache D. Jauneau A. Chemin C. Chartrain M. Rémy M.-H. Merdes A. Haren L. Functional Analysis of γ-Tubulin Complex Proteins Indicates Specific Lateral Association via Their N-terminal Domains.J. Biol.

Surprisingly, however, the crystallographic model for GCP4 instead fit into the densities at positions 9 and 11 (Figures 2C, 2D, 3C , and 3D; Table S4; ∼82% GCP4 sequence coverage). The resolution of our density map enabled side chain identification that confirmed the identity of GCP4 at these positions of the γ-TuRC (Figures 2D and 3D). Furthermore, we aligned our refined GCP4 model to the monomeric, crystallographic GCP4 model via their N-domains (Guillet et al., 2011Guillet V. Knibiehler M. Gregory-Pauron L. Remy M.-H. Chemin C. Raynaud-Messina B. Bon C. Kollman J.M. Agard D.A. Merdes A. Mourey L. Crystal structure of γ-tubulin complex protein GCP4 provides insight into microtubule nucleation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 915-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which revealed that within the γ-TuRC, the GCP4 C-domain is rotated by ∼10° toward the preceding subunit (Figure S3F), and helix 21 is rotated by ∼90° toward the GCP4-associated γ-tubulin (Figure S3G). Together, these results indicate that complexed GCP4 is structurally different from the monomeric protein and that the γ-TuRC contains two copies of GCP4, both of which are located distal to the “overlap” region.Figure 3Positioning of GCP4 and GCP6 in the γ-TuRCShow full caption(A) Schematic of the γ-TuRC highlighting the locations of GCP4 (yellow) and GCP6 (red).(B) Schematic of a γ-tubulin/GCP4/GCP6 heterotetramer that forms the γ-TuSC-like assembly, γ-TuG4/6, and interacting coiled coil (CC) and helical bundle (HB) of the unassigned densities (dark gray).(C) Density at positions 11–13 used to model N- and C-domains and short C-domain hairpins (indicated) of the second GCP4 (yellow surface) and GCP6 (red surface), viewed from the angle indicated in (A).

Whether specialized hepatic stem cells exist that regenerate the liver during homeostasis or in response to injury is a key question in the field and an area of active investigation. Many tissue stem cells, such as intestinal stem cells (ISCs), are LGR5+/AXIN2+ and utilize WNT/β-catenin signaling to sustain their high proliferative capacity necessary to maintain homeostasis or promote regeneration in response to injury (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). In the homeostatic liver, LGR5 and AXIN2 are co-expressed in pericentral hepatocytes (Planas-Paz et al., 2016Planas-Paz L. Orsini V. Boulter L. Calabrese D. Pikiolek M. Nigsch F. Xie Y. Roma G. Donovan A. Marti P. et al.The RSPO-LGR4/5-ZNRF3/RNF43 module controls liver zonation and size.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and a centro-portal WNT/β-catenin signaling gradient is critical for metabolic liver zonation to enable processing of nutrients and xenobiotics, as well as the expression of serum proteins (Colnot, 2011Colnot S.P.C. Liver Zonation.in: Monga P. Molecular Pathology of Liver Diseases S. Springer Science and Business Media, 2011Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the first few layers of AXIN2+ hepatocytes expressing glutamine synthetase (GS) were attributed increased proliferative potential compared to other hepatocytes, thus suggesting zonal dominance of homeostatic proliferation (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). AXIN2 lineage tracing suggested that these cells could repopulate all hepatocytes along the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal, streaming from the central to the portal vein (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In contrast, lineage tracing of LGR5+ pericentral hepatocytes did not support their increased proliferative capacity and suggested no zonal dominance during homeostasis (Planas-Paz et al., 2016Planas-Paz L. Orsini V. Boulter L. Calabrese D. Pikiolek M. Nigsch F. Xie Y. Roma G. Donovan A. Marti P. et al.The RSPO-LGR4/5-ZNRF3/RNF43 module controls liver zonation and size.Nat.

USA. 2019; 116: 19530-19540Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains unclear whether AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes are stem cells responsible for liver homeostasis. The concept of one specialized liver stem cell compartment is further challenged by the diversity of hepatocyte populations reported to have superior regenerative capacity. SOX9+ periportal hepatocytes, opposite to the pericentral niche, show increased proliferative and regenerative capacity in response to chronic injury (Font-Burgada et al., 2015Font-Burgada J. Shalapour S. Ramaswamy S. Hsueh B. Rossell D. Umemura A. Taniguchi K. Nakagawa H.

Furthermore, telomerase-expressing hepatocytes throughout the liver replenish hepatocytes during homeostasis and in response to injury with no zonal dominance (Lin et al., 2018Lin S. Nascimento E.M. Gajera C.R. Chen L. Neuhöfer P. Garbuzov A. Wang S. Artandi S.E. Distributed hepatocytes expressing telomerase repopulate the liver in homeostasis and injury.Nature. 2018; 556: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). While WNT/β-catenin signaling promotes hepatocyte proliferation and is important for liver development and regeneration (Russell and Monga, 2018Russell J.O. Monga S.P. Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Liver Development, Homeostasis, and Pathobiology.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2018; 13: 351-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether a defined hepatocyte stem cell population, such as AXIN2+/LGR5+ pericentral hepatocytes, or hepatocytes throughout the liver utilize WNT/β-catenin signaling to mediate liver repair in response to diverse insults. Using BAC-transgenic AXIN2 lineage tracing, which does not interfere with WNT/β-catenin signaling, in combination with diverse injury models, targeted cellular ablation of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes and zonal expression profiling, we now clarified the role of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes as well as the contribution of other liver zones during homeostasis and repair. AXIN2 negatively regulates WNT/β-catenin signaling and is a tumor suppressor in liver cancer (Jho et al., 2002Jho E.H. Zhang T. Domon C. Joo C.K. Freund J.N. Costantini F.

In previous AXIN2 lineage tracing mice, insertion of the CreERT2 cassette disrupted one Axin2 allele (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that potential haploinsufficiency of Axin2 might bias WNT/β-catenin signaling and proliferation of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes, we developed BAC-transgenic Axin2CreERT2 mice without heterozygous deletion of Axin2. Similar AXIN2 protein levels in liver as well as similar Axin2 and Lgr5 mRNA expression in liver, gut, and stomach from Axin2CreERT2 compared to WT littermates indicated unaffected WNT/β-catenin signaling in our mice (Figures S1A–S1C). We crossed these mice with R26-EGFP reporter mice to obtain Axin2CreERT2EGFP mice (Planas-Paz et al., 2019Planas-Paz L. Sun T. Pikiolek M. Cochran N.R. Bergling S. Orsini V. Yang Z. Sigoillot F.

We confirmed efficient labeling and lineage tracing of AXIN2+ tissue stem cell compartments in ISCs and stomach stem cells (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1D). EGFP-labeled tissue stem cells in the small intestine and stomach were highly proliferative, as indicated by Ki67 staining (Figures 1B and S1D), which is in line with previous reports and necessary to replace the significant amounts of apoptotic cells (Figure S1E) that are removed by shedding of epithelial tips (Ramachandran et al., 2000Ramachandran A.

Apoptosis in the gastric mucosa: molecular mechanisms, basic and clinical implications.J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2000; 51: 3-15PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, very low hepatocyte apoptosis frequency (Figure S1E) and minimal proliferation of EGFP-labeled pericentral hepatocytes (Figures 1C and S1F) are consistent with their generally low turnover rates during homeostasis (Magami et al., 2002Magami Y. Azuma T. Inokuchi H. Kokuno S. Moriyasu F. Kawai K. Hattori T. Cell proliferation and renewal of normal hepatocytes and bile duct cells in adult mouse liver.Liver. 2002; 22: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One-day AXIN2 lineage tracing labeled few AXIN2+ hepatocytes mostly within the first layers of pericentral hepatocytes marked by the WNT/β-catenin-regulated metabolic enzyme GS (Figures 1D and 1E). The number of EGFP-labeled pericentral hepatocytes increased between 1 and 7 days, reaching beyond the GS+ layers into the adjacent parenchyma (Figures 1D–1F). No further increase in the number of EGFP-labeled hepatocytes from day 7 to 10 months and no streaming into the portal vein region were observed (Figures 1D–1F). The AXIN2 lineage tracing results obtained in Axin2CreERT2EGFP mice were confirmed in Axin2CreERT2LACZ mice (Figures S1G and S1H) using the alternative R26-LACZ reporter (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar), which offered higher labeling efficiency (Figure S1I). Virtually no EGFP-labeled or LACZ-labeled hepatocytes were observed in the portal region at any time point (Figures 1E and S1G). To assess whether the increase in EGFP-labeled hepatocytes during the 7-day lineage tracing period was caused by proliferation of AXIN2+/GS+ hepatocytes labeled on day 1, we included 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling during the lineage tracing period. Surprisingly, only about 2% of the EGFP-labeled hepatocytes on day 7 were EdU+ (Figure 1G), indicating that they did not derive from duplication of AXIN2+ hepatocytes. We further detected no zonal dominance during homeostatic proliferation as indicated by equal numbers of EdU+ hepatocytes in all liver zones (Figures S1J and S1K). After 7-day lineage tracing in Axin2CreERT2EGFP mice, both pericentral and adjacent parenchymal hepatocytes were EGFP labeled, matching the zones of Axin2 in situ hybridization (ISH) signals (Figures S1L and S1M) and expression of the WNT/β-catenin-regulated metabolic enzyme CYP2E1 (Figures 1H and S1N). This suggests that the increase in EGFP-labeled cells occurred via continuous TAM-mediated labeling of AXIN2+ hepatocytes up until day 7, consistent with continuous labeling of hepatic cells during other lineage tracing experiments (Tarlow et al., 2014aTarlow B.D. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. Clonal tracing of Sox9+ liver progenitors in mouse oval cell injury.Hepatology. 2014; 60: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Importantly, Axin2 expression was not confined to the first few GS+ pericentral hepatocyte layers, which were proposed to have stem cell properties (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) or those expressing the tissue stem cell marker Lgr5 (Figure 1I) but extended further into the parenchyma. Together, our data confirm proliferation and lineage tracing of AXIN2+ tissue stem cells in the small intestine and stomach, while AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes neither overtly proliferate nor repopulate the liver during homeostasis. Instead, hepatocytes in all liver zones equally contribute to maintenance of the hepatocyte pool during homeostasis. To further investigate the role of AXIN2+ hepatocytes, we isolated EGFP+ and EGFP– hepatocytes from Axin2CreERT2EGFP mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Figures 1J and S2A). EGFP+ hepatocytes showed increased Axin2 expression and WNT/β-catenin signaling when compared to EGFP– hepatocytes (Figure S2B) and negligible expression of non-hepatocyte markers (Figures S2B–S2D), suggesting purity and separation of AXIN2+ and AXIN2– hepatocytes, respectively. This separation was further confirmed by differential expression of pericentral and periportal metabolic enzymes (Gougelet et al., 2014Gougelet A. Torre C. Veber P. Sartor C. Bachelot L. Denechaud P.D. Godard C. Moldes M. Burnol A.F.

In contrast to AXIN2+ hepatocytes, ISCs (Jadhav et al., 2017Jadhav U. Saxena M. O’Neill N.K. Saadatpour A. Yuan G.C. Herbert Z. Murata K. Shivdasani R.A.

Correlative expression analysis of genes regulating the different cell-cycle stages (Santos et al., 2015Santos A. Wernersson R. Jensen L.J. Cyclebase 3.0: a multi-organism database on cell-cycle regulation and phenotypes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D1140-D1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) indicated no difference between AXIN2+ and AXIN2– hepatocytes, whereas ISCs showed increased expression of cell-cycle genes when compared to AXIN2+ hepatocytes (Figure 1L). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further revealed upregulation of gene sets for metabolic processes in AXIN2+ hepatocytes versus ISCs (Figure S2F) and upregulation of those for proliferative processes in ISCs compared to AXIN2+ hepatocytes (Figure S2G). While both AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes and ISCs are the cell populations with the highest WNT/β-catenin activity in their respective organ, our transcriptomics analyses support different functional roles of these AXIN2+ cell populations. ISCs show a pro-proliferative signature consistent with utilizing WNT/β-catenin signaling for driving proliferation and regeneration of the intestinal villus (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). In contrast, AXIN2+ hepatocytes have a metabolic gene signature and are equally proliferative compared to AXIN2– hepatocytes. Therefore, our transcriptomics data further support that AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes do not constitute a proliferative hepatic stem cell compartment. In order to probe the regenerative potential of pericentral AXIN2+ hepatocytes, we performed AXIN2 lineage tracing following partial hepatectomy (PHx), a liver regeneration model that allows for evaluation of liver regrowth without zonal bias (Mitchell and Willenbring, 2008Mitchell C. Willenbring H. A reproducible and well-tolerated method for 2/3 partial hepatectomy in mice.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Moderate expansion of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes that did not stream toward the portal vein (Figures 2A–2C) and equal EdU incorporation in all liver zones during liver regrowth (Figures 2D and 2E) suggest no superior regenerative capacity of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes following PHx. For spatiotemporal assessment of WNT/β-catenin signaling and hepatocyte proliferation during liver regrowth, we performed an EdU chase in Axin2-LacZ mice either right after PHx for 40 h or from 40 h post-PHx to 72 h post-PHx (Figure 2F). 40 h post-PHx, the majority of EdU+ hepatocytes were detected around the portal vein with much less parenchymal and very few pericentral EdU+ hepatocytes (Figures 2G and 2H). Equal numbers of Ki67+ periportal and parenchymal hepatocytes suggest that 40 h post-PHx parenchymal hepatocytes started proliferating (Figures 2G and 2H). At 72 h post-PHx, fewer periportal but more parenchymal and pericentral hepatocytes were EdU+ and Ki67+ compared with 40 h post-PHx. A greater increase in Ki67+ compared with EdU+ pericentral hepatocytes at 72 h post-PHx indicated that they just had started proliferating (Figures 2G and 2H). Together, our data suggest that hepatocyte proliferation following PHx initiated in the periportal niche and progressed through the parenchyma toward the central vein. Likewise, AXIN2 was upregulated in periportal and parenchymal hepatocytes concomitant with proliferation 40 h post-PHx and reduced again at 72 h post-PHx when their proliferative response declined, respectively (Figures 2I and 2J). TAM injections during regeneration in Axin2CreERT2EGFP mice following PHx labeled significantly more AXIN2+ hepatocytes compared to mice that only received TAM before PHx (Figures 2C and 2K–2M). Labeling of significantly more parenchymal and periportal hepatocytes than in control mice without PHx (Figure 2N) and in those with pre-labeled AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes (Figures 2A–2C) indicates upregulation of AXIN2 throughout the liver during liver regeneration rather than an expansion of hepatocytes from the central vein. Together, our data suggest that all liver zones equally contribute to liver regrowth following PHx with AXIN2 upregulation paralleling initiation of the regenerative wave. To assess how introducing zonal bias by damaging periportal hepatocytes affects the regenerative capacity of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes and those in other liver zones, we subjected TAM-injected Axin2CreERT2EGFP mice to allyl alcohol (AA) treatment followed by alternate day EdU injections during the regenerative phase of 14 days (Figure 3A). Low-dose AA induced moderate damage in periportal hepatocytes triggering mostly local repair in neighboring periportal hepatocytes, whereas high-dose AA resulted in dramatic cell death, infiltration of IBA1+ macrophages, and lytic necrosis of the periportal zone inducing proliferation in all liver zones (Figures 3B, 3C, and S3A). Most EdU+ hepatocytes appeared at the portal vein 14 days after high-dose AA, followed by the parenchyma. Lower proliferation rates in pericentral hepatocytes are consistent with only mild (16%) and non-significant expansion of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes during recovery from high-dose AA injury, with no EGFP+ cells traced into the periportal zone (Figures 3A–3E). Similar to mice subjected to PHx, high-dose AA triggered upregulation of AXIN2 in periportal and parenchymal hepatocytes of Axin2-LacZ mice few days after injury (Figures 3F–3H and S3B). Likewise, labeling of AXIN2+ hepatocytes in Axin2CreERT2EGFP mice during recovery from AA injury resulted in significantly increased numbers of EGFP+ hepatocytes around the portal vein and in the parenchyma (Figures 3I–3L). This suggests that local repair together with compensatory proliferation from hepatocytes throughout the liver contribute to the regeneration of the periportal zone, coinciding with upregulation of AXIN2. To assess the importance of AXIN2+ hepatocytes in regenerating and maintaining the pericentral niche where they reside, we generated Axin2CreERT2DTA mice that allow for TAM-inducible expression of diphtheria toxin A (DTA) enabling targeted ablation of AXIN2+ cells. Following TAM injection, pericentral hepatocytes gradually underwent apoptosis as evidenced by waves of Cleaved Caspase-3-stained hepatocytes peaking at day 3, followed by lytic necrosis and IBA1+/Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-diastase+ macrophages phagocytosing hepatocyte remnants affecting all pericentral hepatocyte layers, peaking at day 5 (Figures 4A–4C, S4A, and S4B). While CYP2E1 staining was completely absent in pericentral hepatocytes at day 5 after DTA expression, remnant CYP2E1+ parenchymal hepatocytes suggest incomplete deletion of peripheral parenchymal AXIN2+ hepatocytes (Figures S4C and S4D). Importantly, the pericentral zone was completely devoid of GS+ or HNF4α+ hepatocytes (Figures 4C and 4D), as well as Axin2 and Lgr5 mRNA staining (Figures 4E–4G), suggesting that we ablated the entire AXIN2+/GS+ pericentral putative hepatocyte stem cell compartment at day 5. Shortly after induction of cell death in AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes, Axin2 and Lgr5 mRNA was highly upregulated in pericentral and parenchymal hepatocytes and to a lesser extent in periportal hepatocytes (Figures 4E-–4G), followed by periportal and parenchymal hepatocyte proliferation (Figures 4H and S4E). Local repair characterized by pericentral proliferation occurred only with several days delay when the niche started to recover (Figures 4H and S4E). EdU incorporation between day 3 and day 9 and analysis at day 9 or day 21 suggested comparable hepatocyte proliferation rates during recovery from AA damage in all liver zones (Figures 4I, 4J, S4F, and S4G). Interestingly, EdU/GS costaining indicated that only a subset (<24%) of the new GS+ hepatocytes was derived by proliferation during recovery of the pericentral niche (Figure 4J). This is consistent with most GS+ hepatocytes originating from conversion of GS– hepatocytes newly juxtaposed to the central vein, supported by compensatory proliferation in all liver zones. Together, our data suggest that hepatocytes throughout the liver contribute to regeneration without superior regenerative capacity of AXIN2+ pericentral hepatocytes. The diversity of hepatic epithelial cell populations associated with high plasticity and regenerative potential challenges the concept of one specialized liver stem cell maintaining liver mass during homeostasis or following injury (Font-Burgada et al., 2015Font-Burgada J.

Both dorsal and ventral hippocampus (dH and vH) project to the NAc, but it remains unknown whether dH and vH act in concert or separately to engage NAc representations related to space and reward. We recorded simultaneously from the dH, vH, and NAc of rats during an appetitive spatial task and focused on hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) to identify times of memory reactivation across brain regions. Here, we show that dH and vH awake SWRs occur asynchronously and activate distinct and opposing patterns of NAc spiking. Only NAc neurons activated during dH SWRs were tuned to task- and reward-related information. These temporally and anatomically separable hippocampal-NAc interactions point to distinct channels of mnemonic processing in the NAc, with the dH-NAc channel specialized for spatial task and reward information.

https://openalex.org/W2995394720,"Summary Transient receptor potential channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel that serves as one of the primary sensors of environmental irritants and noxious substances. Many TRPA1 agonists are electrophiles that are recognized by TRPA1 via covalent bond modifications of specific cysteine residues located in the cytoplasmic domains. However, a mechanistic understanding of electrophile sensing by TRPA1 has been limited due to a lack of high-resolution structural information. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of nanodisc-reconstituted ligand-free TRPA1 and TRPA1 in complex with the covalent agonists JT010 and BITC at 2.8, 2.9, and 3.1 A, respectively. Our structural and functional studies provide the molecular basis for electrophile recognition by the extraordinarily reactive C621 in TRPA1 and mechanistic insights into electrophile-dependent conformational changes in TRPA1. This work also provides a platform for future drug development targeting TRPA1."

Forming an LCB is the first and rate-limiting reaction in the de novo synthesis of SL (Fig. S1). During SL synthesis, LCBs are usually N-acylated to a fatty acid (FA) of variable length (C16–C26) forming ceramides and conjugated to variable headgroup structures forming complex SLs. LCBs are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum by the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase. The most abundant LCB in mammals is the 18-carbon dihydroxy-amino-alkane sphingosine (d18:1) that is formed by the conjugation of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA. Serine palmitoyltransferase, however, can metabolize a variety of other acyl-CoA in the range of C14–C18 and use alanine and glycine as alternative substrates. This forms a broad variety of LCBs, which differ by structure, function, and metabolism (1Carreira A.C. Santos T.C. Lone M.A. Zupančič E. Lloyd-Evans E. de Almeida R.F.M. Hornemann T. Silva L.C.

However, the -dienic sphingoid base sphingadienine (d18:2) that is formed downstream of sphingosine (d18:1) has an additional DB at the Δ14Z position (3Renkonen O. Hirvisalo E.L.

Recently, we reported that 1-deoxySO (m18:1) contains a Δ14Z DB but lacks the canonical DB at the Δ4E position (5Steiner R. Saied E.M. Othman A. Arenz C. Maccarone A.T. Poad B.L.

Whereas the Δ4E DB is introduced by the ceramide desaturase 1 (DEGS1), the enzyme responsible for the introduction of the Δ14Z DB is not known. Here, we identified fatty acid desaturase type 3 (FADS3) as a bona fide sphingoid base desaturase introducing a DB in the Δ14Z position and therefore responsible for converting d18:1 into d18:2 and 1-deoxySA (m18:0) into 1-deoxySO (m18:1). Human plasma contains different SL classes, of which the most abundant are sphingomyelins (SM), hexosylceramides (HexCer), and ceramides (Cer). These classes are formed on a variety of LCB backbone structures, and variations in their LCB composition are associated with different pathological conditions (6Othman A. Rütti M.F. Ernst D.

Differences in the LCB profile predict the risk for future diabetes type 2 (T2DM) independent from classical risk factors, such as BMI and blood glucose (9Mwinyi J. Boström A. Fehrer I. Othman A.

Males and females have different risk profiles for T2DM. In men, T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and BMI, whereas obesity is more common in women. We therefore compared the LCB profile in an age- and BMI-matched subgroup of female and male participants of the CoLaus cohort (n = 329 each). LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose were not different between groups (Table 1), whereas total and HDL cholesterol were higher and waist/hip ratio was lower in females (p = −log 49.4). In plasma and tissue, the majority of LCBs is N-acylated and conjugated to variable headgroups. Nonconjugated LCBs in plasma are minor and less than 1% of the total. The combination of a variable LCB with a variable FA frequently results in the formation of isomeric structures (e.g. d18:1/24:0 versus d18:0/24:1), which interfere with the LCB analysis by LC-MS. To avoid interference with the N-acyl chain, we subjected the extracted lipids to a sequential acid/base hydrolysis (10Alecu I. Othman A. Penno A. Saied E.M. Arenz C. von Eckardstein A. Hornemann T.

Vollenweider P. Association between parental history and genetic risk scores for coronary heart disease prediction: the population-based CoLaus study.Atherosclerosis. 2016; 244 (26584140): 59-6510.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2015.10.104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As the enzyme converts d18:1 into d18:2, we hypothesized that genetic variations in the desaturase gene will be reflected by changes in the d18:1/d18:2 ratio. We therefore used this ratio as a metabolic outcome trait for a GWAS on 1100 participants of the CoLaus cohort for whom the LCB profile was already available from an earlier study (9Mwinyi J. Boström A. Fehrer I. Othman A. Waeber G. Marti-Soler H. Vollenweider P. Marques-Vidal P. Schiöth H.B. von Eckardstein A. Hornemann T. Plasma 1-deoxysphingolipids are early predictors of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.PLoS One. 2017; 12 (28472035): e017577610.1371/journal.pone.0175776PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis revealed a group of adjacent SNPs, showing a significant association with the d18:1/d18:2 ratio. The strongest association was seen for SNP rs174455 (p = −log 7.93), which is located in an intronic region of the fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) gene on chromosome 11q12.2–13.1 (Fig. 1D). The same region clusters two other desaturases, FADS1 and FADS2, which metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids (12Park H.G. Park W.J. Kothapalli K.S. Brenna J.T. The fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) gene product catalyzes Δ4 desaturation to yield n-3 docosahexaenoic acid and n-6 docosapentaenoic acid in human cells.FASEB J. 2015; 29 (26065859): 3911-391910.1096/fj.15-271783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, the function of FADS3 was still elusive. The FADS3 gene spans 17.9 kb of genomic DNA and has the same structure as FADS1 and FADS2, consisting of 12 exons and 11 introns. On the protein level, FADS3 is 52 and 62% homologous to FADS1 and FADS2, respectively. To test whether FADS3 is a Δ14Z LCB desaturase, we expressed the mouse and human FADS3 cDNA in HEK293 cells. Endogenous d18:2 levels in HEK293 cells were low, indicating a low activity of the putative Δ14Z desaturase. For comparison, we also expressed the cDNA of mFADS1 and mFADS2. Expression levels were comparable for all constructs (Fig. 2A). Immune fluorescence microscopy showed an intracellular colocalization of FADS3 with calnexin, indicating that FADS3 is an ER protein (Fig. 2B). Enzyme activity was tested in human and mouse FADS3-expressing cells supplemented either with isotope-labeled (d7)d18:0 or (d3)m18:0. The free LCBs were absorbed by the cells (13Karsai G. Kraft F. Haag N. Korenke G.C. Hänisch B. Othman A. Suriyanarayanan S. Steiner R. Knopp C. Mull M. Bergmann M. Schröder J.M. Weis J. Elbracht M. Begemann M. et al.DEGS1-associated aberrant sphingolipid metabolism impairs nervous system function in humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 (30620338): 1229-123910.1172/JCI124159Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and metabolized to (d7)ceramide and downstream products, such as (d7)SM and (d7)HexCer (Fig. S2A). After 48 h, the lipids were extracted and hydrolyzed, and the LCB profile were analyzed by LC-MS. In both mFADS3- and hFADS3-expressing cells, we observed a strong increase in d18:2 (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2B), which was not seen in mFADS1- or mFADS2-expressing cells. In addition, FADS3-expressing cells showed an increased conversion of m18:0 into m18:1, indicating that the Δ14Z DB in 1-deoxySO is also formed by FADS3 (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2C). To test whether FADS3 acts on N-acylated or free LCBs, we treated cells with fumonisin B1 (FB1). FB1 inhibits ceramide synthase and therefore the N-acylation of LCBs. In the presence of FB1, the conversion was about 70% reduced, but a significant amount of (d7)d18:1 was still converted into (d7)d18:2. This was confirmed in vitro, by adding either the free LCB (d7)d18:1 or the N-acylated d18:1/6:0 to cell-free extract of FADS3-expressing HEK cells. Both the free and the N-acylated LCBs were effectively converted into their dienic forms (Fig. 2F), indicating that FADS3 is capable of metabolizing both free and N-acylated LCBs. For further confirmation, we performed the reverse experiments by knocking down endogenous FADS3 in HeLa cells, which had a higher endogenous FADS3 expression than HEK293 cells. Transfection with FADS3 siRNA (siFADS3) abolished FADS3 expression almost completely compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (siSCR) (Fig. 3A). LCB profiling revealed that almost no isotope-labeled (d7)d18:2 was formed in the absence of FADS3, whereas in siSCR-treated cells, a significant conversion of (d7)d18:0 into (d7)d18:1 and finally into (d7)d18:2 was observed (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the conversion of isotope-labeled (d3)m18:0 into (d3)m18:1 was mostly abolished in siFADS3-treated cells (Fig. 3C and Fig. S4). Finally, we analyzed the LCB profile in plasma of FADS3-deficient mice (14Zhang J.Y. Qin X. Liang A. Kim E. Lawrence P. Park W.J. Kothapalli K.S.D. Brenna J.T. Fads3 modulates docosahexaenoic acid in liver and brain.Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent.

No d18:2 was detected in plasma of FADS−/− mice, whereas FADS+/− mice had about 50% of the WT levels (Fig. 3D). To see whether the Δ14Z DB has biological relevance, we cultured WT and FADS3-overexpressing cells with increasing amounts of m18:0 and quantified the number of surviving cells after 48 h. HEK293 cells overexpressing FADS3 were significantly more resistant to m18:0 toxicity than WT cells (Fig. 3E). As d18:2 plasma levels were higher in females, we compared the FADS3 tissue expression between males and females using the public gene expression data from the GTEx portal (https://gtexportal.org). 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. Overall, the highest FADS3 expression was seen for peripheral nerve, aorta, and adipose tissue. The majority of tissues showed higher FADS3 expression in females. The most pronounced difference was seen for adipose tissues, with 194.6 transcripts per million (TPM) in females versus 166.7 TPM in males. Sphingadienine (d18:2) is an atypical sphingoid base that contains two DBs, a Δ4E and a Δ14Z (3Renkonen O. Hirvisalo E.L. Structure of plasma sphingadienine.J.

Whereas the Δ4E DB is introduced by DEGS1 during SL de novo synthesis, the enzyme introducing the Δ14Z DB was not known. However, in a gender-, age-, and BMI-matched cohort, we identified d18:2 as the second most abundant LCB (Fig. 1A) and significantly higher in females than in males. This confirms data from two recent epidemiologic studies, which also report gender-specific difference in d18:2-based SLs (16Chew W.S. Torta F. Ji S. Choi H. Begum H. Sim X. Khoo C.M. Khoo E.Y.H.

Although, d18:2 was first described in the late 1960s (3Renkonen O. Hirvisalo E.L. Structure of plasma sphingadienine.J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10 (5356753): 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the responsible enzyme forming the Δ14Z double was not known. Based on genetic association studies in combination with in vivo and in vitro experiments, we identified FADS3 as a bona fide Δ14Z long-chain base desaturase. Data from the GTEx database revealed generally higher FADS3 expression in females for many tissues, including peripheral nerve and adipose tissue, but also liver, kidney, and muscle. Higher FADS3 expression was also reported for female mice (18Pédrono F. Blanchard H. Kloareg M. D'andréa S. Daval S. Rioux V. Legrand P. The fatty acid desaturase 3 gene encodes for different FADS3 protein isoforms in mammalian tissues.J.

Although human FADS3 was first cloned in 2000 (19Marquardt A. Stöhr H. White K. Weber B.H. cDNA cloning, genomic structure, and chromosomal localization of three members of the human fatty acid desaturase family.Genomics. 2000; 66 (10860662): 175-18310.1006/geno.2000.6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), its function remained elusive. FADS3 is composed of an N-terminal cytochrome b5-like domain and three histidine motifs at the C-terminal ends, which is characteristic for membrane-bound front end desaturases (20Park W.J. Kothapalli K.S. Reardon H.T. Kim L.Y. Brenna J.T. Novel fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) transcripts generated by alternative splicing.Gene. 2009; 446 (19573581): 28-3410.1016/j.gene.2009.06.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vitro studies indicated that FADS3 is specific for trans-vaccenic acid (trans-11–18:1), catalyzing the synthesis of a trans-11,cis-13-linoleic acid isomer (Δ13 desaturation) (21Rioux V. Pédrono F. Blanchard H. Duby C. Boulier-Monthéan N. Bernard L. Beauchamp E. Catheline D. Legrand P. Trans-vaccenate is Δ13-desaturated by FADS3 in rodents.J.

Interestingly, an earlier GWAS on genetic determinants of circulating sphingolipids found FADS3 to be strongly associated with SM species containing monounsaturated N-acyl chains (22Hicks A.A. Pramstaller P.P. Johansson A. Vitart V. Rudan I. Ugocsai P. Aulchenko Y. Franklin C.S. Liebisch G. Erdmann J. Jonasson I. Zorkoltseva I.V. Pattaro C. Hayward C.

As d18:1-based SLs with unsaturated acyl chains (e.g. SM d18:1/24:1) are isobaric to SLs with saturated fatty acids formed on a d18:2 backbone (e.g. SM d18:2/24:0), these associations could also refer to -dienic SM species (Figs. S3 and S5). FADS3 localizes to human chromosome 11q13 (23Blanchard H. Legrand P. Pédrono F. Fatty acid desaturase 3 (Fads3) is a singular member of the Fads cluster.Biochimie. 2011; 93 (20226833): 87-9010.1016/j.biochi.2010.03.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is known as a cancer hotspot locus (19Marquardt A.

It is located in a gene cluster together with FADS1 and FADS2, which were identified previously as Δ-5 and Δ-6 desaturases. FADS3 mRNA expression responds inversely to FADS1 and FADS2 expression levels. In FADS2-deficient mice, FADS3 expression increased 3-fold (25Stroud C.K. Nara T.Y. Roqueta-Rivera M. Radlowski E.C.

FADS3 is spliced, yielding to alternative transcripts, which are conserved in several mammalian and avian species (18Pédrono F. Blanchard H. Kloareg M. D'andréa S. Daval S. Rioux V. Legrand P.

However, it is not yet clear whether these alternative transcripts are catalytically active. Little is known about the function of d18:2-based SLs.

It serves as a backbone for complex sphingolipids (Fig. 1C) and forms -dienic LCB phosphates (SAdienine-1P) (29Sutter I. Velagapudi S. Othman A. Riwanto M. Manz J. Rohrer L. Rentsch K. Hornemann T.

It is noteworthy that the Δ14 DB in d18:2 is in cis conformation, introducing a kink into the otherwise straight LCB structure. This might affect the lateral assembly of d18:2-based SLs in biological membranes and could interfere with membrane nanodomain formation and receptor clustering. In the first reports, FADS3 KO mice showed no overt phenotype (14Zhang J.Y. Qin X. Liang A. Kim E. Lawrence P. Park W.J. Kothapalli K.S.D. Brenna J.T.

Methods Australian adults (N = 439) completed the PERMA Profiler and measures of physical and mental health (SF-12), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS 21), subjective physical activity (Active Australia Survey), and objective activity and sleep (GENEActiv accelerometer). Internal consistency was examined using Cronbach’s alpha and associations between theoretically related constructs examined using Pearson’s correlation. Model fit in comparison with theorised models was examined via Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results Results indicated acceptable internal consistency for overall PERMA Profiler scores and all subscales (α range = 0.80–0.93) except Engagement (α = 0.66). Moderate associations were found between PERMA Profiler wellbeing scores with subjective constructs (e.g. depression, anxiety, stress; r = -0.374 - -0.645, p = <0.001) but not objective physical activity or sleep. Data failed to meet model fit criteria for neither the theorised five-factor nor an alternative single-factor structure. Conclusions Findings were mixed, providing strong support for the scale’s internal consistency and moderate support for congervent and divergent validity, albeit not in comparison to objectively captured activity outcomes. We could not replicate the theorised data structure nor an alternative, single factor structure. Results indicate insufficient psychometric properties of the PERMA Profiler."
https://openalex.org/W2996962623,"Understanding the relationship between exogenous melatonin and water deficit stress is crucial for achieving high yields and alleviating the effects of water deficit stress on soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) plants in agriculture. This study investigated the effects of exogenous melatonin on soybean photosynthetic capacity under water deficit stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. We conducted a potting experiment in 2018 using the soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) cultivar Suinong 26. We identified the impacts of a concentration of PEG 6000 simulating drought (15%, w/v) and an appropriate melatonin concentration (100 μmol/L) on the growth of soybean seedlings and flowering stages in a preliminary test. We applied exogenous melatonin by foliar spraying and root application to determine the effects on leaf photosynthesis during water deficit stress. Our results indicated that 15% PEG 6000 had an obvious inhibitory effect on the growth of soybean seedlings and flowering stages, causing oxidative stress and damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2O2 and O2·-) accumulation and potentially reducing air exchange parameters and photosystem II (PSII) efficiency. The application of exogenous melatonin significantly relieved the inhibitory effects of PEG 6000 stress on seedlings and flowering growth, and gas exchange parameters, potentially improved PSII efficiency, improved the leaf area index (LAI) and the accumulation of dry matter, slowed down oxidative stress and damage to leaves by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT), reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), and ultimately improved soybean yield. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that application of exogenous melatonin at the seedlings and flowering stages of soybean is effective in alleviating plant damage caused by water deficit stress and improving the drought resistance of soybean plants. In addition, the results showed that application of exogenous melatonin by root is superior to foliar spraying."
https://openalex.org/W2997220995,"Soy protein concentrate (SPC), as a protein source, is widely used to replace partial fishmeal (FM) in aquafeeds, especially for carnivorous fish. This study investigated the effects of partial FM replacement by SPC for juvenile pearl gentian grouper. The fish were fed with diets containing six levels of SPC (SPC 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75) for 6 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, average body weight gain (BWG), specific growth ratio (SGR), and weight gain ratio (WGR) had the highest values in fish fed with diet SPC 15, followed by that of fish fed with SPC 0 while fish fed with SPC 75 had the lowest values (P < 0.05). Fish fed with diet SPC 15 and SPC 30 had the highest protein efficiency ratio (PER) while fish fed with diet SPC 15, SPC 30, and SPC 45 had the highest feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P < 0.05). Daily feed intake (DFI) was significantly decreased in fish fed with diets containing any level of SPC (P < 0.05). Survival rate was significantly higher in fish fed with diets SPC 15, SPC 30, and SPC 45 as compared to other treatments. Fish fed the diet including less than 30% FM replacement showed a higher protein content in the muscle. The ADC of dietary protein and some amino acids were significantly higher in diets SPC 0, followed by SPC 15; while SPC 75 had the lowest content (P < 0.05). Similarly, fish fed with SPC 30 and SPC 15 showed significantly higher protein and amino acid (AA) retention than other dietary treatments. The optimal FM replacement with SPC for specific growth ratio (SGR) was estimated to be 14.41% using a non-linear higher order regression model. These results indicated that pearl gentian grouper has a limited ability to utilize SPC as a protein source, and the FM replacement with SPC should be less than 30% (FM45.5 g 100g -1 and SPC18g 100g -1)."
https://openalex.org/W2998041033,"Benthic invertebrates are the most commonly used organisms used to assess ecological status as required by the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). For WFD-compliant assessments, benthic invertebrate communities are sampled, identified and counted. Taxa × abundance matrices are used to calculate indices and the resulting scores are compared to reference values to determine the ecological status class. DNA-based tools, such as DNA metabarcoding, provide a new and precise method for species identification but cannot deliver robust abundance data. To evaluate the applicability of DNA-based tools to ecological status assessment, we evaluated whether the results derived from presence/absence data are comparable to those derived from abundance data. We analysed benthic invertebrate community data obtained from 13,312 WFD assessments of German streams. Broken down to 30 official stream types, we compared assessment results based on abundance and presence/absence data for the assessment modules “organic pollution” (i.e., the saprobic index) and “general degradation” (a multimetric index) as well as their underlying metrics. In 76.6% of cases, the ecological status class did not change after transforming abundance data to presence/absence data. In 12% of cases, the status class was reduced by one (e.g., from good to moderate), and in 11.2% of cases, the class increased by one. In only 0.2% of cases, the status shifted by two classes. Systematic stream type-specific deviations were found and differences between abundance and presence/absence data were most prominent for stream types where abundance information contributed directly to one or several metrics of the general degradation module. For a single stream type, these deviations led to a systematic shift in status from ‘good’ to ‘moderate’ (n = 201; with only n = 3 increasing). The systematic decrease in scores was observed, even when considering simulated confidence intervals for abundance data. Our analysis suggests that presence/absence data can yield similar assessment results to those for abundance-based data, despite type-specific deviations. For most metrics, it should be possible to intercalibrate the two data types without substantial efforts. Thus, benthic invertebrate taxon lists generated by standardised DNA-based methods should be further considered as a complementary approach."

While risks vary for different communities, disaster and emergency preparedness is recognized as essential for all nation-states. Evidence to inform measurement of preparedness is lacking. The objective of this study was to identify and define a set of public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) indicators to advance performance measurement for local/regional public health agencies.A three-round modified Delphi technique was employed to develop indicators for PHEP. The study was conducted in Canada with a national panel of 33 experts and completed in 2018. A list of indicators was derived from the literature. Indicators were rated by importance and actionability until achieving consensus.The scoping review resulted in 62 indicators being included for rating by the panel. Panel feedback provided refinements to indicators and suggestions for new indicators. In total, 76 indicators were proposed for rating across all three rounds; of these, 67 were considered to be important and actionable PHEP indicators.This study developed an indicator set of 67 PHEP indicators, aligned with a PHEP framework for resilience. The 67 indicators represent important and actionable dimensions of PHEP practice in Canada that can be used by local/regional public health agencies and validated in other jurisdictions to assess readiness and measure improvement in their critical role of protecting community health."
https://openalex.org/W2995448053,"Elevated levels of glucose and fatty acids are the main characteristics of diabetes, obesity and other metabolic disorders, associated with increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Once the primary pathogenesis of diabetes is established, which is potentially linked to both genetic and environmental factors, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia exert further destructive and/or toxic effects on β-cells. The concept of glucolipotoxicity has arisen from the combination of deleterious effects of chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acid levels on pancreatic β- cell function and/or survival. Though numerous studies have been conducted in this field, the exact molecular mechanisms and causative factors still need to be established. The aim of the present work was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress, and inflammatory/antioxidant responses in the presence of high concentrations of glucose/fatty acids in a cell-culture system using an insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cell line (Rin-5F) and to study the effects of the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on β-cell toxicity. In our study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of cytotoxicity in the presence of high glucose (up to 25 mM) and high palmitic acid (up to 0.3 mM) on Rin-5F cells. Our results suggest that the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying β-cell toxicity are mediated by increased oxidative stress, imbalance of redox homeostasis, glutathione (GSH) metabolism and alterations in inflammatory responses. Pre-treatment with NAC attenuated oxidative stress and alterations in GSH metabolism associated with β-cells cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2997620369,"The oral, cervical, and genital mucosa, covered by stratified squamous epithelia with polarized organization and strong tight and adherens junctions, play a critical role in preventing transmission of viral pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-1 interaction with mucosal epithelial cells may depolarize epithelia and disrupt their tight and adherens junctions; however, the molecular mechanism of HIV-induced epithelial disruption has not been completely understood. We showed that prolonged interaction of cell-free HIV-1 virions, and viral envelope and transactivator proteins gp120 and tat, respectively, with tonsil, cervical, and foreskin epithelial cells induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is an epigenetic process leading to the disruption of mucosal epithelia and allowing the paracellular spread of viral and other pathogens. Interaction of cell-free virions and gp120 and tat proteins with epithelial cells substantially reduced E-cadherin expression and activated vimentin and N-cadherin expression, which are well-known mesenchymal markers. HIV gp120- and tat-induced EMT was mediated by SMAD2 phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors Slug, Snail, Twist1 and ZEB1. Activation of TGF-β and MAPK signaling by gp120, tat, and cell-free HIV virions revealed the critical roles of these signaling pathways in EMT induction. gp120- and tat-induced EMT cells were highly migratory via collagen-coated membranes, which is one of the main features of mesenchymal cells. Inhibitors of TGF-β1 and MAPK signaling reduced HIV-induced EMT, suggesting that inactivation of these signaling pathways may restore the normal barrier function of mucosal epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W2994654868,"Ethiopia is commonly affected by drought and famine, and this has taken quite a toll on citizens of the country, particularly the under-five children. Undernutrition among under-five children in Ethiopia is a prominent public health concern, and it lacked attention for decades. However, the government of Ethiopia, together with other stakeholders, committed to overcoming the impact of malnutrition through the transformational plan. Here we show the magnitude of undernutrition among under-five children and the factors predicting the achievement of global nutrition targets set for 2025 at the World Health Assembly.Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016 was used for this study. A total of 9494 child-mother pairs were included in this analysis. The nutritional status indicators (Height-for-age, Weight-for-height and Weight-for-age) of children were measured and categorized based on the World Health Organization child growth standards. A multilevel logistic regression model adjusted for clusters and sampling weights were used to identify factors associated with stunting, underweight, and wasting. The independent variables were assessed by calculating the odds ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI).The prevalence of stunting was 38.3% (95% CI: 36.4% to 40.2%), under-weight 23.3% (95%CI: 21.9% to 24.9%) and wasting 10.1% (95%, CI: 9.1% to 11.2%). Sex of the child (male), children older than 24 months, recent experience of diarrhea, household wealth index (poorest), and administrative regions (Tigray, Amhara and developing regions) had a higher risk of undernutrition. On the other hand, children born from overweight mothers and educated mother (primary, secondary or higher) had a lower risk of undernutrition.The burden of undernutrition is still considerably high in Ethiopia. Implimentation of strategies and policies that focus on improving the socioeconomic educatiional status of the community need to be sustained. Generally, actions targeted on factors contributing to undernutrition among under-five children demands immediate attention to achieve national and global nutrition target."
https://openalex.org/W2998363839,"The Tropical Andes region includes biodiversity hotspots of high conservation priority whose management strategies depend on the analysis of forest dynamics drivers (FDDs). These depend on complex social and ecological interactions that manifest on different space–time scales and are commonly evaluated through regression analysis of multivariate datasets. However, processing such datasets is challenging, especially when time series are used and inconsistencies in data collection complicate their integration. Moreover, regression analysis in FDD characterization has been criticized for failing to capture spatial variability; therefore, alternatives such as geographically weighted regression (GWR) have been proposed, but their sensitivity to multicollinearity has not yet been solved. In this scenario, we present an innovative methodology that combines techniques to: 1) derive remote sensing time series products; 2) improve census processing with dasymetric mapping; 3) combine GWR and random forest (RF) to derive local variables importance; and 4) report results based in a clustering and hypothesis testing. We applied this methodology in the northwestern Ecuadorian Amazon, a highly heterogeneous region characterized by different active fronts of deforestation and reforestation, within the time period 2000–2010. Our objective was to identify linkages between these processes and validate the potential of the proposed methodology. Our findings indicate that land-use intensity proxies can be extracted from remote sensing time series, while intercensal analysis can be facilitated by calculating population density maps. Moreover, our implementation of GWR with RF achieved accurate predictions above the 74% using the out-of-bag samples, demonstrating that derived RF features can be used to construct hypothesis and discuss forest change drivers with more detailed information. In the other hand, our analysis revealed contrasting effects between deforestation and reforestation for variables related to suitability to agriculture and accessibility to its facilities, which is also reflected according patch size, land cover and population dynamics patterns. This approach demonstrates the benefits of integrating remote sensing–derived products and socioeconomic data to understand coupled socioecological systems more from a local than a global scale."
https://openalex.org/W2997354830,"Antibodies that recognize commensal microbial antigens may be cross reactive with a part of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein gp41. To improve understanding of the role of the microbiota in modulating the immune response to HIV vaccines, we studied the associations of the gut microbiota composition of participants in the HIV Vaccine Trials Network 096 clinical trial with their HIV-specific immune responses in response to vaccination with a DNA-prime, pox virus boost strategy designed to recapitulate the only efficacious HIV-vaccine trial (RV144). We observed that both levels of IgG antibodies to gp41 at baseline and post-vaccination levels of IgG antibodies to the Con.6.gp120.B, ZM96.gp140 and gp70 B.CaseA V1-V2 antigens were associated with three co-occurring clusters of family level microbial taxa. One cluster contained several families positively associated with gp41-specific IgG and negatively associated with vaccine-matched gp120, gp140 and V1-V2-specific IgG responses. A second cluster contained families that negatively associated with gp41 and positively associated with gp120, gp140 and V1-V2-specific IgG responses. A third cluster contained microbial groups that did not correlate with any immune responses. Baseline and post-vaccination levels of gp41 IgG were not significantly correlated, suggesting that factors beyond the microbiome that contribute to immune response heterogeneity. Sequence variant richness was positively associated with gp41, p24, pg140 and V1-V2 specific IgG responses, gp41 and p24 IgA responses, and CD4+ T cell responses to HIV-1 proteins. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the gut microbiota may be an important predictor of vaccine response."
https://openalex.org/W2998422730,"Missed nursing care is considered an error of omission and is defined as any aspect of required patient care that is omitted (either in part or whole) or significantly delayed. Nursing care missed in the perinatal setting can cause negative outcomes and repercussions for the quality and safety of care. This has been reported in multiple settings and countries and is tied to negative maternal outcomes. Preventing missed nursing care requires in-depth research considering the clinical setting.The main aim of the study was to assess commonly missed nursing care elements, reasons, and factors for the omission in the obstetric and gynecologic units of general hospitals in Tigray 2017/18.A cross-sectional study was conducted in eight randomly selected general hospitals in Tigray, Ethiopia. A total of 422 nurses and midwives were selected through simple random sampling using the staff list as a sampling frame. To identify the commonly missed nursing care and related factors, the MISSCARE survey tool was used. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess potential risk factors of nursing cares omission.The study results showed that 299 (74.6%) participants commonly missed at least one nursing care in the perinatal setting. Labor resources 386(96.3%), teamwork 365(91%), material resources 361 (90%) and communication 342 (85.3%) were the reasons identified for commonly missing care. In the multivariate analyses, sex (p-value <0.001), educational level (p-value 0.034), working shift (p-value <0.001) and having an intention to leave the institution (p-value <0.001) showed a significant association with commonly missing care.The proportion of commonly missed nursing care was high. After adjusting for demographic variables, labor resources, material resources, and communication were reasons for commonly missed nursing care. Increasing male professional proportion, investing in nurses/midwives training, and harmonizing nursing service administration through appropriate working shift arrangement and timely assessment of professionals' stability and satisfaction could minimize frequent omission of nursing care."
https://openalex.org/W2995713175,"Periodic monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility patterns in clinical settings is vital to ascertain the potency as well as re-establishing empirical therapy. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogens isolated from routine laboratory specimens at Ndola Teaching Hospital. A retrospective study was conducted on routine specimens received between May 2016 and July 2018. Specimens were cultured on standard media and Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was used for susceptibility testing in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute’s recommendations. A total of 693 specimens were analyzed, of which 65.9% (457) specimens came from inpatient departments and 49.1% (340) came from female patients. The commonest specimens were urine (58.6%), blood (12.7%) and wound swabs (8.5%), and the most common microorganisms were coliform (29.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.4%), coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS, 13.4%), and Escherichia coli (13%). The highest percentage of resistance to any particular antibiotic was co-trimoxazole (91.7%, 33) followed by nalidixic acid (75.2%, 279), norfloxacin (69.0%, 100), ceftazidime (55.7%, 185), nitrofurantoin (46.6%, 191), chloramphenicol (43%, 111) and ciprofloxacin (8.6%, 271). Furthermore, patient location had resistance effect on coliform (p = 0.014), CoNS (p = 0.031), Streptococcus species (p = 0.024) and Klebsiella species (p = 0.004) to nitrofurantoin, ceftazidime, nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol, respectively. Besides coliform, resistance of Enterobacter species to ceftazidime and Proteus species to nalidixic acid were more from female patients. Generally, the most effective antibiotics were chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin with addition of ceftazidime on blood pathogens and ciprofloxacin on wound swab pathogens. The common isolates were coliform, S. aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococci and Escherichia coli. The resistance of most bacteria to ceftazidime and nitrofurantoin were influenced by both gender and location. Our study presents a broad overview of the resistance profiles of bacterial isolates. However, more nosocomial prevalence and antibiogram studies on individual routine specimens are required to provide a more detailed picture of resistance patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2997489991,"Objective Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have unique metabolic properties which may improve insulin sensitivity (Si) and beta cell function but data in humans are limited. We conducted a 6-week clinical trial of MCT oil supplementation. Methods 22 subjects without diabetes (8 males, 14 females, mean ± standard error age 39±2.9 years, baseline BMI 27.0±1.4 kg/m2) were counseled to maintain their body weight and physical activity (PA) during the trial. Dietary intake, PA data, body composition, and resting energy expenditure (REE) were obtained through dietary recall, international PA questionnaire, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and indirect calorimetry, respectively. MCT prescriptions were given based on REE and PA to replace part of dietary fat with 30 grams of MCT per 2000 kcal daily. Insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after MCT to measure changes in Si, acute insulin response (AIR), disposition index (DI), and glucose effectiveness (Sg). Results MCT were well tolerated and weight remained stable (mean change 0.3 kg, p = 0.39). Fasting REE, respiratory quotient, and body composition were stable during the intervention. There were no significant changes in mean fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, fasting total ketones, Si, AIR, DI, Sg, leptin, fructosamine, and proinsulin. The mean change in Si was 0.5 10−4 min-1 per mU/L (95% CI: -1.4, 2.4), corresponding to a 12% increase from baseline, and the range was -4.7 to 12.9 10−4 min-1 per mU/L. Mean total adiponectin decreased significantly from 22925 ng/mL at baseline to 17598 ng/mL at final visit (p = 0.02). The baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were not significantly associated with the change in Si. Discussion There were a wide range of changes in the minimal model parameters of glucose and insulin metabolism in subjects following 6 weeks of MCT as an isocaloric substitution for part of usual dietary fat intake. Since this was a single-arm non-randomized study without a control group, it cannot be certain whether these changes were due to MCT so further randomized controlled trials are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2995328878,"β- N -methylamino- l -alanine (BMAA) is a nonproteinogenic amino acid that has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). BMAA has been found in human protein extracts; however, the mechanism by which it enters the proteome is still unclear. It has been suggested that BMAA is misincorporated at serine codons during protein synthesis, but direct evidence of its cotranslational incorporation is currently lacking. Here, using LC-MS–purified BMAA and several biochemical assays, we sought to determine whether any aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) utilizes BMAA as a substrate for aminoacylation. Despite BMAA's previously predicted misincorporation at serine codons, following a screen for amino acid activation in ATP/PP i exchange assays, we observed that BMAA is not a substrate for human seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS). Instead, we observed that BMAA is a substrate for human alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) and can form BMAA-tRNA Ala by escaping from the intrinsic AlaRS proofreading activity. Furthermore, we found that BMAA inhibits both the cognate amino acid activation and the editing functions of AlaRS. Our results reveal that, in addition to being misincorporated during translation, BMAA may be able to disrupt the integrity of protein synthesis through multiple different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2995372405,"The MADS-box gene family encodes transcription factors with many biological functions that extensively regulate plant growth, development and reproduction. Erigeron breviscapus is a medicinal herb used widely in traditional Chinese medicine, and is believed to improve blood circulation and ameliorate platelet coagulation. In order to gain a detailed understanding of how transcription factor expression may regulate the growth of this potentially important medicinal plant, a genome-wide analysis of the MADS-box gene family of E. breviscapus is needed. In the present study, 44 MADS-box genes were identified in E. breviscapus and categorized into five subgroups (MIKC, Mα, Mβ, Mγ and Mδ) according to their phylogenetic relationships with the Arabidopsis MADS-box genes. Additionally, the functional domain, subcellular location and motif compositions of the E. breviscapus MADS-box gene products were characterized. The expression levels for each of the E. breviscapus MADS-box (EbMADS) genes were analyzed in flower, leaf, stem and root organs, and showed that the majority of EbMADS genes were expressed in flowers. Meanwhile, some MADS genes were found to express high levels in leaf, stem and root, indicating that the MADS-box genes are involved in various aspects of the physiological and developmental processes of the E. breviscapus. The results from gene expression analysis under different pollination treatments revealed that the MADS-box genes were highly expressed after non-pollinated treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this study describes the first genome-wide analysis of the E. breviscapus MADS-box gene family, and the results provide valuable information for understanding of the classification, cloning and putative functions of the MADS-box family."
https://openalex.org/W2997392025,"Vector borne diseases are a continuing global threat to both human and animal health. The ability of vectors such as mosquitos to cover large distances and cross country borders undetected provide an ever-present threat of pathogen spread. Many diseases can infect multiple vector species, such that even if the climate is not hospitable for an invasive species, indigenous species may be susceptible and capable of transmission such that one incursion event could lead to disease establishment in these species. Here we present a consensus modelling methodology to estimate the habitat suitability for presence of mosquito species in the UK deemed competent for Rift Valley fever virus (RVF) and demonstrate its application in an assessment of the relative risk of establishment of RVF virus in the UK livestock population. The consensus model utilises observed UK mosquito surveillance data, along with climatic and geographic prediction variables, to inform six independent species distribution models; the results of which are combined to produce a single prediction map. As a livestock host is needed to transmit RVF, we then combine the consensus model output with existing maps of sheep and cattle density to predict the areas of the UK where disease is most likely to establish in local mosquito populations. The model results suggest areas of high suitability for RVF competent mosquito species across the length and breadth of the UK. Notable areas of high suitability were the South West of England and coastal areas of Wales, the latter of which was subsequently predicted to be at higher risk for establishment of RVF due to higher livestock densities. This study demonstrates the applicability of outputs of species distribution models to help predict hot-spots for risk of disease establishment. While there is still uncertainty associated with the outputs we believe that the predictions are an improvement on just using the raw presence points from a database alone. The outputs can also be used as part of a multidisciplinary approach to inform risk based disease surveillance activities."
https://openalex.org/W2995160164,"Melatonin has potential neuroprotective capabilities after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), but long-term effects have not been investigated. We hypothesized that melatonin treatment directly after HI could protect against early and delayed brain injury. Unilateral HI brain injury was induced in postnatal day 7 rats. An intraperitoneal injection of either melatonin or vehicle was given at 0, 6 and 25 hours after hypoxia. In-vivo MRI was performed 1, 7, 20 and 43 days after HI, followed by histological analysis. Forelimb asymmetry and memory were assessed at 12–15 and at 36–43 days after HI. More melatonin treated than vehicle treated animals (54.5% vs 15.8%) developed a mild injury characterized by diffusion tensor values, brain volumes, histological scores and behavioral parameters closer to sham. However, on average, melatonin treatment resulted only in a tendency towards milder injury on T2-weighted MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient maps day 1 after HI, and not improved long-term outcome. These results indicate that the melatonin treatment regimen of 3 injections of 10 mg/kg within the first 25 hours only gave a transient and subtle neuroprotective effect, and may not have been sufficient to mitigate long-term brain injury development following HI."
https://openalex.org/W2997302526,"Tick-borne nairoviruses (order Bunyavirales) encode an ovarian tumor domain protease (OTU) that suppresses the innate immune response by reversing the post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). Ub is highly conserved across eukaryotes, whereas ISG15 is only present in vertebrates and shows substantial sequence diversity. Prior attempts to address the effect of ISG15 diversity on viral protein-ISG15 interactions have focused on only a single species' ISG15 or a limited selection of nairovirus OTUs. To gain a more complete perspective of OTU-ISG15 interactions, we biochemically assessed the relative activities of 14 diverse nairovirus OTUs for 12 species' ISG15 and found that ISG15 activity is predominantly restricted to particular nairovirus lineages reflecting, in general, known virus-host associations. To uncover the underlying molecular factors driving OTUs affinity for ISG15, X-ray crystal structures of Kupe virus and Ganjam virus OTUs bound to sheep ISG15 were solved and compared to complexes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Erve virus OTUs bound to human and mouse ISG15, respectively. Through mutational and structural analysis seven residues in ISG15 were identified that predominantly influence ISG15 species specificity among nairovirus OTUs. Additionally, OTU residues were identified that influence ISG15 preference, suggesting the potential for viral OTUs to adapt to different host ISG15s. These findings provide a foundation to further develop research methods to trace nairovirus-host relationships and delineate the full impact of ISG15 diversity on nairovirus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2997231122,"Body size reduction, also known as miniaturization, is an important evolutionary process that affects a number of physiological and phenotypic traits and helps animals conquer new ecological niches. However, this process is poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we report genomic and transcriptomic features of arguably the smallest known insect–the parasitoid wasp, Megaphragma amalphitanum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). In contrast to expectations, we find that the genome and transcriptome sizes of this parasitoid wasp are comparable to other members of the Chalcidoidea superfamily. Moreover, compared to other chalcid wasps the gene content of M. amalphitanum is remarkably conserved. Intriguingly, we observed significant changes in M. amalphitanum transposable element dynamics over time, in which an initial burst was followed by suppression of activity, possibly due to a recent reinforcement of the genome defense machinery. Overall, while the M. amalphitanum genomic data reveal certain features that may be linked to the unusual biological properties of this organism, miniaturization is not associated with a large decrease in genome complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2997339635,"Background Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a first-line treatment option for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Patients who fail or are intolerant to IM therapy are treated with more expensive second and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients show wide variation in trough concentrations in response to standard dosing. Thus, many patients receive subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic doses. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may improve dose management that, in turn, may reduce costs and improve outcomes. However, TDM also adds to the cost of patient care. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of TDM for generic IM therapy. Methods We developed a microsimulation model for the trough plasma concentration of IM which is related to a cytogenetic or molecular response. We compared two cohorts: one with TDM and one without TDM (NTDM). The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the effectiveness measure. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results The lifetime cost and QALY of treatment with TDM were $2,137K [95% Ci: 2,079K; 2,174K] and 12.37 [95% CI: 12.07; 12.55], respectively. The cost and QALY of NTDM were $2,132K [95% CI: 2,091K; 2,197K] and 12.23 [95% CI: 11.96; 12.50], respectively. The incremental cost and QALY for TDM relative to NTDM was $4,417 [95% CI: -52,582; 32,097]) and 0.15 [95% CI: -0.13; 0.28]. The ICER for TDM relative to NTDM was $30,450/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that TDM was cost-effective relative to NTDM in 90% of the tested scenarios at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Conclusions Although the impact of TDM is modest, the cost-effectiveness over a lifetime horizon (societal perspective, ($30,450/QALY) falls within the acceptable range (< $100k/QALY)."
https://openalex.org/W2996204112,"Nile crocodiles are apex predators widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa that have been viewed and managed as a single species. A complex picture of broad and fine-scale phylogeographic patterns that includes the recognition of two species (Crocodylus niloticus and Crocodylus suchus), and the structuring of populations according to river basins has started to emerge. However, previous studies surveyed a limited number of samples and geographical regions, and large areas of the continent remained unstudied. This work aimed at a fine scale portrait of Nile crocodile populations at the fringes of their geographic distribution in southern Africa. Wild and captive individuals were sampled across four major river systems (Okavango, Lower Kunene, Lower Shire and Limpopo) and the KwaZulu-Natal region. A multi-marker approach was used to infer phylogeographic and genetic diversity patterns, including new and public mitochondrial data, and a panel of 11 nuclear microsatellites. All individuals belonged to a phylogenetic clade previously associated with the C. niloticus species, thus suggesting the absence of C. suchus in southern Africa. The distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes indicated ancestral genetic connectivity across large areas, with loss of diversity along the north-south axis. Genetic variation partitioned the populations primarily into western and eastern regions of southern Africa, and secondarily into the major river systems. Populations were partitioned into five main groups corresponding to the Lower Kunene, the Okavango, the Lower Shire, and the Limpopo rivers, and the KwaZulu-Natal coastal region. All groups show evidence of recent bottlenecks and small effective population sizes. Long-term genetic diversity is likely to be compromised, raising conservation concern. These results emphasize the need for local genetic assessment of wild populations of Nile crocodiles to inform strategies for management of the species in southern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2996344130,"Hemiplegic paralysis after stroke may augment postural instability and decrease the balance control ability for standing. The center of mass acceleration (COMacc) is considered to be an effective indicator of postural stability for standing balance control. However, it is less studied how the COMacc could be affected by the muscle activities on lower-limbs in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. This study aimed to examine the effects of hemiplegic paralysis in post-stroke individuals on the amplitude and structural variabilities of COMacc and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals during quiet standing. Eleven post-stroke hemiplegic patients and the same number of gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers participated in the experiment. The sEMG signals of tibialis anterior (TA) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles of the both limbs, and the COMacc in the anterior-posterior direction with and without visual feedback (VF vs. NVF) were recorded simultaneously during quiet standing. The sEMG and COMacc were analyzed using root mean square (RMS) or standard deviation (SD), and a modified detrended fluctuation analysis based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD-DFA). Results showed that the SD and the scale exponent α of EMD-DFA of the COMacc from the patients were significantly higher than the values from the controls under both VF (p < 0.01) and NVF (p < 0.001) conditions. The RMSs of TA and LG on the non-paretic limbs were significantly higher than those on paretic limbs (p < 0.05) for both the patients and controls (p < 0.05). The TA of both the paretic and non-paretic limbs of the patients showed augmented α values than the TA of the controls (p < 0.05). The α of the TA and LG of non-paretic limbs, and the α of COMacc were significantly increased after removing visual feedback in patients (p < 0.05). These results suggested an increased amplitude variability but decreased structural variability of COMacc, associated with asymmetric muscle contraction between the paretic and the non-paretic limbs in hemiplegic paralysis, revealing a deficiency in integration of sensorimotor information and a loss of flexibility of postural control due to stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2994947088,"Tracking the activity of signalling pathways is a fundamental method for basic science, as well as in cancer- and pharmaceutical research. The developmental pathways Wnt, Hedgehog and Notch are frequently deregulated in cancers and represent a valuable target for the discovery of novel anticancer compounds. Here we present reporter systems for tracking activity of these pathways by using specific promoter elements driving the expression of either sensitive luciferases or fluorescent proteins. A high level of sensitivity was obtained using the luciferase reporter genes for firefly (FLuc), secreted Gaussia (GLuc) and synthetic NanoLuc (NLuc). As fluorescent reporter proteins, mTurqouise2, tdTomato and iRFP720 were chosen. Specificity of pathway activity was validated by co-transfection with pathway activating genes, showing significant response to induction. In addition, multi-gene plasmids were cloned, allowing the detection of all three pathways by one vector. By using the multi-gene vector 3P-Luc (wnt-NLuc, hedgehog-FLuc, Notch-GLuc), we could unambiguously demonstrate the crosstalk between pathways, while excluding cross reactivity of luciferase substrates. First studies with synthetic compounds confirmed the applicability of the system for future drug screening approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2995380582,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphological changes of the femur in the coronal plane in progressing varus gonarthrosis and to explore the interrelation of each component.From January to July 2017, radiographic images of 1538 knees of 883 consecutive patients were collected and analyzed. We drew the alignments and measured the orientation angles of the lower extremities and compared the results among age groups for each sex. Correlation and regression tests were used to analyze the measurements.There were significant differences in the neck-shaft angle (NSA), femoral bowing angle (FBA) and anatomic medial distal femoral angle (aMDFA) by age group in females, whereas the differences were not significant in males. In females, a positive correlation was found between age and the FBA and aMDFA (r = 0.253, 0.141, p<0.01), and a negative correlation was found between age and the NSA while the FBA was controlled (r = -0.065, p<0.05). The FBA was positively correlated with the NSA (r = 0.312, p<0.01) and aMDFA (r = 0.233, p<0.01). The NSA, FBA, and aMDFA together affected 72.2% of the mechanical medial distal femoral angle (mMDFA) (β = 0.071, -0.528, 0.803, p<0.01).As knee osteoarthritis (KOA) progressed, dynamic deformation of the femur was found in females, while no obvious changes were found in males. Femoral mechanical axis varus (mMDFA decrease) was the result of changes in the NSA, FBA and aMDFA. The deformation was throughout the femur rather than in a local area, as femur bowing can lead to corresponding changes in both ends of the femur. We provided a theoretical basis for TKA and knee-salvage treatment, and more attention should be paid to aging patients, especially females, in the preoperative protocol for orthomorphia."
https://openalex.org/W2995451452,"Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) infection might be pathogenically closely related to urticaria. This study is a nationwide population-based cohort study from 1997 to 2013, which investigated the association between MP infection and urticaria in Taiwan. A total of 1,175 patients were included for the study group, and 2,350 for the control group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for urticaria. Result showed that 254 patients with new-onset urticaria were involved in the study group and 465 incident cases in the control group. The incidence rates (per 100,000 person-months) of urticaria were 37.2 and 32.5 in the study and control groups, respectively. The relative risk is 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0–1.3) indicating no significant correlation between MP and urticaria. The multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of urticaria with MP infection (aHR = 1.1, P = 0.1058) had no statistically significance difference compared to the control group. However, the risk of urticaria in MP-infected patients aged between 20 and 59 years old was found to have increased (aHR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1–2.2) prior to a diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2995578737,"Background and purpose The roles of surgery, chemotherapy, and parameters of radiation therapy for treating very rare central nervous system germ cell tumors (CNS-GCT) are still under discussion. We aimed to evaluate the survival and recurrence patterns of patients with CNS-GCT treated with chemotherapy followed by whole ventricle irradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Materials and methods We reviewed the clinical outcomes of 20 consecutive patients with CNS-GCT treated with chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy from 2004 to 2014 in two partner institutions. Results Twenty children with a median age of 12 years were included (16 males). Sixteen tumors were pure germinomas, and 4 were non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT). All patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy guided by daily images, and 70% with volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy additionally. The median dose for the whole-ventricle was 25.2 Gy (range: 18–30.6 Gy) and 36 Gy (range: 30–54 Gy) for the tumor bed boost. The median post-radiation therapy follow-up was 57.5 months. There were 3 recurrences (2 NGGCT and 1 germinoma that recurred as a NGGCT), with 1 death from the disease and the other 2 cases each successfully rescued with chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation. The overall survival at 5 years was 95% and disease-free survival was 85%. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the combined use of chemotherapy followed by whole ventricle irradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy is effective for CNS-GCTs, especially pure germinomas. Even being rescued with craniospinal irradiation, the NGGCT cases have markedly worse prognoses and should be more rigorously selected for localized treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2996520172,"C- Mannosylation is a common modification of thrombospondin type 1 repeats present in metazoans and recently identified also in apicomplexan parasites. This glycosylation is mediated by enzymes of the DPY19 family that transfer α-mannoses to tryptophan residues in the sequence W X 2 W X 2 C, which is part of the structurally essential tryptophan ladder. Here, deletion of the dpy19 gene in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii abolished C -mannosyltransferase activity and reduced levels of the micronemal protein MIC2. The loss of C -mannosyltransferase activity was associated with weakened parasite adhesion to host cells and with reduced parasite motility, host cell invasion, and parasite egress. Interestingly, the C -mannosyltransferase–deficient Δ dpy19 parasites were strongly attenuated in virulence and induced protective immunity in mice. This parasite attenuation could not simply be explained by the decreased MIC2 level and strongly suggests that absence of C- mannosyltransferase activity leads to an insufficient level of additional proteins. In summary, our results indicate that T. gondii C -mannosyltransferase DPY19 is not essential for parasite survival, but is important for adhesion, motility, and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2998574829,"Pediatric patients undergoing invasive operations bear extra risk of developing nosocomial infections (NIs). However, epidemiological evidence of the underlying risk factors, which is needed for early prevention, remains limited.Using data from the electronic medical records and the NI reporting system of a tertiary pediatric hospital, we conducted a retrospective analysis to identify preoperative and operation-related risk factors for postoperative NIs. Multivariable accelerated failure time models were fitted to select independent risk factors. The performance of these factors in risk stratification was examined by comparing the empirical risks between the model-defined low- and high-risk groups.A total of 18,314 children undergoing invasive operations were included for analysis. After a follow-up period of 154,700 patient-days, 847 postoperative NIs were diagnosed. The highest postoperative NI rate was observed for operations on hemic and lymphatic system. Surgical site infections were the NI type showing the highest overall risk; however, patients were more likely to develop urinary tract infections in the first postoperative week. Older age, higher weight-for-height z-score, longer preoperative ICU stay, preoperative enteral nutrition, same-day antibiotic prophylaxis, and higher hemoglobin level were associated with delayed occurrence of postoperative NIs, while longer preoperative hospitalization, longer operative duration, and higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score showed acceleration effects. Risk stratification based on these factors in an independent patient population was moderate, resulting in a high-risk group in which 72% of the postoperative NIs were included.Our findings suggest that pediatric patients undergoing invasive operations and at high risk of developing postoperative NIs are likely to be identified using basic preoperative and operation-related risk factors, which together might lead to moderately accurate risk stratification but still provide valuable information to guide early and judicious prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2998428915,"Malaria is an infectious disease of major worldwide clinical importance that causes a variety of severe, or complicated, syndromes including cerebral malaria, which is often fatal. Leukocyte integrins are essential for host defense but also mediate physiologic responses of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We previously showed that targeted deletion of the αD subunit (αD-/-) of the αDβ2 integrin, which is expressed on key leukocyte subsets in mice and humans, leads to absent expression of the integrin heterodimer on murine macrophages and reduces mortality in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (P. berghei ANKA). To further identify mechanisms involved in the protective effect of αD deletion in this model of severe malaria we examined wild type C57BL/6 (WT) and αD-/- mice after P. berghei ANKA infection and found that vessel plugging and leukocyte infiltration were significantly decreased in the brains of αD-/- animals. Intravital microscopy demonstrated decreased rolling and adhesion of leukocytes in cerebral vessels of αD-/- mice. Flow cytometry analysis showed decreased T-lymphocyte accumulation in the brains of infected αD-/- animals. Evans blue dye exclusion assays demonstrated significantly less dye extravasation in the brains of αD-/- mice, indicating preserved blood-brain barrier integrity. WT mice that were salvaged from P. berghei ANKA infection by treatment with chloroquine had impaired aversive memory, which was not observed in αD-/- mice. We conclude that deletion of integrin αDβ2 alters the natural course of experimental severe malaria, demonstrating previously unrecognized activities of a key leukocyte integrin in immune-inflammatory responses that mediate cerebral involvement."
https://openalex.org/W2994908931,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been hypothesized to specify distinct dorsal neural fates. During neural development, BMPs are expressed in the roof plate and adjacent neuroepithelium. Because several hindbrain nuclei that form the proprioceptive/vestibular/auditory sensory network originate from the rhombic lip, near the roof plate, BMP signaling may regulate the development of these nuclei. To test this hypothesis genetically, we have examined the development of the hindbrain in BMP type I receptor knockout mice. Our results demonstrate that BMP signaling is involved in the formation of precerebellar mossy fiber nuclei, which give rise to cerebellar mossy fibers, but is not required for the development of the inferior olivary nucleus, which gives rise to cerebellar climbing fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2995243844,"Optical coherence tomography is commonly used to measure the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in both normal and diseased eyes; however, variation among normal eyes is common and may limit the usefulness of the results. The aim of this study was to explore the interocular asymmetries in retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in a group of normal eyes and to investigate the influence of blood vessel diameter on local retinal nerve fibre layer thickness.In this prospective study, retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and blood vessel diameter across 100 healthy participants were measured using two optical coherence tomography instruments. Individuals were categorised into two groups based on the presence or absence of interocular retinal nerve fibre layer thickness asymmetry beyond the 75th percentile of all participants.The superonasal sectoral retinal nerve fibre layer thickness was significantly greater in the left eye compared to the right, across all three sectors. Mean blood vessel diameter showed a corresponding difference in thickness at one of the superonasal sectors. Linear regression showed a positive and moderate correlation between blood vessel diameter and focal retinal nerve fibre layer thickness. This trend persisted across both arteries and veins, but veins showed larger variability between left and right eye in participants with marked superonasal retinal nerve fibre layer asymmetry.Retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and blood vessel diameter vary significantly between eyes even in healthy individuals. These asymmetries in a normal population should be taken into consideration when interpreting the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness measurements from optical coherence tomography to assist in distinguishing normal variations from disease."
https://openalex.org/W2997793938,"During a national reckoning against sexual violence, the public read or heard dozens of apologies offered by prominent public figures in response to allegations of sexual misconduct. This study examined people’s reactions to these apologies, with a focus on whether their implicit theories of personality—their beliefs about whether personality is changeable—influenced their evaluations of the apologies and the men who issued them. Using a nationally representative sample (N = 720) and real apologies offered during the #MeToo movement, it was found that, relative to people holding more of an entity (i.e., fixed) view of personality, those holding more of an incremental (i.e., malleable) view evaluated the apologies and apologizers more favorably, held more positive general attitudes toward this recent wave of apologies for misconduct, and were more likely to indicate that redemption was possible for the accused men. These findings suggest that people who hold more of an incremental theory of personality might interpret an apology as a meaningful signal that a person is ready and willing to change their ways and work toward self-improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2998070034,"Bakanae disease, caused by the fungal phytopathogen Fusarium fujikuroi, can be detected in most rice (Oryza sativa L.) growing areas worldwide. In this study, we investigated the population structure of this fungus in southern Lao PDR, a country located near the geographic origin of rice domestication. Microsatellites (SSRs) and mating type (MAT) analyses, pathogenicity and fungicide sensitivity tests were integrated in the study. The first key finding is that the population genetic structure of F. fujikuroi in Lao PDR is consistent with high clonal reproduction. Indeed, (i) ""true"" clones were identified; (ii) within populations, MAT types were frequently skewed from 1:1 ratio, (iii) linkage disequilibrium (among SSRs as also among SSRs and MAT) was present, and (iv) gene-flow between opposite MAT types within the same population is restricted. The presence of genetic divergence among areas and populations and the occurrence of positive spatial autocorrelation of genetic variation, indicate that migration is restricted, and that genetic drift plays an important role in the evolution of this fungus. Two main well-defined groups of isolates were detected (FST = 0.213) that display a non-random spatial distribution. They differ in the ability to induce seedlings death but not seedlings elongation (the typical Bakanae symptom) suggesting that the pathogen's ability to induce the two symptoms is under different genetic control. Finally, we compared two agroecosystems with contrasting characteristics: low-input and traditional (Lao PDR) vs high-input and modern (Italy). We found differences in the level of population structuring and of spatial autocorrelation. This suggests that the evolutionary potential of the fungus not only depends on its intrinsic characteristics, but is strongly influenced by other external factors, most likely by the dynamics of infested seed exchange. Thus, quarantine and chemical treatments are a way to reduce population connectivity and hence the evolutionary potential of this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2998524567,"The main aim of the present study was to examine several parameters of handwriting in order to identify the putative specific patterns of writing associated with psychopathic personality disorder. The hypothesis-generating study was carried out with the use of Mann-Whitney U test to compare two groups of prisoners, without p-value, effect size, and confidence intervals for effect size. The handwriting samples were obtained from two groups of individuals: prisoners diagnosed with psychopathic personality (n = 50), prisoners without psychopathic personality disorder (n = 30). Two groups were matched in terms of intellectual level, age, and education. The examined handwriting samples were identical. To examine graphical parameters such as structure, proportions, density, inter-spaces, and impulse, the computer programs GlobalGraf were used. This software is employed by Polish Forensic Association. The inter-group comparisons of graphical parameters have shown there is no significant difference (95% confidence intervals for the effect sizes included 0, or negative numbers) in handwriting between prisoners with psychopathic personality disorder and prisoners without this disorder. Logistic regression has been calculated to show whether any handwriting patterns allow to predict psychopathic personality disorder. Results indicate that participants with psychopathic personality disorder do not exhibit significant motor impairments manifesting in structural, density, topographic, proportions, letter spacing, and impulse features of handwriting. This suggests, contrary to many beliefs related to graphology, that psychopathic personality cannot be identified on the basis of computational forensic examination of handwriting."
https://openalex.org/W2994640868,"Here we describe a collaboration between industry, the National Health Service (NHS) and academia that sought to demonstrate how early understanding of both pharmacology and genomics can improve strategies for the development of precision medicines. Diseased tissue ethically acquired from patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was used to investigate inter-patient variability in drug efficacy using ex vivo organocultures of fresh lung tissue as the test system. The reduction in inflammatory cytokines in the presence of various test drugs was used as the measure of drug efficacy and the individual patient responses were then matched against genotype and microRNA profiles in an attempt to identify unique predictors of drug responsiveness. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in CYP2E1 and SMAD3 genes may partly explain the observed variation in drug response."
https://openalex.org/W2998612520,"Purpose The aim of this study was to analyze the utility of various preoperative electrophysiological tests of the facial nerve CNVII in predicting CNVII function after vestibular schwannoma surgery. Methods This retrospective study included 176 patients who had preoperative facial nerve electroneurography and electrically evoked blink reflex testing. We defined the following variables: axonal degeneration of CNVII (AD-CNVII), trigeminal nerve damage (D-CNV), disturbances in the short-latency pathway of the blink reflex (D-BR), and any changes in electrophysiological test results (A-EMG). Results AD-CNVII, D-CNV, D-BR, and A-EMG were noted in 24%, 10%, 64%, and 71% of the patients, respectively. Negative D-CNV correlated with good CNVII function in early (p = 0.005) and long-term follow-up (p = 0.003) but was not an independent prognostic factor for postoperative facial muscles function. D-CNV appeared to be closely related to tumor size. D-BR was related to tumor size and had no predictive value. AD-CNVII (amplitude reduction of 50% or more compared to the healthy side) was an independent factor associated with increased risk of facial muscles weakness (p = 0.015 and p = 0.031 for early and late outcomes, respectively). Conclusions Further studies are needed to establish which tests and cut-off values are the most useful for predicting post-surgical facial nerve function."
https://openalex.org/W2995515590,"Filamentous proteins are responsible for the superior mechanical strength of our cells and tissues. The remarkable mechanical properties of protein filaments are tied to their complex molecular packing structure. However, since these filaments have widths of several to tens of nanometers, it has remained challenging to quantitatively probe their molecular mass density and three-dimensional packing order. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful tool to perform simultaneous mass and morphology measurements on filamentous proteins at high resolution, but its applicability has been greatly limited by the lack of automated image processing methods. Here, we demonstrate a semi-automated tracking algorithm that is capable of analyzing the molecular packing density of intra- and extracellular protein filaments over a broad mass range from STEM images. We prove the wide applicability of the technique by analyzing the mass densities of two cytoskeletal proteins (actin and microtubules) and of the main protein in the extracellular matrix, collagen. The high-throughput and spatial resolution of our approach allow us to quantify the internal packing of these filaments and their polymorphism by correlating mass and morphology information. Moreover, we are able to identify periodic mass variations in collagen fibrils that reveal details of their axially ordered longitudinal self-assembly. STEM-based mass mapping coupled with our tracking algorithm is therefore a powerful technique in the characterization of a wide range of biological and synthetic filaments."
