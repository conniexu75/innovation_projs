https://openalex.org/W3136053247,"The ocean contains unique biodiversity, provides valuable food resources and is a major sink for anthropogenic carbon. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an effective tool for restoring ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services1,2, but at present only 2.7% of the ocean is highly protected3. This low level of ocean protection is due largely to conflicts with fisheries and other extractive uses. To address this issue, here we developed a conservation planning framework to prioritize highly protected MPAs in places that would result in multiple benefits today and in the future. We find that a substantial increase in ocean protection could have triple benefits, by protecting biodiversity, boosting the yield of fisheries and securing marine carbon stocks that are at risk from human activities. Our results show that most coastal nations contain priority areas that can contribute substantially to achieving these three objectives of biodiversity protection, food provision and carbon storage. A globally coordinated effort could be nearly twice as efficient as uncoordinated, national-level conservation planning. Our flexible prioritization framework could help to inform both national marine spatial plans4 and global targets for marine conservation, food security and climate action. Using a globally coordinated strategic conservation framework to plan an increase in ocean protection through marine protected areas can yield benefits for biodiversity, food provisioning and carbon storage."
https://openalex.org/W3124726575,"In recent years, there has been a great deal of concern about the proliferation of false and misleading news on social media1-4. Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5-7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy-and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online."
https://openalex.org/W3139367533,"Clonal haematopoiesis, which is highly prevalent in older individuals, arises from somatic mutations that endow a proliferative advantage to haematopoietic cells. Clonal haematopoiesis increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke independently of traditional risk factors1. Among the common genetic variants that give rise to clonal haematopoiesis, the JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) mutation, which increases JAK-STAT signalling, occurs at a younger age and imparts the strongest risk of premature coronary heart disease1,2. Here we show increased proliferation of macrophages and prominent formation of necrotic cores in atherosclerotic lesions in mice that express Jak2VF selectively in macrophages, and in chimeric mice that model clonal haematopoiesis. Deletion of the essential inflammasome components caspase 1 and 11, or of the pyroptosis executioner gasdermin D, reversed these adverse changes. Jak2VF lesions showed increased expression of AIM2, oxidative DNA damage and DNA replication stress, and Aim2 deficiency reduced atherosclerosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of Jak2VF lesions revealed a landscape that was enriched for inflammatory myeloid cells, which were suppressed by deletion of Gsdmd. Inhibition of the inflammasome product interleukin-1β reduced macrophage proliferation and necrotic formation while increasing the thickness of fibrous caps, indicating that it stabilized plaques. Our findings suggest that increased proliferation and glycolytic metabolism in Jak2VF macrophages lead to DNA replication stress and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome, thereby aggravating atherosclerosis. Precise application of therapies that target interleukin-1β or specific inflammasomes according to clonal haematopoiesis status could substantially reduce cardiovascular risk."

https://openalex.org/W3137683977,"A variety of species of bacteria are known to colonize human tumours1–11, proliferate within them and modulate immune function, which ultimately affects the survival of patients with cancer and their responses to treatment12–14. However, it is not known whether antigens derived from intracellular bacteria are presented by the human leukocyte antigen class I and II (HLA-I and HLA-II, respectively) molecules of tumour cells, or whether such antigens elicit a tumour-infiltrating T cell immune response. Here we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and HLA peptidomics to identify a peptide repertoire derived from intracellular bacteria that was presented on HLA-I and HLA-II molecules in melanoma tumours. Our analysis of 17 melanoma metastases (derived from 9 patients) revealed 248 and 35 unique HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, respectively, that were derived from 41 species of bacteria. We identified recurrent bacterial peptides in tumours from different patients, as well as in different tumours from the same patient. Our study reveals that peptides derived from intracellular bacteria can be presented by tumour cells and elicit immune reactivity, and thus provides insight into a mechanism by which bacteria influence activation of the immune system and responses to therapy. HLA peptidomic analysis identifies recurrent intracellular bacteria-derived peptides presented on HLA-I and HLA-II molecules in melanoma tumours, revealing how bacteria can modulate immune functions and responses to cancer therapies."

https://openalex.org/W3138350170,"Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin-domain containing protein 1 (NLRP1) is an inflammasome sensor that mediates the activation of caspase-1 to induce cytokine maturation and pyroptosis1–4. Gain-of-function mutations of NLRP1 cause severe inflammatory diseases of the skin4–6. NLRP1 contains a function-to-find domain that auto-proteolyses into noncovalently associated subdomains7–9, and proteasomal degradation of the repressive N-terminal fragment of NLRP1 releases its inflammatory C-terminal fragment (NLRP1 CT)10,11. Cytosolic dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (hereafter, DPP8/DPP9) both interact with NLRP1, and small-molecule inhibitors of DPP8/DPP9 activate NLRP1 by mechanisms that are currently unclear10,12–14. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human NLRP1–DPP9 complex alone and with Val-boroPro (VbP), an inhibitor of DPP8/DPP9. The structures reveal a ternary complex that comprises DPP9, full-length NLRP1 and the NLRPT CT. The binding of the NLRP1 CT to DPP9 requires full-length NLRP1, which suggests that NLRP1 activation is regulated by the ratio of NLRP1 CT to full-length NLRP1. Activation of the inflammasome by ectopic expression of the NLRP1 CT is consistently rescued by co-expression of autoproteolysis-deficient full-length NLRP1. The N terminus of the NLRP1 CT inserts into the DPP9 active site, and VbP disrupts this interaction. Thus, VbP weakens the NLRP1–DPP9 interaction and accelerates degradation of the N-terminal fragment10 to induce inflammasome activation. Overall, these data demonstrate that DPP9 quenches low levels of NLRP1 CT and thus serves as a checkpoint for activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome. Structures of NLRP1–DPP9 alone and with a small-molecule inhibitor of DPP9 reveal the mechanisms through which NLRP1 is regulated, providing insights into the role of this complex in inflammasome regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3138939380,"The future of the global ocean economy is currently envisioned as advancing towards a ‘blue economy’—socially equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically viable ocean industries1,2. However, tensions exist within sustainable development approaches, arising from differing perspectives framed around natural capital or social equity. Here we show that there are stark differences in outlook on the capacity for establishing a blue economy, and on its potential outcomes, when social conditions and governance capacity—not just resource availability—are considered, and we highlight limits to establishing multiple overlapping industries. This is reflected by an analysis using a fuzzy logic model to integrate indicators from multiple disciplines and to evaluate their current capacity to contribute to establishing equitable, sustainable and viable ocean sectors consistent with a blue economy approach. We find that the key differences in the capacity of regions to achieve a blue economy are not due to available natural resources, but include factors such as national stability, corruption and infrastructure, which can be improved through targeted investments and cross-scale cooperation. Knowledge gaps can be addressed by integrating historical natural and social science information on the drivers and outcomes of resource use and management, thus identifying equitable pathways to establishing or transforming ocean sectors1,3,4. Our results suggest that policymakers must engage researchers and stakeholders to promote evidence-based, collaborative planning that ensures that sectors are chosen carefully, that local benefits are prioritized, and that the blue economy delivers on its social, environmental and economic goals. The capacity to create an equitable and sustainable ‘blue economy’ from ocean resources will be determined by addressing social conditions, governance and infrastructure, not just resource availability, as shown by a fuzzy logic model incorporating multidisciplinary criteria."
https://openalex.org/W3136534722,"Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) mediate innate immunity by forming inflammasomes. Activation of the NLR protein NLRP1 requires autocleavage within its function-to-find domain (FIIND)1-7. In resting cells, the dipeptidyl peptidases DPP8 and DPP9 interact with the FIIND of NLRP1 and suppress spontaneous NLRP1 activation8,9; however, the mechanisms through which this occurs remain unknown. Here we present structural and biochemical evidence that full-length rat NLRP1 (rNLRP1) and rat DPP9 (rDPP9) form a 2:1 complex that contains an autoinhibited rNLRP1 molecule and an active UPA-CARD fragment of rNLRP1. The ZU5 domain is required not only for autoinhibition of rNLRP1 but also for assembly of the 2:1 complex. Formation of the complex prevents UPA-mediated higher-order oligomerization of UPA-CARD fragments and strengthens ZU5-mediated NLRP1 autoinhibition. Structure-guided biochemical and functional assays show that both NLRP1 binding and enzymatic activity are required for DPP9 to suppress NLRP1 in human cells. Together, our data reveal the mechanism of DPP9-mediated inhibition of NLRP1 and shed light on the activation of the NLRP1 inflammasome."
https://openalex.org/W3136483169,"In metazoans, specific tasks are relegated to dedicated organs that are established early in development, occupy discrete locations and typically remain fixed in size. The adult immune system arises from a centralized haematopoietic niche that maintains self-renewing potential1,2, and-upon maturation-becomes distributed throughout the body to monitor environmental perturbations, regulate tissue homeostasis and mediate organism-wide defence. Here we examine how immunity is integrated within adult mouse tissues, and address issues of durability, expansibility and contributions to organ cellularity. Focusing on antiviral T cell immunity, we observed durable maintenance of resident memory T cells up to 450 days after infection. Once established, resident T cells did not require the T cell receptor for survival or retention of a poised, effector-like state. Although resident memory indefinitely dominated most mucosal organs, surgical separation of parabiotic mice revealed a tissue-resident provenance for blood-borne effector memory T cells, and circulating memory slowly made substantial contributions to tissue immunity in some organs. After serial immunizations or cohousing with pet-shop mice, we found that in most tissues, tissue pliancy (the capacity of tissues to vary their proportion of immune cells) enables the accretion of tissue-resident memory, without axiomatic erosion of pre-existing antiviral T cell immunity. Extending these findings, we demonstrate that tissue residence and organ pliancy are generalizable aspects that underlie homeostasis of innate and adaptive immunity. The immune system grows commensurate with microbial experience, reaching up to 25% of visceral organ cellularity. Regardless of the location, many populations of white blood cells adopted a tissue-residency program within nonlymphoid organs. Thus, residence-rather than renewal or recirculation-typifies nonlymphoid immune surveillance, and organs serve as pliant storage reservoirs that can accommodate continuous expansion of the cellular immune system throughout life. Although haematopoiesis restores some elements of the immune system, nonlymphoid organs sustain an accrual of durable tissue-autonomous cellular immunity that results in progressive decentralization of organismal immune homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W3137123949,"The accurate segregation of chromosomes during meiosis-which is critical for genome stability across sexual cycles-relies on homologous recombination initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) made by the Spo11 protein1,2. The formation of DSBs is regulated and tied to the elaboration of large-scale chromosome structures3-5, but the protein assemblies that execute and control DNA breakage are poorly understood. Here we address this through the molecular characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RMM (Rec114, Mei4 and Mer2) proteins-essential, conserved components of the DSB machinery2. Each subcomplex of Rec114-Mei4 (a 2:1 heterotrimer) or Mer2 (a coiled-coil-containing homotetramer) is monodispersed in solution, but they independently condense with DNA into reversible nucleoprotein clusters that share properties with phase-separated systems. Multivalent interactions drive this condensation. Mutations that weaken protein-DNA interactions strongly disrupt both condensate formation and DSBs in vivo, and thus these processes are highly correlated. In vitro, condensates fuse into mixed RMM clusters that further recruit Spo11 complexes. Our data show how the DSB machinery self-assembles on chromosome axes to create centres of DSB activity. We propose that multilayered control of Spo11 arises from the recruitment of regulatory components and modulation of the biophysical properties of the condensates."
https://openalex.org/W3136383753,"Among primates, humans display a unique trajectory of development that is responsible for the many traits specific to our species. However, the inaccessibility of primary human and chimpanzee tissues has limited our ability to study human evolution. Comparative in vitro approaches using primate-derived induced pluripotent stem cells have begun to reveal species differences on the cellular and molecular levels1,2. In particular, brain organoids have emerged as a promising platform to study primate neural development in vitro3-5, although cross-species comparisons of organoids are complicated by differences in developmental timing and variability of differentiation6,7. Here we develop a new platform to address these limitations by fusing human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells to generate a panel of tetraploid hybrid stem cells. We applied this approach to study species divergence in cerebral cortical development by differentiating these cells into neural organoids. We found that hybrid organoids provide a controlled system for disentangling cis- and trans-acting gene-expression divergence across cell types and developmental stages, revealing a signature of selection on astrocyte-related genes. In addition, we identified an upregulation of the human somatostatin receptor 2 gene (SSTR2), which regulates neuronal calcium signalling and is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders8,9. We reveal a human-specific response to modulation of SSTR2 function in cortical neurons, underscoring the potential of this platform for elucidating the molecular basis of human evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3138289994,"Most rivers exchange water with surrounding aquifers1,2. Where groundwater levels lie below nearby streams, streamwater can infiltrate through the streambed, reducing streamflow and recharging the aquifer3. These 'losing' streams have important implications for water availability, riparian ecosystems and environmental flows4-10, but the prevalence of losing streams remains poorly constrained by continent-wide in situ observations. Here we analyse water levels in 4.2 million wells across the contiguous USA and show that nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of them lie below nearby stream surfaces, implying that these streamwaters will seep into the subsurface if it is sufficiently permeable. A lack of adequate permeability data prevents us from quantifying the magnitudes of these subsurface flows, but our analysis nonetheless demonstrates widespread potential for streamwater losses into underlying aquifers. These potentially losing rivers are more common in drier climates, flatter landscapes and regions with extensive groundwater pumping. Our results thus imply that climatic factors, geological conditions and historic groundwater pumping jointly contribute to the widespread risk of streams losing flow into surrounding aquifers instead of gaining flow from them. Recent modelling studies10 have suggested that losing streams could become common in future decades, but our direct observations show that many rivers across the USA are already potentially losing flow, highlighting the importance of coordinating groundwater and surface water policy."
https://openalex.org/W3137940060,"Gene regulatory divergence is thought to play a central role in determining human-specific traits. However, our ability to link divergent regulation to divergent phenotypes is limited. Here, we utilized human-chimpanzee hybrid induced pluripotent stem cells to study gene expression separating these species. The tetraploid hybrid cells allowed us to separate cis- from trans-regulatory effects, and to control for nongenetic confounding factors. We differentiated these cells into cranial neural crest cells, the primary cell type giving rise to the face. We discovered evidence of lineage-specific selection on the hedgehog signaling pathway, including a human-specific sixfold down-regulation of EVC2 (LIMBIN), a key hedgehog gene. Inducing a similar down-regulation of EVC2 substantially reduced hedgehog signaling output. Mice and humans lacking functional EVC2 show striking phenotypic parallels to human-chimpanzee craniofacial differences, suggesting that the regulatory divergence of hedgehog signaling may have contributed to the unique craniofacial morphology of humans."
https://openalex.org/W3137569107,"Nutrient losses from sloping farmland in karst areas lead to the decline in land productivity and nonpoint source pollution. A specially tailored steel channel with an adjustable slope and underground hole fissures was used to simulate the microenvironment of the ""dual structure"" of the surface and underground of sloping farmland in a karst area. The artificial rainfall simulation method was used to explore the surface and underground runoff characteristics and nutrient losses from sloping farmland under different rainfall intensities. The effect of rainfall intensity on the nutrient loss of farmland on karst sloping land was clarified. The results showed that the surface was the main route of runoff and nutrient loss during the rainy season on sloping farmland in karst areas. The influence of rainfall intensity on the nutrients in surface runoff was more substantial than that on underground runoff nutrients. Nutrient loss was more likely to occur underground than on the surface. The losses of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium in surface and underground runoff initially increased and then gradually stabilized with the extension of rainfall duration and increased with increasing rainfall intensity and the amount of nutrient runoff. The output of nutrients through surface runoff accounted for a high proportion of the total, and underground runoff was responsible for a low proportion. Although the amount of nutrients output by underground runoff was small, it could directly cause groundwater pollution. The research results provide a theoretical reference for controlling land source pollution from sloping farming in karst areas."
https://openalex.org/W3138514125,"Oceanic transform faults are seismically and tectonically active plate boundaries1 that leave scars-known as fracture zones-on oceanic plates that can cross entire ocean basins2. Current descriptions of plate tectonics assume transform faults to be conservative two-dimensional strike-slip boundaries1,3, at which lithosphere is neither created nor destroyed and along which the lithosphere cools and deepens as a function of the age of the plate4. However, a recent compilation of high-resolution multibeam bathymetric data from 41 oceanic transform faults and their associated fracture zones that covers all possible spreading rates shows that this assumption is incorrect. Here we show that the seafloor along transform faults is systemically deeper (by up to 1.6 kilometres) than their associated fracture zones, in contrast to expectations based on plate-cooling arguments. Accretion at intersections between oceanic ridges and transform faults seems to be strongly asymmetric: the outside corners of the intersections show shallower relief and more extensive magmatism, whereas the inside corners have deep nodal basins and seem to be magmatically starved. Three-dimensional viscoplastic numerical models show that plastic-shear failure within the deformation zone around the transform fault results in the plate boundary experiencing increasingly oblique shear at increasing depths below the seafloor. This results in extension around the inside corner, which thins the crust and lithosphere at the transform fault and is linked to deepening of the seafloor along the transform fault. Bathymetric data suggest that the thinned transform-fault crust is augmented by a second stage of magmatism as the transform fault intersects the opposing ridge axis. This makes accretion at transform-fault systems a two-stage process, fundamentally different from accretion elsewhere along mid-ocean ridges."
https://openalex.org/W3137481750,"Objective To describe clinical characteristics, disease course and outcomes in a large and well-documented cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. Methods We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study in The Netherlands including 952 of 1183 consecutively hospitalized patients that were admitted to participating hospitals between March 2nd, 2020, and May 22nd, 2020. Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters upon admission and during hospitalization were collected until July 1 st . Results The median age was 69 years (IQR 58–77 years) and 605 (63.6%) were male. Cardiovascular disease was present in 558 (58.6%) patients. The median time of onset of symptoms prior to hospitalization was 7 days (IQR 5–10). A non ICU admission policy was applicable in 312 (32.8%) patients and in 165 (56.3%) of the severely ill patients admitted to the ward. At admission and during hospitalization, severely ill patients had higher values of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer with higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts. Overall in-hospital mortality was 25.1% and 183 (19.1%) patients were admitted to ICU, of whom 56 (30.6%) died. Patients aged ≥70 years had high mortality, both at the ward (52.4%) and ICU (47.4%). The median length of ICU stay was 8 days longer in patients aged ≥70 years compared to patients aged ≤60 years. Conclusion Hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged ≥70 years had high mortality and longer ICU stay compared to patients aged ≤60 years. These findings in combination with the patient burden of an ICU admission and possible long term complications after discharge should encourage us to further investigate the benefit of ICU admission in elderly and fragile COVID-19-patients."
https://openalex.org/W3137524055,"While numerous studies implicate the microbiome in host fitness, contributions of host evolution to microbial recruitment remain largely uncharacterized. Past work has shown that plant polyploidy and domestication can influence plant biotic and abiotic interactions, yet impacts on broader microbiome assembly are still unknown for many crop species. In this study, we utilized three approaches—two field studies and one greenhouse-based experiment—to determine the degree to which patterns in bacterial community assembly in wheat ( Triticum sp.) roots and rhizospheres are attributable to the host factors of ploidy level (2n, 4n, 6n) and domestication status (cultivated vs. wild). Profiling belowground bacterial communities with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analyzed patterns in diversity and composition. From our initial analyses of a subsetted dataset, we observed that host ploidy level was statistically significant in explaining variation in alpha and beta diversity for rhizosphere microbiomes, as well as correlated with distinct phylum-level shifts in composition, in the field. Using a reduced complexity field soil inoculum and controlled greenhouse conditions, we found some evidence suggesting that genomic lineage and ploidy level influence root alpha and beta diversity (p-value&lt;0.05). However, in a follow-up field experiment using an expanded set of Triticum genomes that included both wild and domesticated varieties, we did not find a strong signal for either diploid genome lineages, domestication status, or ploidy level in shaping rhizosphere bacterial communities. Taken together, these results suggest that while host ploidy and domestication may have some minor influence on microbial assembly, these impacts are subtle and difficult to assess in belowground compartments for wheat varieties. By improving our understanding of the degree to which host ploidy and cultivation factors shape the plant microbiome, this research informs perspectives on what key driving forces may underlie microbiome structuring, as well as where future efforts may be best directed towards fortifying plant growth by microbial means. The greatest influence of the host on the wheat microbiome appeared to occur in the rhizosphere compartment, and we suggest that future work focuses on this environment to further characterize how host genomic and phenotypic changes influence plant-microbe communications."
https://openalex.org/W3138862750,"High expression of glucose transporter family members, which augment glucose uptake and glycolytic flux, has been shown to play a pivotal role in the proliferation and survival of tumor cells, contributing to the energy supply, biosynthesis and homeostasis of cancer cells. Among the many members, solute carrier family 2 member 1 (SLC2A1) encodes a glucose transporter, GLUT1, that is critical in the metabolism of glucose, which is an energy source for cell growth that contributes to cancer progression and development. The aim of this study was to analyze the survival and genetic changes/immune profiles in patients with gastric cancer with high SLC2A1 expression and to provide treatment for improving prognosis. This study investigated the clinicopathologic parameters, the proportion of immune cells and gene sets affecting SLC2A1 expression in 279 and 415 patients with gastric cancer from the Eulji Hospital cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas, respectively. We assessed the response to conventional chemotherapy drugs, including fluorouracil, a compound of fluoropyrimidine S-1, oxaliplatin, and all−trans−retinoic acid (ATRA), in gastric cancer cell lines with high SLC2A1 expression. High SLC2A1 expression was associated with poor prognosis, cancer cell proliferation, decreased immune cells, including CD8 T cells and B cells, and a low prognostic nutrition index, representing body nutrition-related status. In pathway network analysis, SLC2A1 was indirectly linked to the retinoic signaling pathway and negatively regulated immune cells/receptors. In the drug response analysis, the drug ATRA inhibited gastric cancer cell lines with high SLC2A1 expression. Treatment involving the use of SLC2A1 could contribute to better clinical management/research for patients with gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3138133663,"Inflammation is a critical component of many lung diseases including asthma and acute lung injury (ALI). Using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we quantified the levels of oxysterols in two different murine models of lung diseases. These are lipid mediators derived from cholesterol and known to modulate immunity and inflammation. Interestingly, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) was the only oxysterol with altered levels during lung inflammation, and its levels were differently affected according to the model. Therefore, we sought to assess how this oxysterol would affect lung inflammatory responses. In a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung inflammation, 25-OHC levels were increased, and most of the hallmarks of the model (eg, leukocyte recruitment, mRNA expression, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines) were decreased following its intratracheal administration. We also found that, when administered in the lung, 25-OHC is metabolized locally into 25-hydroxycholesterol-3-sulfate and 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol. Their administration in the lungs did not recapitulate all the effects of 25-OHC. Conversely, in a model of allergic asthma induced by intranasal administration of house dust mites (HDM), 25-OHC levels were decreased, and when intranasally administered, this oxysterol worsened the hallmarks of the model (eg, leukocyte recruitment, tissue remodeling [epithelium thickening and peribranchial fibrosis], and cytokine expression) and induced changes in leukotriene levels. Ex vivo, we found that 25-OHC decreases LPS-induced primary alveolar macrophage activation while having no effect on neutrophil activation. Its sulfated metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol-3-sulfate, decreased neutrophil, but not macrophage activation. Taken together, our data support a differential role of 25-OHC in ALI and allergic inflammation models."

https://openalex.org/W3138959032,"Although in vitro fertilization (IVF) is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, there is increasing concern about the long-term and sex-specific health implications. Augmenting our IVF mouse model to longitudinally investigate metabolic outcomes in offspring from optimal neonatal litter sizes, we found sex-specific metabolic outcomes in IVF offspring. IVF-conceived females had higher body weight and cholesterol levels compared to naturally conceived females, whereas IVF-conceived males had higher levels of triglycerides and insulin, and increased body fat composition. Through adult liver transcriptomics and proteomics, we identified sexually dimorphic dysregulation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathways that are associated with the sex-specific phenotypes. We also found that global loss of DNA methylation in placenta was linked to higher cholesterol levels in IVF-conceived females. Our findings indicate that IVF procedures have long-lasting sex-specific effects on metabolic health of offspring and lay the foundation to utilize the placenta as a predictor of long-term outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3136713544,"Factors for overall survival after pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) seem to be nodal status, chemotherapy administration, UICC staging, and resection margin. However, there is no consensus on the definition for tumor free resection margin. Therefore, univariate OS as well as multivariate long-term survival using cancer center data was analyzed with regards to two different resection margin definitions. Ninety-five patients met inclusion criteria (pancreatic head PDAC, R0/R1, no 30 days mortality). OS was analyzed in univariate analysis with respect to R-status, CRM (circumferential resection margin; positive: ≤1mm; negative: &gt;1mm), nodal status, and chemotherapy administration. Long-term survival &gt;36 months was modelled using multivariate logistic regression instead of Cox regression because the distribution function of the dependent data violated the requirements for the application of this test. Significant differences in OS were found regarding the R status (Median OS and 95%CI for R0: 29.8 months, 22.3–37.4; R1: 15.9 months, 9.2–22.7; p = 0.005), nodal status (pN0 = 34.7, 10.4–59.0; pN1 = 17.1, 11.5–22.8; p = 0.003), and chemotherapy (with CTx: 26.7, 20.4–33.0; without CTx: 9.7, 5.2–14.1; p &lt; .001). OS according to CRM status differed on a clinically relevant level by about 12 months (CRM positive: 17.2 months, 11.5–23.0; CRM negative: 29.8 months, 18.6–41.1; p = 0.126). A multivariate model containing chemotherapy, nodal status, and CRM explained long-term survival (p = 0.008; correct prediction &gt;70%). Chemotherapy, nodal status and resection margin according to UICC R status are univariate factors for OS after PDAC. In contrast, long-term survival seems to depend on wider resection margins than those used in UICC R classification. Therefore, standardized histopathological reporting (including resection margin size) should be agreed upon."
https://openalex.org/W3137832201,"Background Globally violence is a matter of public health concern with severe physical and mental health implications and social consequences. Evidence suggest that adolescents have an elevated risk of exposure to physical and sexual violence. However, there is a lack of nationally representative research on violence and its associated factors in Nepal to inform interventions. This paper attempts to find the factors associated with various forms of physical and sexual violence among school-going adolescents in Nepal. Methods We analysed the cross-sectional data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) 2015. The GSHS survey applied a two-stage cluster sampling process to select a representative sample of 7 to 11 grade students from 74 schools across the country. We applied logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with physical and sexual violence. Results Out of the total 6,529 participants, 45.24% of them faced a physical attack, 39.25% were involved in a physical fight, and 11.65% were victims of sexual violence in the survey administered between 7 August 2015 to 14 March 2016. In a multiple regression analysis, the age of participants, parental supervision, feeling unsafe at school, and the number of close friends were found to be associated with a physical attack. Participants who were bullied, had multiple sex partners, and had received corporal punishment in school had a higher engagement in a physical fight. Likewise, school grade, having parents who understand the problems, having multiple sex partners, and corporal punishment at school were associated with instances of sexual violence. Conclusion The study identified multiple factors associated with experiences of physical attacks, involvement in a physical fight, and sexual violence among school-going adolescents. This study results can have important implications for school administration, parents, and policymakers alike to plan appropriate anti-violence strategies and interventions. Since various forms of violence share some common risk factors, a comprehensive strategy could be worth considering to prevent such acts of violence."

The objective of the present study is to demonstrate a novel image acquisition technique and analysis method using linearly polarized light. The proposed imaging technique is based on image acquisition at multiple slide rotation angles, which are co-registered to form a composite image used for quantitative analysis by pixel intensity or pixel counting. The technique was demonstrated on multiple human coronary samples with varying histopathologies and developed specifically to analyze cap collagen in atherosclerotic plaque. Pixel counting image analysis was found to be reproducible across serial tissue sections and across different users and sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in cap structural integrity that are likely relevant to prediction of rupture risk. The benefit of slide rotation angle under linear polarization to acquire images represents a feasible and practical implementation for expanding the general utility of PSR for quantitative analysis."

Regression analysis is performed to examine the impact of corporate information disclosure environment proxied by the Internet penetration rate on innovation. Leveraging from the city-level Internet penetration rates data in China from 2003 to 2017, this study gets the following findings: (1) Firms headquartered in cities with high Internet penetration rates tend to be more innovative, i.e. they invest more in research and development. (2) This result is supported by several robustness checks, such as alternative measures of key variables, alternative empirical specifications, and tests to mitigate identification concerns. (3) ""financing constraint"" and ""tolerance of innovation failure"" are two channels that influence firms’ innovative endeavors. (4) Additional tests show that Internet penetration rates facilitate a firm’s output efficiency of innovation input, total factor productivity, and human capital environment for innovation. The above conclusions not only enrich the relevant literature on the influencing factors of corporate innovation from the perspective of the firm information disclosure environment but also provide an important reference for further understanding the positive role of macro technology development on social and economic development."
https://openalex.org/W3138176438,"Objective To report the clinical profile associated with G60 and I60 over a 4-year prospective observational period in 2 large cohorts of adult patients with CF. Methods 319 patients were included (210 Canadian and 119 French) and classified according to their inclusion G60 (≥ or &lt; 11.1 mmol/L) and the median inclusion I60 (≥ or &lt; 24 mU/I). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), body mass index (BMI) were collected on OGTT days. Linear mixed regression models were used to assess the effect of G60 and I60. Results High G60 was not associated to a lower FEV1 at inclusion and the follow-up decline was not higher in the high G60 group (Coefficient [95% CI]: -3.4 [-7.4;0.6], p = 0.0995.). There was no significant association between BMI and G60. Patients with high I60 tended to have a higher mean BMI (+0.5 kg/m 2 [0.0 to 1.1], p = 0.05) but no interaction over time was observed. Conclusions High G60 is not associated with a lower lung function at inclusion nor its decline over a 4-year follow-up. High I60 is slightly associated to a higher weight at inclusion, but not with BMI evolution over time in adult patients."
https://openalex.org/W3136053854,"Detailed knowledge on genetic parameters such as diversity, structure, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and identification of duplicates in a germplasm bank and/or breeding collection are essential to conservation and breeding strategies in any crop. Therefore, the potato genetic breeding collection at the Universidad de Nariño in Colombia, which is made up of diploid and tetraploid genotypes in two of the more diverse genebanks in the world, was analyzed with 8303 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from SolCAP version 1. In total, 144 genotypes from this collection were analyzed identifying an 57.2% of the polymorphic markers that allowed establishing two and three subpopulations that differentiated the diploid genotypes from the tetraploids. These subpopulations had high levels of heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium. The diversity levels were higher in the tetraploid genotypes, while the LD levels were higher in the diploid genotypes. For the tetraploids, the genotypes from Peru had greater diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium than those from Colombia, which had slightly lower diversity and higher degrees of LD. The genetic analysis identified, adjusted and/or selected diploid and tetraploid genotypes under the following characteristics: 1) errors in classification associated with the level of ploidy; 2) presence of duplicates; and 3) genotypes with broad genetic distances and potential use in controlled hybridization processes. These analyses suggested that the potato genetic breeding collection at the Universidad de Nariño has a genetic base with a potential use in breeding programs for this crop in the Department of Nariño, in southern Colombia."
https://openalex.org/W3136763055,"This study uses mobility statistics combined with business census data for the eight Japanese prefectures with the highest coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection rates to study the effect of mobility reductions on the effective reproduction number (i.e., the average number of secondary cases caused by one infected person). Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data; they can be effectively used for understanding pandemics if integrated with epidemiological findings and other economic data sets. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were slightly more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20%–35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6%–30% reduction in weekly mobility. These are the results if other potential causes of spread are ignored; for a fuller picture, more careful observations, expanded data sets, and advanced statistical modeling are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3137787410,"Entrustable professional activities (EPAs), as a focus of learner assessment, are supported by validity evidence. An EPA is a unit of professional practice requiring proficiency in multiple competencies simultaneously, that can be entrusted to a sufficiently competent learner. Taken collectively, a set of EPAs define and inform the curriculum of a specialty training. The goal of this study was to develop a set of EPAs for Dutch PICU fellows. A multistage methodology was employed incorporating sequential input from task force members, a medical education expert, PICU fellowship program directors, and PICU physicians and fellows via a modified three-round Delphi study. In the first modified Delphi round, experts rated indispensability and clarity of preliminary EPAs. In the subsequent rounds, aggregated scores for each EPA and group comments were provided. In round two, respondents rated indispensability and clarity of revised EPAs. Round three was used to gain explicit confirmation of suitability to implement these EPAs. Based on median ratings and content validity index (CVI) analysis for indispensability in the first two rounds, all nine preliminary EPAs covered activities that were deemed essential to the clinical practice of PICU physicians. Based on median ratings and CVI analysis for clarity however, four EPAs needed revision. With an agreement percentage of 93–100% for all individual EPAs as well as the set as a whole, a high degree of consensus among experts was reached in the third round. The resulting nine PICU EPAs provide a succinct overview of the core tasks of Dutch PICU physicians. These EPAs were created as an essential first step towards developing an assessment system for PICU fellows, grounded in core professional activities. The robust methodology used, may have broad applicability for other (sub)specialty training programs aiming to develop specialty specific EPAs."
https://openalex.org/W3138346680,"Background Firearm dealer density is correlated with firearm interpersonal violence, but no quasi-experimental studies have assessed whether changes in dealer density lead to changes in firearm self-harm injuries and deaths. We assessed whether openings of firearm dealers are associated with short-term changes in local firearm self-harm injury rates. Methods We identified 718 openings of firearm dealers in California using licensing data, 2014–2016. We defined exposure regions based on aggregations of zip codes defined by proximity to firearm dealer openings and matched each opening to four control regions on time and determinants of firearm injury. We applied a differences-in-differences approach to compare rates of firearm self-harm, in the month before and after each opening, in places with and without openings. Results Firearm dealer openings were not associated with acute, local changes in firearm self-harm relative to places without openings (ratio of rate ratio: 0.90 [95% CI:0.68–1.19]). Results were robust to numerous sensitivity and secondary analyses. Conclusion We found no associations of firearm dealer openings with acute, localized firearm self-harm deaths and injuries. Our focus on acute, local effects; broad availability of dealers and firearms; durability of firearms; or strong confounding-control may explain these null findings."
https://openalex.org/W3139274663,"Intestinal development is compromised in low birth weight (LBW) pigs, negatively impacting their growth, health, and resilience. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of the altered intestinal maturation observed in neonatal and juvenile LBW female piglets by comparing the changes in intestinal morphology, gene expression, and methylation in LBW versus normal birth weight (NBW) female piglets. A total of 16 LBW/NBW sibling pairs were sacrificed at 0 hours, 8 hours, 10 days, and 8 weeks of age. The gastrointestinal tract was weighed, measured, and the small intestine was sampled for histomorphology, gene expression, and methylation analyses. Impaired intestinal development, with shorter villi and shallower crypts, was observed in LBW female piglets. The expression of intestinal development markers (ALPI and OLFM) rapidly peaked after birth in NBW but not in LBW female piglets. The lower expression of genes involved in nutrient digestion (ANPEP and SI) and barrier function (OCLN and CLDN4) in LBW, together with their delayed development of intestinal villi and crypts could help to explain the compromised health and growth potential of LBW female piglets. The changes in methylation observed in LBW in key regulators of intestinal development (OLFM4 and FZD5) suggest long-term effects of BW on intestinal gene expression, development, and function. Accordingly, experimental demethylation induced in IPEC-J2 cells led to increased expression of intestinal genes (MGA, DPP4, and GLUT2). Overall, we have identified the alterations in transcription or epigenetic marking at a number of genes critical to intestinal development, which may contribute to both the short- and long-term failure of LBW female piglets to thrive."
https://openalex.org/W3136614323,"This article examines men's involvement in an institutional gender equity award scheme and how their self-concept as allies develops over time. It draws specifically on a subset of qualitative data from the four men participating in a study involving in-depth interviews with university staff involved in the self-assessment team of one Australian institution's Science in Australia Gender Equality (SAGE) Athena SWAN pilot. Data related to the men's experiences is the article's focus. Key themes from the data include: 1) men's motivations for engagement; 2) men's self-understandings as 'champions for change' 3) the barriers/risks associated with male championship; and 4) men's evolving perceptions and critiques of the male champions model. Findings show that men demonstrated personal growth and increased awareness through their participation in the pilot. Yet, their frustration with how equity and diversity was managed in their organisational context highlights pitfalls in the concept of a male 'champion'. This article provides timely guidance for institutions seeking to engage allies in gender equity initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3111004241,"Across a wide range of domains, experts make probabilistic judgments under conditions of uncertainty to support decision-making. These judgments are often conveyed using linguistic expressions (e.g., x is likely). Seeking to foster shared understanding of these expressions between senders and receivers, the US intelligence community implemented a communication standard that prescribes a set of probability terms and assigns each term an equivalent numerical probability range. In an earlier PLOS ONE article, [1] tested whether access to the standard improves shared understanding and also explored the efficacy of various enhanced presentation formats. Notably, they found that embedding numeric equivalents in text (e.g., x is likely [55-80%]) substantially outperformed the status-quo approach in terms of the percentage overlap between participants' interpretations of linguistic probabilities (defined in terms of the numeric range equivalents they provided for each term) and the numeric ranges in the standard. These results have important prescriptive implications, yet Wintle et al.'s percentage overlap measure of agreement may be viewed as unfairly punitive because it penalizes individuals for being more precise than the stipulated guidelines even when the individuals' interpretations fall perfectly within the stipulated ranges. Arguably, subjects' within-range precision is a positive attribute and should not be penalized in scoring interpretive agreement. Accordingly, in the present article, we reanalyzed Wintle et al.'s data using an alternative measure of percentage overlap that does not penalize in-range precision. Using the alternative measure, we find that percentage overlap is substantially elevated across conditions. More importantly, however, the effects of presentation format and probability level are highly consistent with the original study. By removing the ambiguity caused by Wintle et al.'s unduly punitive measure of agreement, these findings buttress Wintle et al.'s original claim that the methods currently used by intelligence organizations are ineffective at coordinating the meaning of uncertainty expressions between intelligence producers and intelligence consumers. Future studies examining agreement between senders and receivers are also encouraged to reflect carefully on the most appropriate measures of agreement to employ in their experiments and to explicate the bases for their methodological choices."
https://openalex.org/W3137599210,"The development of new techniques for the detection of carbapenemase activity is of great importance since the increased incident of resistance against carbapenems represents a serious threat to global public health. In this context, the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization approach already demonstrated to be a reliable tool for rapid carbapenemase detection. As a newly developed test, there is still a lack of in-depth analysis of its robustness and possible wider application. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the potential for using the design MBT STAR-Carba assay as the pre-characterization method for Enterobacterales and P . aeruginosa strains in terms of the produced classes of carbapenemases using modified procedure parameters—various suspension densities and incubation times. Moreover, its usefulness for the in-depth analysis and characterization of metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) was tested by applying inhibition assays. In this study, the designed assay proved to be a sensitive tool for the detection of carbapenemase hydrolytic activity, which can be successfully used to partially classify the class of carbapenemase present. Additionally, the use of defined high concentration suspensions would allow to shorten the incubation time to 1 minute for certain strains. Considering that the assay was also suitable to investigate the effect of different inhibitors on the MBL activity, it demonstrates far higher discriminatory potential than only a rapid routine carbapenemase detection tool and could be used as a susceptibility assay."
https://openalex.org/W3139171472,"Sediment retention is a key ecosystem function provided by floodplains to filter sediments and nutrients from the river water during floods. Floodplain vegetation is an important driver of fine sediment retention. We aim to understand which structural properties of the vegetation are most important for capturing sediments. In a hydraulic flume experiment, we investigated this by disentangling sedimentation on and underneath 96 vegetation patches (40 cm x 60 cm). We planted two grass and two herb species in each patch and conducted a full-factorial manipulation of 1) vegetation density, 2) vegetation height, 3) structural diversity (small-tall vs tall-tall species combinations) and 4) leaf pubescence (based on trait information). We inundated the vegetation patches for 21 h in a flume with silt- and clay-rich water and subsequently measured the amount of accumulated sediment on the vegetation and on a fleece as ground underneath it. We quantified the sediment by washing it off the biomass and off the fleece, drying the sediment and weighting it. Our results showed that all manipulated vegetation properties combined (vegetation density and height, and the interaction of structural diversity and leaf pubescence) explained sedimentation on the vegetation (total R2 = 0.34). The sedimentation underneath the vegetation was explained by the structural diversity and the leaf pubescence (total R2 = 0.11). We further found that vegetation biomass positively affected the sedimentation on and underneath the vegetation. These findings are crucial for floodplain management strategies with the aim to increase sediment retention. Based on our findings, we can identify management strategies and target plant communities that are able to maximize a floodplain's ability to capture sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2999808493,"Improving road safety and setting targets for reducing traffic-related crashes and deaths are highlighted as part of the United Nations sustainable development goals and worldwide vision zero efforts. The advent of transportation network companies and ridesourcing expands mobility options in cities and may impact road safety outcomes. We analyze the effects of ridesourcing use on road crashes, injuries, fatalities, and driving while intoxicated (DWI) offenses in Travis County, Texas. Our approach leverages real-time ridesourcing volume to explain variation in road safety outcomes. Spatial panel data models with fixed-effects are deployed to examine whether the use of ridesourcing is significantly associated with road crashes and other safety metrics. Our results suggest that for a 10% increase in ridesourcing trips, we expect a 0.12% decrease in road crashes, a 0.25% decrease in road injuries, and a 0.36% decrease in DWI offenses in Travis County. On the other hand, ridesourcing use is not significantly associated with road fatalities. This study augments existing work because it moves beyond binary indicators of ridesourcing availability and analyzes crash and ridesourcing trips patterns within an urbanized area rather than their metropolitan-level variation. Contributions include developing a data-rich approach for assessing the impacts of ridesourcing use on the transportation system's safety, which may serve as a template for future analyses for other cities. Our findings provide feedback to policymakers by clarifying associations between ridesourcing use and traffic safety and uncover the potential to achieve safer mobility systems with transportation network companies."
https://openalex.org/W3136665521,"Background Oritavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive pathogens indicated for use in adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Its concentration-dependent activity and prolonged half-life provide a convenient single-dose alternative to multi-dose daily therapies for ABSSSI. This retrospective cohort study was conducted to quantify the clinical and economic advantages of using oritavancin compared to other antibiotic agents that have been historically effective for ABSSSI. Methods Seventy-nine patients received oritavancin who had failed previous outpatient antibiotic therapy (OPAT) for cellulitis or abscess and were subsequently readmitted to the hospital as an inpatient between 2016 and 2018. These patients were compared to a cohort of 28 patients receiving other antibiotics following OPAT failure and subsequent hospitalization for these two infection types. The primary clinical end point was average length of stay (aLOS) and secondary endpoints included readmission rates for the same indication at 30 and 90 days after discharge and the average hospital cost (aHC). Results A total of 107 patients were hospitalized for treatment of cellulitis or abscess. Demographic characteristics of both the oritavancin and comparator groups were similar except for the presence of diabetes. The primary clinical endpoint showed a non-significant decrease in aLOS between the oritavancin group versus comparator (2.12 days versus 2.59 days; p = 0.097). The secondary endpoints revealed lower readmission rates associated with oritavancin treatment at 30 and 90 days; the average hospital cost was 5.9% lower for patients that received oritavancin. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate that oritavancin provides not only a single-dose alternative to multi-day therapies for skin and skin structure infections, but also a clinical and economic advantage compared to other antibiotic agents."
https://openalex.org/W3136792848,"Psychosocial stressors can cause physical inactivity, cardiac damage, and hypotension-induced death in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Because repeated exposure to mild stress can lead to habituation in wild-type mice, we investigated the response of mdx mice to a mild, daily stress to determine whether habituation occurred. Male mdx mice were exposed to a 30-sec scruff restraint daily for 12 weeks. Scruff restraint induced immediate physical inactivity that persisted for at least 60 minutes, and this inactivity response was just as robust after 12 weeks as it was after one day. Physical inactivity in the mdx mice was not associated with acute skeletal muscle contractile dysfunction. However, skeletal muscle of mdx mice that were repeatedly stressed had slow-twitch and tetanic relaxation times and trended toward high passive stiffness, possibly due to a small but significant increase in muscle fibrosis. Elevated urinary corticosterone secretion, adrenal hypertrophy, and a larger adrenal cortex indicating chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were measured in 12-week stressed mdx mice relative to those unstressed. However, pharmacological inhibition of the HPA axis did not affect scruff-induced physical inactivity and acute corticosterone injection did not recapitulate the scruff-induced phenotype, suggesting the HPA axis is not the driver of physical inactivity. Our results indicate that the response of mdx mice to an acute mild stress is non-habituating and that when that stressor is repeated daily for weeks, it is sufficient to exacerbate some phenotypes associated with dystrophinopathy in mdx mice."
https://openalex.org/W3137064266,"The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a data assimilation technique that uses an ensemble of models, updated with data, to track the time evolution of a usually non-linear system. It does so by using an empirical approximation to the well-known Kalman filter. However, its performance can suffer when the ensemble size is smaller than the state space, as is often necessary for computationally burdensome models. This scenario means that the empirical estimate of the state covariance is not full rank and possibly quite noisy. To solve this problem in this high dimensional regime, we propose a computationally fast and easy to implement algorithm called the penalized ensemble Kalman filter (PEnKF). Under certain conditions, it can be theoretically proven that the PEnKF will be accurate (the estimation error will converge to zero) despite having fewer ensemble members than state dimensions. Further, as contrasted to localization methods, the proposed approach learns the covariance structure associated with the dynamical system. These theoretical results are supported with simulations of several non-linear and high dimensional systems."
https://openalex.org/W3138071306,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a key molecular stress sensor and response mediator implicated in multiple cellular functions in health and diseases. Despite its importance and intrinsic involvement in pivotal molecular and cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, chromatin organization, and cell death, the regulatory mechanisms of PARP1 are poorly understood. In this study, we show that SMURF2, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase and suggested tumor suppressor, physically interacts with PARP1 in different cellular settings, directly ubiquitinates it in vitro and stimulates its PARylation activity in cells, the phenomenon that required SMURF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase function. Intriguingly, in the cellular environment SMURF2 was found to regulate the dynamic exchange of ubiquitin moieties on PARP1, mostly decreasing its monoubiquitination. Through the set of systematic mass spectrometry analyses conducted on SMURF2-modified cells, we identified on PARP1 18 lysine residues (out of 126 present in PARP1) as sites which ubiquitination was considerably affected by SMURF2. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis coupled with in cellula ubiquitination and PARylation assays unveiled K222 as a critical site enabling a cross talk between SMURF2-modulated monoubiquitination of PARP1 and its activity, and pointed to K498, S507, and a KTR triad (K498/K521/K524) as the main auto-PARylation sites affected by SMURF2. The results also uncovered that SMURF2 controls PARP1 interactome, influencing its functions and expression in a context-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that SMURF2-mediated ubiquitin signaling plays an essential role in PARP1 regulation, beyond the regulation of its protein expression."

However, the effects of CLA on inflammation and glucose metabolism are controversial. The underlying mechanisms governing the gut microbiota and sexual dimorphisms have also not been elucidated. The present study assessed the effect of CLA on glucose and lipid metabolism in established obesity and examined the mechanism of action based on gut microbiota. Four-week-old C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks to induce obesity. The diet-induced obese (DIO) mice were fed an HFD supplemented with mixed CLA (50% cis-9, trans-11 isomer and 50% trans-10, cis-12 isomers, 0.2% wt/wt) for 15 weeks. CLA supplementation remarkably reversed body weight in both sexes. CLA favored anti-inflammatory microbiota in male mice, mediating increased short-chain fatty acids and decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, which alleviated global inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity via inhibition of the TLR4-NF-κB pathway in adipose tissue. CLA promoted the growth of hydrogen sulfide-producing Desulfovibrio and the release of LPS in female mice, which aggravated adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. Although CLA impaired glucose metabolism in females, brown adipose tissue was significantly activated with browning of white adipose tissue in both sexes, which led to enhanced energy expenditure. Fecal transplantation from CLA-treated mice to DIO mice mimicked the sex-dependent phenotype. In conclusion, CLA decreased body weight and increased energy expenditure but sex-dependently modulated insulin resistance via the gut-adipose axis."
https://openalex.org/W3136623478,"Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP) is a cardiac-specific stress-response protein which exerts diverse effects to modulate cardiac remodeling in response to pathological stimuli. We examined the role of CARP in postnatal cardiac development and function under basal conditions in mice. Transgenic mice that selectively overexpressed CARP in heart (CARP Tg) exhibited dilated cardiac chambers, impaired heart function, and cardiac fibrosis as assessed by echocardiography and histological staining. Furthermore, the mice had a shorter lifespan and reduced survival rate in response to ischemic acute myocardial infarction. Immunofluorescence demonstrated the overexpressed CARP protein was predominantly accumulated in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes. Microarray analysis revealed that the nuclear localization of CARP was associated with the suppression of calcium-handling proteins. In vitro experiments revealed that CARP overexpression resulted in decreased cell contraction and calcium transient. In post-mortem cardiac specimens from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage heart failure, CARP was significantly increased. Taken together, our data identified CARP as a crucial contributor in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure which was associated with its regulation of calcium-handling proteins."

This study intended to explore the effect and mechanism of PCE on long bone development in female fetal rats. In vivo, the PCE group pregnant rats were given different concentrations of caffeine during the gestational Day 9-20. The mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related genes were significantly reduced in PCE group. In the PCE group (120 mg/kg·d), the length and primary center of fetal femur were shorter, and accompanied by H-type blood vessel abundance reducing. Meanwhile, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression decreased in the growth plate of the PCE group (120 mg/kg·d). In contrast, the miR375 expression increased. In vitro, caffeine decreased CTGF and increased miR375 expression in fetal growth plate chondrocytes. After co-culture with caffeine-treated chondrocytes, the tube formation ability for the H-type endothelial cells was decreased. Furthermore, CTGF overexpression or miR375 inhibitor reversed caffeine-induced reduction of tube formation ability, and miR375 inhibitor reversed caffeine-induced CTGF expression inhibition. In summary, PCE decreased the expression of CTGF by miR375, ultimately resulting in H-type blood vessel-related long bone dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W3137879127,"Background Educational activities for physicians sponsored by opioid manufacturers are implicated in the over- and mis-prescribing of opioids. However, the implications of promotion to nurses are poorly understood. Nurses play a key role in assessing pain, addressing the determinants of pain, and administering opioid medications. We sought to understand the nature and content of pain-related educational events sponsored by opioid manufacturers and to compare events targeting physicians and nurses. Methods We conducted a cross sectional, descriptive analysis of pharmaceutical company reports detailing 116,845 sponsored educational events attended by health professionals from 2011 to 2015 in Australia. We included events that were sponsored by manufacturers of prescription opioid analgesics and were pain related. We compared event characteristics across three attendee groups: (a) physicians only; (b) at least one nurse in attendance; and (c) nurses only. We coded the unstructured data using iteratively generated keywords for variables related to location, format, and content focus. Results We identified 3,411 pain-related events sponsored by 3 companies: bioCSL/CSL (n = 15), Janssen (n = 134); and Mundipharma (n = 3,262). Pain-related events were most often multidisciplinary, including at least one nurse (1,964/3,411; 58%); 38% (1,281/3,411) included physicians only, and 5% (166/3,411) nurses only. The majority of events were held in clinical settings (61%) and 43% took the form of a journal club. Chronic pain was the most common event topic (26%) followed by cancer pain and palliative care (18%), and then generic or unspecified references to pain (15%); nearly a third (32%) of event descriptions contained insufficient information to determine the content focus. Nurse-only events were less frequently held in clinical settings (32%; p &lt; .001) and more frequently were product launches (17%; p &lt; .001) and a significantly larger proportion focused on cancer or palliative care (33%; p &lt; .001), generic pain topics (27%; p &lt; .001), and geriatrics (25%; p &lt; .001) than physician-only or multidisciplinary events. Discussion Opioid promotion via sponsored educational events extends beyond physicians to multidisciplinary teams and specifically, nurses. Despite lack of evidence that opioids improve outcomes for long-term chronic non-cancer pain, hundreds of sponsored educational events focused on chronic pain. Regulators should consider the validity of distinguishing between pharmaceutical companies’ “promotional” and “non-promotional” activities."
https://openalex.org/W3136399136,"Precise quantification of molecular targets in a biological sample across a wide dynamic range is a key requirement in many diagnostic procedures, such as monitoring response to therapy or detection of measurable residual disease. State of the art digital PCR assays provide for a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. However digital assays are complex and require sophisticated microfluidic tools. Here we present an assay format that enables ultra-precise quantification of RNA targets in a single measurement across a dynamic range of more than six orders of magnitude. The approach is based on hydrogel beads that provide for microfluidic free compartmentalization of the sample as they are used as nanoreactors for reverse transcription, PCR amplification and combined real time and digital detection of gene transcripts. We have applied these nanoreactor beads for establishing an assay for the detection and quantification of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts. The assay has been characterized for its precision and linear dynamic range. A comparison of the new method against conventional real time RT-PCR analysis (reference method) with clinical samples from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) revealed excellent concordance with Pearsons correlation coefficient of 0.983 and slope of 1.08."
https://openalex.org/W3139435170,"Scan pattern analysis has been discussed as a promising tool in the context of real-time gaze-based applications. In particular, information-theoretic measures of scan path predictability, such as the gaze transition entropy (GTE), have been proposed for detecting relevant changes in user state or task demand. These measures model scan patterns as first-order Markov chains, assuming that only the location of the previous fixation is predictive of the next fixation in time. However, this assumption may not be sufficient in general, as recent research has shown that scan patterns may also exhibit more long-range temporal correlations. Thus, we here evaluate the active information storage (AIS) as a novel information-theoretic approach to quantifying scan path predictability in a dynamic task. In contrast to the GTE, the AIS provides means to statistically test and account for temporal correlations in scan path data beyond the previous last fixation. We compare AIS to GTE in a driving simulator experiment, in which participants drove in a highway scenario, where trials were defined based on an experimental manipulation that encouraged the driver to start an overtaking maneuver. Two levels of difficulty were realized by varying the time left to complete the task. We found that individual observers indeed showed temporal correlations beyond a single past fixation and that the length of the correlation varied between observers. No effect of task difficulty was observed on scan path predictability for either AIS or GTE, but we found a significant increase in predictability during overtaking. Importantly, for participants for which the first-order Markov chain assumption did not hold, this was only shown using AIS but not GTE. We conclude that accounting for longer time horizons in scan paths in a personalized fashion is beneficial for interpreting gaze pattern in dynamic tasks."
