https://openalex.org/W2105425384,"This technical report describes a 360-channel flexible multi-electrode array with high spatial resolution, wide coverage area and minimal damage to the recorded neural tissue. Among other descriptions of multiunit in vivo neuronal recording in cats, the authors also use the electrode array to show spiral-patterned spread of epileptic neural activity in the neocortex. Arrays of electrodes for recording and stimulating the brain are used throughout clinical medicine and basic neuroscience research, yet are unable to sample large areas of the brain while maintaining high spatial resolution because of the need to individually wire each passive sensor at the electrode-tissue interface. To overcome this constraint, we developed new devices that integrate ultrathin and flexible silicon nanomembrane transistors into the electrode array, enabling new dense arrays of thousands of amplified and multiplexed sensors that are connected using fewer wires. We used this system to record spatial properties of cat brain activity in vivo, including sleep spindles, single-trial visual evoked responses and electrographic seizures. We found that seizures may manifest as recurrent spiral waves that propagate in the neocortex. The developments reported here herald a new generation of diagnostic and therapeutic brain-machine interface devices."
https://openalex.org/W1984984201,"Cancer is often viewed as a caricature of normal developmental processes, but the extent to which its cellular heterogeneity truly recapitulates multilineage differentiation processes of normal tissues remains unknown. Here we implement single-cell PCR gene-expression analysis to dissect the cellular composition of primary human normal colon and colon cancer epithelia. We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that the different gene-expression programs linked to multilineage differentiation are strongly associated with patient survival. We develop two-gene classifier systems (KRT20 versus CA1, MS4A12, CD177, SLC26A3) that predict clinical outcomes with hazard ratios superior to those of pathological grade and comparable to those of microarray-derived multigene expression signatures."

https://openalex.org/W2034355012,"Transcriptomic analyses have revealed an unexpected complexity to the human transcriptome, whose breadth and depth exceeds current RNA sequencing capability. Using tiling arrays to target and sequence select portions of the transcriptome, we identify and characterize unannotated transcripts whose rare or transient expression is below the detection limits of conventional sequencing approaches. We use the unprecedented depth of coverage afforded by this technique to reach the deepest limits of the human transcriptome, exposing widespread, regulated and remarkably complex noncoding transcription in intergenic regions, as well as unannotated exons and splicing patterns in even intensively studied protein-coding loci such as p53 and HOX. The data also show that intermittent sequenced reads observed in conventional RNA sequencing data sets, previously dismissed as noise, are in fact indicative of unassembled rare transcripts. Collectively, these results reveal the range, depth and complexity of a human transcriptome that is far from fully characterized."

https://openalex.org/W2119404698,"Bacterial pathogens evolve during the infection of their human host(1-8), but separating adaptive and neutral mutations remains challenging(9-11). Here we identify bacterial genes under adaptive evolution by tracking recurrent patterns of mutations in the same pathogenic strain during the infection of multiple individuals. We conducted a retrospective study of a Burkholderia dolosa outbreak among subjects with cystic fibrosis, sequencing the genomes of 112 isolates collected from 14 individuals over 16 years. We find that 17 bacterial genes acquired nonsynonymous mutations in multiple individuals, which indicates parallel adaptive evolution. Mutations in these genes affect important pathogenic phenotypes, including antibiotic resistance and bacterial membrane composition and implicate oxygen-dependent regulation as paramount in lung infections. Several genes have not previously been implicated in pathogenesis and may represent new therapeutic targets. The identification of parallel molecular evolution as a pathogen spreads among multiple individuals points to the key selection forces it experiences within human hosts."

https://openalex.org/W2040320225,"Excessive activation of the β-adrenergic, angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone signaling pathways promotes mortality after myocardial infarction, and antagonists targeting these pathways are core therapies for treating this condition. Catecholamines and Ang II activate the multifunctional Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), the inhibition of which prevents isoproterenol-mediated and Ang II-mediated cardiomyopathy. Here we show that aldosterone exerts direct toxic actions on myocardium by oxidative activation of CaMKII, causing cardiac rupture and increased mortality in mice after myocardial infarction. Aldosterone induces CaMKII oxidation by recruiting NADPH oxidase, and this oxidized and activated CaMKII promotes matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression in cardiomyocytes. Myocardial CaMKII inhibition, overexpression of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (an enzyme that reduces oxidized CaMKII) or NADPH oxidase deficiency prevented aldosterone-enhanced cardiac rupture after myocardial infarction. These findings show that oxidized myocardial CaMKII mediates the cardiotoxic effects of aldosterone on the cardiac matrix and establish CaMKII as a nodal signal for the neurohumoral pathways associated with poor outcomes after myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W1997098169,"We developed an assay for quantifying the reward value of nutrient and used it to analyze the effects of metabolic state and leptin. In this assay, mice chose between two sippers, one of which dispensed water and was coupled to optogenetic activation of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and the other of which dispensed natural or artificial sweeteners. This assay measured the reward value of sweeteners relative to lick-induced optogenetic activation of DA neurons. Mice preferred optogenetic stimulation of DA neurons to sucralose, but not to sucrose. However, the mice preferred sucralose plus optogenetic stimulation versus sucrose. We found that food restriction increased the value of sucrose relative to sucralose plus optogenetic stimulation, and that leptin decreased it. Our data suggest that leptin suppresses the ability of sucrose to drive taste-independent DA neuronal activation and provide new insights into the mechanism of leptin's effects on food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2087900616,"Nitric oxide (NO) is crucial in diverse physiological and pathological processes. We show that a hypomorphic mouse model of argininosuccinate lyase (encoded by Asl) deficiency has a distinct phenotype of multiorgan dysfunction and NO deficiency. Loss of Asl in both humans and mice leads to reduced NO synthesis, owing to both decreased endogenous arginine synthesis and an impaired ability to use extracellular arginine for NO production. Administration of nitrite, which can be converted into NO in vivo, rescued the manifestations of NO deficiency in hypomorphic Asl mice, and a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-independent NO donor restored NO-dependent vascular reactivity in humans with ASL deficiency. Mechanistic studies showed that ASL has a structural function in addition to its catalytic activity, by which it contributes to the formation of a multiprotein complex required for NO production. Our data demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for ASL in NOS function and NO homeostasis. Hence, ASL may serve as a target for manipulating NO production in experimental models, as well as for the treatment of NO-related diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1986177491,"Obesity-related diseases are associated with vascular dysfunction and impaired revascularization. Omentin is a fat-derived secreted protein, which is down-regulated in association with obese complications. Here, we investigated whether omentin modulates endothelial cell function and revascularization processes in vitro and in vivo. Systemic delivery of an adenoviral vector expressing omentin (Ad-omentin) enhanced blood flow recovery and capillary density in ischemic limbs of wild-type mice in vivo, which were accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a physiological concentration of recombinant omentin protein increased differentiation into vascular-like structures and decreased apoptotic activity under conditions of serum starvation. Treatment with omentin protein stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in HUVECs. Inhibition of Akt signaling by treatment with dominant-negative Akt or LY294002 blocked the stimulatory effects of omentin on differentiation and survival of HUVECs and reversed omentin-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation. Pretreatment with the NOS inhibitor also reduced the omentin-induced increase in HUVEC differentiation and survival. Omentin protein also stimulated the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase in HUVECs. Transduction with dominant-negative AMP-activated protein kinase diminished omentin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and omentin-stimulated increase in HUVEC differentiation and survival. Of importance, in contrast to wild-type mice, systemic administration of Ad-omentin did not affect blood flow in ischemic muscle in eNOS-deficient mice in vivo. These data indicate that omentin promotes endothelial cell function and revascularization in response to ischemia through its ability to stimulate an Akt-eNOS signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2050419119,"Post-translational palmitoylation of intracellular proteins is mediated by protein palmitoyltransferases belonging to the DHHC family, which share a common catalytic Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif. Several members have been implicated in neuronal development, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. We previously observed that mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of the ZDHHC5 gene are impaired in context-dependent learning and memory. To identify potentially relevant protein substrates of DHHC5, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of stable isotope-labeled neuronal stem cell cultures from forebrains of normal and DHHC5-GT (gene-trapped) mice using the bioorthogonal palmitate analog 17-octadecynoic acid. We identified ∼300 17-octadecynoic acid-modified and hydroxylamine-sensitive proteins, of which a subset was decreased in abundance in DHHC5-GT cells. Palmitoylation and oligomerization of one of these proteins (flotillin-2) was abolished in DHHC5-GT neuronal stem cells. In COS-1 cells, overexpression of DHHC5 markedly stimulated the palmitoylation of flotillin-2, strongly suggesting a direct enzyme-substrate relationship. Serendipitously, we found that down-regulation of DHHC5 was triggered within minutes following growth factor withdrawal from normal neural stem cells, a maneuver that is used to induce neural differentiation in culture. The effect was reversible for up to 4 h, and degradation was partially prevented by inhibitors of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. These findings suggest that protein palmitoylation can be regulated through changes in DHHC PAT levels in response to differentiation signals. Post-translational palmitoylation of intracellular proteins is mediated by protein palmitoyltransferases belonging to the DHHC family, which share a common catalytic Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif. Several members have been implicated in neuronal development, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity.

These findings suggest that protein palmitoylation can be regulated through changes in DHHC PAT levels in response to differentiation signals. Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification important for trafficking, stability, and activity of numerous intracellular proteins in eukaryotic cells. Many proteins involved in neural development, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity are known to be palmitoylated, including signaling proteins, ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, cell adhesion molecules, transporters, adaptors, and scaffolding proteins (1Huang K. El-Husseini A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Resh M.D. Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re14Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 3Linder M.E.

Protein palmitoylation has a prominent role in targeting proteins to specialized membrane compartments, which is central to axon and dendrite outgrowth and the formation of synapses. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms and regulation of protein palmitoylation is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling neuronal function. Protein palmitoylation is carried out by a family of 23 mammalian palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), 3The abbreviations used are: PATpalmitoyl acyltransferaseALLNN-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinylnorleucinalPApalmitic acidNSCneural stem cellGTgene-targeted17-ODYA17-octadecynoic acidABEacyl-biotin exchangeSILACstable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture. referred to as the DHHC family, that catalyze palmitoylation of intracellular proteins on cysteine residues (5Bartels D.J.

Sci. 2011; 36: 245-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cellular and physiological roles of the DHHC PATs are just beginning to be explored. A particular challenge has been the identification of physiologically relevant enzyme-substrate pairs. Genetic approaches have proven powerful, especially in lower organisms (see, for example, Refs. 10Roth A.F. Wan J. Bailey A.O. Sun B. Kuchar J.A. Green W.N. Phinney B.S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Davis N.G.

PLoS One. 2011; 6: e16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and, more recently, in mammalian systems. These approaches, coupled with powerful new methods to profile palmitoylated proteins in cells and tissues, are providing opportunities for delineating pathways controlled by protein palmitoylation (reviewed in Refs. 4Fukata Y. Fukata M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar and 9Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. Trends Biochem.

A second challenge has been to understand how protein palmitoylation is regulated. The mechanisms are incompletely understood and limited to only a few examples, in particular, the palmitoylation of G protein α subunit Gαs (12Wedegaertner P.B. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and the neuronal scaffolding protein PSD-95 (13El-Husseini Ael-D. Schnell E. Dakoji S. Sweeney N. Zhou Q. Prange O. Gauthier-Campbell C. Aguilera-Moreno A. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Cell. 2002; 108: 849-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In both instances, palmitate turnover is accelerated in response to extracellular signals by receptor activation, contributing to down-regulation of these signaling pathways. Positive regulation of palmitoylation by DHHC PAT recruitment to cellular compartments has more recently been proposed as a mechanism to increase palmitoylation. For example, DHHC2 translocates to postsynaptic membranes upon suppression of neuronal activity, thereby increasing PSD-95 palmitoylation and promoting its synaptic accumulation (14Noritake J. Fukata Y. Iwanaga T. Hosomi N. Tsutsumi R. Matsuda N. Tani H. Iwanari H. Mochizuki Y. Kodama T. Matsuura Y. Bredt D.S. Hamakubo T. Fukata M. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The effect is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domain of DHHC2 (15Greaves J. Carmichael J.A. Chamberlain L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulation of overall DHHC protein levels in cells has not been previously described. We have previously shown that mice carrying a hypomorphic allele of DHHC5 (designated DHHC5-GT, for gene-targeted) have a defect in fear learning and memory. In the brain, DHHC5 localizes to the post-synaptic density and interacts with PSD95 but does not palmitoylate it (16Li Y. Hu J. Höfer K. Wong A.M. Cooper J.D. Birnbaum S.G. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13022-13031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the current study, we identify the abundant lipid raft protein flotillin-2 as a substrate for DHHC5 and show that it is under-palmitoylated in DHHC5-GT neural stem cells and brain. Furthermore, we find that DHHC5 declines rapidly (within minutes) on induction of neural differentiation, demonstrating a previously unsuspected mode of DHHC PAT regulation.

This plasmid directs transcription of a full-length mouse DHHC5 cDNA corresponding to NCBI RefSeq NM_144887. pEF-BOS-HA-mDHHC5 (CΔS) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II XL; Stratagene), resulting in a single amino acid change C134S within the DHHC motif. A full-length human flotillin-2 cDNA clone (Open Biosystems, MHS1010–57825, corresponding to the human flotillin-2 cDNA in GenBankTM BC_003683) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) (Invitrogen) using XhoI and BamHI sites and is designated pcDNA/Myc-His-FLOT2. Site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA/Myc-His-FLOT2 to create cysteine to serine (palmitoylation defective) substitutions at Cys-4, -19, and -20 was also performed as above. NSCs derived from DHHC5-GT mice and littermate controls were profiled according to Ref. 18Martin B.R. Wang C. Adibekian A. Tully S.E. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar. Full experimental procedures are available in the supplemental materials. NSCs (60 × 106 cells) growing in suspension culture in NSC growth medium (DMEM/F-12/N2 containing 20 ng/ml EGF, 20 ng/ml FGF2, and 5 μg/ml heparin) were harvested by centrifugation, washed three times in PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (“lysis buffer”) containing 10 μl of freshly added 1 m N-ethylmaleimide. ABE assays were performed according to (10Roth A.F. Wan J. Bailey A.O. Sun B. Kuchar J.A. Green W.N. Phinney B.S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Davis N.G. Cell. 2006; 125: 1003-1013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were precipitated using chloroform-methanol, treated exhaustively with N-ethylmaleimide to block free thiol groups, which was removed by sequential chloroform-methanol precipitation and then treated with hydroxylamine and biotin-HPDP to exchange thiol-bound fatty acids for biotin; proteins were precipitated to remove free biotin and recover the biotinylated proteins. Equal amounts of solubilized protein were incubated with neutravidin beads, and eluted with 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins eluted from the beads were concentrated and resuspended in a final volume of 50 μl, and one-fifth of the entire sample was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel for subsequent transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotting. Whole cell lysates or eluates from neutravidin beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblots were performed using the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-flotillin-2 (1:5000; BD Transduction Laboratories, catalogue number 610383), rabbit polyclonal anti-Rap2b (1:1000, ProteinTech, 16266–1-AP), rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (1:1000, Abcam), anti-DHHC5 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich HPA014670), mouse monoclonal α-adaptin antibody (1:1000, Abcam), mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich), and mouse monoclonal anti-GAP-43 (Santa-Cruz, SC-17790). Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence using either or sheep anti-mouse IgG, peroxidase-linked species specific F(ab′)2 fragment or HRP-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (both from GE Healthcare). The filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film at room temperature for times varying between 5 s and 15 min. Oligomerization of flotillins in NSCs was assessed according to Ref. 19Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar. Disuccinimidyl suberate was prepared in Me2SO (25 mm). NSCs were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0), and the cells were suspended at a density of ∼25 × 106 cells/ml in PBS (pH 8.0). Disuccinimidyl suberate (or vehicle alone) was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell lysates were prepared as described above and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-flotillin-2 monoclonal antibody. DHHC5-WT or -GT NSCs (∼50,000) were seeded in wells of a 24-well plate on polylysine-coated coverslips in 500 μl of NSC differentiation medium. After 2 days, one-half of the spent medium was replaced with 250 μl of fresh NSC differentiation medium. Three days after seeding, NSCs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-Tuj 1 polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Covance) and mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (1:300, Cell Signaling) at 37 °C for 30 mins and then with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cover glasses were then mounted using Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). To study the cellular role of DHHC5, we dissected the forebrains of post-natal day 1 DHHC5-GT mice and littermate controls and cultured them under conditions that select for cells maintaining neural stem cell pluripotency (20Zhang C.L. Zou Y. He W. Gage F.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Virtually 100% strongly expressed Sox2, a marker of NSCs (supplemental Fig. S1). These cultures have been continually passaged for 1 year and maintain elevated Sox2 expression with greatly reduced levels of DHHC5 (∼5% of normal, the residual caused by splicing around the gene trap cassette) (16Li Y. Hu J. Höfer K. Wong A.M. Cooper J.D. Birnbaum S.G. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13022-13031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To identify potential substrates of DHHC5, we utilized stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) methods, culturing both wild type and DHHC5-GT cells in normal or isotopic arginine (+8) and lysine (+10) for several passages and then incubating the cells with the fatty acid analog 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) to metabolically label endogenous sites of palmitoylation (18Martin B.R. Wang C. Adibekian A. Tully S.E. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 1A. Membrane lysates were reacted with rhodamine-azide by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (click) chemistry for gel-based fluorescent analysis (21Martin B.R. Cravatt B.F. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Labeling was shown to be hydroxylamine-sensitive, yet no significant changes in 17-ODYA labeling were visibly different between wild type and DHHC5-GT cells (Fig. 1B). To profile the substrates of DHHC5, we first defined a list of palmitoylated proteins in neuronal stem cells. Heavy and light wild type cells were treated overnight with 17-ODYA or palmitic acid (PA) as a negative control. (PA is expected to be incorporated into proteins but lacks the functional alkyne group required for protein capture.) An additional set of control experiments was performed where heavy and light cells were both treated with 17-ODYA, and then one of the samples was treated with hydroxylamine. After precipitation, equal amounts of membrane lysate from each of the light and heavy pairs were combined, mixing 17-ODYA and PA (or hydroxylamine)-treated lysates for reaction with biotin-azide and enrichment of bioorthogonally labeled palmitoylated proteins. Tryptic peptides were separated in-line by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) and analyzed using a high resolution mass spectrometer. Quantitative proteomic analysis of these samples revealed ∼400 proteins that were enriched more than 5-fold and were present in reciprocally treated sample pairs from the PA control experiments (supplemental Table S1) and several hundred more proteins in the hydroxylamine control experiments (supplemental Table S2). In total, ∼300 proteins were identified in both approaches, defining a list of high confidence palmitoylated proteins. This list includes many previously known neuronal palmitoylated proteins, including N-Ras (22Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J.

Next, isotopically labeled wild type and DHHC-GT cells were labeled overnight with 17-ODYA, reacted with biotin-azide, selectively enriched on streptavidin beads, and digested for comparative proteomic analysis. As expected, DHHC5 showed the greatest WT/GT ratio, as a consequence of gene-targeting. (DHHC5 is S-acylated at three sites downstream of the catalytic DHHC motif as shown in a prior proteomic study that used the acyl-biotin exchange method (28Yang W. Di Vizio D. Kirchner M. Steen H.

Of the high confidence 17-ODYA-enriched proteins identified above, ∼20 proteins demonstrated elevated SILAC ratio changes (WT/GT) of 2-fold or greater, suggestive of DHHC5 substrates (supplemental Table S3). However, unenriched tryptic digests of combined heavy and light membrane lysates from pairs of wild type and DHHC5-GT NSCs were analyzed, allowing comparison of the absolute abundance to 17-ODYA enrichment (supplemental Table S4) for the most abundant of these proteins. Athough this analysis only measured the abundance of ∼50% of the putative DHHC5 substrates, in each case, the WT/GT ratio difference in the 17-ODYA-treated samples reflected an underlying difference in overall membrane protein abundance (supplemental Table S5). Therefore, we did not find strong evidence for a steady-state pool of unacylated proteins in the DHHC5-GT cells. Flotillins are palmitoylated proteins implicated in lipid raft assembly and function (29Morrow I.C. Parton R.G. Traffic. 2005; 6: 725-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 30Stuermer C.A. J. Neurochem. 2011; 116: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We observed a SILAC ratio (WT/GT) for flotillin-2 of 3.06 ± 0.12 (S.E.), making it a candidate DHHC5 substrate (Fig. 1C). To evaluate flotillin-2 palmitoylation by an independent method, we used an orthogonal palmitoylation assay (acyl-biotin exchange) to assess flotillin-2 palmitoylation. In this approach, hydroxylamine-sensitive, palmitoylated cysteines are exchanged for a disulfide biotin for capture on a neutravidin column (31Kang R. Wan J. Arstikaitis P. Takahashi H. Huang K. Bailey A.O. Thompson J.X. Roth A.F. Drisdel R.C. Mastro R. Green W.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Davis N.G. El-Husseini A. Nature. 2008; 456: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 32Wan J. Roth A.F. Bailey A.O. Davis N.G. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, the total amount of flotillin-2 was decreased ∼50% in the DHHC5-GT as compared with wild type lysates; however, the amount of flotillin-2 captured on the biotin column was nearly undetectable. Other known palmitoylated proteins, such as Rap2b and calnexin (31Kang R. Wan J. Arstikaitis P. Takahashi H. Huang K. Bailey A.O. Thompson J.X. Roth A.F. Drisdel R.C. Mastro R. Green W.N.

In whole mouse brain lysates (Fig. 1E), absolute levels of flotillin-2 were unchanged, but palmitoylated flotillin-2 was reduced in the DHHC5-GT mice as compared with wild type (Fig. 1E), further supporting the observation that flotillin-2 palmitoylation is dependent upon DHHC5. Quantitative immunoblots from three independent experiments confirmed a greater than 10-fold decrease in the S-acylated fraction in the DHHC5-GT cells (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, incubation with increasing concentrations of the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate abolished the S-acylated fraction of flotillin-2 in the neural stem cells, confirming a fatty acid as the hydroxylamine-sensitive modification (Fig. 1G). We next sought to determine whether DHHC5 would direct the palmitoylation of flotillin-2 in a heterologous cell assay system. COS-1 cells transfected with an epitope-tagged flotillin-2 and DHHC5, but not the catalytic mutant DHHC5 (C134S), showed greatly enhanced enrichment of flotillin-2 by acyl biotin exchange, demonstrating the ability of DHHC5 to palmitoylate flotillin-2 in heterologous cells (Fig. 2A). These data, together with the data presented in Fig. 1, provide strong evidence for a direct enzyme-substrate interaction for DHHC5-flotillin-2. Flotilin-2 is myristoylated at Gly-2 and palmitoylated at three cysteine residues located near the amino terminus (Cys-4, -19, and -20), with Cys-4 showing the most robust palmitate incorporation in HeLa cells (34Neumann-Giesen C. Falkenbach B. Beicht P. Claasen S. Lüers G. Stuermer C.A. Herzog V. Tikkanen R. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Mutation of all three cysteine residues blocked palmitoylation of flotillin-2 by endogenous COS cells enzymes (Fig. 2B, lane 3) and by DHHC5 (compare lanes 2 and 4). Mutation of cysteine residues in various combinations (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–10) reveals that DHHC5 stimulated palmitoylation most prominently at Cys-4 but also at Cys-20. Flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 function as homo-and hetero-oligomers in cells through association of their carboxyl-terminal domains (19Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To assess oligomerization of flotillin-2 in the NSCs, we performed a previously described analysis that involves cross-linking of adjacent lysine residues in proteins using a chemical reagent, disuccinimidyl suberate, and assessment of flotillin-2 migration by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (19Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In wild type NSCs (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2), cross-linking of cell lysates reveals that flotillin-2, which normally exists as a monomer at 45 kDa, shifts almost entirely to a high molecular weight (presumably the tetramer as previously reported (19Solis G.P. Hoegg M. Munderloh C. Schrock Y. Malaga-Trillo E. Rivera-Milla E. Stuermer C.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, no high molecular weight flotillin-2 complexes were observed in the DHHC5-GT NSCs (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). These results are consistent with the known requirement of flotillin-2 palmitoylation for formation of higher order complexes (35Munderloh C. Solis G.P. Bodrikov V. Jaeger F.A. Wiechers M. Málaga-Trillo E. Stuermer C.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Langhorst M.F. Reuter A. Jaeger F.A. Wippich F.M. Luxenhofer G. Plattner H. Stuermer C.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 87: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, the buoyant density of flotillin-2 as assessed by sucrose density centrifugation was similar between WT and DHHC5-GT cells (Fig. 2D). Under these conditions, α-adaptin, a marker for clathrin coated vesicles, was found near the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 2D, lanes 11–13), whereas flotillin-2 was found in fractions 5–8, peaking in fraction 6 for both cell types. Although a trace of flotillin-2 could be detected at the top of the gradient only in WT extracts (in two experiments), whether this was a true difference remains to be determined, because flotillin-2 levels were reduced in the knockout, and flotillin-2 in fraction 1 in WT cells was at the limits of detection in the assay. However, it is clear that the sedimentation of the vast majority of flotillin-2 was unaffected by the lack of DHHC5. Flotillin-2 palmitoylation has been shown to be required for neurite outgrowth (35Munderloh C. Solis G.P. Bodrikov V. Jaeger F.A. Wiechers M. Málaga-Trillo E. Stuermer C.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Langhorst M.F. Reuter A. Jaeger F.A. Wippich F.M. Luxenhofer G. Plattner H. Stuermer C.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 87: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a process that can be induced in cell culture by changes in the culture medium that include growth factor withdrawal (20Zhang C.L. Zou Y. He W. Gage F.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we observed that DHHC5-GT NSCs did not extend neurites and showed little evidence of neuronal differentiation, at least as evidenced by expression of the neuronal marker, β-tubulin III (Tuj 1) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in the course of these experiments, we tracked normal DHHC5 protein expression during induction of neuronal differentiation in WT cells and discovered that within 5 min of shifting to the differentiation media, DHHC5 levels begin to decrease rapidly (Fig. 3B, top panel), reaching a level of 10% of previous levels after 1 h. The decline closely paralleled the disappearance of the stem cell marker, Sox2 (middle panel). Flotillin-2 levels were unaffected (bottom panel). This suggests that DHHC5 is under the control of upstream signals that either promote neurogenesis or maintain stem cell pluripotency. Of note, there was no difference in the decline of Sox2 between wild type and DHHC5-GT cells (Fig. 3B, middle panels), indicating that the loss of DHHC5 does not affect signaling to Sox2. Additionally, adding back growth factors to the cells after a period of growth factor withdrawal (4 h) was sufficient to rapidly induce DHHC5, with an increase that was half-maximal at 10 min and complete within 1–2 h (Fig. 3C), indicating that the changes are rapid and reversible. The loss of DHHC5 suggested that DHHC5 is subject to rapid degradation in response to the shift to the differentiation medium. We therefore tested the effect of inhibitors of proteosome-mediated degradation (ALLN (37Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2103522306,"It has been hypothesized that aquaporin-9 (AQP9) is part of the unknown route of hepatocyte glycerol uptake. In a previous study, leptin receptor-deficient wild-type mice became diabetic and suffered from fasting hyperglycemia whereas isogenic AQP9(-/-) knock-out mice remained normoglycemic. The reason for this improvement in AQP9(-/-) mice was not established before. Here, we show increased glucose output (by 123% ± 36% S.E.) in primary hepatocyte culture when 0.5 mM extracellular glycerol was added. This increase depended on AQP9 because it was absent in AQP9(-/-) cells. Likewise, the increase was abolished by 25 μM HTS13286 (IC(50) ~ 2 μM), a novel AQP9 inhibitor, which we identified in a small molecule library screen. Similarly, AQP9 deletion or chemical inhibition eliminated glycerol-enhanced glucose output in perfused liver preparations. The following control experiments suggested inhibitor specificity to AQP9: (i) HTS13286 affected solute permeability in cell lines expressing AQP9, but not in cell lines expressing AQPs 3, 7, or 8. (ii) HTS13286 did not influence lactate- and pyruvate-dependent hepatocyte glucose output. (iii) HTS13286 did not affect glycerol kinase activity. Our experiments establish AQP9 as the primary route of hepatocyte glycerol uptake for gluconeogenesis and thereby explain the previously observed, alleviated diabetes in leptin receptor-deficient AQP9(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W2068595687,"Many tumors exhibit elevated chromosome mis-segregation termed chromosome instability (CIN), which is likely to be a potent driver of tumor progression and drug resistance. Causes of CIN are poorly understood but probably include prior genome tetraploidization, centrosome amplification and mitotic checkpoint defects. This study identifies epigenetic alteration of the centromere as a potential contributor to the CIN phenotype. The centromere controls chromosome segregation and consists of higher-order repeat (HOR) alpha-satellite DNA packaged into two chromatin domains: the kinetochore, harboring the centromere-specific H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A), and the pericentromeric heterochromatin, considered important for cohesion. Perturbation of centromeric chromatin in model systems causes CIN. As cancer cells exhibit widespread chromatin changes, we hypothesized that pericentromeric chromatin structure could also be affected, contributing to CIN. Cytological and chromatin immunoprecipitation and PCR (ChIP-PCR)-based analyses of HT1080 cancer cells showed that only one of the two HORs on chromosomes 5 and 7 incorporate CENP-A, an organization conserved in all normal and cancer-derived cells examined. Contrastingly, the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3 (trimethylation of H3 lysine 9) mapped to all four HORs and ChIP-PCR showed an altered pattern of H3K9me3 in cancer cell lines and breast tumors, consistent with a reduction on the kinetochore-forming HORs. The JMJD2B demethylase is overexpressed in breast tumors with a CIN phenotype, and overexpression of exogenous JMJD2B in cultured breast epithelial cells caused loss of centromere-associated H3K9me3 and increased CIN. These findings suggest that impaired maintenance of pericentromeric heterochromatin may contribute to CIN in cancer and be a novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2073801259,"The orphan nuclear receptor TR3 (NR41A and Nur77) is overexpressed in most lung cancer patients and is a negative prognostic factor for patient survival. The function of TR3 was investigated in non-small-cell lung cancer A549 and H460 cells, and knockdown of TR3 by RNA interference (siTR3) inhibited cancer cell growth and induced apoptosis. The prosurvival activity of TR3 was due, in part, to formation of a p300/TR3/ specificity protein 1 complex bound to GC-rich promoter regions of survivin and other Sp-regulated genes (mechanism 1). However, in p53 wild-type A549 and H460 cells, siTR3 inhibited the mTORC1 pathway, and this was due to activation of p53 and induction of the p53-responsive gene sestrin 2, which subsequently activated the mTORC1 inhibitor AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) (mechanism 2). This demonstrates that the pro-oncogenic activity of TR3 in lung cancer cells was due to inhibition of p53 and activation of mTORC1. 1,1-Bis(3’-indolyl)-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methane (DIM-C-pPhOH) is a recently discovered inhibitor of TR3, which mimics the effects of siTR3. DIM-C-pPhOH inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells and lung tumors in murine orthotopic and metastatic models, and this was accompanied by decreased expression of survivin and inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, demonstrating that inactivators of TR3 represent a novel class of mTORC1 inhibitors."

Liu X.S. Liu Q.R. Wei L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). One of the GDNFOS isoforms encodes a potentially secreted peptide of 105 amino acids detected in human kidney cell lines and brain by Western blot analysis. Therefore, it may be that human and rodent GDNF isoforms differ in several aspects of the number of exons, alternative splicing, signal peptides, and cis-natural antisense transcript regulation, but also differ at the levels of expression in brain and peripheral tissue. GDNF is known to be down-regulated in substantia nigra and putamen in human Parkinson disease (26Bäckman C.M. Shan L. Zhang Y.J. Hoffer B.J. Leonard S. Troncoso J.C. Vonsatel P. Tomac A.C. Mol.

Neural. Transm. 1996; 103: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, GDNF regulation in Alzheimer disease (AD) is less documented (29Siegel G.J. Chauhan N.B. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). A recent report indicated that GDNF concentrations are significantly up-regulated in cerebrospinal fluid and down-regulated in serum in patients with early AD (30Straten G. Eschweiler G.W. Maetzler W. Laske C. Leyhe T. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2009; 18: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We selected human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) for GDNF study because it is a region consistently affected by Alzheimer disease (31Schroeter M.L. Stein T. Maslowski N. Neumann J. Neuroimage. 2009; 47: 1196-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and neurons of the MTG are also affected in HD (32Herndon E.S. Hladik C.L. Shang P. Burns D.K. Raisanen J. White 3rd, C.L. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2009; 68: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We found that the mRNA deriving from human GDNF exon 2 was significantly increased, whereas the mature peptide was decreased in the MTG of AD patients in comparison with MTG of age-matched controls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of regulation of human GDNF and GDNFOS isoforms and mature GDNF peptide in the brains of AD and HD patients Based on our study of the role of GDNF in incubation of heroin craving (33Airavaara M. Pickens C.L. Stern A.L. Wihbey K.A. Harvey B.K. Bossert J.M. Liu Q.R. Hoffer B.J. Shaham Y. Addict. Biol. 2011; 16: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we found that the human GDNF gene contains more spliced ESTs in the University of California, Santa Cruz genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) than rat. We searched the human EST data base (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html) to identify additional human GDNF exons. We found human exons 1, 4, and 6 to be homologous to rat exons 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Using 0Sequencher software (Gene Code Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI), we identified additional human exons 2, 3, and 5 that are aligned to the EST clones and human GDNF genomic sequence. Human GDNF isoform nucleotide sequences were translated into amino acid sequences using the ExPASy translation tool (http://us.expasy.org/tools/dna.html), and the peptide sequences were aligned using ClustalW software (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/). In addition, we also identified a natural antisense gene (GDNFOS for GDNF opposite strand) transcribed from the antisense strand of GDNF gene by EST sequence alignments and Sanger sequencing (Eurofins, Huntsville, AL) of three IMAGE human cDNA clones. The pre-pro-GDNF domains and potential post-translational modification sites were identified by InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/). Based on the possible isoform differences between rat and human, the evolutionary analysis of the splicing junctions was carried out in UCSC syntenic genomic alignment using BLASTZ followed by chaining and netting pipeline (34Kent W.J.

The protein domains of potential ORF of GDNFOS3 were analyzed by ExPaSy proteomic tools (http://us.expasy.org/tools/#proteome). Post mortem MTG samples of controls, AD, and HD (supplemental Table S1, A and B) subjects were obtained from the Department of Pathology of the Division of Neuropathology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where diagnoses were all confirmed by autopsy (37Troncoso J.C. Cataldo A.M. Nixon R.A. Barnett J.L. Lee M.K. Checler F. Fowler D.R. Smialek J.E. Crain B. Martin L.J. Kawas C.H. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 43: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the samples were qualified for an exemption under 45 CFR 46.101 of the DHHS criteria. The RNA integrity of each sample was analyzed by the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit with Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Human brain and peripheral tissue cDNAs were synthesized using pooled total RNA purchased from Clontech. Human pancreas islets were obtained from the Integrated Islet Distribution Program (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–400 g; Charles River) were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly frozen in −50 °C isopentane solution and stored in a freezer at −80 °C. Tissue punches of the brain regions were taken from 1-mm coronal sections cut in a cryostat at −20 °C. The peripheral tissues were dissected on ice and immediately frozen by dry ice. The experimental procedures followed the guidelines of the Principles of Laboratory Care (National Institutes of Health publication 86-23, 1996) and were approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Animal Care and Use Committee (animal protocol number 07-BNRB-54). Total RNAs were isolated using the TRIzol reagent, and single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized using the Superscript III first strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). TaqMan probes (see Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S2) were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen) at the splicing junctions of the different human and rat GDNF and GDNFOS isoforms for RT-qPCR analysis. The rat endogenous control was Fam-labeled Ube2i (supplemental Table S2; synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). The human endogenous control was Fam-labeled β-actin (Applied Biosystems). The RT-qPCR assays were carried out with Advanced TaqMan® Fast Universal PCR Master Mix in a 7500 Fast TaqMan instrument (Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen) using a default thermo-cycling program. Technical duplicates and triplicates were carried out in the qPCR assays. Twenty human AD, 8 HD, and 19 and 8 control middle temporal gyrus samples for AD and HD (supplemental Table S1, A and B), respectively, were assayed to compare expression of human GDNF and GDNFOS isoforms. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of more than 36 represented very low mRNA levels and were therefore deleted from the analysis. Mann-Whitney U tests from Prizm software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) were used to analyze the RT-qPCR data. A polyclonal goat antibody for GDNF (AF-212-NA; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used for Western blot to detect GDNF mature peptide (33Airavaara M. Pickens C.L. Stern A.L. Wihbey K.A. Harvey B.K. Bossert J.M. Liu Q.R. Hoffer B.J. Shaham Y. Addict. Biol. 2011; 16: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We also tried commercially available GDNF antibodies of Santa Cruz Biotechnology B-8 (sc-13147), D-20 (sc-328; Santa Cruz, CA), MAB212 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and ANT-014 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Although those antibodies recognized purified recombinant GDNF dimer and monomer, none of them detected specific bands of the dimer (32 kDa) and monomer (16 kDa) in rat tissue extracts (supplemental Fig. S1A), whereas the goat GDNF antibody (AF-212-NA; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) recognized the specific GDNF dimer and monomer of rat tissue extracts (supplemental Fig. S1B). An affinity-purified anti-GDNFOS3 antibody was developed by injecting rabbit with epitope peptide (CKGMSHGQHFTHT) located at the C terminus (Genemed Synthesis, Inc., San Antonio, TX) and was used for Western blot of HEK293 and SH-SY5Y, CHO cell lines, and tissues of human and rat. The Western blocking solutions for GDNF and GDNFOS were 5 and 7.5% nonfat milk, respectively, to show the specific immunostainings. Student's t test was used to analyze the Western blot data. A search of the human dbEST data base followed by RT-qPCR analysis identified six exons in the human GDNF gene (Fig. 1A). A comparison with the rat GDNF gene structure reveals that three exons, human GDNF exons 1, 4-short, 4-long, and 6, are conserved with rat GDNF exons 1, 2-short, 2-long, and 3, respectively. The human GDNF exon 2, 3, and 5 sequences are aligned (Fig. 1) with human EST clones AJ001897, AJ001899, and DQ235474, respectively. The original translation initiation methionine of the GDNF is located in human exon 4. InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/) indicates that the GDNF isoform with exon 2 (Ex2_4L) 5The GDNF isoforms designations are as follows: Ex1_4S, GDNF isoform with inter-exon splicing of exon 1 to exon 4-short; Ex1_4L, GDNF isoform with inter-exon splicing of exon 1 to exon 4-long; Ex2_4L, GDNF isoform with inter-exon splicing of exon 2 to exon 4-long; Ex3_4S, GDNF isoform with inter-exon splicing of exon 3 to exon 4-short; Ex4S_5, GDNF isoform with inter-exon splicing of exon 4-short to exon 5; GDNF-αL, GDNF isoform with intra-exon splicing of exon 4-long; GDNF-βS, GDNF isoform with intra-exon splicing of exon 4-short. contains another initiation codon that translates into a 35-amino acid signal peptide in contrast to GDNF isoforms with exons 1 or 3 (Ex1_4S/L and Ex3_4S, respectively), each of which contains 18 amino acid signal peptides (supplemental Fig. S2). The insertion of human exon 5 between exons 4-short and 6 creates a truncated GDNF isoform (Ex4S_5) that potentially utilizes the downstream initiation methionine encoded by exon 6. The truncated GDNF isoform Ex4S_5 contains only 20 amino acids of the pro-region before the furin endoproteinase cleavage site, and InterProScan indicated that the 20-amino acid sequence is not a signal peptide. Therefore, human GDNF isoforms of Ex1_4L, Ex1_4S, Ex3_4S, Ex2_4L, and Ex4S_5 encode 211, 185, 185, 228, and 159 amino acids, respectively, and the peptide sequence differences among the isoforms are located in the pre-pro-regions of GDNF. All of the human GDNF isoforms encode the identical mature GDNF peptide (supplemental Fig. S2). We investigated human GDNF isoform expression patterns in brain regions and peripheral tissues using isoform-specific TaqMan-DNA minor grove binding protein probes (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S2). We used the human caudate hGDNF-βS mRNA as a reference. The human hGDNF-αL mRNA levels were highest in intestine, kidney, pancreatic islet, caudate, and putamen, whereas the hGDNF-βS mRNA levels were highest in intestine and kidney (Table 1).TABLE 1Human GDF isoform expression using hGDNF-βS in caudate as a referenceIsoformCAUPUTNACSNRCTXAMGHIPHTHISLINTKIDMUSEx1_4S/L4.565.472.361.971.490.991.392.198.0417.8817.010.54Ex2_4LaPrimate-specific isoforms.0.470.280.940.450.500.060.110.1212.350.630.770Ex3_4SaPrimate-specific isoforms.0000000000.240.560Ex4S_5aPrimate-specific isoforms.00.390.2600.290.3500.4000.5200hGDNF-αL50.6335.3519.1721.7210.823.677.334.8986.5640.4730.410.15hGDNF-βS11.470.760.510.560.490.410.501.067.294.310.11Ratio α:β50.624.125.242.619.37.517.99.881.75.67.11.4a Primate-specific isoforms. Open table in a new tab RT-qPCR showed that the human GDNF exon 1 (Ex1_4L/S) transcript level is highest in brain and peripheral tissues except for pancreatic islets where exon 2 (Ex2_4L) transcript is higher. The exon 3 (Ex3_4S) transcript was not found in most tissues except for low levels in intestine and kidney. The exon 5 (Ex4S_5) transcript was either not detected or was at very low levels in putaman, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and intestine (Table 1). The ratios of the human GDNF α-long and β-short isoforms were generally higher in brain regions (except hypothalamus and amygdala) and pancreatic islets than the ratios of α-long and β-short in peripheral tissues (Table 1). Using specific TaqMan probes for rGDNF-αL and rGDNF-βS isoforms (supplemental Table S2) and for reference the rGDNF-βS in rat dorsal striatum, we found that mRNA for rGDNF-αL was expressed severalfold higher than that of the rGDNF-βS across brain regions and peripheral tissues. The highest mRNA expressions were in dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, ovary, lung, and stomach, and lower levels were in prefrontal cortex and amygdala (Table 2). Interestingly, the human α-long and β-short ratios are several folds higher than rat α-long and β-short ratios (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Because the long pre-(α)long proGDNF isoform contains the dopamine neuron-stimulating peptide-11 (DNSP-11) (38Bradley L.H. Fuqua J. Richardson A. Turchan-Cholewo J. Ai Y. Kelps K.A. Glass J.D. He X.

Pickens C.L. Stern A.L. Wihbey K.A. Harvey B.K. Bossert J.M. Liu Q.R. Hoffer B.J. Shaham Y. Addict. Biol. 2011; 16: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We found that levels of mature GDNF monomer were higher in ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala; lower in hippocampus CA1, CA2 and dentate gyrus than in other brain regions. We also found the levels of the monomer were higher in muscle and testis than in other peripheral tissues (Fig. 2). The 32-kDa band was observed in rat heart, lung, and spleen, and the 48-kDa band was observed in heart, muscle, and stomach. Because the Western blots were carried out in the same conditions for both brain and peripheral tissues, the formation of GDNF oligomerization could be stronger in peripheral tissues than that of brain (Fig. 2B in reduced and supplemental Fig. S1B in nonreduced conditions). Western blot analysis showed that GDNF peptide levels did not correlate with mRNA levels in brain regions where the striatal levels were several times higher than that of prefrontal cortex. The discordance between GDNF mRNA and the mature peptide in different brain regions could be due to cell type-specific expression of GDNF isoforms and transportation of mature peptide along neuronal processes (40Wang J. Carnicella S. Ahmadiantehrani S. He D.Y. Barak S. Kharazia V. Ben Hamida S. Zapata A. Shippenberg T.S. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14502-14512Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By searching the human dbEST data base followed by RT-qPCR analysis and sequencing of the IMAGE cDNA clones, a cis-natural antisense transcript (GDNFOS) gene was identified from the opposite strand of GDNF (Fig. 1A). The GDNFOS gene contains four exons and three initiation sites for transcription, i.e. exon 1, exon 2-long, and exon 3-long for GDNFOS1, GDNFOS2, and GDNFOS3, respectively (Fig. 1B). The first exon of the GDNFOS1 isoform has 136 nucleotides of reverse complementarity (head-to-head configuration) (25Zhang Y. Liu X.S. Liu Q.R. Wei L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3465-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to the 5′-UTR of the GDNF isoform Ex1_4L/S (Fig. 1A). Exon 1 of the GDNFOS1 isoform is spliced to the exon 2-short, exon 3-short (intra-exonal splicing events), and exon 4-short (alternative poly adenylation event). Exon 2-long of GDNFOS2 isoform is spliced to exon 3-short and exon 4-short. Exon 3-long of GDNFOS3 isoform is spliced to exon 4-long (alternative poly adenylation event; Fig. 1B). The GDNFOS2 and GDNFOS3 transcripts do not overlap with the GDNF sense transcripts. IMAGE clones of 277201, 1762317, and 1637129 were sequenced in two directions to obtain the sequences of GDNFOS1, GDNFOS2, and GDNFOS3 (GenBankTM accession numbers JF824130, JF824131, and JF824129, respectively). GDNFOS1 and GDNFOS2 IMAGE clones contain the upstream poly(A) site to produce 618- and 2,944-bp transcripts, respectively. GDNFOS1 and GDNFOS2 are predicted long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (41Lipovich L. Johnson R. Lin C.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 597-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), with no ORF of more than 60 amino acids. The GDNFOS3 IMAGE clone contains the downstream alternative adenylation site to produce a 1,963-bp transcript that potentially encodes an ORF of 105 amino acids (Fig. 3). The calculated molecular mass and isoelectric point of the ORF are 11.86 kDa and pI = 8.47, respectively. The proteome and pathway analysis found that the ORF contains an N-terminal 28-amino acid signal peptide, an internal asparagine-glycosylation site, two cysteines, an endoplastic reticulum targeting sequence (Predotar, http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html) and in a secreted pathway (Secretome 2.0 server, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP/). There is a single furin-type cleavage site after the signal peptide between residues 28 and 29, and the mature peptide contains interface amino acids of Pro, Ile, Tyr, Trp, and Arg involved in protein-protein interactions (42Sillerud L.O. Larson R.S. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 151-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The exon-intron junctions of human GDNFOS are conserved at splicing donor (GT) and acceptor (AG) sites, and the first large intron (31,778 bp) is followed by small introns of 959 and 436 bp for intron 2 and 3, respectively. A TaqMan probe (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S2) was designed at the splicing junction of GDNFOS gene exons 1 and 2 to investigate the tissue expression patterns of the GDNFOS1 transcript. The highest mRNA levels of GDNFOS1 were found in kidney, ovary, and testis, where GDNFOS1 mRNA is more than 10-fold of that of brain caudate region; higher expression was also observed in cerebellum and nucleus accumbens relative to other brain areas (Fig. 4A). The transcriptional level of GDNFOS1 is lower than that of GDNF isoform Ex1_4L in all brain regions (data not shown). The affinity-purified antibody against the C-terminal peptide (CKGMSHGQHFTHT) of GDNFOS3 recognized a 35-kDa band in Western blot (7.5% dry milk blocking solution) of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and MTG but not in SH-SY5Y and CHO cell lines, rat kidney, and prefrontal cortex (Fig. 4B, left panel). The 35-kDa band could be blocked in HEK293 and MTG by preincubation of the antibody with the antigenic peptide (Fig. 4B, right panel). The 35- and 30-kDa bands might be glycosylated or oligomeric"
https://openalex.org/W2086121216,"It is well regarded that insulin receptor signaling in the liver is key to proper metabolic control. Reza Zarnegar and his colleagues now show that the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, Met, physically interacts with the insulin receptor signaling complex, potentiating the latter's signaling. They also show that Met signaling restores insulin responsiveness in a mouse model of insulin resistance, suggesting a potentially new therapeutic avenue to treat prediabetes. Met is the transmembrane tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is structurally related to the insulin receptor (INSR) tyrosine kinase. Here we report that the HGF-Met axis regulates metabolism by stimulating hepatic glucose uptake and suppressing hepatic glucose output. We show that Met is essential for an optimal hepatic insulin response by directly engaging INSR to form a Met-INSR hybrid complex, which culminates in a robust signal output. We also found that the HGF-Met system restores insulin responsiveness in a mouse model of insulin refractoriness. These results provide new insights into the molecular basis of hepatic insulin resistance and suggest that HGF may have therapeutic potential for type 2 diabetes in the clinical setting."

https://openalex.org/W2079322519,"In the kidney, bulk reabsorption of filtered proteins occurs in the proximal tubule via receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME) through the multiligand receptor complex megalin-cubilin. Other mechanisms and nephron sites for RME of proteins are unclear. Recently, the secreted protein 24p3 (lipocalin-2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)), which is expressed in the distal nephron, has been identified as a sensitive biomarker of kidney damage. A high-affinity receptor for 24p3 (24p3R) that is involved in endocytotic iron delivery has also been cloned. We investigated the localization of 24p3R in rodent kidney and its role in RME of protein-metal complexes and albumin. Immunostaining of kidney tissue showed expression of 24p3R in apical membranes of distal tubules and collecting ducts, but not of proximal tubule. The differential expression of 24p3R in these nephron segments was confirmed in the respective cell lines. CHO cells transiently transfected with 24p3R or distal tubule cells internalized submicromolar concentrations of fluorescence-coupled proteins transferrin, albumin, or metallothionein (MT) as well as the toxic cadmium-MT (Cd2+(7)-MT) complex, which caused cell death. Uptake of MT or transferrin and Cd2+(7)-MT toxicity were prevented by picomolar concentrations of 24p3. An EC50 of 123±50 nM was determined for binding of MT to 24p3R by microscale thermophoresis. Hence, 24p3R binds proteins filtered by the kidney with high affinity and may contribute to RME of proteins, including 24p3, and to Cd2+(7)-MT toxicity in distal nephron segments."

https://openalex.org/W2070417148,"Glycosyltransferases (Gtfs) catalyze the formation of a diverse array of glycoconjugates. Small-molecule inhibitors to manipulate Gtf activity in cells have long been sought as tools for understanding Gtf function. Success has been limited because of challenges in designing inhibitors that mimic the negatively charged diphosphate substrates. Here we report the mechanism of action of a small molecule that inhibits O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), an essential human enzyme that modulates cell signaling pathways by catalyzing a unique intracellular post-translational modification, β-O-GlcNAcylation. The molecule contains a five-heteroatom dicarbamate core that functions as a neutral diphosphate mimic. One dicarbamate carbonyl reacts with an essential active site lysine that anchors the diphosphate of the nucleotide-sugar substrate. A nearby cysteine then reacts with the lysine adduct to form a carbonyl crosslink in the OGT active site. Though this unprecedented double-displacement mechanism reflects the unique architecture of the OGT active site, related dicarbamate scaffolds may inhibit other enzymes that bind nucleotide-containing substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2019100231,"Although metabolic networks have been reconstructed on a genome scale, the corresponding reconstruction and integration of governing transcriptional regulatory networks has not been fully achieved. Here we reconstruct such an integrated network for amino acid metabolism in Escherichia coli. Analysis of ChIP-chip and gene expression data for the transcription factors ArgR, Lrp and TrpR showed that 19 out of 20 amino acid biosynthetic pathways are either directly or indirectly controlled by these regulators. Classifying the regulated genes into three functional categories of transport, biosynthesis and metabolism leads to the elucidation of regulatory motifs that constitute the integrated network's basic building blocks. The regulatory logic of these motifs was determined on the basis of relationships between transcription factor binding and changes in the amount of transcript in response to exogenous amino acids. Remarkably, the resulting logic shows how amino acids are differentiated as signaling and nutrient molecules, revealing the overarching regulatory principles of the amino acid stimulon."

A central challenge in genetics is to predict phenotypic variation from individual genome sequences. Here we construct and evaluate phenotypic predictions for 19 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We use conservation-based methods to predict the impact of protein-coding variation within genes on protein function. We then rank strains using a prediction score that measures the total sum of function-altering changes in different sets of genes reported to influence over 100 phenotypes in genome-wide loss-of-function screens. We evaluate our predictions by comparing them with the observed growth rate and efficiency of 15 strains tested across 20 conditions in quantitative experiments. The median predictive performance, as measured by ROC AUC, was 0.76, and predictions were more accurate when the genes reported to influence a trait were highly connected in a functional gene network."

However, the exact mechanisms for p53 transcriptional activation through RPs are not well understood. We show that the RPL11 is rapidly but transiently recruited at promoter sites of p53-regulated genes upon nucleolar stress induced by actinomycin D (ActD). Characterisation of molecular events at p53 promoter sites shows that L11 is required for the recruitment of p53 transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP and p53 K382 acetylation. We found that direct binding to Mdm2 E3 ligase and NEDDylation of L11 are critical regulators for L11 promoter recruitment. Our data suggest that binding of L11 to Mdm2 at the promoter results in relief from Mdm2-mediated transcriptional repression of p53. Analysis of chromatin and RNA polymerase II markers suggests that L11 is involved in the initiation step of transcriptional activation. Furthermore, analysis of 36 ActD-induced genes shows that L11 and NEDD8 are global regulators of the p53 activation response. The studies provide insights on how nucleolar stress through L11 and NEDD8 can activate the transcriptional activity of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2167973594,"Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) is a well-studied oncogene for its role in tumorigenesis and serves as a marker of malignancy in several cancer types including lung. In the present study, we defined the role of PTTG in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, cell migration and induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the regulation of integrin αVβ3–FAK (focal adhesion kinase) signaling pathway. Overexpression of PTTG through an adenovirus vector resulted in a significant increase in the expression of integrins αV and β3, a process that was reversed with the downregulation of PTTG expression through the use of an adenovirus expressing PTTG-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). Western blot analysis of cells infected with adenovirus PTTG cDNA resulted in increased FAK and enhanced expression of adhesion complex molecules paxillin, metavincullin, and talin. Furthermore, downstream signaling genes Rac1, RhoA, Cdc42 and DOCK180 showed upregulation upon PTTG overexpression. This process was dependent on integrin αV, as blockage by antagonist echistatin (RGD peptide) or αV-specific siRNA resulted in a decrease in FAK and subsequent adhesion molecules. Actin cytoskeleton disruption was detected as a result of integrin-FAK signaling by PTTG as well as enhanced cell motility. Taken together, our results suggest for the first time an important role of PTTG in regulation of integrins αV and β3 and adhesion-complex proteins leading to induction of EMT."

IntroductionPost-translational modification of proteins is central to regulating their stability and activity. One such modification, ubiquitination, involves the attachment of a 76-amino acid ubiquitin (Ub) 4The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinDUBdeubiquitinating enzymeMBPmaltose-binding proteinRIRRING1-in between RING-RING2SCA3spinocerebellar cerebellar ataxia 3UIMubiquitin interacting motifUblubiquitin-like motifUBALUb-aldehydeMJDMachado-Joseph diseaseDTSSP3,3′-dithio(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate). moiety to a protein via an isopeptide linkage that is formed between the C-terminal glycine of Ub and the ϵ-amino acid side chain of a lysine (Lys) residue within the target protein (1Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Conjugation of Ub to a protein is a multistep process, requiring the concerted activities of three distinct families of enzymes. The first step involves the activation of Ub by the E1 Ub-activating enzyme in an ATP-dependent manner, with the formation of a Ub thioester complex between the active site cysteine within the E1 and the C-terminal glycine of Ub. For Ub, two E1 Ub-activating enzymes, Ube1 and UBA6 (3Pelzer C. Kassner I. Matentzoglu K. Singh R.K. Wollscheid H.P. Scheffner M. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol.

Sci. 2008; 33: 230-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), can interact with E2 Ub-conjugating enzymes, of which there are ∼38 in humans (5Ye Y. Rape M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of an E2·Ub thioester complex. Finally, the E2 thioester interacts with its respective E3 Ub-ligase, which in turn directs Ub onto the target protein. There are two main classes of E3 Ub-ligases: HECT and RING-domain containing E3s. The human genome encodes upwards of 600 predicted RING Ub-ligases, ∼30 HECT Ub-ligases, and a smaller subset of non-HECT, non-RING E3s (i.e. U-box or zinc finger E3s). The RING domain provides a scaffold through which the E3 interacts with the E2-Ub, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from the E2 onto the substrate protein. In contrast, HECT E3s contain an active site cysteine that receives the Ub directly from the E2, which can then be transferred onto the substrate protein (6de Bie P. Ciechanover A. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition to being conjugated to a lysine residue within a target protein, each of the 7 lysine residues within Ub can serve as an acceptor for the next Ub, leading to the formation of isopeptide-linked Ub chains. Lys48-linked chains are the best studied of the isopeptide-linked chains and direct proteins to the proteasome where they are subsequently degraded. However, Ub chains can be linked through one of the other six lysine residues within Ub, with such chains playing important roles in many cellular processes, including DNA repair, receptor signaling, and endocytosis (7Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 8Li W. Ye Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2397-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).E3 Ub-ligases are central in determining the manner in which Ub chains are assembled on substrate proteins and, typically, E3 ligases can regulate their own activity and stability via self-ubiquitination. MDM2 is a classical example of a RING E3 ligase that can mediate the conjugation of Lys48-linked Ub chains on itself. As a result, MDM2 promotes its own targeting to the proteasome for degradation (9Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). However, for certain E3s, such as BRCA1 and RING1b, attachment of Ub conjugates does not appear to affect stability. Rather, these RING E3s conjugate non-Lys48 linked chains on themselves. BRCA1 mediates the formation of Lys6-linked Ub chains (10Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Mallery D.L. Vandenberg C.J. Hiom K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6755-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas RING1b adds a mix of Lys6, Lys27, and Lys48 linked chains (12Ben-Saadon R. Zaaroor D. Ziv T. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), resulting in enhanced activity for both E3s to ubiquitinate histone proteins.Although self-ubiquitination can affect both the activity and stability of an E3, it is also reversible. Indeed, another distinct group of enzymes, collectively called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) can counteract the activity of E3 Ub-ligases. Although there is one family of metalloprotease-type DUBs, the majority of DUBs are cysteine proteases that can be subdivided into four subclasses based on their Ub-protease domain: Ub C-terminal hydrolases, otubain proteases, Ub-specific proteases, and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) proteases. Three broad functions exist for the DUB enzymes: 1) processing mature Ub precursor proteins to generate free Ub; 2) catalyzing the removal of a Ub from a ubiquitinated substrate; and 3) facilitating the removal of Ub and the subsequent transfer and degradation of a protein through the proteasome (13Nijman S.M.

Moreover, many DUBs function in partnership with specific E3 ligases. One such E3:DUB pair is MDM2:USP7, with MDM2 being stabilized by USP7-mediated deubiquitination (14Li M. Brooks C.L. Kon N. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 879-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In contrast, Usp7 can act in partnership with the E6-AP RING-ligase to catalyze the removal of Ub conjugates from RING1b, with E6-AP mediating the attachment of Lys48-linked Ub conjugates that promote the proteasomal degradation of RING1b (15de Bie P. Zaaroor-Regev D. Ciechanover A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 400: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although most characterized DUBs have been reported to function via their Ub-protease activity, in some cases DUBs can inhibit ubiquitination and degradation of substrates independent of their catalytic activity (16Nakada S.

Kontogiannea M. Thorarinsdottir T. Fallon L. Williams A.J. Djarmati A. Fantaneanu T. Paulson H.L. Fon E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutations in SCA3, the gene encoding ataxin-3, cause MJD, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia-3 (SCA3) (20Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama S. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. et al.Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), the most common autosomal dominant inherited ataxia worldwide. Mutations in the Parkin gene are responsible for ∼50% of early onset Parkinson disease cases (21Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Moreover, patients with SCA3 have been reported to present with parkinsonian symptoms further supporting the disease relevance of the interaction between parkin and ataxin-3 (22Klein C. Schneider S.A. Lang A.E. Mov. Disord. 2009; 24: 2042-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We found that ataxin-3 can deubiquitinate parkin directly in vitro and can reduce the extent of parkin ubiquitination in cells. Furthermore, the MJD-associated, polyglutamine (poly(Q))-expanded mutant form of ataxin-3 promotes parkin degradation by the autophagy pathway. However, the precise mechanism involved in ataxin-3-mediated deubiquitination of parkin remains largely unknown.In the current study, we find that ataxin-3 is unable to hydrolyze preassembled Ub conjugates on parkin. Rather, ataxin-3 appears to edit Ub conjugates as they are being attached to parkin. The mechanism involves stabilizing the parkin·E2 complex and redirecting the transfer of Ub from the E2 onto ataxin-3 rather than onto parkin. Both in vitro and in cells, the process requires the active site cysteine of parkin-bound ataxin-3. Taken together, the work reveals a novel mode of coupling between the respective activities within a E2·E3·DUB complex to fine-tune the overall extent of ubiquitination.DISCUSSIONIn the course of characterizing the interaction between parkin and ataxin-3, we identified a novel mechanism explaining how ataxin-3 regulates parkin ubiquitination. We find that ataxin-3 was unable to hydrolyze previously assembled Ub conjugates on parkin (Fig. 2), yet could regulate the assembly of newly forming Ub conjugates on parkin (Fig. 3). We considered the notion that ataxin-3 may inhibit the attachment of these new Ub conjugates on parkin by antagonizing the E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, an essential component of the ubiquitination cascade. Indeed, ataxin-3 not only bound the E2-conjugating enzyme directly (Fig. 4), but mediated a reduction in the levels of charged E2-Ub thioester, in a strictly parkin-dependent manner (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the reduction in the levels of the E2-Ub thioester conjugate appeared to coincide with the appearance of a monoubiquitinated species of ataxin-3. This monoubiquitinated species of ataxin-3 was also observed in cells. Moreover, in cells, parkin-bound ataxin-3 stabilized the interaction between the E2 and parkin, likely resulting in the formation of an E2·parkin·ataxin-3 complex. Mutation of the active site cysteine in ataxin-3 not only abolished the interaction between ataxin-3 and E2, it also prevented both the monoubiquitination of ataxin-3 and the formation of a stable complex between parkin and E2. From these findings, we now propose a model whereby ataxin-3 stabilizes the association between E2 and parkin, thereby impeding the release of the uncharged E2, whereas in parallel diverting the Ub from the E2-Ub thioester conjugate onto itself, and away from parkin (Fig. 7).Ataxin-3 Deubiquitinates Parkin in an Unconventional MannerEven though our model outlines an unconventional mechanism for a DUB to deubiquitinate a substrate protein, it is not unprecedented. The classical mechanism used by the majority of DUBs to deubiquitinate a cognate substrate requires their intrinsic hydrolase activity. However, certain DUBs can mediate the deubiquitination of their substrate independently of their DUB activity. One example is Usp13, a DUB that possesses a Ub-binding domain allowing it to interact directly with the RING E3 Ub-ligase SIAH1, blocking the ability of SIAH1 to ubiquitinate itself (18Scortegagna M. Subtil T. Qi J. Kim H. Zhao W. Gu W. Kluger H. Ronai Z.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27333-27341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In a separate study, the DUB OTUB1 interacted directly with the E2 Ubc13, suppressing the activity of the Ubc13/uev1 to form Ub chains and preventing RNF168 from ubiquitinating its cognate substrate in the DNA-damage response pathway (16Nakada S. Tai I. Panier S. Al-Hakim A. Iemura S. Juang Y.C. O'Donnell L. Kumakubo A. Munro M. Sicheri F. Gingras A.C. Natsume T. Suda T. Durocher D. Nature. 2010; 466: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).However, one stark contrast between ataxin-3 and these two DUBs is that ataxin-3 requires the presence of its active site cysteine to impede parkin self-ubiquitination (Fig. 1A). Mutation of the active site cysteine to a serine in OTUB1 and Usp13 had no effect on the ability of both DUBs to inhibit the ligase activity of RNF168 and SIAH1, respectively. Inactivation of ataxin-3 by mutating its active site cysteine to a serine abolishes the activity of ataxin-3 toward parkin (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, inactive ataxin-3 was not monoubiquitinated in our assays (Figs. 5A and 6A), nor did it stabilize the binding between parkin and the E2 (Fig. 6A). Thus, when cysteine 14 is mutated to a serine, ataxin-3 can no longer redirect the Ub from the E2-Ub thioester away from parkin (Fig. 5A) onto itself, whereas at the same time being unable to interact with and stabilize the binding of the E2 to parkin (Figs. 4A and 6A).Model of Ataxin-3-mediated Deubiquitination of Actively Ubiquitinating ParkinFrom our findings, we propose a model whereby ataxin-3 reduces the ability of parkin to ubiquitinate itself by: 1) promoting the retention of the E2 on parkin, thus reducing the efficiency with which it undergoes successive rounds of charging and release of ubiquitin onto substrate, and by 2) diverting the Ub from the E2 within the parkin·E2·ataxin-3 complex away from parkin and onto ataxin-3. Together, these effects reduce the efficiency of parkin ubiquitination (Fig. 7). From our in vitro data, it is clear that, in the presence of parkin, ataxin-3 redirects the Ub in the E2·Ub complex away from parkin and onto itself, in a manner dependent on its active site cysteine (Figs. 5A and 6). How could ataxin-3 divert the Ub onto itself in the presence of parkin? We have considered two distinct scenarios that may explain our findings. In the first scenario, C14 within ataxin-3 interacts directly with the Ub-thioester when the E2 is bound to parkin, and directs Ub onto a lysine within ataxin-3 and away from parkin. Alternatively, instead of acquiring the Ub directly from the E2, parkin might mediate the transfer of Ub onto ataxin-3. A recent study suggests that RBR-type E3-ligases such as parkin function as hybrids of RING- and HECT-type ligases, with the E2 transferring the Ub onto a cysteine within one of their RING domains to form an E3-Ub thioester, before the Ub is transferred to a lysine within the E3 (24Wenzel D.M. Lissounov A. Brzovic P.S. Klevit R.E. Nature. 2011; 474: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In this scenario an intermediate parkin-Ub thioester conjugate might be involved in transferring Ub onto a lysine within ataxin-3.In addition to directing the Ub from the E2 onto itself, ataxin-3 can also promote the formation of a stable complex between the E2 and parkin (Fig. 6A). By keeping the E2 bound to parkin, ataxin-3 can impede the recharging of the E2 to form a new E2-Ub thioester conjugate, whereas at the same time preventing the association of parkin with newly charged E2-Ub from the free pool. Studies with other E3-ligases demonstrate clearly that dissociation of the uncharged E2 from the E3 is an essential step for the E2 to become charged again (30Eletr Z.M. Huang D.T. Duda D.M. Schulman B.A. Kuhlman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 933-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). If the E2 remains bound to the E3, it is unable to interact with the E1 Ub-activating enzyme and become recharged. The cycling between binding and dissociating from parkin not only maintains the available pool of free E2 that can be charged with a Ub, but helps provide parkin with a constant pool of charged Ub that can be directed toward the assembly of Ub chains.Consistent with the notion that ataxin-3 may affect the charging of the E2, a reduction in the levels of E2-Ub was noted in the presence of parkin (Fig. 5, A and C). However, as the reaction proceeded over longer times, levels of the E2-Ub returned to normal (supplemental Fig. S4). We speculate that the initial reduction in levels of the E2-Ub thioester conjugate (Fig. 5, A and C) is a direct result of the Ub being diverted onto ataxin-3, with ataxin-3 retaining the E2 on parkin (Fig. 6A), thus preventing its release and subsequent recharging. Moreover, the retention of the E2 on parkin may also be acting as a barrier preventing newly charged free E2-Ub from associating with and conjugating Ub onto parkin. Taken together, we present evidence for a novel mechanism through which ataxin-3 diverts the Ub from the E2·Ub thioester complex away from parkin and onto itself, thereby counteracting the ability of parkin to ubiquitinate itself.Implications for Parkin Activity and Other DUBsPrior to this study, ataxin-3 was considered a classical DUB. It was demonstrated to hydrolyze both free Ub chains and Ub conjugates from the U-box E3 CHIP, another recently identified substrate for ataxin-3 (31Winborn B.J. Travis S.M. Todi S.V. Scaglione K.M.

Cell. 2011; 43: 599-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, by deubiquitinating CHIP, ataxin-3 regulates the ligase activity of CHIP, whereas at the same time trimming newly forming Ub chains on CHIP substrates. Through these actions, ataxin-3 promotes the termination of the CHIP-mediated ubiquitination reaction, whereas preventing excessive ubiquitination by CHIP of its cognate substrate (32Scaglione K.M. Zavodszky E. Todi S.V. Patury S. Xu P. Rodríguez-Lebrón E. Fischer S. Konen J. Djarmati A. Peng J. Gestwicki J.E. Paulson H.L. Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 599-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast, ataxin-3 appears to use a distinct mechanism, not previously observed for other DUBs, to regulate the activity of parkin. What advantages might such a mechanism offer over a more conventional mode of deubiquitination as described for CHIP (32Scaglione K.M. Zavodszky E. Todi S.V. Patury S. Xu P. Rodríguez-Lebrón E. Fischer S. Konen J. Djarmati A. Peng J. Gestwicki J.E. Paulson H.L. Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 599-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)? In our previous study, we demonstrated that wild-type ataxin-3 had no effect on parkin stability (19Durcan T.M. Kontogiannea M. Thorarinsdottir T. Fallon L. Williams A.J. Djarmati A. Fantaneanu T. Paulson H.L. Fon E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that ataxin-3 regulates the activity of parkin within the cell. Recently, parkin has been demonstrated to interact with and promote the clearance of mitochondria that have lost their membrane potential (33Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar). This was accompanied by an increase in parkin self-ubiquitination and ubiquitination of mitochondrial associated proteins (34Geisler S. Holmström K.M. Skujat D. Fiesel F.C. Rothfuss O.C. Kahle P.J. Springer W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar, 35Chan N.C. Salazar A.M. Pham A.H. Sweredoski M.J. Kolawa N.J. Graham R.L. Hess S. Chan D.C. Hum. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1367-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). As parkin plays a central role in this and other cell stress pathways, ataxin-3-mediated deubiquitination might therefore be involved in inhibiting parkin activity until the appropriate cellular cue is triggered. In the context of MJD, the expansion of the poly(Q) tract within ataxin-3 may antagonize its ability to regulate parkin activity, leading to a disruption of the parkin mitochondrial quality control pathway and other cell stress pathways. If indeed the inappropriate regulation of parkin promotes neuronal cell loss in MJD, then targeting parkin E3 Ub-ligase activity could represent an exciting therapeutic target in the future. IntroductionPost-translational modification of proteins is central to regulating their stability and activity. One such modification, ubiquitination, involves the attachment of a 76-amino acid ubiquitin (Ub) 4The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinDUBdeubiquitinating enzymeMBPmaltose-binding proteinRIRRING1-in between RING-RING2SCA3spinocerebellar cerebellar ataxia 3UIMubiquitin interacting motifUblubiquitin-like motifUBALUb-aldehydeMJDMachado-Joseph diseaseDTSSP3,3′-dithio(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate). moiety to a protein via an isopeptide linkage that is formed between the C-terminal glycine of Ub and the ϵ-amino acid side chain of a lysine (Lys) residue within the target protein (1Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Eddins M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Conjugation of Ub to a protein is a multistep process, requiring the concerted activities of three distinct families of enzymes. The first step involves the activation of Ub by the E1 Ub-activating enzyme in an ATP-dependent manner, with the formation of a Ub thioester complex between the active site cysteine within the E1 and the C-terminal glycine of Ub. For Ub, two E1 Ub-activating enzymes, Ube1 and UBA6 (3Pelzer C. Kassner I. Matentzoglu K. Singh R.K. Wollscheid H.P. Scheffner M. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of an E2·Ub thioester complex. Finally, the E2 thioester interacts with its respective E3 Ub-ligase, which in turn directs Ub onto the target protein. There are two main classes of E3 Ub-ligases: HECT and RING-domain containing E3s. The human genome encodes upwards of 600 predicted RING Ub-ligases, ∼30 HECT Ub-ligases, and a smaller subset of non-HECT, non-RING E3s (i.e. U-box or zinc finger E3s). The RING domain provides a scaffold through which the E3 interacts with the E2-Ub, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from the E2 onto the substrate protein. In contrast, HECT E3s contain an active site cysteine that receives the Ub directly from the E2, which can then be transferred onto the substrate protein (6de Bie P. Ciechanover A. Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition to being conjugated to a lysine residue within a target protein, each of the 7 lysine residues within Ub can serve as an acceptor for the next Ub, leading to the formation of isopeptide-linked Ub chains. Lys48-linked chains are the best studied of the isopeptide-linked chains and direct proteins to the proteasome where they are subsequently degraded. However, Ub chains can be linked through one of the other six lysine residues within Ub, with such chains playing important roles in many cellular processes, including DNA repair, receptor signaling, and endocytosis (7Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 8Li W. Ye Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2397-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).E3 Ub-ligases are central in determining the manner in which Ub chains are assembled on substrate proteins and, typically, E3 ligases can regulate their own activity and stability via self-ubiquitination. MDM2 is a classical example of a RING E3 ligase that can mediate the conjugation of Lys48-linked Ub chains on itself. As a result, MDM2 promotes its own targeting to the proteasome for degradation (9Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). However, for certain E3s, such as BRCA1 and RING1b, attachment of Ub conjugates does not appear to affect stability. Rather, these RING E3s conjugate non-Lys48 linked chains on themselves. BRCA1 mediates the formation of Lys6-linked Ub chains (10Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Mallery D.L. Vandenberg C.J. Hiom K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6755-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), whereas RING1b adds a mix of Lys6, Lys27, and Lys48 linked chains (12Ben-Saadon R. Zaaroor D. Ziv T. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), resulting in enhanced activity for both E3s to ubiquitinate histone proteins.Although self-ubiquitination can affect both the activity and stability of an E3, it is also reversible. Indeed, another distinct group of enzymes, collectively called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) can counteract the activity of E3 Ub-ligases. Although there is one family of metalloprotease-type DUBs, the majority of DUBs are cysteine proteases that can be subdivided into four subclasses based on their Ub-protease domain: Ub C-terminal hydrolases, otubain proteases, Ub-specific proteases, and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) proteases. Three broad functions exist for the DUB enzymes: 1) processing mature Ub precursor proteins to generate free Ub; 2) catalyzing the removal of a Ub from a ubiquitinated substrate; and 3) facilitating the removal of Ub and the subsequent transfer and degradation of a protein through the proteasome (13Nijman S.M.

Moreover, many DUBs function in partnership with specific E3 ligases. One such E3:DUB pair is MDM2:USP7, with MDM2 being stabilized by USP7-mediated deubiquitination (14Li M. Brooks C.L. Kon N. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 879-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In contrast, Usp7 can act in partnership with the E6-AP RING-ligase to catalyze the removal of Ub conjugates from RING1b, with E6-AP mediating the attachment of Lys48-linked Ub conjugates that promote the proteasomal degradation of RI"

https://openalex.org/W1996200050,"Raf kinase activity is deregulated in cancers and is thought to promote tumor growth by inducing proliferation signaling through MEK/Erk. This report identifies a new role for c-Raf independent of MEK/Erk and relying on phosphorylation of Ser338. Phospho–C-Raf interacts with the mitotic kinases Aurora-A and Plk1, activating the latter to promote mitotic progression and increase cell division, and this pathway is a crucial mediator for the protumorigenic effect of c-Raf in vivo. RAF kinases regulate cell proliferation and survival and can be dysregulated in tumors1,2. The role of RAF in cell proliferation has been linked to its ability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK). Here we identify a MEK-independent role for RAF in tumor growth. Specifically, in mitotic cells, CRAF becomes phosphorylated on Ser338 and localizes to the mitotic spindle of proliferating tumor cells in vitro as well as in murine tumor models and in biopsies from individuals with cancer. Treatment of tumors with allosteric inhibitors, but not ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors, prevents CRAF phosphorylation on Ser338 and localization to the mitotic spindle and causes cell-cycle arrest at prometaphase. Furthermore, we identify phospho-Ser338 CRAF as a potential biomarker for tumor progression and a surrogate marker for allosteric RAF blockade. Mechanistically, CRAF, but not BRAF, associates with Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) at the centrosomes and spindle poles during G2/M. Indeed, allosteric or genetic inhibition of phospho-Ser338 CRAF impairs Plk1 activation and accumulation at the kinetochores, causing prometaphase arrest, whereas a phospho-mimetic Ser338D CRAF mutant potentiates Plk1 activation, mitosis and tumor progression in mice. These findings show a previously undefined role for RAF in tumor progression beyond the RAF-MEK-ERK paradigm, opening new avenues for targeting RAF in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2092957099,"The NF-κB transcription factor has a central role in diverse processes, including inflammation, proliferation and cell survival, and its activity is dysregulated in diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer. We recently identified the TRE17/ubiquitin-specific protease 6 (USP6) oncogene as the first de-ubiquitinating enzyme to activate NF-κB. TRE17/USP6 is translocated and overexpressed in aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), a pediatric tumor characterized by extensive bone degradation and inflammatory recruitment. In the current study, we explore the mechanism by which TRE17 induces activation of NF-κB, and find that it activates the classical NF-κB pathway through an atypical mechanism that does not involve IκB degradation. TRE17 co-precipitates with IκB kinase (IKK), and IKK activity is augmented in stable cell lines overexpressing TRE17, in a USP-dependent manner. Optimal activation of NF-κB by TRE17 requires both catalytic subunits of IKK, distinguishing its mechanism from the classical and non-canonical pathways, which require either IKKβ or IKKα, respectively. TRE17 stimulates phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536, a modification that has been associated with enhanced transcriptional activity and nuclear retention. Induction of S536 phosphorylation by TRE17 requires both IKKα and IKKβ, as well as the IKKγ/NEMO regulatory subunit of IKK. We further demonstrate that TRE17(long) is highly tumorigenic when overexpressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and that inhibition of NF-κB significantly attenuates tumor formation. In summary, these studies uncover an unexpected signaling mechanism for activation of classical NF-κB by TRE17. They further reveal a critical role for NF-κB in TRE17-mediated tumorigenesis, and suggest that NF-κB inhibitors may function as effective therapeutic agents in the treatment of ABC."
https://openalex.org/W1963734677,"Proteins that translocate across cell membranes need to overcome a significant hydrophobic barrier. This is usually accomplished via specialized protein complexes, which provide a polar transmembrane pore. Exceptions to this include bacterial toxins, which insert into and cross the lipid bilayer itself. We are studying the mechanism by which large antibacterial proteins enter Escherichia coli via specific outer membrane proteins. Here we describe the use of neutron scattering to investigate the interaction of colicin N with its outer membrane receptor protein OmpF. The positions of lipids, colicin N, and OmpF were separately resolved within complex structures by the use of selective deuteration. Neutron reflectivity showed, in real time, that OmpF mediates the insertion of colicin N into lipid monolayers. This data were complemented by Brewster Angle Microscopy images, which showed a lateral association of OmpF in the presence of colicin N. Small angle neutron scattering experiments then defined the three-dimensional structure of the colicin N-OmpF complex. This revealed that colicin N unfolds and binds to the OmpF-lipid interface. The implications of this unfolding step for colicin translocation across membranes are discussed."

The sheep myeloid antimicrobial peptide 29 (SMAP-29), a leukocyte peptide of the cathelicidin family, reduces the bacterial concentration in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and consolidated pulmonary tissues of infected lambs (8Brogden K.A.

Likewise, the CAP-18, C-terminal fragment from rabbit granulocytes, possesses bactericidal activity (10Travis S.M. Anderson N.N. Forsyth W.R. Espiritu C. Conway B.D. Greenberg E.P. McCray Jr., P.B.

However, some AMP possesses higher percentage of α-helical structure in the presence of hydrophobic environments, like LL37 in trifluoroethanol or lipid A (13Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N.N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These AMPs have multiple modes of action that are generally perceived as differing from those of conventional antibiotics (1Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 7Schröder J.M. Harder J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14Boix E. Nogués M.V. Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Most studies have proceeded on the tacit assumption that these AMPs act on bacteria through electrostatic interactions and that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria, serves as the initial AMP binding site. However, recent studies have shown that LPS is not universally associated with susceptibility to the bactericidal effects of AMPs (15Peterson A.A. Fesik S.W. McGroarty E.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1987; 31: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Epand R.M. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we recently examined the mechanism of antimicrobial action of hRNase 7 against the Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is not mediated through LPS but via the outer membrane protein, OprI (17Lin Y.M.

In this report we identify a distinct group of outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp) of the Enterobacteriaceae family of Gram-negative bacteria that contribute directly to their susceptibilities to α-helical cationic AMPs. The Lpp is one of major outer membrane proteins of E. coli, which anchors to outer membrane and cell wall through the modified N-terminal N-acyl-S-diacylglycerylcysteine residue and C-terminal lysine residue, respectively (18Inoyye S.

Small aliquots of recombinant Lpp (0.8 μg in 10 μl) or bacterial suspensions (5–10 × 106 cfu in 45 μl) were incubated with increasing concentrations of EDC and glutaraldehyde in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5 and 7.5, respectively, at 37 °C for 30 min. The cross-linked complexes were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting using anti-Lpp and anti-biotin antibody, respectively. Among the AMPs tested against K. pneumoniae, SMAP-29, Protegrin-1, and Polymyxin B had the highest bactericidal activity with LD99 (the dose that achieves 99% reduction of colony-forming units) less than 0.1 μm. CAP-18 and LL-37 were somewhat weaker with LD99 less than 0.15 μm, whereas the Arg-riched oligopeptide, (R3S1)3, and hRNase 7 were weak, with LD99 0.6 μm (Fig. 1A). SMAP-29 exerted broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Y. enterocolitica, S. marcescens, S. typhimurium, E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), and fungi (C. albicans) but had minimal activity against P. pastoris X-33) (Fig. 1B). To examine the membrane integrity of K. pneumoniae after AMP treatment, we found that the permeability of membrane markedly increased within 5 min after treatment with 5∼10 μm SMAP-29 or CAP-18, whereas permeability resulting from 20∼40 μm Polymyxin B increased slowly (Fig. 1C). Among the cationic AMPs tested, SMAP-29, and LL-37 were able to bind susceptible bacteria K. pneumoniae even in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl or 4 mm MgCl2, at which the binding abilities of Polymyxin B and (R3S1)3 were markedly reduced (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the bindings of cationic SMAP-29 and LL-37 to the susceptible bacteria are mediated through a specific receptor rather than nonspecific ionic interaction, as that occurs between cationic AMP and anionic LPS in most Gram-negative bacteria. A search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base with the primary amino acid sequence of P. aeruginosa OprI protein, a known binding protein for the AMP, human RNase 7 (24Huang Y.C. Lin Y.M. Chang T.W. Wu S.J. Lee Y.S. Chang M.D. Chen C. Wu S.H. Liao Y.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we identified a homologous lipoprotein, Lpp, which is expressed in all the Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrio cholerae. Lpp protein sequence from these bacterial species is 23 and 25% identical, respectively, to P. aeruginosa OprI but interestingly was not detected in Gram-positive bacteria or fungi (Fig. 1E); these microbes clearly have other targets for AMP binding that remain to be explored. The primary sequences of Lpp family proteins in the Enterobacteriaceae were highly homologous to one another with minor variations primarily at C terminus. We cloned Lpp genes of K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. typhimurium, expressed them in E. coli BL21-DE3 as thioredoxin-fused proteins, and purified them to high homogeneity after cleavage with protease Factor Xa (Fig. 2, A and B). Both recombinant OprI and Lpp proteins (shown by arrowhead and arrow, respectively) were detected predominantly in monomer form and with minor amounts in dimer conformation on reducing SDS-PAGE visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2B). However, three major bands were observed by Western blot using antibodies raised against recombinant OprI from P. aeruginosa and Lpp from E. coli (Fig. 2C). The antibody raised against E. coli Lpp could react with the Lpps of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium but not with the OprI of P. aeruginosa and vice versa. To investigate the stronger antigenicity of dimeric Lpp than monomeric Lpp to anti-Lpp antibody as shown in Fig. 2C, a His-tagged Lpp of K. pneumoniae was contact-transferred onto duplicate PVDF membranes and detected by antibodies against His6 and Lpp, respectively. The antigenicity of dimeric His6-tagged Lpp to anti-Lpp antibody was stronger than that to anti-His6 antibody (see supplemental Fig. S1). The preference of anti-Lpp antibody to dimeric Lpp indicates that the Lpp used as immunogen to raise antibody may exist in the form of dimer or more linked by a disulfide bond at the N terminus. To further examine the status of polymerization, the recombinant Lpp of K. pneumoniae was cross-linked with an increasing amount of EDC and analyzed by silver staining and Western blot (Fig. 2, D and E). The presence of oligomers ranging dimer to hexamer suggests that the recombinant Lpp exists in hexamer.FIGURE 1Antimicrobial spectra of cationic AMPs and their target protein on Gram-negative bacteria. A, bactericidal activities of AMPs on K. pneumoniae are shown. B, antimicrobial activity of SMAP-29 on various microbes is shown. Microbes (5–10 × 104 cfu) were treated with AMPs at 37 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 3 h and then plated on agar plates for the determination of remaining cfu. C, increase of membrane permeability of K. pneumoniae after AMP treatment is shown. Bacteria (107 cfu) were incubated with 1 μm SYTOX® Green in a dark 96-well plate for 15 min before the addition of AMP. The increase of fluorescence was measured using 485- and 520-nm filters for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. RFU, relative fluorescence units. D, binding of AMPs to K. pneumoniae is shown. Overnight cultures of bacteria (107 cfu) were incubated with SAMP-29, LL-37, Polymyxin B, or (R3S1)3 (3 μg each) in 50 μl at 37 °C for 30 min, then spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. NaCl or MgCl2 was added as indicated. T represents total AMPs employed, S is for supernatant, and P is for pellet. E, amino acid sequence alignment of Lpp-homologous proteins by the software ClustalX is shown. The Lpp sequences of S. typhimurium (NP_460342), Enterobacter cloacae (YP_003612855), Citrobacter youngae (ZP_06353081), E. coli (NP_416192), Shigella boydii (YP_001880438), S. marcescens (AAA26566), Y. enterocolitica (YP_001006405), K. pneumoniae (YP_001335792), V. cholerae (ZP_01972724), and OprI sequence of P. aeruginosa (NP_251543) were obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Only cationic α-helical AMPs, like SMAP-29, CAP-18, and LL-37, were recognized by His-tagged Lpp and pulled down by Ni-NTA Agarose, whereas the non-α-helical cationic AMPs, like Protegrin-1, Polymyxin B, and (R3S1)3, were not (Fig. 3A). The specific interaction between Lpp and biotinyl-SMAP-29 was further validated by glutaraldehyde cross-linking followed by SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and Western blot using anti-Lpp and anti-biotin antibodies, respectively (Fig. 3, B–D). Oligomers of Lpp from monomer to hexamer were observed upon glutaraldehyde cross-linking (marked with numbers 1–6). Interestingly, the Lpp·biotinyl-SMAP-29 complexes were detected in the presence of biotinyl-SMAP-29 (marked with a–d). In addition to K. pneumoniae Lpp, the Lpp of E. coli and S. typhimurium was also recognized by biotinylated SMAP-29 and pulled down by streptavidin-conjugated beads detected by Western blot using anti-Lpp antibody. The formation of Lpp·biotinyl-SMAP-29 complex were abolished by anti-Lpp antibody but not by anti-OprI antibody (Fig. 3E). Similarly, the P. aeruginosa OprI was also bound to biotinyl-SMAP-29 and abolished by anti-OprI antibody but not by anti-Lpp antibody. It is interesting to note that the signal of dimer is stronger than that of monomer probably due to the preference of biotinyl-SMAP-29 to recognize and bind disulfide bond-linked oligomer to monomer. These results indicate that cationic α-helical AMP could specifically recognize both OprI of P. aeruginosa and Lpp of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria. In contrast to recombinant Lpp/OprI, only one signal with slower mobility than that of monomeric recombinant Lpp/OprI was observed for the crude total lysates of tested Gram-negative bacteria by Western blot as shown in Fig. 4A. The native Lpp of membrane fraction of K. pneumoniae was recognized by biotinyl-SMAP-29 and pulled down by streptavidin-conjugated beads detected by Western blot. The specific interaction was abolished by anti-Lpp antibody but not by anti-OprI antibody (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the interaction was competed by excess amounts of free SMAP-29 and other cationic α-helical AMPs, like CAP-18 and LL-37, but not by Polymyxin B (Fig. 4C). To determine whether Lpp is the target of cationic α-helical AMP in vivo, increasing amounts of recombinant Lpp were employed for the competition of AMP action in a colony-forming unit assay. We found that the antimicrobial activities of cationic α-helical AMPs, like SMAP-29, CAP-18, and LL37, against K. pneumoniae were blocked by exogenous Lpp, but those of Polymyxin B and Protegrin-1 were not. As a control, we found that the antimicrobial activity of SMAP-29 against P. aeruginosa was also inhibited by exogenous Lpp (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the actions of SMAP-29 were blocked by exogenous Lpp regardless of the nature of the specific susceptible target bacteria, as this is a distinct property of the ligand. Furthermore, the surface Lpp of K. pneumoniae was protected from the actions of these cationic α-helical AMPs, including SMAP-29, by anti-Lpp antibody but not by anti-OprI antibody. However, the actions of Polymyxin B and Protegrin-1 were not blocked by the anti-Lpp antibody (Fig. 5B). In addition to K. pneumoniae, several bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Y. enterocolitica, S. marcescens, S. typhimurium, and E. coli) were also protected by the anti-Lpp antibody, but the P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and C. albicans not belonging to Enterobacteriaceae were not protected by the anti-Lpp antibody (Fig. 5C). The increase in membrane permeability caused by SMAP-29 or CAP-18 was inhibited by anti-Lpp antibody, but that caused by Polymyxin B was not (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that surface Lpp plays a key role in the susceptibility of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria, but not that of P. aeruginosa, to cationic α-helical AMPs. Morphologically, the outer membrane of K. pneumoniae detached from inner cytoplasmic membrane and blebbed outward 5 min after SMAP-29 treatment. The cytosol condensed into a heavily stained body, leaving behind a lightly stained space beneath the membrane 20 min after SMAP-29 treatment (Fig. 6A). Most Lpp as well as biotinylated SMAP-29 (large and small gold particles shown as L and S, respectively) relocated from outer membrane to the condensed cytosolic area. To further investigate whether Lpp is depleted from the outer membrane, we found that the surface Lpp was accessible to EDC and cross-linked into a large complex without SMAP-29 treatment because the complex was unable to be dissociated into monomer by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6B); however, the Lpp became inaccessible to EDC after SMAP-29 treatment probably due to internalization into cytosol (Fig. 6C). In addition, the anti-Lpp antibody could not recognize and bind the SMAP-29-treated bacteria anymore, although the total amount of Lpp remained constant (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that the abundant surface Lpp was targeted and internalized into cytosol by SMAP-29. To explore and identify factors that could reduce the efficacy of AMPs in clinical trials and the possible bactericidal pathway of AMP, we found that the bactericidal activities, analyzed by the diameter of inhibition zone on Luria Broth agar plate, of hRNase 7, (R3S1)3, and Indolicidin (4 μg each) against E. coli and K. pneumoniae were reduced, whereas those of Polymyxin B and SMAP-29 were only slightly reduced (Fig. 7m, A and B). To investigate the possible factors involved in Luria Broth culture medium, which contains divalent cations and salts (0.17 m NaCl), we found the bactericidal activities of LL-37 and (R3S1)3 against K. pneumoniae were markedly repressed by 1.5 mm MgCl2 or 0.15 m NaCl, but those of SMAP-29 and Polymyxin B were not (Fig. 7, C and D). To investigate whether the inhibitory effects of ions and salts are mediated through the reduced binding of AMP to Lpp, we found that the binding ability of LL-37 as well as SMAP-29 to His-tagged Lpp was not inhibited by MgCl2 (0∼4 mm) in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl, although the bactericidal activity of LL-37 was susceptible to the inhibition by 1.5 mm MgCl2 or 0.15 m NaCl. Thus, other downstream events in the bactericidal pathway or the structure of LL-37 are suspected to be affected by divalent cations and salts because the structure of LL-37 varies with the hydrophobicities of solvents (13Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N.N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Lpp/OprI is the target of cationic α-helical AMP, we intended to screen for AMPs from natural source using the His-tagged Lpp as a ligand. For proteins in the RNase A superfamily, human hRNase 7 possesses bactericidal activity, whereas the oocytic ribonuclease from bullfrog, Rana Catesbeiana (RC-RNase) does not. For bactericidal cationic peptides, SMAP-29 is an α-helical AMP, whereas Polymyxin B is not. To mimic the complicate environments of natural source of AMPs including ions, salts, and other cellular components, we retrieved hRNase 7 and SMAP-29 from the above-mentioned RNase/peptide mixture in the presence of crude lysate of human lung adenocarcinoma cell CL1-0 by the His-tagged Lpp (Fig. 8). The result provides a novel method for screening of antimicrobials from natural sources for use against drug-resistant bacteria. The widespread use of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture plays a significant role in the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Conventional antibiotics typically inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, or cell wall components. Microorganisms develop resistance to these antibiotics through their inactivation/modification by enzymes, modification of target site, alteration of metabolic pathway, and reduction of drug accumulation by decreasing drug permeability or increasing active efflux (25Shepard B.D.

https://openalex.org/W1987201681,"To perform highly sensitive cellular binding studies with TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), we developed a bioluminescent variant of soluble TWEAK (GpL-FLAG-TNC-TWEAK) by fusing it genetically to the C terminus of the luciferase of Gaussia princeps (GpL). Equilibrium binding studies on human (HT1080 and HT29) and murine (Renca and B16) cell lines at 37 °C revealed high affinities of human TWEAK from 53 to 112 pm. The dissociation rate constant of the TWEAK-Fn14 interaction was between 0.48×10(-3) s(-1) (HT29) and 0.58×10(-3) s(-1) (HT1080) for the human molecules, and the association rate constant obtained was 3.3×10(6) m(-1) s(-1) for both cell lines. It has been shown previously that oligomerization of soluble TWEAK trimers results in enhanced Fn14-mediated activation of the classical NFκB pathway. Binding studies with GpL-FLAG-TNC-TWEAK trimers oligomerized by help of a FLAG tag-specific antibody gave no evidence for a major increase in Fn14 occupancy by oligomerized ligand despite strongly enhanced induction of the NFκB target IL8. Thus, aggregated complexes of soluble TWEAK and Fn14 have a higher intrinsic activity to stimulate the classical NFκB pathway and qualitatively differ from isolated trimeric TWEAK-Fn14 complexes. Furthermore, determination of IL8 induction as a function of occupied activated receptors revealed that the intrinsic capability of TNFR1 to stimulate the classical NFκB pathway and IL8 production was ∼100-fold higher than Fn14. Thus, although ∼25 activated TNFR1 trimers were sufficient to trigger half-maximal IL8 production, more than 2500 cell-bound oligomerized TWEAK trimers were required to elicit a similar response."
https://openalex.org/W2089172583,"Elucidating how serine/threonine phosphatases regulate kinase function and bacterial virulence is critical for our ability to combat these infections. Group B streptococci (GBS) are β-hemolytic Gram-positive bacteria that cause invasive infections in humans. To adapt to environmental changes, GBS encodes signaling mechanisms comprising two component systems and eukaryotic-like enzymes. We have previously described the importance of the serine/threonine kinase Stk1 to GBS pathogenesis. However, how the presence or absence of the cognate serine/threonine phosphatase Stp1 affects Stk1 function and GBS virulence is not known. Here, we show that GBS deficient only in Stp1 expression are markedly reduced for their ability to cause systemic infections, exhibit decreased β-hemolysin/cytolysin activity, and show increased sensitivity to autolysis. Although transcription of genes important for β-hemolysin/cytolysin expression and export is similar to the wild type (WT), 294 genes (excluding stp1) showed altered expression in the stp1 mutant and included autolysin genes. Furthermore, phosphopeptide enrichment analysis identified that 35 serine/threonine phosphopeptides, corresponding to 27 proteins, were unique to the stp1 mutant. This included phosphorylation of ATP synthase, DNA and RNA helicases, and proteins important for cell division and protein synthesis. Collectively, our results indicate that Stp1 is important for appropriate regulation of Stk1 function, hemolysin activity, autolysis, and GBS virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2010956463,"Prokaryotic orthologs of eukaryotic Cys-loop receptor channels recently emerged as structural and mechanistic surrogates to investigate this superfamily of intercellular signaling proteins. Here, we examine proton activation of the prokaryotic ortholog GLIC using patch clamp electrophysiology, mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Whole-cell current recordings from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing GLIC show half-maximal activation at pH 6, close to the pK(a) of histidine, implicating the three native His residues in proton sensing linked to activation. The mutation H235F abolishes proton activation, H277Y is without effect, and all nine mutations of His-127 prevent expression on the cell surface. In the GLIC crystal structure, His-235 on transmembrane (TM) α-helix 2, hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Ile-259 on TM α-helix 3. MD simulations show that when His-235 is protonated, the hydrogen bond persists, and the channel remains in the open conformation, whereas when His-235 is deprotonated, the hydrogen bond dissociates, and the channel closes. Mutations of the proximal Tyr-263, which also links TM α-helices 2 and 3 via a hydrogen bond, alter proton sensitivity over a 1.5 pH unit range. MD simulations show that mutations of Tyr-263 alter the hydrogen bonding capacity of His-235. The overall findings show that His-235 in the TM region of GLIC is a novel proton binding site linked to channel activation."

Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that cAMP binds to one subunit of tetrameric HCN2 and HCN4 C termini with high affinity (∼0.12 μm) and subsequently with low affinity (∼1 μm) to the remaining three subunits. Changes induced by high affinity binding already exist in both a constrained HCN2 tetramer and the unconstrained HCN1 tetramer.

The structure, hanging below the pore, is derived from sequences that begin just after the end of the S6 transmembrane segment and includes both the CNBD and the C-linker, a region that connects the CNBD to the inner side of the channel pore. Cyclic AMP is thought to bind and induce a conformational change that propagates through the CNBD as well as to the C-linker of an adjacent subunit (9Zhou L. Siegelbaum S.A.

Evidence for the formation of a gating ring comes from studies of the purified HCN2 C terminus using analytical ultracentrifugation (8Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In the absence of cAMP, monomers are predominantly seen, whereas the proportion of multimers, especially tetramers, increases significantly when cAMP is present. Curiously, facilitation of opening by cAMP differs among the mammalian HCNs. HCN2 and HCN4 opening is strongly facilitated by cAMP, whereas that of HCN1 and HCN3 is only weakly affected or not affected at all, respectively (12Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B.

This variation among the isoforms is thought to arise, at least in part, from subtle differences in primary structure of the CNBD and the C-linker (12Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B.

Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the differences in cAMP effect among the isoforms remains unknown. Here, we set out to directly quantify and compare the energetics of cAMP binding among HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 using the C terminus in solution. HCN constructs were cloned in a modified pET28 vector (Novagen) containing an His6 tag, maltose-binding protein, and a cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus protease denoted as an HMT tag. The constructs utilized were mouse HCN1J (residues 390–645), ΔAB-HCN1J (432–645), mouse HCN2J (443–645), ΔAB-HCN2J (458–645), rabbit HCN4J (522–724), and ΔAB-HCN4J (532–724). The R591E mutation in HCN2J was obtained using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). GCN4LI, a leucine zipper protein that forms an artificial parallel tetramer when amino acids in the “a” and “d” positions of the coiled-coil are mutated to a leucine and an isoleucine, respectively (16Harbury P.B.

Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar), and HCN2J were amplified by PCR with a BamHI site and an additional 5 glycines at the 3′ and 5′ end, respectively, making a 10-glycine linker between the two pieces. After ligation, the fusion construct was amplified and cloned into the HMT vector. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLacI grown in 2× YT media at 37 °C, except for HCN1J and ΔAB-HCN1J, which were grown at 25 °C, and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed by sonication in 250 mm KCl + 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (buffer A), except in the case of HCN1J and GCN4LI-HCN2J, where 500 mm NaCl plus 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) was used, supplemented with 100 mm PMSF, 25 mg/ml lysozyme, 25 mg/ml DNase I, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 m EDTA. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 35,000 × g, and the filtered supernatant was loaded onto a Talon (Clontech) column, washed with buffer A, and eluted with buffer A + 500 mm imidazole. His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease was used to cleave the tag for 2 h at room temperature and dialyzed against buffer A + 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. To remove the tag and tobacco etch virus protease, the protein solution was rerun on talon resin. For GCN4LI-HCN2J, the tags were not removed and run on an amylose column instead. The flow-through was collected, dialyzed against 10 mm KCl, 20 mm MES (pH 6.0) + 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer C), and further purified on a Resource S column (GE Healthcare) in buffer C with a linear gradient to 40% buffer D (1 m KCl, 10 mm MES (pH 6.0) + 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) over 40 column volumes. In the case of the GCN4LI-HCN2J, a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) was used with 10 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) with a linear gradient to 40% buffer 1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) over 40 column volumes. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. Homogeneity of the protein was confirmed on HiLoad Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) (see supplemental Fig. 1). Samples were concentrated and dialyzed against 150 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 °C. Titrations were performed in an ITC200 (GE Healthcare) at 25 or 10 °C, using a concentration of cAMP that was 10× that for the HCN protein and 1-μl injections. Protein concentrations were determined by absorption at 280 nm under denaturing conditions, and extinction coefficients were calculated. The binding isotherms were analyzed using sequential models and the two independent binding site models implemented in MicroCal Origin 7.0. Binding isotherms are described by the following equation c = Ka[M]N, where Ka is the association constant, [M] is the total protein concentration in the cell, and N is the stoichiometry of interaction. The value for c was between 1 and 1000 for all of the data used for this study, which is generally considered to yield data that is accurate for enthalpy changes that are >10 kcal/mol (17Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min to remove dust particles. DLS measurements were performed on a DynaPro plate reader (Wyatt Technology). Acquisition was performed at 25 °C with Dynamics 7.0 with five scans of 5 s each. Analysis was performed using Dynamic 7.0 and Origin 7.0. Values for molecular weight, along with associated values for polydispersity, were obtained by DLS. Molecular weights of oligomeric forms of protein obtained by DLS were easily separated from aggregated protein, which was identified by its comparatively large value for molecular weight. We examined the binding of cAMP to the isolated C terminus of the HCN2 channel, a region corresponding to the first six α helices of the C-linker and the three α helices and eight β-barrel strands that constitute the CNBD. Examination of this region alone, which we refer to as HCN2J from the initial study of this region (8Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), allows us to isolate the actual binding event, which is not possible in full-length channels. Although inherently limited because of the absence of the transmembrane and N-terminal regions of the channel, use of the C-terminal fragment also avoids reciprocal interactions between the C terminus and transmembrane portions of the full-length channel that could influence binding. Ample quantities of HCN2J were obtained, and the binding of cAMP to HCN2J was assessed by ITC (18Velázquez Campoy A. Freire E. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 115: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Adding cAMP to purified HCN2J at 100 or 200 μm produced two clear transitions, which could readily be fit with a two independent binding site model (Fig. 1A) and yielded binding affinities of ∼1 and 0.1 μm (Fig. 1B). This model gave a better fit than the sequential model for four binding sites, also implemented in MicroCal Origin 7.0, in which the initial binding of the ligand to one site affects the affinity of the others. These two models, as applied in Origin, are described in detail in the supplemental material, along with examples of how each model fit the data (supplemental Fig. 2) and a state diagram illustrating a possible molecular interpretation for the negative cooperativity (supplemental Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Low affinity binding of cAMP remains at low HCN2J concentrations and when self-association is eliminated. A, plots of heat produced by ITC upon progressive injections of cAMP into indicated concentrations of HCN2J and 200 μm ΔAB-HCN2J, as indicated. The solid line through the values of the lower plots represents a single binding model for all of the above except for 100 μm HCN2J, which was fit with a two independent binding site model. The fits yielded values for affinity and energetics (ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS) (supplemental table). Note that, along with an experiment using 10 μm HCN2J on the far left, data are plotted from an experiment in which cAMP was titrated into buffer lacking HCN protein (upper plot, gray trace; lower plot, gray points); no discernible heat is released when cAMP is added to buffer alone.

Error bars indicate S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The energetics of binding were different for each binding event (Fig. 1C); the apparent low affinity binding event was driven by favorable enthalpy and unfavorable entropy, whereas both were favorable for the apparent high affinity binding event. Thus, the biphasic pattern is due to release of heat specific to each of two binding events, both of which are exothermic but proceed and saturate over different and well separated ranges of cAMP concentration. The lower affinity binding event also occurs with a more negative enthalpy, resulting in a falling phase. The rising phase that follows occurs as both sets of binding sites saturate and the amount of heat released decreases. The stoichiometry of binding, which is the ratio of cAMP to individual HCN2J subunits, was different between binding events, with values of ∼0.25 and ∼0.75 (supplemental table) for the high and low affinity events, respectively. Because these values for stoichiometry sum up to an overall stoichiometry of ∼1, both binding events likely occur to the same site with altered geometries. For the low affinity binding event, the values for c are ∼114, and the values for ΔH are >15 kcal/mol, within the optimal experimental guidelines suggested by Wiseman et al. (17Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). However, for the high affinity binding event, the values for c are high (>400), and the values for ΔH are <6 kcal/mol. To examine the profile of heat changes due only to the high affinity binding event, the μcal/mol versus molar ratio curves were simulated with the experimental data obtained for only this event. These simulated curves show that the decrease in heat over time was comparatively steep (curves not shown). Thus, although the data are within the acceptable range of c-values and the fit to the two independent binding site model is very good, it is probable that the value obtained from the fitting for the high affinity binding event is not as accurate as that for the low affinity binding event (19Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Lowering temperature (from 25 to 10 °C) still resulted in two transitions and affinities much like those at the higher temperature, although the total amount of heat released was considerably smaller and the double transition was less pronounced (supplemental Fig. 4; supplemental table). To determine whether both events reflected binding to the CNBD, we introduced the R591E mutation, which is located in the highly conserved phosphate-binding cassette and coordinates the cAMP phosphate group (8Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 14Chen S. Wang J. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This mutation eliminated both binding events, consistent with two transitions resulting from binding of cAMP to the known CNBD (Fig. 1D). One of the two binding events could have been due to promotion of self-association of HCN2J by cAMP binding to form dimers and tetramers, which has been shown previously by analytical ultracentrifugation (8Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 11Zhou L. Olivier N.B. Yao H. Young E.C. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 2004; 44: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To minimize the extent of HCN2J self-association, ITC measurements were repeated using lower concentrations of protein. Because self-association requires the C-linker, ITC measurements were also carried out using HCN2J lacking the first two α helices of this region (A′, B′) (ΔAB-HCN2J). Indeed, cAMP addition to lower concentrations of HCN2J and to ΔAB-HCN2J resulted in only the lower affinity binding event (Fig. 2, A and B), both with a stoichiometry of 1 (supplemental table), suggesting that self-association was necessary for the appearance of a high affinity binding event. Although the ΔH values were <6 kcal/mol for the single binding event of 10 and 25 μm HCN2J, the c-values obtained were ∼8 and ∼19, respectively, which are within the optimal range. To approximate the extent of self-association and assess its contribution to the high affinity binding event, DLS of HCN2J, at a range of concentrations, and ΔAB-HCN2J (200 μm) was performed with or without a saturating concentration of cAMP (Fig. 2C). The apparent molecular mass obtained for ΔAB-HCN2J was ∼26 kDa, close to the calculated mass of the ΔAB-HCN2J monomer (22.4 kDa); this mass was unaffected by cAMP, consistent with the lack of cAMP-induced self-association. At the lowest concentrations of protein used (10 μm), the apparent molecular mass of HCN2J was also ∼26 kDa, suggesting that the protein was monomeric. However, the apparent weight of HCN2J increased with increasing concentrations of protein, consistent with the appearance of larger forms. This interpretation is supported by values for polydispersity, the standard deviation of the distribution of molecular weights obtained by DLS. Values for polydispersity of greater than 30% are generally considered to indicate populations of particles that are of significantly different sizes, or to be polydisperse, with a molecular weight corresponding to the peak of the distribution (23Habel J.E. Ohren J.F. Borgstahl G.E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Zulauf M. D'Arcy A. J. Cryst. Growth. 1992; 122: 102-106Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At the lowest concentration of HCN2J and for ΔAB-HCN2J, polydispersity was <15%, which, along with the apparent molecular weight, is consistent with very small contributions from oligomeric forms of the protein. For intermediate protein concentrations, polydispersity values were ∼27.5%, suggesting small but more significant contributions from multiple oligomeric forms. This is reflected in the gradual increase in apparent molecular masses, ranging from ∼42 to 59 kDa for 25, 50, and 100 μm HCN2J. At the highest concentration of HCN2J (200 μm), the apparent mass is about 83 kDa, close to the 89.6 kDa as predicted for the tetramer; this, along with a polydispersity value of ∼24%, supports the predominance of the tetrameric form at this highest concentration. The higher HCN2J concentrations are likely a better reflection of its effective concentration when attached to the intact tetrameric channel at the plasma membrane. Notably, the apparent weight was increased with cAMP at all concentrations of HCN2J except for the highest concentration; its effect was largest at the lowest concentration of HCN2J and progressively decreased as the protein concentration increased. In cAMP, values for polydispersity remained below ∼30% at all concentrations of HCN2J. At 200 μm, the absence of an effect of cAMP on the molecular weight of HCN2J is consistent with the predominance of tetramers. Thus, high affinity binding is apparent mainly when HCN2J is already a tetramer and is not due to self-association per se. Together with the stoichiometry of cAMP binding to HCN2J at higher protein concentrations, these data suggest an inherent negative cooperativity whereby cAMP binds initially to one subunit of the tetramer with high affinity and subsequently to the remaining three subunits with lower affinity. The stoichiometries of the two binding events are calculated in relation to the concentration of individual HCN subunits; thus, their summed value of 1 is consistent with negative cooperativity, in which one cAMP binds with high affinity and the remaining three cAMP molecules bind with low affinity. To further examine binding of cAMP to the HCN2J tetramer, we fused it to the C terminus of GCN4-LI, a protein known to form a tetrameric coiled-coil (16Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar), and confirmed that it was a tetramer by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3D). As pretetramerization reduces the amount of tag-free protein after cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease, and hence the yield, we kept the HMT tag attached for both constrained and unconstrained forms of the HCN2J tetramer. Unlike the unconstrained HCN2J tetramer, titration of cAMP with the constrained HCN2J tetramer revealed only a single binding transition (Fig. 3A). The possibility thus exists that the HCN2J fragments were unable to form a tetramer. However, the binding is characterized by a low binding affinity and an energetic signature that were identical to those of the low affinity binding event in the unconstrained HCN2J tetramer (Fig. 3, B and C). The binding affinities of both the constrained and the unconstrained tetramer were similar to the single binding event determined for the monomeric ΔAB-HCN2J, but the energetics were different; the absolute values of entropy and enthalpy were much smaller after deletion (Fig. 3C). Thus, the CNBDs are able to make tetrameric contacts, and the changes induced by high affinity binding of cAMP in the unconstrained HCN2J tetramer have probably already taken place in the constrained tetramer. HCN2 and HCN4 channel opening is strongly facilitated by cAMP, whereas that of HCN1 and HCN3 is only weakly affected or not affected at all, respectively (12Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Mistrík P. Mader R. Michalakis S. Weidinger M. Pfeifer A. Biel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27056-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether the conformational changes in HCN2J, as seen in the double transitions of cAMP binding, might reflect the stronger effect of cAMP. Therefore, cAMP binding to purified versions HCN1 and HCN4 C termini was next examined. For HCN4J and ΔAB-HCN4J, the biphasic heat signature, apparent binding affinities of cAMP, and associated energetics were similar to those for HCN2 (supplemental Fig. 5). In contrast, for HCN1J, only a single transition was observed upon cAMP binding in both low and high concentrations (Fig. 4A), with values of binding affinity and energetics (Fig. 4, B and C) that were similar to those for the single binding event in the constrained HCN2J and for the low affinity binding event of the unconstrained HCN2J tetramer. Notably, the energetics of binding for HCN1J were different from those of ΔAB-HCN1J. Although both exhibit a single binding transition of low affinity and similar free energy of binding, the absolute values for both enthalpy and entropy were larger, paralleling the differences in energetics noted between tetrameric HCN2J and ΔAB-HCN2J. Dynamic light scattering across a range of HCN1J concentrations (Fig. 4D), under the same conditions as those utilized for ITC, showed that, as for HCN2J, the apparent molecular weight increased with increasing concentrations, consistent with the appearance of larger forms. However, in the absence of cAMP, the apparent weights for HCN1J were larger than those for HCN2J, at intermediate and high concentrations of protein, suggesting that self-association and tetramer formation occurred to a greater extent under these conditions. Furthermore, the molecular weight of HCN1J, at all concentrations tested, was unaffected by saturating levels of cAMP, suggesting that the cAMP is unable to induce significant conformational changes. The value of stoichiometry for the single binding event of HCN1J is ∼0.37 and ∼0.68, at 200 and 25 μm, respectively; that for ΔAB-HCN1J is ∼0.88 (supplemental table). Although a stoichiometry near 1 would be expected for a single binding event, the lower values probably reflect an underestimation of concentration that results from nonspecific aggregation that renders the cAMP-binding site inaccessible. Nevertheless, the molecular weights for HCN1 constructs are reliable as they were obtained from DLS experiments in which polydispersity values for the non-aggregated portions were ≤31%. Together, the data suggest that the changes induced by high affinity binding of cAMP in the unconstrained HCN2J tetramer have already taken place in the HCN1 C terminus. Here, we show that cAMP binding to HCN channels can be assessed in detail using the isolated C terminus and interpreted in the absence of downstream changes in the transmembrane domains associated with channel gating. Cyclic AMP bound to one subunit of tetrameric HCN2 with high affinity and, subsequently, to the remaining three subunits with lower affinity. The greater similarity of energetics of the single binding event of the constrained HCN2J tetramer to those of the low affinity binding event of the unconstrained HCN2J tetramer than to those of the HCN2J monomer (ΔAB-HCN2J) suggests that the changes induced by high affinity binding of cAMP in the unconstrained HCN2J tetramer have already taken place in the constrained tetramer. Cyclic AMP binds to HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 with similar low affinity, but we found no evidence for a high affinity binding transition in HCN1. Thus, as for the constrained HCN2J tetramer, our data suggest that changes induced by the high affinity binding of cAMP have already occurred in the HCN1 C terminus. This “preactivation” of HCN1 explains both the small effect of cAMP on facilitation of its opening and the opening of the unliganded channel, which occurs as though it has already been disinhibited by the C terminus (12Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 25Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A.

Physiol. 2001; 118: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Two recent studies found that binding of cAMP to the HCN C terminus produced only a single transition when examined by ITC, with values very close to the low affinity binding values obtained in our study. In one study (27Xu X. Vysotskaya Z.V. Liu Q. Zhou L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37082-37091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the amount of HCN4 protein utilized was 75 μm, suggesting that the proportion of tetramers was low; this would explain the absence of a high affinity binding transition. In another study (28Wu S. Vysotskaya Z.V. Xu X. Xie C. Liu Q. Zhou L. Biophys. J. 2011; 100: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the amount of HCN2 protein used was not reported. Temperature was also not reported in those studies. We found that lowering temperature from 25 to 10 °C reduced the amount of heat released considerably, although two transitions were still resolved provided that high concentrations were used. Nevertheless, reduced heat at lower temperatures could make it more difficult to resolve the transitions, particularly at lower concentrations at which tetramer formation is already low. The biphasic pattern of heat released when cAMP was added to HCN2J was fit very well using a two independent binding site model, with three parameters per binding each of two sites (Ka, ΔH, and N), and not very well using a sequential model, with two free parameters (Ka and ΔH) for each of four binding sites. The comparatively better fit for the two independent binding site model was probably also due to the availability of the parameter N for each site of the two sites, which was free to adjust independently during the fit. The stoichiometry obtained from fitting the data to the two independent binding site model was close to 1:3, high affinity relative to low affinity. A possible interpretation for the negative cooperativity inferred by the two independent binding site model is offered in supplemental Fig. 3. Binding of cAMP to the unoccupied HCN2J tetramer changes the conformation of one subunit, resulting in subunit interfaces with increased stability. This hampers the conformational changes of the other subunits upon binding cAMP, resulting in an observed negative cooperativity (a sequential model (29Koshland Jr., D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar)). An alternative mechanism would involve one high affinity site and three low affinity sites that “pre-exist” within a tetramer. However, such asymmetry is not supported by the structures of the holo and apo HCN2 C terminus obtained by x-ray diffraction, which are 4-fold symmetrical tetramers (8Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 30Taraska J.W. Puljung M.C. Olivier N.B. Flynn G.E. Zagotta W.N. Nat.

Physiol. 2007; 129: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggesting that HCN2 can switch between states of low (∼1–2 μm) and high (submicromolar) cAMP affinity, but those studies suggest that this switch occurs when the channel goes from closed to open. We show that a transition from high to low affinity can also be induced solely by cAMP binding to the C terminus without influence from the transmembrane domains. A similar switch has been described in the catabolic activating peptide dimer, a structurally related cAMP-binding protein in which ITC measurements have shown that binding of the second cAMP molecule occurs with lower affinity but more favorable enthalpy than binding of the first molecule (35Popovych N. Sun S. Ebright R.H. Kalodimos C.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar); thus, for both the catabolic activating peptide and the HCN2 C terminus, the thermodynamic basis for negative cooperativity is completely entropic. It remains to be seen how this entropic C-terminal switch and resulting changes in conformation and/or dynamics interact with the transmembrane elements to facilitate HCN opening.

https://openalex.org/W2043209260,"NOTCH signaling induced by Delta1 (DLL1) and Jagged1 (JAG1) NOTCH ligands is modulated by the β3N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase Fringe. LFNG (Lunatic Fringe) and MFNG (Manic Fringe) transfer N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to O-fucose attached to EGF-like repeats of NOTCH receptors. In co-culture NOTCH signaling assays, LFNG generally enhances DLL1-induced, but inhibits JAG1-induced, NOTCH signaling. In mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that do not add galactose (Gal) to the GlcNAc transferred by Fringe, JAG1-induced NOTCH signaling is not inhibited by LFNG or MFNG. In mouse embryos lacking B4galt1, NOTCH signaling is subtly reduced during somitogenesis. Here we show that DLL1-induced NOTCH signaling in CHO cells was enhanced by LFNG, but this did not occur in either Lec8 or Lec20 CHO mutants lacking Gal on O-fucose glycans. Lec20 mutants corrected with a B4galt1 cDNA became responsive to LFNG. By contrast, MFNG promoted DLL1-induced NOTCH signaling better in the absence of Gal than in its presence. This effect was reversed in Lec8 cells corrected by expression of a UDP-Gal transporter cDNA. The MFNG effect was abolished by a DDD to DDA mutation that inactivates MFNG GlcNAc transferase activity. The binding of soluble NOTCH ligands and NOTCH1/EGF1-36 generally reflected changes in NOTCH signaling caused by LFNG and MFNG. Therefore, the presence of Gal on O-fucose glycans differentially affects DLL1-induced NOTCH signaling modulated by LFNG versus MFNG. Gal enhances the effect of LFNG but inhibits the effect of MFNG on DLL1-induced NOTCH signaling, with functional consequences for regulating the strength of NOTCH signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2052199680,"Mechanical loads induce profound anabolic effects in the skeleton, but the molecular mechanisms that transduce such signals are still poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α) is acutely up-regulated in response to exogenous mechanical stimuli secondary to prostanoid signaling and Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation. In this context, Hif-1α associates with β-catenin to inhibit Wnt target genes associated with bone anabolic activity. Mice lacking Hif-1α in osteoblasts and osteocytes form more bone when subjected to tibia loading as a result of increased osteoblast activity. Taken together, these studies indicate that Hif-1α serves as a negative regulator of skeletal mechanotransduction to suppress load-induced bone formation by altering the sensitivity of osteoblasts and osteocytes to mechanical signals."
https://openalex.org/W2073724409,"The authors report that prolonged inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in Drosophila CNS results in a homeostatic increase in the α7 receptor, which then induces an increase in the A-type K+ current carried by Shal/Kv4 channels. This increase in Shal activity stabilizes postsynaptic potentials. Long-term synaptic changes, which are essential for learning and memory, are dependent on homeostatic mechanisms that stabilize neural activity. Homeostatic responses have also been implicated in pathological conditions, including nicotine addiction. Although multiple homeostatic pathways have been described, little is known about how compensatory responses are tuned to prevent them from overshooting their optimal range of activity. We found that prolonged inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), the major excitatory receptors in the Drosophila CNS, resulted in a homeostatic increase in the Drosophila α7 (Dα7)-nAChR. This response then induced an increase in the transient A-type K+ current carried by Shaker cognate L (Shal; also known as voltage-gated K+ channel 4, Kv4) channels. Although increasing Dα7-nAChRs boosted miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, the ensuing increase in Shal channels served to stabilize postsynaptic potentials. These data identify a previously unknown mechanism for fine tuning the homeostatic response."
https://openalex.org/W2079939915,"The aspartic protease cathepsin-D (cath-D) is a marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer that is overexpressed and hypersecreted by human breast cancer cells. Secreted pro-cath-D binds to the extracellular domain of the β-chain of the LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in fibroblasts. The LRP1 receptor has an 85-kDa transmembrane β-chain and a noncovalently attached 515-kDa extracellular α-chain. LRP1 acts by (1) internalizing many ligands via its α-chain, (2) activating signaling pathways by phosphorylating the LRP1β-chain tyrosine and (3) modulating gene transcription by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of its β-chain. LRP1 RIP involves two cleavages: the first liberates the LRP1 ectodomain to give a membrane-associated form, LRP1β-CTF, and the second generates the LRP1β-intracellular domain, LRP1β-ICD, that modulates gene transcription. Here, we investigated the endocytosis of pro-cath-D by LRP1 and the effect of pro-cath-D/LRP1β interaction on LRP1β tyrosine phosphorylation and/or LRP1β RIP. Our results indicate that pro-cath-D was partially endocytosed by LRP1 in fibroblasts. However, pro-cath-D and ectopic cath-D did not stimulate phosphorylation of the LRP1β-chain tyrosine. Interestingly, ectopic cath-D and its catalytically inactive (D231N)cath-D, and pro-(D231N)cath-D all significantly inhibited LRP1 RIP by preventing LRP1β-CTF production. Thus, cath-D inhibits LRP1 RIP independently of its catalytic activity by blocking the first cleavage. As cath-D triggers fibroblast outgrowth by LRP1, we propose that cath-D modulates the growth of fibroblasts by inhibiting LRP1 RIP in the breast tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2042355769,"Missing in metastasis (MIM) is a member of newly emerged inverse Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain protein family and a putative metastasis suppressor. Although reduced MIM expression has been associated with bladder, breast and gastric cancers, evidence for the role of MIM in tumor progression remains scarce and controversial. Herein we characterized a MIM knockout mouse strain and observed that MIM-deficient mice often developed enlarged spleens. Autopsy and histological analysis revealed that nearly 78% of MIM(-/-) mice developed tumors with features similar to diffuse large B lymphoma during a period from 1 to 2 years. MIM(-/-) mice also exhibited abnormal distribution of B cells in lymphoid organs with decrease in the spleen but increase in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood. Furthermore, the bone marrow of MIM(-/-) mice contained a higher percentage of pre-B2 cells but fewer immature B-cells than wild-type mice. In response to CXCL13, a B-cell chemokine released from splenic stromal cells, MIM-deficient B-cells did not undergo chemotaxis or morphological changes in response to the chemokine and also did not internalize CXCR5, the receptor of CXCL13. Microarray analyses demonstrated that MIM is the only member of the I-BAR domain family that was highly expressed in human B cells. However, low or absent MIM expression was common in either primary B-cell malignancies or established B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphomas. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time an important role for MIM in B-cell development and suggest that predisposition of MIM-null mice to lymphomagenesis may involve aberrant interactions between B lineage cells and the lymphoid microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2059027548,"α1,6-Fucosyltransferase (Fut8) knock-out (Fut8−/−) mice showed an abnormality in pre-B cell generation. Membrane assembly of pre-BCR is a crucial checkpoint for pre-B cell differentiation and proliferation in both humans and mice. The assembly of pre-BCR on the cell surface was substantially blocked in the Fut8-knockdown pre-B cell line, 70Z/3-KD cells, and then completely restored by re-introduction of the Fut8 gene to 70Z/3-KD (70Z/3-KD-re) cells. Moreover, loss of α1,6-fucosylation (also called core fucosylation) of μHC was associated with the suppression of the interaction between μHC and λ5. In contrast to Fut8+/+ CD19+CD43− cells, the subpopulation expressing the μHC·λ5 complex in the Fut8−/− CD19+CD43− cell fraction was decreased. The pre-BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of CD79a and activation of Btk were attenuated in Fut8-KD cells, and restored in 70Z/3-KD-re cells. The frequency of CD19lowCD43− cells (pre-B cell enriched fraction) was also reduced in Fut8−/− bone marrow cells, and then the levels of IgM, IgG, and IgA of 12-week-old Fut8−/− mice sera were significantly lower than those of Fut8+/+ mice. Our results suggest that the core fucosylation of μHC mediates the assembly of pre-BCR to regulate pre-BCR intracellular signaling and pre-B cell proliferation. α1,6-Fucosyltransferase (Fut8) knock-out (Fut8−/−) mice showed an abnormality in pre-B cell generation.

https://openalex.org/W2164564454,"TFIIB is essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. TFIIB also cross-links to terminator regions and is required for gene loops that juxtapose promoter-terminator elements in a transcription-dependent manner. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae sua7-1 mutation encodes an altered form of TFIIB (E62K) that is defective for both start site selection and gene looping. Here we report the isolation of an ssl2 mutant, encoding an altered form of TFIIH, as a suppressor of the cold-sensitive growth defect of the sua7-1 mutation. Ssl2 (Rad25) is orthologous to human XPB and is a member of the SF2 family of ATP-dependent DNA helicases. The ssl2 suppressor allele encodes an arginine replacement of the conserved histidine residue (H508R) located within the DEVH-containing helicase domain. In addition to suppressing the TFIIB E62K growth defect, Ssl2 H508R partially restores both normal start site selection and gene looping. Moreover, Ssl2, like TFIIB, associates with promoter and terminator regions, and the diminished association of TFIIB E62K with the PMA1 terminator is restored by the Ssl2 H508R suppressor. These results define a novel, functional interaction between TFIIB and Ssl2 that affects start site selection and gene looping."
https://openalex.org/W2033400142,"In this report we describe the contribution of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) derived from the inducible microsomal PGE-synthase type-1 (mPGES-1) to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogenic drive in tumor epithelial cells and in tumor-bearing mice. EGFR stimulation upregulated expression of mPGES-1 in HT-29, A431 and A549 cancer cells. Egr-1, a transcription factor induced by EGF, mediated this response. The Egr-1 rise provoked the overexpression of mPGES-1 messenger and protein, and enhanced PGE2 formation. These changes were suppressed either by silencing Egr-1, or by upstream blockade of EGFR or ERK1/2 signals. Further, in a clonogenic assay on tumor cells, EGF induced a florid tumorigenic phenotype, which regressed when mPGES-1 was silenced or knocked down. EGF-induced mPGES-1 overexpression in epithelial cell reduced E-cadherin expression, whereas enhancing that of vimentin, suggesting an incipient mesenchymal phenotype. Additionally, inhibiting the EGFR in mice bearing the A431 tumor, the mPGES-1 expression and the tumor growth, exhibited a parallel decline. In conclusion, these findings provide novel evidence that a tight cooperation between the EGF/EGFR and mPGES-1 leads to a significant tumorigenic gain in epithelial cells, and provide clues for controlling the vicious association."
https://openalex.org/W2003028347,"Nucleostemin (NS), a nucleolar GTPase, is highly expressed in stem/progenitor cells and in most cancer cells. However, little is known about the regulation of its expression. Here, we identify the NS gene as a novel direct transcriptional target of the c-Myc oncoprotein. We show that Myc overexpression enhances NS transcription in cultured cells and in pre-neoplastic B cells from Eμ-myc transgenic mice. Consistent with NS being downstream of Myc, NS expression parallels that of Myc in a large panel of human cancer cell lines. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we show that c-Myc binds to a well-conserved E-box in the NS promoter. Critically, we show NS haploinsufficiency profoundly delays Myc-induced cancer formation in vivo. NS+/-Eμ-myc transgenic mice have much slower rates of B-cell lymphoma development, with life spans twice that of their wild-type littermates. Moreover, we demonstrate that NS is essential for the proliferation of Myc-overexpressing cells in cultured cells and in vivo: impaired lymphoma development was associated with a drastic decrease of c-Myc-induced proliferation of pre-tumoural B cells. Finally, we provide evidence that in cell culture NS controls cell proliferation independently of p53 and that NS haploinsufficiency significantly delays lymphomagenesis in p53-deficient mice. Together these data indicate that NS functions downstream of Myc as a rate-limiting regulator of cell proliferation and transformation, independently from its putative role within the p53 pathway. Targeting NS is therefore expected to compromise early tumour development irrespectively of the p53 status."
https://openalex.org/W2008371777,"Overexpression of the transcriptional regulator Myc is thought to be the cause or a contributing factor in the development of a large number of human lymphomas and certain other cancers. Apoptotic cell death constitutes a tumor suppressive mechanism, particularly in the context of Myc overexpression. Accordingly, lymphoma development in Eμ-Myc transgenic mice, which mimic the Myc/IgH chromosomal translocation that causes Burkitt lymphoma, is accelerated by concomitant overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members or loss of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, such as Bim. Bim binds with high affinity to all pro-survival Bcl-2-like proteins and can also interact with Bax/Bak, but it remains unclear which of these interactions are critical for its tumor suppressive function. We have previously generated knock-in mutant mice in which the BH3 region of Bim has been exchanged with that for Bad, Noxa or Puma so that it can only bind to select pro-survival Bcl-2-like proteins: BimBad binding to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1 or A1; BimNoxa binding only to Mcl-1 and A1 and as a control, BimPuma, which can still bind all pro-survival Bcl-2-like proteins. We have now inter-crossed these Bim mutant mice with Eμ-Myc transgenic mice, and found that both the BimBad and the BimNoxa mutations but not the BimPuma mutation greatly accelerate Myc-induced lymphoma development and increase leukemic burden. These results demonstrate that for optimal tumor suppressive activity, Bim must be able to interact with all and not just select pro-survival Bcl-2 family members."
