https://openalex.org/W2109173122,"Two methods were utilized to demonstrate the peroxidation of chloride ion to a free species (HOCl or Cl2) by myeloperoxidase. The peroxidase caused the volatilization of radioactivity from soultions containing hydrogen peroxide and [36Cl]NaCl, and catalyzed the formation of HOCl when solutions contianing these components were passed through a Millipore filter to which the peroxidase was adsorbed. In this flow system, 90 mug of canine myeloperoxidase generated 80 muM HOCl in the presence of 200 muM H2O2 at a rate corresponding to a turnover of 100 min-1. Under these conditions, o-tolidine, whose oxidation can be coupled to Cl- peroxidation in free solution, did not accelerate turnover. In contrast to chloroperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase, myeloperoxidase does not utilize chlorite for chlorination reactions. This oxidant inactivates the enzyme. At low pH, chloride ion suppresses the oxidation of myeloperoxidase (to the stable compound II) by both hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite. Acceptor chlorination is therefore not a rate-controlling reaction in the myeloperoxidase mechanism, and the potential of the functional peroxidase couple is higher than the HOCl/Cl- couple under chlorinating conditions. The product-forming step may be a reverse of compound I formation at the expense of HOCl, rather than the chlorination of Cl- by a chloroperoxidase-like chlorinating intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1527731832,"[125I]Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, an extremely potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, has been purified to theoretical specific activity (2200 Ci/mmol) and used as a ligand to characterize the beta-adrenergic receptors of cultured rat glioma cells and other cultured cell clones. Appropriate receptor sites were identified by stereoselective competition for binding by a number of adrenergic agonists and antagonists, by correlation between the potency of these compounds to inhibit binding and to affect adenylate cyclase activity, and by correlation of binding with the presence or absence of response to catecholamines (stimulation of adenylate cyclase) in various cell clones. In equilibrium experiments, the dissociation constant for binding of the iodinated ligand to the beta-adrenergic receptor of a clone of rat glioma cells (C6TG1A) was 250 pM; the corresponding value for a clone of human fibroblasts (VA2) was 15 pM. For C6TG1A, KD was verified by analysis of the kinetics of binding: k1 = 10(8) 1/mol/min: k-1 = 0.017/min. This rate of dissociation of ligand from the receptor was also established by study of the rate of activation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol after prior equilibration with iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. For VA2 cells, where affinity was higher, the rate of reversal of binding was only 0.0035/min. C6TG1A contained approximately 4000 receptor sites/cell (75 fmol/mg of protein), and these sites appeared to be coupled to adenylate cyclase in a stoichiometric manner. A second site with equal affinity for iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (KD = 250 pM) was also identified in C6TG1A by both kinetic analysis and equilibrium binding studies. While most compounds that interacted with the beta-adrenergic receptor also influenced binding to the second site, the latter did not distinguish between stereoisomers of propranolol, and its affinity for the other compounds tested was poorer."

In comparison to the prepubescent rat, adults have higher estrogen binding in the liver and greater increases in plasma renin substrate after administration of estrogen. The protein in the liver which binds estrogen may be an estrogen receptor involved in modulating hepatic synthesis of selective plasma proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1553688094,"Pure cholesterol associated in complexes with lipoproteins (whole serum and human low density lipoproteins) or esterified with succinic acid (cholesteryl succinate) and bound to albumin effectively suppresses 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells grown in lipoprotein-poor serum medium during short 4-hour) incubation periods. Simultaneous measurments of the kinetics of uptake of radioactive unesterified cholesterol of whole serum and cholesteryl succinate, their conversion to lipid products, and the decay in enzyme activity, suggest that the cholesterol-induced suppression is mediated by the sterol itself rather than by inhibitory lipid products derived from its metabolism. Several cholesterol derivatives such as cholestenone, 7-ketocholesterol, and 7alpha-and 25-hydroxycholesterol also suppress reductase activiy in HTC cells and are significantly more inhibitory than the pure cholesterol preparations. The decrease in enzyme activity produced by cholesterol and its derivatives is concentration-dependent and specific. [1-14C]Oleate incorporation experiments indicate that cholesterol ester formation in HTC cells is not increased at inhibitory concentrations of the steroids. These data suggest that sterol ester formation is not an obligatory process in the feedback control of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The half-life of the reductase (3 to 4 hours) is not significantly changed by cycloheximide, plus or minus whole serum, and cholesteryl succinate. In contrast, the half-life is strongly reduced when HTC cells are incubated with cycloheximide plus maximal concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, or cholestenone, resulting in t1/2 values of 24, 36, and 60 min, respectively. Increasing concentrations of whole serum and cholesteryl succinate have no significant effect on the apparent rate constant of inactivation of the enzyme, whereas its apparent rate of synthesis is decreased 3- and 10-fold, respectively. These results are reversed with oxygenated steroid inhibitors. The rate of synthesis of reductase is essentially unchanged as the concentrations of 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, and cholestenone are increased in the culture medium, whereas the apparent rate constant for degradation is increased 9-, 7-, and 3-fold, respectively. HMG-CoA reductase activity in HTC cells thus appears to be modulated by two different mechanisms in which steroid structure is important. Whole serum and cholesteryl succinate specifically decrease the rate of enzyme synthesis, while 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, and cholestenone increase the rate of inactivation of the reductase."

https://openalex.org/W1592231331,"Treatment of either beef heart or rat liver mitochondrial ATPase with the arginine reagent, 2,3-butanedione, resulted in enzyme inactivation. The reaction followed pseudo-first order kinetics until 90 to 95% of the enzyme had been inactivated, and prolonged incubation with butanedione resulted in complete inactivation. When the modification reaction was performed in the presence of ATP, the rate of inactivation was significantly decreased. The kinetics of inactivation indicates that the reaction of 1 molecule of reagent per active site of beef heart mitochondrial ATPase is necessary for inactivation. The loss of ATPase activity was also observed when submitochondrial particles were treated with butanedione. Studies with beef heart mitochondrial ATPase indicated that the inactivation was not due to enzyme dissociation into subunits. Kinetic studies with partially inactivated enzyme demonstrated that the Km values of ITP and of ATP in the presence of HCO3-were similar to the same constants for the control enzyme. When ATP was used as the substrate in the absence of anion activator, the partially inactivated enzyme still exhibited negative cooperativity. Inactivation was also observed when beef heart mitochondrial ATPase was treated with another arginine reagent, phenylglyoxal. The loss of ATPase activity was analyzed in terms of [14C]phenylglyoxal incorporation. From the present studies it is concluded that arginyl residues play an essential role in mitochondrial ATPase, probably at the hydrolytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1573034460,"Isolated adipocytes, incubated in the presence of extracellular 32Pi to steady state 32P incorporation into cellular phosphopeptides, were exposed to hormones for 5 min. Epinephrine (10(-6) M) stimulated 32P incorporation into at least 12 major phosphopeptides, distributed in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane. Quantitatively pre-eminent among these were peptides of molecular weight 123,000 and 69,000, each located both in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. The effect of epinephrine (10(-7) M) on 32P incorporation into these two peptides was augmented by theophylline (10(-3) M) in a synergistic fashion. Norepinephrine, dibutyryl N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (synthetic 1 to 24 fragment), and glucagon mimicked the effect of epinephrine. Insulin modified adipocyte peptide phosphorylation in two ways. When present as the sole hormone, insulin (100 microunits/ml) consistently and selectively stimulated the 32P incorporation into a peptide of molecular weight 123,000 (endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm) without significant alteration in the 32P content of any other major peptide. A second effect of insulin was evident when epinephrine (10(-6) M) was present simultaneously. Insulin significantly inhibited the epinephrine-stimulated phosphorylation of the molecular weight 69,000 (endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm) and 26,000 (plasma membrane) peptides. Nevertheless, persistence of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the 123,000 peptide in the presence of epinephrine was shown by a 32P content of this peptide that was greater in the presence of both hormones than with either individually. These findings indicate that in intact adipocytes: (a) epinephrine acutely alters the phosphorylation of a large number of adipocyte peptides, partly at least, via activation of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase; (b) insulin opposes several epinephrine-stimulated phosphorylations in a manner consitent with its ability to lower epinephrine-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation in adipocytes; and (c) insulin, in addition, exerts a unique stimulatory effect on adipocyte peptide phosphorylation that is independent of its effects on cyclic AMP metabolism and may be medicated by the generation of an as yet undefined intracellular messenger unique to insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1538459223,"Basement membrane procollagen biosynthesis was studied in organ cultures of embryonic rat parietal yolk sac endoderm by following [14C]proline incorporation into nondialyzable proteins. After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol the 14C-proteins synthesized were characterized by agarose gel filtration and disc electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The labeled procollagen was identified by its content of hydroxy[14C]proline, its sensitivity to digestion with bacterial collagenase, and its resistance to digestion with pepsin. In cultures which were continuously labeled for periods from 6 hours to 4 days, the pro-alpha chains consistently eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000. After pepsin digestion the resultant alpha chains had an apparent molecular weight between 125,000 and 140,000. This suggests that basement membrane procollagen either contains non-triple helical pepsin-resistant regions or a triple helical region which is larger than the corresponding region of interstitial procollagen. Two experiments were performed to determine whether the chains of newly synthesized basement membrane procollagen were cleaved to a smaller molecular species. In the first, the hydroxylation and secretion of procollagen were blocked with alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl, and the resulting intracellular chains of basement membrane protocollagen were found to co-elute with fully hydroxylated and secreted pro-alpha chains. In the second, cultures were labeled for 1 day and chased for 3 days with unlabeled medium. Autoradiography had shown that most of the label was chased into new basement membrane. Agarose chromotography showed that after 3-day chase the pro-alpha chains still eluted with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000. Thus, the data indicated that basement membrane procollagen was deposited in new basement membrane without undergoing a time-dependent extracellular conversion."

https://openalex.org/W1574890413,"The mechanism by which fatty acid addition leads to the inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in intact rat liver mitochondria was investigated. In all cases the fatty acid octanoate was added to mitochondria oxidizing succinate. Addition of fatty acid caused an inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in mitochondria incubated under State 3 conditions (glucose plus hexokinase), in uncoupled, oligomycin-treated mitochondria, and in rotenone-menadione-treated mitochondria, but not in uncoupled mitochondria or in mitochondria incubated under State 4 conditions. A number of metabolic conditions were found in which pyruvate dehydrogenase was inactivated concomitant with an elevation in the ATP/ADP ratio. This is consistent with the inverse relationship between the ATP/ADP ratio and the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity proposed by various laboratories. However, in several other metabolic conditions pyruvate dehydrogenase was inactivated while the ATP/ADP ratio either was unchanged or even decreased. This observation implies that there are likely other regulatory factors involved in the fatty acid-mediated inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Incubation conditions in State 3 were found in which the ATP/ADP and the acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratios remained constant and the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was correlated inversely with the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Other State 3 conditions were found in which the ATP/ADP and the NADH/NAD+ ratios remained constant while the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was correlated inversely with the acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio. Further evidence supporting these experiments with intact mitochondria was the observation that the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity of a mitochondrial extract was stimulated strongly by acetyl-CoA and was inhibited by NAD+ and CoASH. In contrast to acetyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA inhibited the kinase activity. These results indicate that the inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by fatty acid in isolated rat liver mitochondria may be mediated through effects of the NADH/NAD+ ratio and the acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio on the interconversion of the active and inactive forms of the enzyme complex catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase."

These interferons were partially purified by immunoabsorbance and by gel filtration. On treatment with glycosidases, about 80% of the 3H-labeled sugar moieties in this glycoprotein-containing fraction was removed without detectable alteration of the antiviral activity or antibody-binding properties characteristic of interferon. The molecular weight of leukocyte interferon was reduced by about 4000. As others have reported, the heterogeneous character of interferon revealed by isoelectric focusing was greatly reduced by the enzyme treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1536186327,"The administration of glucagon, adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, or N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate caused an increase in the phosphorylation of rat liver ribosomes. The increase (approximately 3-fold) was in the protein of the small ribosomal subunit. The proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioautographs were made of the gels. The effect of the hormone and of the nucleotides was entirely due to an increase in the phosphorylation of the 40 S ribosomal subunit protein S6."
https://openalex.org/W1918421567,"The activity of ornithine decarboxylase increases markedly in a biphasic manner during the hormone-dependent development of mouse mammary epithelium in vitro. The first peak of activity occurring at 3 to 4 hours of culture was elicited by incubating mammary explants in a culture medium without any added hormones, although addition of insulin or prolactin, or both, caused a greater increase. The emergence of the second peak of activity at about 12 hours depended on the actions of both insulin and prolactin. A second increase in activity could also be effected postmitotically by the delayed addition of prolactin. Studies with actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggest that the first increase in enzyme activity may be effected at a post-transcriptional level, whereas a second increase may be at both transcriptional and translational levels. During the first 3 hours of incubation, there was a rapid, transient increase in cyclic AMP concentration in mammary epithelium. The presence of insulin or prolactin in culture did not affect the change in epithelial cyclic AMP concentration. Addition of several derivatives of cyclic AMP, 0.1 to 0.5 mM, as well as prostaglandin E1, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, resulted in enhancement of the first increase in enzyme activity. The effect of cyclic nucleotide was additive to that of insulin and prolactin and appears to be mediated at a post-transcriptional level. The stimulatory effect of a lower concentration of both the cyclic nucleotide and prostaglandin E1 was augmented by theophylline, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. These results may suggest possible involvement of cyclic AMP in the first increase in enzyme activity that occurs in the absence of any added hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1574455334,"Guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP)-dependent protein kinase was purified from the guinea pig fetal lung, a tissue shown to be the richest in this enzyme in all mammalian sources examined, and its general properties studied. The enzyme was purified 150-fold from crude extract by steps of pH 5.4 isoelectric precipitation, Sephadex G-200 filtration, hydroxylapatite treatment and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The purified enzyme, free from contamination with adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase, had a specific activity at least equivalent to 600-fold purification of the enzyme from the adult lung. The pulmonary enzyme exhibited an absolute requirement of protein kinase modulator (prepared from various mammalian tissues with an exception of skeletal muscle) for its activity. Inhibitor protein of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase purified from rabbit skeletal muscle could not stimulate nor inhibit the cyclic GMP target enzyme, indicating the factors from mammalian sources regulating the two classes of protein kinases may not be the same. The enzyme had Ka values of 1.3 times 10(-8) and 3.3 times 10(-8) M for 8-bromo cyclic GMP and cyclic GMP, respectively, compared to 3.0 times 10(-6) M for cyclic AMP. Cyclic GMP lowered the Km of the enzyme for ATP from 6.3 times 10(-5) M in its absence to 2.1 times 10(-5) M in its presence, accompanied by an approximate doubling of the Vmax. The molecular weight of the enzyme (assayed by its catalytic and cyclic GMP-binding abilities) was estimated to be 123,000, corresponding to a sedimendation coefficient of 7.06 S, by means of sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme required Mg2+ and Co2+ for its activity with optimal concentrations of about 30 and 0.7 mM, respectively. The maximal activity seen in the presence of Mg2+, however, was nearly twice as high as that seen in the presence of Co2+. Histones were generally effective substrates for the enzyme, whereas protamine, casein, phosvitin, phosphorylase kinase, and activator protein of phosphodiesterase were not. The cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme exhibited a greater affinity for histones than did the cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme in the presence of Mg2+."

https://openalex.org/W1583798495,"The effects of insulin and glucagon on glycogen metabolism were studied in cultured fetal hepatocytes transplanted from 15-day-old fetuses. The effects of these hormones were examined just after transplantation, when the cells contained only minute amounts of glycogen, and during the 3 to 4 day culture period, when the hepatocytes were exposed to 10 muM cortisol and actively accumulated glycogen. At all stages of the culture, glucagon addition (10 nM) was followed by a rapid depletion of labeled glycogen, previously synthesized during a pulse labeling with [14C]glucose: this effect was mimicked by N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) (0.3 to 1 nM). Such a glycogenolytic effect of glucagon was observed even 6 hours after transplantation, i.e. at a time when cortisol was not present. In addition, glucagon clearly induced cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monosphosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in cells grown for 18 hours in the absence of cortisol. With cells grown for 3 days in the presence of cortisol, glucagon-dependent glycogenolysis was also obtained when cortisol was removed from the medium 20 hours before hormone addition. Thus the presence of cortisol is not necessary either to maintain a response to glucagon or for the onset of the glycogenolytic effect of glucagon. Insulin addition (10 nM) stimulated [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen at all stages of the culture when grown in the presence of cortisol; no glycogenic response to insulin was observed 6 hours after transplantation where cortisol was not previously introduced. In addition, if the hepatocytes were grown in the presence of insulin alone (i.e. in the absence of cortisol) no significant storage of glycogen occurred. Maximal storage (or labeling) of glycogen was observed when hepatocytes were grown in the presence of both cortisol and insulin. The presence of cortisol was therefore necessary for the expression of the glycogenic effect of insulin. These data show that marked difference exist between the onset of developmental responses towards glucagon and insulin. The glucagon-dependent regulatory pathway should be present very early in fetal development and should not depend on cortisol. On the contrary, the onset of the insulin-dependent regulatory pathway seems to be induced during culture, and it is likely that this is caused by cortisol."

This fraction, which represents less than 5% of the total chromatin protein content, binds preferentially to unique, double-stranded sequences of fractionated homologous DNA. The interactions are strong at low ionic strength (Km = 6.7 X 10(-9) M) and decrease with rising salt concentration. Complexes of the NP protein fraction with homologous DNA are immunologically tissue-specific.

https://openalex.org/W1581029239,"The oxidation of formaldehyde by rat liver mitochondria in the presence of 50 mM phosphate was enhanced 2-fold by exogenous NAD+. Absolute requirement of NAD+ for formaldehyde oxidation was demonstrated by depleting the mitochondria of their NAD+ content (4.6 nmol/mg of protein), followed by reincorporation of the NAD+ into the depleted mitochondria. Aldehyde (formaldehyde) dehydrogenase activity was completely abolished in the depleted mitochondria, but the enzyme activity was restored to control levels following reincorporation of the pyridine nucleotide. Phosphate stimulation of formaldehyde oxidation could not be explained fully by the phosphate-induced swelling which enhances membrane permeability to NAD+, since stimulation of the enzyme activity by increased phosphate concentrations was still observed in the absence of exogenous NAD+. The Km for formaldehyde oxidation by the mitochondria was found to be 0.38 nM, a value similar to that obtained with varying concentrations of NAD+; both Vmax values were very similar, giving a value of 70 to 80 nmol/min/mg of protein. The pH optimum for the mitochondrial enzyme was 8.0. Inhibition of the enzyme activity by anaerobiosis was apparently due to the inability of the respiratory chain to oxidize the generated NADH. The inhibition of mitochondrial formaldehyde oxidation by succinate was found to be due to a lowering of the NAD+ level in the mitochondria. Succinate also inhibited acetaldehyde oxidation by the mitochondria. Malonate, a competitive inhibitor of succinic dehydrogenase, blocked the inhibitory effect of succinate. The respiratory chain inhibitors, rotenone, and antimycin A plus succinate, strongly inhibited formaldehyde oxidation by apparently the same mechanism, although the crude enzyme preparation (freed from the membrane) was slightly sensitive to rotenone. The mitochondria were subfractionated, and 85% of the enzyme activity was found in the inner membrane fraction (mitoplast). Furthermore, separation into inner membrane and matrix components indicated a distribution of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity similar to malic dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1571909926,Physicochemical techniques were used to investigate the activation of C55-isoprenoid alcohol phosphokinase by synthetic lecithins. Complexes of the enzyme with phospholipids were prepared using a method employing sodium dodecyl sulfate as a protein-solubilizing agent. Circular dichorism and the intrinsic fluorescence of the kinase were used as optical probes of protein conformation with these complexes. No evidence for a major lipid-dependent conformational change in the protein was observed when these complexes were studied under conditions where the lipid mesomorphic transitions occurred. EPR studies of mixtures of synthetic lecithins and the C55-isoprenoid alcohol indicated a correlation between kinase activity and the rotational diffusion rate within the hydrophobic phase. It is concluded that the lipid physical state probably does not affect the enzyme activity by altering the protein conformation but more likely does so by affecting the motion of the molecular participants in the reaction.

Most pairs tested showed an optimal hydrophilic-lipophilic balance number for kinase activation in the hydrophobic range of 6 to 9. Thus, there appears to be both a structural and a relative hydrophobic requirement for activation, and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance number may be a measure of the physical properties of the lipid required for activation."
