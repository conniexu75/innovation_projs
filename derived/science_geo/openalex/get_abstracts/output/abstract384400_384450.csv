https://openalex.org/W2175853567,"Transcription factors control cell-specific gene expression programs through interactions with diverse coactivators and the transcription apparatus. Gene activation may involve DNA loop formation between enhancer-bound transcription factors and the transcription apparatus at the core promoter, but this process is not well understood. Here we report that mediator and cohesin physically and functionally connect the enhancers and core promoters of active genes in murine embryonic stem cells. Mediator, a transcriptional coactivator, forms a complex with cohesin, which can form rings that connect two DNA segments. The cohesin-loading factor Nipbl is associated with mediator–cohesin complexes, providing a means to load cohesin at promoters. DNA looping is observed between the enhancers and promoters occupied by mediator and cohesin. Mediator and cohesin co-occupy different promoters in different cells, thus generating cell-type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene expression program of each cell. The control of embryonic stem-cell state is not yet fully understood, but is fundamental to our knowledge of human development and to making progress in regenerative medicine. The gene-expression programs that make stem cells pluripotent are controlled by transcription factors — such as Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog — in a process thought to involve gene activation through DNA loop formation between enhancer-bound transcription factors and the transcription apparatus at the core promoter. Two factors, Mediator and cohesin, are shown here to connect the enhancers and core promoters of active genes in embryonic stem cells by generating cell-type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene-expression program of each cell. These results suggest that diseases caused by mutations in Mediator and cohesin — including Opitz–Kaveggia syndrome, Lujan syndrome, schizophrenia and Cornelia de Lange syndrome — are associated with defects in the cell-type-specific chromatin structure that is established by these protein complexes. Gene activation may involve the formation of a DNA loop that connects enhancer-bound transcription factors with the transcription apparatus at the core promoter. But this process is not well understood. Here, two proteins, mediator and cohesin, are shown to connect the enhancers and core promoters of active genes in embryonic stem cells. These proteins seem to generate cell-type-specific DNA loops linked to the gene expression program of each cell."
https://openalex.org/W2167381746,"Isolated, atomically thin conducting membranes of graphite, called graphene, have recently been the subject of intense research with the hope that practical applications in fields ranging from electronics to energy science will emerge. Here, we show that when immersed in ionic solution, a layer of graphene takes on new electrochemical properties that make it a trans-electrode. The trans-electrode's properties are the consequence of the atomic scale proximity of its two opposing liquid-solid interfaces together with graphene's well known in-plane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are revealed by ionic conductivity measurements on a CVD grown graphene membrane that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Despite this membrane being only one to two atomic layers thick, we find it is a remarkable ionic insulator with a very small stable conductivity that depends on the ion species in solution. Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has been drilled show that the membrane's effective insulating thickness is less than one nanometer. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal substrate for very high-resolution, high throughput nanopore based single molecule detectors. Sensors based on modulation of graphene's in-plane electronic conductivity in response to trans-electrode environments and voltage biases will provide new insights into atomic processes at the electrode surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1967205858,"The reliable detection of single quantum particles has revolutionized the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing. For several years, researchers have aspired to extend such detection possibilities to larger scale strongly correlated quantum systems, in order to record in-situ images of a quantum fluid in which each underlying quantum particle is detected. Here we report on fluorescence imaging of strongly interacting bosonic Mott insulators in an optical lattice with single-atom and single-site resolution. From our images, we fully reconstruct the atom distribution on the lattice and identify individual excitations with high fidelity. A comparison of the radial density and variance distributions with theory provides a precise in-situ temperature and entropy measurement from single images. We observe Mott-insulating plateaus with near zero entropy and clearly resolve the high entropy rings separating them although their width is of the order of only a single lattice site. Furthermore, we show how a Mott insulator melts for increasing temperatures due to a proliferation of local defects. Our experiments open a new avenue for the manipulation and analysis of strongly interacting quantum gases on a lattice, as well as for quantum information processing with ultracold atoms. Using the high spatial resolution, it is now possible to directly address individual lattice sites. One could, e.g., introduce local perturbations or access regions of high entropy, a crucial requirement for the implementation of novel cooling schemes for atoms on a lattice."
https://openalex.org/W2053856108,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are produced by reprogramming differentiated adult cells using a cocktail of transcription factors. They share many properties that are characteristic of embryonic stem (ES) cells generated by somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), and of ES cells from naturally fertilized embryos. The three cell types are not identical, however, and an interesting difference has now been discovered: iPS cells retain an 'epigenetic memory' of the donor tissue from which they derive, whereas SCNT-based reprogramming resets the DNA-methylation state of adult cells so it is closer to the ES cell-like state. In a separate study, Ji et al. examine the role of specific DNA methylation marks in the developmental progression of particular cell lineages. They present a genome-wide DNA-methylation analysis of haematopoietic cell populations that reveals remarkable epigenetic plasticity. Changes in DNA methylation emerge as perhaps a principal factor directing cell-fate choices such as commitment to myeloid or lymphoid development. During haematopoiesis, multipotent progenitors differentiate into progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors. A comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of haematopoietic cell populations with well-characterized differentiation potentials reveals remarkable epigenetic plasticity during lymphoid and myeloid restriction. Epigenetic modifications must underlie lineage-specific differentiation as terminally differentiated cells express tissue-specific genes, but their DNA sequence is unchanged. Haematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study epigenetic modifications during cell-fate decisions, as multipotent progenitors (MPPs) differentiate into progressively restricted myeloid or lymphoid progenitors. Although DNA methylation is critical for myeloid versus lymphoid differentiation, as demonstrated by the myeloerythroid bias in Dnmt1 hypomorphs1, a comprehensive DNA methylation map of haematopoietic progenitors, or of any multipotent/oligopotent lineage, does not exist. Here we examined 4.6 million CpG sites throughout the genome for MPPs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and thymocyte progenitors (DN1, DN2, DN3). Marked epigenetic plasticity accompanied both lymphoid and myeloid restriction. Myeloid commitment involved less global DNA methylation than lymphoid commitment, supported functionally by myeloid skewing of progenitors following treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Differential DNA methylation correlated with gene expression more strongly at CpG island shores than CpG islands. Many examples of genes and pathways not previously known to be involved in choice between lymphoid/myeloid differentiation have been identified, such as Arl4c and Jdp2. Several transcription factors, including Meis1, were methylated and silenced during differentiation, indicating a role in maintaining an undifferentiated state. Additionally, epigenetic modification of modifiers of the epigenome seems to be important in haematopoietic differentiation. Our results directly demonstrate that modulation of DNA methylation occurs during lineage-specific differentiation and defines a comprehensive map of the methylation and transcriptional changes that accompany myeloid versus lymphoid fate decisions."

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome encodes multiple microRNA genes of its own. Here we report that primary transcripts of ebv-miR-BART6 (pri-miR-BART6) are edited in latently EBV-infected cells. Editing of wild-type pri-miR-BART6 RNAs dramatically reduced loading of miR-BART6-5p RNAs onto the microRNA-induced silencing complex. Editing of a mutation-containing pri-miR-BART6 found in Daudi Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma C666-1 cell lines suppressed processing of miR-BART6 RNAs. Most importantly, miR-BART6-5p RNAs silence Dicer through multiple target sites located in the 3′-UTR of Dicer mRNA. The significance of miR-BART6 was further investigated in cells in various stages of latency. We found that miR-BART6-5p RNAs suppress the EBNA2 viral oncogene required for transition from immunologically less responsive type I and type II latency to the more immunoreactive type III latency as well as Zta and Rta viral proteins essential for lytic replication, revealing the regulatory function of miR-BART6 in EBV infection and latency.

https://openalex.org/W1972080672,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a molecule capable of initiating the release of intracellular Ca2+ required for many essential cellular processes. Recent evidence links two-pore channels (TPCs) with NAADP-induced release of Ca2+ from lysosome-like acidic organelles; however, there has been no direct demonstration that TPCs can act as NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channels. Controversial evidence also proposes ryanodine receptors as the primary target of NAADP. We show that TPC2, the major lysosomal targeted isoform, is a cation channel with selectivity for Ca2+ that will enable it to act as a Ca2+ release channel in the cellular environment. NAADP opens TPC2 channels in a concentration-dependent manner, binding to high affinity activation and low affinity inhibition sites. At the core of this process is the luminal environment of the channel. The sensitivity of TPC2 to NAADP is steeply dependent on the luminal [Ca2+] allowing extremely low levels of NAADP to open the channel. In parallel, luminal pH controls NAADP affinity for TPC2 by switching from reversible activation of TPC2 at low pH to irreversible activation at neutral pH. Further evidence earmarking TPCs as the likely pathway for NAADP-induced intracellular Ca2+ release is obtained from the use of Ned-19, the selective blocker of cellular NAADP-induced Ca2+ release. Ned-19 antagonizes NAADP-activation of TPC2 in a non-competitive manner at 1 μm but potentiates NAADP activation at nanomolar concentrations. This single-channel study provides a long awaited molecular basis for the peculiar mechanistic features of NAADP signaling and a framework for understanding how NAADP can mediate key physiological events.

Although originally discovered in sea urchin eggs, it is becoming increasing clear that NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is crucial to many physiological processes in a diverse range of mammalian cell types (5Patel S.

Many distinctive features of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release indicate that the Ca2+ release channels involved are functionally and structurally different from the well characterized Ca2+ release channels found on sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum stores (ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) (7Galione A.

NAADP triggers Ca2+ release from acidic stores, but the identity of the Ca2+ release channel involved has remained a mystery (7Galione A. Evans A.M. Ma J. Parrington J. Arredouani A. Cheng X.

The importance of TPC2 to Ca2+ movements across lysosomal membranes was recently shown in whole lysosome recordings. Mutation of TPC2 affected the magnitude of whole lysosomal Ca2+ currents, highlighting the need to investigate the conductance and gating properties of TPC2 at the single-channel level (13Schieder M.

Many characteristics of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release distinguish it from Ca2+ release triggered by other signaling molecules, and these indicate unusual underlying mechanisms of ion channel function. For the first time, we describe here the fundamental single-channel gating and conductance properties of purified human TPC2 and demonstrate that TPC2 exhibits many unique functional characteristics that can explain the idiosyncrasies of cellular NAADP signaling characteristics, whereas cardiac (RyR2) and skeletal (RyR1) RyRs do not. A preliminary report of these data has been presented in abstract form (17Pitt S.J. Funnell T. Zhu M.X. Sitsapesan M. Venturi E. Parrington J. Ruas M. Galione A. Sitsapesan R. Biophys.

The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) and kept for 60 min on ice before homogenization. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and kept on ice for 1 h, after which insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by adding non-immune rabbit serum coupled covalently to protein-A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with either non-immune rabbit serum (control) or polyclonal anti-TPC2 antibody (10Calcraft P.J. Ruas M. Pan Z. Cheng X. Arredouani A. Hao X.

Following removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed with IP buffer containing 1% CHAPS followed by two washes containing 0.1% CHAPS. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were eluted by incubation with the peptides used to raise the antibody, at 50 μg/ml in 0.1% CHAPS and 0.05% phosphatidylcholine for 4 h at 4 °C. The eluted protein complexes were dialyzed for 36 h at 4 °C in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm PIPES, 0.15 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, using a 20,000 molecular weight cut-off filter. After dialysis, an equal volume of 0.5 m sucrose solution was added and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before aliquoting and snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. Further information is provided in supplemental Methods. Purified TPC2, rabbit skeletal RyR1, or sheep cardiac RyR2 was incorporated into planar phosphatidylethanolamine lipid bilayers under voltage clamp conditions using previously described techniques (18Sitsapesan R. Montgomery R.A. MacLeod K.T. Williams A.J. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Current fluctuations were recorded at 22 ± 2 °C with either Ca2+ (cis, 250 mm HEPES, 80 mm Tris, 15 μm free Ca2+, pH 7.2/trans, 250 mm glutamic acid, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with Ca(OH)2 giving a free [Ca2+] of 50 mm) or K+ (symmetrical 210 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 15 μm free Ca2+, pH 7.2) as the permeant ion. Luminal pH was lowered to 4.8 by perfusing the trans chamber with a solution of 210 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm HEPES, 15 μm free [Ca2+]. Replacement of Cl− by acetate did not alter TPC2 conductance or gating (data not shown). Washout of the cis (cytosolic) chamber to exchange solutions took 2 min. The free [Ca2+] of all solutions was determined using a Ca2+ electrode (Orion 93-20; Thermo Orion, Boston, MA) as described previously (18Sitsapesan R. Montgomery R.A. MacLeod K.T. Williams A.J. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Current recordings were filtered at 800 Hz (−3 db) and digitized at 20 kHz (ITC-18, Instrutech Corporation) with WinEDR version 2.5.9 (Strathclyde University, UK) or Pulse (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz Germany). Measurements of single-channel current amplitudes were made using the single-channel analysis software WinEDR version 2.5.9 (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK). The closed and open current levels were assessed manually using cursors. Amplitude histograms were obtained from single-channel data using Clampfit version 10.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and fitted with Gaussian curves. In all records, amplitude histograms were best fit with a single Gaussian function representing the main conductance level (300 pS; see Fig. 2b). Subconductance state gating was too brief to be detected by this method of analysis. The channel open probability (Po) was determined over 3 min of continuous recording, using the method of 50% threshold analysis (19Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 483-587Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves were fit using a four-parameter logistical equation in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc). The Ca2+/K+ permeability ratio (PCa2+/PK+) was calculated using the equation given by Fatt and Ginsborg (1958) (20Fatt P. Ginsborg B.L. J. Physiol. 1958; 142: 516-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).PCa2+/PK+=[K+]/4×[Ca2+]×exp(Erev F/RT)×[exp⁡(Erev F/RT)+1](Eq. 1) The value of RT/F used in our calculations was 25.4 mV based on the recording temperature of 22 °C. The zero current reversal potential (Erev) was obtained under bi-ionic conditions (cis, 210 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2; trans, 210 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and represented the point where no current could be detected. Ned-19 was synthesized as described previously (21Naylor E. Arredouani A. Vasudevan S.R. Lewis A.M. Parkesh R. Mizote A. Rosen D. Thomas J.M. Izumi M. Ganesan A. Galione A. Churchill G.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and the l-trans-Ned-19 analog was used throughout. Mean ± S.D. (≥3) is shown unless otherwise stated. Student's t test was used to assess the difference between mean values. A p value of <0.05 was taken as significant. We purified the human recombinant TPC2 complex (Fig. 1a) for subsequent reconstitution into artificial membranes under voltage clamp conditions (18Sitsapesan R. Montgomery R.A. MacLeod K.T. Williams A.J. J. Physiol. 1991; 434: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Representative examples of the resulting single-channel currents in symmetrical solutions of 210 mm KCl, pH 7.2, are shown in Fig. 1b. In the absence of NAADP, occasional channel openings, usually too brief to fully resolve, were observed. NAADP addition to the cis chamber always increased Po (n = 101), whereas trans addition of NAADP had no effect (n = 5). In conditions where luminal Ca2+ was the permeant ion (Fig. 1c), NAADP still activated TPC2 from the cytosolic side only (n = 15). TPC2, therefore, incorporates into bilayers in a fixed orientation as described in the supplementary text, with the cis and trans chambers, most likely corresponding to the cytosolic and luminal sides of the acidic Ca2+ stores, respectively. These single-channel currents were not observed in control experiments (supplemental Fig. S1). In symmetrical 210 mm KCl, the single-channel conductance (Fig. 1d) was 300 ± 6 pS (S.E.; n = 5). Applying a KCl gradient (trans, 210 mm; cis, 510 mm), shifted the current-voltage relationship to the left with a reversal potential of −20.5 mV, indicating that, as for other Ca2+ release channels (22Lindsay A.R. Williams A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1064: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), TPC2 is ideally selective for cations. The current-voltage relationship shown in Fig. 1e revealed a Ca2+ conductance of 15 ± 1.5 pS (S.E.; n = 5), which is very small when compared with that for RyR2 (120 pS (24Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) and IP3R (53 pS (23Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 25Ehrlich B.E. Watras J. Nature. 1988; 336: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar)), using identical recording solutions. The relative permeability of TPC2 to monovalent and divalent cations was assessed by monitoring conductance with 210 mm K+ cis and 210 mm Ca2+ trans. As shown in Fig. 1f, under these conditions a Ca2+/K+ permeability ratio (PCa2+/PK+) of 2.6 was obtained. Thus, like RyR and IP3R, TPC2 is selective for cations but lacks strong discrimination between monovalent and divalent cations (22Lindsay A.R. Williams A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1064: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 24Tinker A.

These ion conduction properties of TPC2 predict a small unitary Ca2+ current through a single TPC2 channel under physiological conditions. This may explain some of the cellular characteristics of NAADP-activated Ca2+ release where small, localized rises in cytosolic Ca2+ either do not propagate throughout the cell (26Churchill G.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38687-38692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or require close proximity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum to trigger greater release of Ca2+ via RyR (27Kinnear N.P.

Nature. 2009; 459: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The small Ca2+ current expected through individual TPC2 channels provides an adaptable system; small Ca2+ release events are possible, but large Ca2+ fluxes could also be generated with high Ca2+ loading of stores if many TPC2 channels were closely arranged, especially if the gating of clusters of channels was coordinated (as appears to be a characteristic of TPC2; see point 3 below). TPC2 channel gating was characterized by four distinguishing features. 1) constitutive, infrequent brief openings in the absence of NAADP, which were not abolished by reducing cytosolic or luminal Ca2+ to 1 nm (data not shown); 2) transitions to a subconductance state (Fig. 1b, asterisks) ∼70% of the fully open channel level as detailed in Fig. 2, a and b; 3) episodic gating where multiple channels appear to open (and close) simultaneously in a synchronized or coupled fashion as shown in Fig. 2c; 4) slow onset in NAADP-induced activation as illustrated in Fig. 2d where Po was measured in 5-s segments. Fig. 3a shows TPC2 activation by NAADP. If [NAADP] was incremented in a cumulative fashion, channel activation plateaued at ∼1 μm (Fig. 3a), and higher [NAADP] had no further effect. However, if 1 mm NAADP was applied without first pretreating with activating concentrations, then the channels shut (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that high affinity activation and lower affinity inactivation sites are likely (29Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 30Morgan A.J. Galione A. Methods. 2008; 46: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Washout of NAADP did not reverse TPC2 activation (Fig. 3a, bottom trace), demonstrating that the activating action of NAADP was irreversible on the timescale of a single-channel experiment. Unexpectedly, the EC50 value (500 nm) was much higher than the Kd values reported for NAADP binding to membranes isolated from cells overexpressing TPC2 (5 nm) or membranes isolated from mouse liver (6.6 nm) (10Calcraft P.J. Ruas M. Pan Z. Cheng X. Arredouani A. Hao X. Tang J. Rietdorf K. Teboul L. Chuang K.T. Lin P. Xiao R. Wang C. Zhu Y. Lin Y. Wyatt C.N. Parrington J. Ma J. Evans A.M. Galione A. Zhu M.X. Nature. 2009; 459: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and we therefore investigated the possibility that physiological environmental factors could modulate TPC2 sensitivity to NAADP. The known Ca2+ release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum are very sensitive to luminal Ca2+ (23Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 821-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Sitsapesan R. Williams A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32Lukyanenko V. Györke I. Györke S. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 432: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether TPC2 could also be regulated by luminal Ca2+. Fig. 3a shows that at 10 μm luminal [Ca2+], 10 nm NAADP has little effect on TPC2. If, however, luminal Ca2+ is raised to 200 μm (Fig. 3b), then 10 nm NAADP becomes an optimally effective concentration, and the NAADP concentration-response relationship is shifted to the left with a dramatic 100-fold reduction in the EC50 value to 5 nm. Luminal Ca2+ therefore enables extremely low levels of NAADP to open TPC2. Fig. 3c shows that in the presence of 10 nm NAADP, which alone is ineffective, luminal Ca2+ increases Po in a concentration-dependent manner. It is significant that the range of luminal [Ca2+] that affects TPC2 Po (10 μm–1 mm) falls within the expected range of luminal [Ca2+] within lysosomal stores (33Lloyd-Evans E. Morgan A.J. He X. Smith D.A. Elliot-Smith E. Sillence D.J. Churchill G.C. Schuchman E.H. Galione A. Platt F.M. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in situ would be steeply dependent on lysosomal Ca2+ load. Depletion of Ca2+ stores below a threshold level could terminate TPC2 Ca2+ flux even in the maintained presence of NAADP, allowing for refilling of the stores until the threshold was again reached. This mechanism of luminal Ca2+ control could lead to the Ca2+ oscillations that are characteristic of NAADP signaling in physiological systems (10Calcraft P.J. Ruas M. Pan Z. Cheng X. Arredouani A. Hao X. Tang J. Rietdorf K. Teboul L. Chuang K.T. Lin P. Xiao R. Wang C. Zhu Y. Lin Y. Wyatt C.N. Parrington J. Ma J. Evans A.M. Galione A. Zhu M.X.

Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11223-11225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because TPCs are present on acidic stores and because NAADP induces alkalinization of acidic stores in sea urchin eggs (35Morgan A.J. Galione A. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is therefore important to ask whether pH affects TPC2 function. Fig. 4, a and b, demonstrate that when luminal pH is reduced from 7.2 to 4.8, TPC2 remains sensitive to low concentrations of NAADP (EC50 = 5.5 nm), although Po levels are decreased. Importantly, activation by NAADP becomes reversible at luminal pH 4.8 (Fig. 4a, third trace), and the concentration-response relationship becomes bell-shaped (Fig. 4b), as is widely observed for NAADP-induced Ca2+ fluxes in mammalian cells (29Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In this way, luminal pH behaves as a molecular switch, modifying the conformation of the NAADP binding site so that NAADP can dissociate from TPC2. The final Po achieved by a rise in NAADP levels is therefore a function of both the luminal pH and the luminal-free [Ca2+]. In a cellular situation, such control would be expected to amplify the diversity of the NAADP signal as luminal pH could toggle between long lasting and transient Ca2+ release events. Because NAADP regulation of TPC2 is so heavily dependent on the luminal pH and [Ca2+], can these factors affect the latency of the NAADP response? Our experiments do not provide any evidence that the luminal environment plays a significant role in determining the rate of onset of channel activation, but the concentration of NAADP appears to be very important. Fig. 5 demonstrates that high concentrations of NAADP activate the channel with a significantly shorter delay than very low concentrations of NAADP. This is not unexpected for a ligand-gated ion channel. A key feature of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release is selective inhibition by the NAADP antagonist, Ned-19 (21Naylor E. Arredouani A. Vasudevan S.R. Lewis A.M. Parkesh R. Mizote A. Rosen D. Thomas J.M. Izumi M. Ganesan A. Galione A. Churchill G.C. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 36Rosen D. Lewis A.M. Mizote A. Thomas J.M. Aley P.K. Vasudevan S.R. Parkesh R. Galione A. Izumi M. Ganesan A. Churchill G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34930-34934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Ned-19 could antagonize NAADP activation of TPC2. Fig. 6a shows a typical experiment where TPC2 is activated by 10 nm NAADP. In the continued presence of NAADP, Ned-19 dose-dependently increased Po at low nanomolar levels but completely shut the channel at 1 μm (mean data shown in Fig. 6b). Washout of both NAADP and Ned-19 (Fig. 6a, bottom trace) reversed the inhibitory effects of Ned-19 but not the activation by NAADP, thereby demonstrating that Ned-19 does not close TPC2 by binding to NAADP activation sites. In the absence of NAADP, Ned-19 can activate TPC2 at nanomolar concentrations, as shown in Fig. 7a. Subsequent addition of NAADP in the continued presence of Ned-19 (100 nm) caused further channel activation. The histogram in Fig. 7b demonstrates that Ned-19 potentiates the effects of NAADP; the sum of the individual effects of 10 nm NAADP and 100 nm Ned-19 is less than the simultaneous action of 10 nm NAADP plus 100 nm Ned-19. In the absence of NAADP, at high concentrations (1 μm), Ned-19 closes the channel (see supplemental Fig. S3). We therefore show for the first time that Ned-19 is a high affinity activator of TPC2, that it closes the channel at high concentrations, and that, consistent with previous experiments measuring inhibition of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in isolated membranes (21Naylor E. Arredouani A. Vasudevan S.R. Lewis A.M. Parkesh R. Mizote A. Rosen D. Thomas J.M. Izumi M. Ganesan A. Galione A. Churchill G.C. Nat. Chem.

Our data strongly suggest that TPCs are the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ release channels but do not rule out the possibility that RyR channels are also relevant NAADP receptors/Ca2+ release channels. With identical recording conditions, optimized for luminal Ca2+ potentiation of cytosolic ligands, we investigated the effects of NAADP on RyR2 and RyR1. Fig. 8 shows that concentrations up to 1 μm had no significant effects on the Po of either isoform, suggesting that RyR channels are unlikely to be involved in NAADP Ca2+-signaling processes other than by indirect recruitment subsequent to Ca2+ release via another pathway, as suggested previously (5Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Our TPC2 studies reveal a number of specific gating mechanisms that link clearly with some of the more unusual aspects of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release and that provide a biophysical picture of how TPC2 may be regulated in a cellular environment. These include extreme sensitivity to NAADP, which is finely controlled by the luminal [Ca2+]. Luminal pH also modulates Po and the rate of dissociation of NAADP from TPC2, vastly changing the shape of the NAADP concentration-response relationship to a graded bell-shaped curve. The delayed onset in NAADP-induced activation of TPC2 that we observe may serve to explain previous reports of time dependence or delays in NAADP effects (34Churchill G.C. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11223-11225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Churamani D. Dickinson G.D. Ziegler M. Patel S. Biochem.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but it is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a simple, high affinity (NAADP is effective at 1 nm), bimolecular interaction between NAADP and TPC2. In this respect, we can draw parallels with another class of Ca2+ release channel, the RyRs and their interactions with ryanodine. Like NAADP, ryanodine also binds irreversibly to RyR with high affinity (Kd = 1.7 nm) (39Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 41Rousseau E. Smith J.S. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C364-C368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Buck E. Zimanyi I. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23560-23567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also like NAADP, the rate of association of ryanodine can be very slow (at 0 mV, 1 μm ryanodine takes >1 min to modify gating). 5R. Sitsapesan, unpublished data. Ryanodine is thought to bind only to open RyR channels, and the rate of association has been demonstrated to be dependent on the concentration of ryanodine and on the holding potential (43Lindsay A.R. Tinker A. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 425-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 44Chu A. Díaz-Muñoz M. Hawkes M.J. Brush K. Hamilton S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar). A similar situation may operate for NAADP interactions with TPC2. NAADP may only bind to certain conformations of TPC2, perhaps one or more particular closed or open states. To explain the synchronized gating that is induced by NAADP, we must depart from the parallel with ryanodine, but we may still maintain our analogy with RyR channels. Multiple RyR channels have been shown to open and close in synchrony, and the term “coupled gating” was first coined to describe this effect (45Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As for TPC2, coupled gating of RyR channels was originally proposed to be ligand-dependent (FK-506 binding protein-dependent), although the mechanism for this effect has not been elucidated (45Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Coupled gating of TPC2 is also ligand-dependent. Both NAADP and Ned-19 induce coupled gating but, as for RyR channels, we do not yet understand the mechanism underlying such behavior. Coupled gating of TPC2 would enable significant flexibility of NAADP-mediated effects, allowing a small conductance channel to produce larger Ca2+ signals. The fact that Ned-19 influences TPC2 gating by binding at sites other than the NAADP binding sites again shows parallels with other intracellular Ca2+ release channels. Both RyRs and IP3Rs possess various binding sites for a wide range of ligands, and this enables complex but flexible systems of Ca2+ release that can be fine-tuned to suit a diversity of biological processes. Fig. 9 incorporates our biophysical data into a predictive model of the regulation of TPC2 as the Ca2+ release channel of lysosome-like acidic Ca2+ stores. In the absence of activating ligands, TPC2 channels gate with very occasional brief openings (Po < 0.0009). We term this gating state of TPC2 the “constitutively active state.” Low concentrations of NAADP increase TPC2 Po, but this is characterized by (i) a delay in onset, (ii) frequent episodes of synchronized gating of multiple channels, and (iii) irreversible activation at pH 7.2 (on the timescale of a single-channel experiment). We term this gating state of TPC2 the “NAADP-activated state.” Thus, the rate of association of NAADP to TPC2 is slow, and the rate of dissociation of NAADP from TPC2 is even slower. The association rate does not appear to increase with either increases in luminal [Ca2+] or a change in pH but is concentration-dependent, being faster at 10 μm NAADP than at 10 nm NAADP as expected for a ligand-receptor interaction. At acidic pH (4.8), the rate of dissociation of NAADP from TPC2 is increased (NAADP binding to TPC2 is no longer irreversible). In contrast to the effects of low concentrations of NAADP, high concentrations of NAADP (1 mm) abolish even constitutive activity, and we term this state of TPC2 the “inactivated state.” The effects of high [NAADP] appear to be of rapid onset, but this is difficult to quantify because constitutive activity is so low. We have reconstituted immunopurified TPC2 into artificial membranes. How do our single-channel currents compare with the currents measured from whole lysosomes isolated from HEK293 cells overexpressing TPC2 (13Schieder M. Rötzer K. Brüggemann A. Biel M. Wahl-Schott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21219-21222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)? We demonstrate a Ca2+/K+ permeability ratio (PCa2+/PK+) of 2.6 and show, in many single-channel traces, that TPC2 is permeable to K+. In contrast, Schieder et al. (13Schieder M. Rötzer K. Brüggemann A. Biel M. Wahl-Schott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21219-21222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) conclude that TPC2 is impermeable to K+. However, it is possible that these authors were unable to accurately measure PCa2+/PK+ due to a gating mechanism that inactivated the channels (13Schieder M. Rötzer K. Brüggemann A. Biel M. Wahl-Schott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21219-21222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). With whole lysosome current recordings, it is difficult to determine whether a rectifying current is obtained because the channels are open but impermeable to K+ or whether the channels are shut due to a gating mechanism (inactivation or block). We have demonstrated that the luminal environment of TPC2 plays an important regulatory role. Perhaps there are additional luminal factors present within a lysosome that can affect TPC2 gating. In summary, purified TPC2 behaves as a functional ion channel and, crucially, possesses the conduction properties required of an intracellular Ca2+ release channel. TPC2 also exhibits a number of unusual gating characteristics that provide an underlying explanation for many of the peculiarities of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in cellular systems (9Ruas M. Rietdorf K. Arredouani A. Davis L.C. Lloyd-Evans E. Koegel H. Funnell T.M. Morgan A.J. Ward J.A. Watanabe K. Cheng X. Churchill G.C. Zhu M.X. Platt F.M. Wessel G.M. Parrington J. Galione A. Curr.

Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A key aspect of TPC2 regulation is that the sensitivity and reversibility of NAADP binding are controlled by the luminal pH and [Ca2+]. Further investigation into the detailed gating mechanisms by which NAADP and other agents can regulate TPC channels will be an exciting area for future research that will transform our understanding of cellular NAADP-mediated processes.

https://openalex.org/W1995635963,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that preferentially targets motor neurons. It was recently found that dominant mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding domain protein) and FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma) cause a subset of ALS. The convergent ALS phenotypes associated with TDP-43 and FUS/TLS mutations are suggestive of a functional relationship; however, whether or not TDP-43 and FUS/TLS operate in common biochemical pathways is not known. Here we show that TDP-43 and FUS/TLS directly interact to form a complex at endogenous expression levels in mammalian cells. Binding was mediated by an unstructured TDP-43 C-terminal domain and occurred within the context of a 300-400-kDa complex that also contained C-terminal cleavage products of TDP-43 linked to neuropathology. TDP-43 C-terminal fragments were excluded from large molecular mass TDP-43 ribonucleoprotein complexes but retained FUS/TLS binding activity. The functional significance of TDP-43-FUS/TLS complexes was established by showing that RNAi silencing of either TDP-43 or FUS/TLS reduced the expression of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6 mRNA. TDP-43 and FUS/TLS associated with HDAC6 mRNA in intact cells and in vitro, and competition experiments suggested that the proteins occupy overlapping binding sites. The combined findings demonstrate that TDP-43 and FUS/TLS form a functional complex in intact cells and suggest that convergent ALS phenotypes associated with TDP-43 and FUS/TLS mutations may reflect their participation in common biochemical processes."

PI3K phosphorylates membrane phosphatidylinositol-diphosphate to generate the second messenger lipid phosphatidylinositol-triphosphate, which in turn activates Akt. Activated Akt phosphorylates several downstream proteins to control cell survival and protein synthesis. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue), a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in various human cancers, inhibits Akt activation by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-triphosphate (23Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar). Decreased Pten expression levels and enhanced Akt activation are associated with hypertrophy in MC treated with high glucose or TGF-β (10Kato M. Putta S. Wang M. Yuan H. Lanting L. Nair I. Gunn A.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides that induce post-transcriptional gene repression by blocking protein translation (by binding to the 3′-UTR of their target genes) or by inducing mRNA degradation (25Bartel D.P.

Recent evidence suggests that miRNAs regulate the expression of key genes relevant to cancer and kidney diseases (28Croce C.M. Nat. Rev.

Huang X.R. Meng X. Lan H.Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21: 1317-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). On the other hand, miR-192 is down-regulated by TGF-β and inhibits E-cadherin expression through up-regulation of Zeb1 and Zeb2 in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (32Krupa A. Jenkins R. Luo D.D.

Vascular endothelial growth factor, a target of miR-93, is up-regulated by hyperglycemic conditions through down-regulation of miR-93, and collagen and fibronectin are up-regulated in parallel in kidney cells (35Long J.

An miRNA cluster (miR-216a and miR-217) targeting PTEN mediates TGF-β-induced activation of Akt in mouse MC (10Kato M. Putta S. Wang M. Yuan H. Lanting L. Nair I. Gunn A. Nakagawa Y. Shimano H. Todorov I. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). miR-216a and miR-217 are both located in an intron of a non-coding RNA, RP23-298H6.1-001 (RP23). Interestingly, this non-coding RNA (as well as miR-216a and miR-217) is regulated by TGF-β and miR-192 through E-boxes present in the RP23 promoter region. These TGF-β-triggered miRNA circuits and downstream signaling cascades result in enhanced ECM accumulation, hypertrophy, cell survival, and oxidant stress in MC related to the pathogenesis of DN (10Kato M. Putta S. Wang M. Yuan H. Lanting L. Nair I. Gunn A. Nakagawa Y. Shimano H. Todorov I. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms of enhanced mRNA translation of ECM and other proteins related to diabetic kidney diseases have been proposed (1Brosius F.C. Khoury C.C. Buller C.L. Chen S. Expert Rev. Endocrinol.

A recent report showed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 phosphorylation by Akt activated by TGF-β up-regulates Dab2 and interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducer translation (37Chaudhury A. Hussey G.S. Ray P.S. Jin G. Fox P.L. Howe P.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, a potential role for miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA translation in response to TGF-β in renal cells has not been fully studied. Here we show that TGF-β induces miR-216a in MC and down-regulates its target Ybx1, which regulates the translation of a binding partner RNA, Tsc-22. Furthermore, we uncovered a new mechanism by which Ybx1, Tsc-22, and Tfe3 coordinately mediate TGF-β-induced Col1a2 expression in MC. Primary mouse MC (MMC) were isolated and cultured as described (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mice were used 7 weeks after the onset of diabetes. db/db mice and genetic control db/+ mice (10 weeks old) were from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Glomeruli were sieved from the kidney as described (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ybx1- and TSC-22-stained areas in glomeruli were quantified using Image-Pro Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.). For processing body (P-body) detection, MMC were transfected with pcNEGFP-DCP1a (38Franks T.M. Lykke-Andersen J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 719-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) using a Nucleofector (Lonza). Cellular localization of P-bodies was detected by fluorescent microscopy. Immunofluorescence was performed as described (39Todorov I. Omori K. Pascual M. Rawson J. Nair I. Valiente L. Vuong T. Matsuda T. Orr C. Ferreri K. Smith C.V. Kandeel F. Mullen Y. Pancreas. 2006; 32: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.02% Triton-X-100, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, and immunostained using primary antibodies against Ybx1 and secondary antibodies conjugated with Texas Red. To detect the nuclei, cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma). Cells were visualized through a ×60 objective using appropriate filters on an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope (Olympus America). Separate images for each color were captured with a Pixera 600 CL camera using Viewfinder V3.0 software (Olympus), merged, and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. This was performed as described (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Antibodies against YBX1 (Abcam), phospho-YBX1, Akt, phospho-Akt, and actin (Cell Signaling), TFE3 (BD Biosciences), and TSC-22 (R&D Systems) were used. All primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. The proximal promoter of mouse Col1a2 gene was cloned by PCR using the primers below. The amplified fragment was cloned into pGL4 (Promega), and the sequence of the insert was confirmed. Humanized mouse Col1a2 proximal promoter was constructed by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). For mutagenesis, PCR was performed using Pfu Ultra polymerase and primers below. Primers for cloning the proximal promoter of mouse Col1a2 (lowercase denotes sequences added for cloning) are: 5′-gcacagatctCCCACGTAGGTGTCCTAAAGTGC-3′, 5′-cgactaagcttACCGTTCCCTCCAACTTAGTCG-3′.

The cross-linked chromatin was sheared and immunoprecipitated using antibodies against Tfe3, Tsc-22, or IgG (negative control). ChIP-enriched DNA was purified and used as template for real-time qPCRs using primers spanning E-box regions as described (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc.

Mouse Ybx1 3′-UTR region was amplified by PCR using primers below and high fidelity polymerase Pfu Ultra polymerase, digested with XhoI and NotI, and cloned into the NotI-XhoI site of psiCheck2 (Promega). Plasmid containing mouse Ybx1-3′-UTR sequence was used as a reporter (psiCheck2mYbx1-3′-UTR), whereas the plasmid containing the 3′-UTR sequence harboring a mutation in the miR-216a site was a negative control (psiCheck2mYbx1-3′-UTR-Mut). For mutagenesis of the miR-216a target site, two primers below were used. Tfe3 and its dominant negative mutant and shRNA expression vectors were described (10Kato M. Putta S. Wang M. Yuan H.

After 24 h, luciferase (Luc) activities were measured as described (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3432-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). For miRNA and shRNA experiments, cells were treated for 48 h. U6 promoter-driven shRNA expression vector targeting Ybx1 was constructed as described (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

After treatment with TGF-β, MMC were washed with cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 100 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 0.2 mm PMSF, and Complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and stored at −80 °C. For immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose beads (Promega) were swollen in NT2 buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 5% BSA. 300 μl of protein-A bead slurry was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of Ybx1 antibody. The antibody-coated beads were washed with ice-cold NT2 buffer and resuspended in 900 μl of NT2 buffer with 100 units/ml RNase inhibitor, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm EDTA. The beads were mixed well, and 100 μl of cell lysate was added. A 100-μl aliquot was removed for RNA sample without IP (input). The remaining mixture (900 μl) was rocked at room temperature for 2 h and then washed four times with ice-cold NT2 buffer followed by two washes with NT2 buffer with 1 m urea, resuspended in 100 μl of NT2 buffer with 0.1% SDS and 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K, and incubated for 30 min at 55 °C. RNAs were extracted by phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. RT-PCR was performed as described (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3432-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). For prediction of domain structures of TFE3 and TSC-22, on-line database SWISS-MODEL (42Kiefer F. Arnold K. Künzli M. Bordoli L. Schwede T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D387-D392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) was used. Downloaded results were further analyzed using the 3D Molecular Viewer (Vector NTI, Invitrogen) to depict interaction of two proteins through the leucine zipper (LZ) structure. Interaction between Tsc-22 and Tfe3 was examined by Co-IP. MMC treated with TGF-β were lysed in TNE buffer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, precleared with Protein-A beads for 1 h, immunoprecipitated with Tsc-22 antibody (goat IgG) or Tfe3 antibody (mouse IgG) overnight, washed 4 times with TNE buffer and eluted with SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using reciprocal antibodies as mentioned above. TGF-β treatment led to a significant decrease in Ybx1 mRNA (from 6 to 24 h) and protein levels at 24 h in MMC (Fig. 1, A and B). Ybx1 mRNA levels were also significantly lower in kidney glomeruli from type 1 diabetic mice (STZ-injected) (Fig. 1C) as well as type 2 diabetic mice (db/db) (Fig. 1D) when compared with their respective controls (control C57BL/6 and db/+). Parallel decrease in Ybx1 expression in glomeruli of these diabetic mice by immunostaining was observed when compared with their non-diabetic controls (Fig. 1, E–J). Ybx1 was suggested to be a potential target of miR-216a (43Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B.

We confirmed a significant increase in miR-216a levels in glomeruli of type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice when compared with corresponding control mice (Fig. 1, L and M) as reported previously (10Kato M.

TGF-β and Col1a2 gene expression levels were also increased in glomeruli from these diabetic mice (9Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Under both conditions (diabetic glomeruli and MMC treated with TGF-β), increased miR-216a and decreased Ybx1 levels were observed. These results suggest that increased miR-216a under diabetic conditions may inhibit the expression of its target, Ybx1. Because TGF-β activates Akt (10Kato M. Putta S. Wang M. Yuan H. Lanting L.

There is a need for anti-HEV research to understand the assembly process of HEV native capsid. Here, we produced a large virion-sized and a small T=1 capsid by expressing the HEV capsid protein in insect cells with and without the N-terminal 111 residues, respectively, for comparative structural analysis. The virion-sized capsid demonstrates a T=3 icosahedral lattice and contains RNA fragment in contrast to the RNA-free T=1 capsid. However, both capsids shared common decameric organization. The in vitro assembly further demonstrated that HEV capsid protein had the intrinsic ability to form decameric intermediate.

Sporadic cases have also been reported between outbreaks in HEV-endemic regions as well as in non-endemic areas, and these cases are transmitted through zoonotic route. The overall mortality rates of HEV during outbreaks range from 1 to 15% in general, and the highest mortality occurs in pregnant women, with fatality rates of up to 30% (1Naik S.R. Aggarwal R.

HEV consists of a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid and a single-stranded, positive-strand RNA genome of ∼7.2 kb that encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) (2Tam A.W. Smith M.M. Guerra M.E. Huang C.C. Bradley D.W. Fry K.E. Reyes G.R. Virology. 1991; 185: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The capsid protein, encoded by the ORF2, is composed of 660 amino acids and responsible for most capsid-related functions, such as virion assembly, host interaction, and immunogenicity. Like other hepatitis viruses, HEV is unable to propagate in currently available cell culture systems, and the research of HEV relies largely on the recombinant HEV capsid proteins (3Schofield D.J.

Virus-like particle (VLP) was obtained when the truncated HEV capsid protein was expressed in insect Tn5 cells with deletion of 52 residues from the C terminus and 111 residues from the N terminus (PORF2) (7Li T.C. Yamakawa Y. Suzuki K. Tatsumi M. Razak M.A. Uchida T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7207-7213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous structural analysis of this HEV-VLP by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provided a basic understanding of the quaternary arrangement of PORF2, where the reconstructed VLP displayed a T=1 icosahedral particle composed of 60 copies of PORF2 (8Xing L. Kato K. Li T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Hammar L. Cheng R.H. Virology. 1999; 265: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The essential element of PORF2 protein for T=1 VLP assembly includes amino acids 125–600 (9Li T.C. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Matsuura Y. Wang J.C. Engvall H. Hammar L. Xing L. Cheng R.H. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12999-13006Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently, the structural information was further refined by the crystal structures of genotype-3 T=1 VLP (10Yamashita T. Mori Y. Miyazaki N. Cheng R.H. Yoshimura M. Unno H. Shima R. Moriishi K. Tsukihara T. Li T.C. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Matsuura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which revealed the tertiary structure of PORF2 to the level of amino acids. However, the T=1 VLPs used in these experiments were much smaller than that of the native virion, which has a diameter of 320–340 Å, as determined by immuno-EM (12Balayan M.S. Andjaparidze A.G.

There is still a need to investigate the assembly pathway of HEV capsid. HEV virion is hypothesized to be made of 180 copies of the capsid protein (8Xing L. Kato K. Li T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Hammar L. Cheng R.H. Virology. 1999; 265: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Guu T.S. Liu Z. Ye Q. Mata D.A. Li K. Yin C. Zhang J. Tao Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we screened for HEV genotype expression and successfully produced a virion-sized VLP from the HEV genotype-3 ORF2 protein after deleting 52 residues from the C terminus. This VLP allowed us to investigate the molecular interactions that govern HEV virion assembly. HEV-VLPs were produced and purified according to the protocol described previously (7Li T.C. Yamakawa Y. Suzuki K. Tatsumi M. Razak M.A. Uchida T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7207-7213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li T.C. Scotti P.D. Miyamura T. Takeda N. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 10890-10896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant baculovirus Ac(G3n13ORF2), which harbored the genome of the N-terminal 13 amino-acid-deleted genotype-3 HEV ORF2, was infected into Tn5 cells with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The recombinant baculovirus-infected Tn5 cells were harvested at 7 days after infection. The medium and cells were separated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were treated with a denaturation buffer containing 50 mm sodium borate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and gently rocked at room temperature for 2 h. The lysate was diluted with EX-CELL 405, and centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 3 h in a Beckman SW32Ti rotor, and the pellet was resuspended in EX-CELL 405. The VLP was purified by multiple ultracentrifugations followed by separation on a CsCl density gradient. The final pellet was resuspended in 10 mm potassium MES buffer, pH 6.2. A homemade dialysis device was used in the disassembly and reassembly experiments because it allowed dialysis with a small amount of sample (20–40 μl). Purified VLP was disrupted by dialysis against buffer containing EDTA (10 mm) and DTT (20 mm) at different pHs. After VLP dissociation, 150 mm NaCl in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) was added, and sample was examined under the electron microscope after a 1-h incubation in the presence of the divalent ion Ca2+ (20 mm). Scanning TEM (STEM) was performed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory STEM facility, with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as an internal control. The mixture of VLP and TMV was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then maintained at −150 °C during data collection to eliminate contamination and reduce mass loss. The specimen was scanned by a 40-keV electron beam of 0.25 nm in size, and images were collected with a preamp gain of 10 for both large and small angle detectors (14Wall J.S. Hainfeld J.F. Simon M.N. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 139-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The image was recorded with a pixel size of 10 Å and was analyzed with the PCMass29 program. After normalizing the background, the mass of the VLPs was selected with the murine sarcoma virus (MSV) shell model provided by the program. Mass measurements for TMV and HEV-VLPs were always performed from the same image. The HEV-VLP mass was measured in MDa (mass per particle), and the TMV mass was measured in KDa/Å (mass per unit length) (15Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). The collection of cryo-EM data for image reconstruction was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100F TEM operating at 200 kV according to the procedure described in detail previously (8Xing L. Kato K. Li T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Hammar L. Cheng R.H. Virology. 1999; 265: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 3-μl solution containing VLP or reassembled ORF2 complex was placed on holey carbon film-coated copper grids and then quickly plunged into liquid ethane after the removal of excess solution. The VLPs were embedded into a thin layer of vitrified ice and transferred into the EM using a Gatan 626 cryo-transferring system. The specimen was observed under 50,000× magnification, and the area of interest was recorded on a TVIPS CCD camera (TemCam-F415). The micrographs were recorded with a pixel size of 2.0 Å at a specimen space and defocus level of 0.7–3.5 Å (supplemental Fig. 1A). Digital images with no stigmatism or drift were selected for later image processing. Images of individual HEV T=3 VLPs were then boxed out and processed with an established software package for icosahedral particles (16Baker T.S. Cheng R.H. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 17Ji Y. Marinescu D.C. Zhang W. Zhang X. Yan X. Baker T.S. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 154: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In total, 7,720 individual images were included in the process, and their defocus levels were distributed mainly within 1.0–2.5 Å. To correct contrast transfer function effect, we applied phase flipping on each image with an in-house program. The density maps were initially reconstructed by combining 1,812 individual images to an effective resolution of 14 Å. Next, amplitude correction was applied during map reconstruction while new data were added. The final density map was reconstructed by combining images of 4,348 individual particles, and the final resolution was assessed as 10.6 Å by Fourier shell correlation with a cutoff of 0.5 (supplemental Fig. 1B). Docking of the T=1 crystal structure into the T=3 cryo-EM density map was first done manually with the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) and then refined with the Situs software package (19Chacón P. Wriggers W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The PORF2 monomer was treated as a rigid body during the initial fitting and refinement processes. Crystallization of the VLPs was performed according to a previously described method (20Wang C.Y. Miyazaki N. Yamashita T. Higashiura A. Nakagawa A. Li T.C. Takeda N. Xing L. Hjalmarsson E. Friberg C. Liou D.M. Sung Y.J. Tsukihara T. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Cheng R.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2008; 64: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crystals were directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and x-ray diffraction experiments were performed. All x-ray experiments of the HEV-VLP crystals were performed at SPring-8 in Hyogo, Japan. Particle orientation in the unit cell was determined with a self-rotation function (21Blow D.M. Rossmann M.G. Jeffery B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 8: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the particle position was determined by a translation search with the cryo-EM structure as the model. The asymmetric crystal unit contains one particle; as a result, 60-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was enforced. The cryo-EM structure (8Xing L. Kato K. Li T. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Hammar L. Cheng R.H. Virology. 1999; 265: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was used to obtain the initial phases of Data I (supplemental Table 1) and generated the envelope (mask) used for non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. The phases were refined by real space electron density averaging with icosahedral symmetry elements and solvent flattening. The resolution was gradually extended to 8.3 Å (R-factor = 0.21, correlation coefficient = 0.92). This structure was used for the phasing of Data II (supplemental Table 1), and the phases were refined and extended to a 3.8 Å resolution (the overall R-factor and correlation coefficient were 0.18 and 0.97, respectively). The electron density map revealed a clear main chain structure. Thus, we built an atomic model into this electron density map using the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar) without difficulty. Sixty icosahedrally related S-subunits were treated as identical, and strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were applied during refinement. The data with the resolution range of 20–3.8 Å were included in the refinement (supplemental Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 2) using the CNS program (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar). The subunit position and orientation were again clarified by rigid body refinement (R-factor of 0.391 (Rfree = 0.395)). After the first cycle of simulated annealing refinement, positional and B-factor refinement followed, and the model was enhanced to an R-factor of 0.261 (Rfree = 0.264). Further positional and B-factor refinement, followed by manual revision of the model, resulted in an R-factor of 0.242 (Rfree = 0.245) with reasonable stereochemistry (root mean square deviations in bond lengths and bond angles were 0.010 Å and 1.68°, respectively). Because of the high non-crystallographic symmetry, the R-factor and Rfree factor were almost identical. After refinement, the stereochemistry of the structure was checked with Procheck (23Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). 98.1% of the non-glycine residues were within the most favored and the additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, and none of the residues were in the additional regions. Atomic structure representations were generated using MolScript (24Kraulis P. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster3D (25Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). 100 μg of purified large and small VLPs were treated with DNase I (final concentration; 0.01 mg/ml) (Sigma) and RNase A (final concentration; 0.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h and then followed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA55Ti rotor. After removal of the supernatant, the pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS minus buffer. The nucleic acids were extracted with RNAzol-LS reagent (Tel-test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and analyzed on 1% agarose gels. For detection of HEV RNA in VLPs, the extracted RNAs from VLPs were mixed with sample buffer (final concentration: 2% formaldehyde, 50% formamide in MOPS buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan). The solution was denatured at 65 °C for 10 min and cooled immediately in ice-cold water and then mixed with 6× loading buffer (80% formamide, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 6 mm EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich). After separation on the formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel (18% formaldehyde, 1% agarose, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1× MOPS buffer, the gel was washed twice for 15 min with 20× SSC (3 m NaCl, 0.3 m trisodium citrate dehydrate (pH 7.0), Roche Applied Science, Tokyo, Japan) and transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane filter (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) by the capillary method. RNAs were fixed on the membrane by irradiation with UV light (Stratalinker UV crosslinker, Stratagene, Tokyo, Japan) and dried in the air. RNAs on the membrane were hybridized with DIG-labeled probe. DIG-labeled RNAs were detected by using a DIG Northern starter kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol and visualized by the LAS-3000 imaging analyzer, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The purified template DNA for the probe RNA was prepared by digesting the plasmid carrying 584-base cDNA of HEV ORF2 (5,903–6,486 nucleotides) under the T7 promoter with BamHI. The probe RNA was prepared using the DIG Northern starter kit according to the manufacturer's manual (incorporation of DIG-UTP during RNA transcription). The norovirus-like particles that were produced by the recombinant baculovirus were used as a control, and the same procedure was used with the HEV-VLPs. The virion-sized HEV-VLP was recovered when the genotype-3 ORF2 sequence was expressed in insect cells. This VLP projected as a spherical image with a diameter of ∼40 nm, larger than the T=1 VLP (27 nm in diameter) (Fig. 1A). In cryo-electron micrographs, the images of HEV-VLP are decorated with spike-like features and are homogeneous in contrast (Fig. 1B). To determine the composition of the large HEV-VLP, we performed mass measurements by using STEM, a technique that measures the amount of electrons scattered from the objects, such as VLPs, on an EM grid. A mixture of purified large and small HEV-VLPs was freeze-dried onto EM grids for STEM mass measurement. TMV with a known mass-to-length ratio was used as an internal standard. The HEV-VLPs appeared as spherical projections with white contrast on the dark field STEM images (Fig. 1A). White cloud-like objects were present in the background, which might be the VLPs broken during sample preservation. The mean mass of large VLP and TMV in the images was measured to generate a plot of the mean TMV mass per unit length versus mean VLP mass per particle (Fig. 1A). A first-order fit was calculated, and the mass of the large HEV-VLP was determined to be 11.8 MDa (Fig. 1D). The mass of the genotype-3 ORF2 protein, which was recovered from the large VLP, was measured as 65.5 KDa by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the large HEV-VLP contains 180 copies of ORF2 proteins, suggesting that the large HEV-VLP is a T=3 icosahedral particle (T=3 VLP). We further performed element analysis with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, also known as electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, determines the chemical composition of the sample with a depth of 50–70 nm. Phosphorus element, as a characteristic element of nucleic acid, was detected from the G3-VLP that was applied to the carbon-coated copper grid (supplemental Fig. 1C). Although the signal of phosphorus element is weak when compared with that of carbon, the phosphorus peak is not detectable in the control grid without VLP materials. This result suggests the co-existence of nucleic acid within the large G3-VLPs. The cryo-EM structure of the large HEV-VLP revealed 90 protruding spikes on a complete icosahedral shell (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the T=3 icosahedral symmetry and the results of the STEM mass measurements. The VLP had an overall diameter of 410 Å and a central cavity of 170 Å in radius as measured from the three-dimensional density map (Fig. 2C). The single-layer capsid contained 180 copies of the ORF2 protein, which were grouped into three unique monomers according to their geometric environments. Although monomers A and B formed dimeric spikes (A-B dimers) around each of the five-fold axes, two two-fold related C monomers formed a spike (C-C dimer) at each of the icosahedral two-fold axes (Fig. 2B). The surface lattices of ORF2 proteins in HEV T=3 VLP were similar to the capsid arrangement of caliciviruses. When compared with the A-B dimer, the morphology of the HEV C-C dimer was less well defined, perhaps due to flexibility in the angle of the protruding domain toward the icosahedral shell. The density map of the T=3 VLP displayed four discrete domains, designated from the outside inward as P, M, S, and N, on a section 52 Å from the equatorial plane (Fig. 2C). The density profile of the P, M, and S domains displayed less variation from that observed in T=1 HEV-VLP, and the docking of the crystal structure of the T=1 PORF2 protein to the density map of T=3 HEV-VLP showed a very good agreement between the two structures (Fig. 2D). The docking positioned N-terminal tail of the PORF2 protein at the capsid inner surface aligned well with the density linker in T=3 VLP (Fig. 2D). The linker density served as a tag to connect the N domain with the icosahedral capsid, indicating the location of the N-terminal 111 amino acids of the ORF2 protein in T=3 HEV-VLP. The crystal structure of the truncated genotype-1 capsid protein (PORF2, containing residues 112–608) can be separated into three domains, S, M, and P, with a less resolved region covering residues 555–560. The S domain formed by residues 118–317 folds into a classical eight-stranded β-barrel with a jelly roll motif (Fig. 3A), as observed in many T=3 viral capsid proteins (26Rossmann M.G. Johnson J.E. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 533-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Harrison S.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Uniquely, three additional short α-helixes were observed in the S domain between strands E and F and strands G and H. The capsid shell was mainly stabilized by intersubunit interactions between the S domains. The folded M domain, consisting of residues 318–451, was a twisted antiparallel β-sheet with an α-helix between the B′ and C′ strands (Fig. 3A). The P domain, composed of residues 452–606, folded into a β-barrel composed of antiparallel β-sheets, F“A”Bb” and Ba“E”D“C” (Fig. 3A), and was connected with the M domain through a long proline-rich hinge (PTPSPAPSRP of residues 452–461) (Fig. 3A). Although both the M and the P domains existed above the S domain, the protruding spikes in the HEV cryo-EM map contain only the P domain density, which is a clear difference to those caliciviruses (supplemental Fig. 3). The PORF2 dimers have the largest buried surface area between monomers (5,900 Å2) mainly due to the interface between P domains (Fig. 3B). The buried surface area is 3,400 and 1,600 Å2 for the two adjacent PORF2 subunits around a three-fold axis and a five-fold axis, respectively (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the buried surface area of three molecules around a three-fold axis (9,500 Å2) is much wider than that around a five-fold axis (4,700 Å2). Sequence alignment of genotype-1 PORF2 with the sequences of genotype-3 (10Yamashita T. Mori Y. Miyazaki N. Cheng R.H. Yoshimura M. Unno H. Shima R. Moriishi K. Tsukihara T. Li T.C. Takeda N. Miyamura T. Matsuura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12986-12991Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and genotype-4 (11Guu T.S. Liu Z. Ye Q. Mata D.A. Li K. Yin C. Zhang J. Tao Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) revealed that the S domain is the most conserved region among HEV genotypes, whereas greater divergence was seen in the N-terminal region (supplemental Fig. 4A). Among the solved structures, genotype-3 appeared flexible at the N-terminal end and was 11 amino acids shorter than the others, whereas the structure deviation from genotype-1 PORF2 is very small (total root mean square deviation is 0.62 for the 472 equivalent amino acids) (supplemental Fig. 4B). Because amino acids 118–129 play an important role in bridging the N-domain to the S-domain in T=3 VLP and serve as a docking register, we used the crystal structure of genotype-1 to decipher the T=3 cryo-EM density map. To understand the mechanism of ORF2 protein transition between T=1 and T=3 assemblies, we docked the T=1 decamer and hexamer into the T=3 cryo-EM density map. The decamer of T=1 VLP consisted of 10 adjacent PORF2 monomers corresponding to five dimers around a five-fold axis, whereas the T=1 hexamer corresponded to three adjacent dimers around a three-fold axis. Unlike the hexamer, the coordinates of the PORF2 decamer fitted very well with the curvature of the T=3 density map at the five-fold vertex (Fig. 4A) and with the domain separation (Fig. 4B). The curvature of T=3 capsid at the three-fold axis did not agree with the coordinates of the PORF2 hexamer as one of the dimers appeared to be sticking out of the cryo-EM density map (data not shown). Besides, the orientation of the P domain of the C-C dimer relative to its M/S domains was 90° different from that of the A-B dimer (Fig. 5). This suggests that the molecular interactions among A-B dimers in the T=3 icosahedron are consistent with the dimer-dimer interactions in the T=1 icosahedral assembly, whereas the interaction between the A-B dimer and C-C dimer is unique to the T=3 assembly.FIGURE 5The orientation of P domain relative to the M and S domain in the C-C dimer appears different from that in A-B dimer. A, the dimeric interactions in the HEV A-B dimer, the HEV C/C dimers, and the Norwalk virus C-C dimer are shown in space-filling models as observed from the outside of the particles. S, M (P1) and P (P2) domains in a subunit are highlighted in dark/light blue, dark/light green, and brown/chocolate, respectively. B, in the T=3 cryo-EM density map, the orientation of the P domain is shown as the angle between the platform of the spike (yellow circles) relative to the M/S domains in the C-C dimer (white line passing through the two adjacent three-fold axes) or the M/S domains in the A-B dimer (white line passing through a five-fold axis and the neighboring three-fold axis). C, the crystal density map showing the position of the proline-rich hinge within the cleft of the M domains. D, the cleft in between the M/S domains provides sufficient room to accommodate the proline-rich hinge in the A-B dimer, where the domains take a bent conformation. The cleft is narrowed down in the C-C dimer due to the flat conformation between the M/S domains, thus pushing the hinge up and out of the cleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the role of ORF2 decamer in T=3 VLP assembly, we analyzed the self-assembly process of HEV-VLP in vitro. A combination of chelating (EDTA) and reducing (DTT) agents was found to disassemble T=3 VLP in a high alkaline environment (pH 10) without denaturating the ORF2 protein (data not shown). The addition of 20 mm CaCl2 into the disassembly solution led to the association of the ORF2 dimers into star-shaped complexes, and no refolded VLP was found (Fig. 4C). When we examined the star-shaped complexes, we found that the distance between two opposite vertices was ∼18 nm, close to the diameter of TMV (Fig. 4D). This size was consistent with that measured from PORF2 decamers. Thus, the star-shaped complexes resembled not only the appearance but also the size of the ORF2 decamer (a pentamer of dimers). Although the overall buried surface area around the three-fold axis is larger than that around the five-fold axis, we did not find any complexes that could fit with the PORF2 hexamer. The in vitro disassembly and reassembly suggested that other factors than ORF2 protein contribute to T=3 VLP assembly. Considering the electropositivity of the ORF2 N-terminal 111 amino acids, we performed nucleic acid extraction from both the T=3 and the T=1 VLPs. Electrophoresis results demonstrated the presence of nucleic acids in the T=3 extract, whereas the T=1 VLP extract was negative for nucleic acids (Fig. 4E). The extracted nucleic acids were sensitive to RNase treatment and resistant to DNase treatment. To further characterize the nucleic acid, we performed Northern blotting according to the protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” An RNA band about 2 kb in size was detected from large particles, whereas no band was detected from the small particles and the control norovirus-like particles (Fig. 4F). This result is consistent with the VLP profiles observed from the cryo-electron micrographs and further indicated that the T=3 particles encapsulated the HEV gene encoding the ORF2 protein. Hepatitis E virus is a human pathogen that causes acute liver failure. Like other hepatitis viruses, HEV cannot be propagated with currently available cell culture techniques.

https://openalex.org/W2078183094,"Cellular eukaryotic mRNAs are capped at their 5' ends with a 7-methylguanosine nucleotide, a structural feature that has been shown to be important for conferring mRNA stability, stimulating mRNA biogenesis (splicing, poly(A) addition, nucleocytoplasmic transport), and increasing translational efficiency. Whereas yeast mRNAs have no additional modifications to the cap, called cap0, higher eukaryotes are methylated at the 2'-O-ribose of the first or the first and second transcribed nucleotides, called cap1 and cap2, respectively. In the present study, we identify the methyltransferase responsible for cap1 formation in human cells, which we call hMTr1 (also known as FTSJD2 and ISG95). We show in vitro that hMTr1 catalyzes specific methylation of the 2'-O-ribose of the first nucleotide of a capped RNA transcript. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of hMTr1 in HeLa cells, we demonstrate that hMTr1 is responsible for cap1 formation in vivo."

Ames dwarf mice survived 987 ± 24 d (median), longer than nonmutant control mice (664 ± 48), but GH-injected dwarf mice did not differ from controls (707 ± 9). Fibroblast cells from Ames dwarf mice were more resistant to cadmium than cells from nonmutant controls (LD(50) values of 9.98 ± 1.7 and 3.9 ± 0.8, respectively), but GH injections into Ames dwarf mice restored the normal level of cadmium resistance (LD(50)=5.8 ± 0.9). Similar restoration of normal resistance was observed for fibroblasts exposed to paraquat, methyl methanesulfonate, and rotenone (P<0.05 in each case for contrast of GH-treated vs. untreated dwarf mice; P<0.05 for dwarf vs. nonmutant control mice.) T4 injections into Ames dwarf mice, in contrast, did not restore normal life span. We conclude that the remarkable life-span extension of Ames dwarf mice, and the stress resistance of cells from these mice, depends on low levels of GH exposure in juvenile and very young adult mice."

However, the role of AMPK and its underlying mechanism on macrophage foam cell formation are poorly understood. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential effects of AMPK in modulating cholesterol deposition by using murine macrophage-derived foam cells. Incubation with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) markedly attenuated the cholesterol ester accumulation in oxidized low density lipoprotein-loaded macrophages. Notably, AICAR treatment significantly increased ATP-binding cassette transporters G1 (Abcg1) mRNA and protein levels without affecting mRNA and protein expression of ABCA1, scavenger receptors, including scavenger receptor-A, CD36, and scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI), and cholesterol synthesis-related genes. The up-regulation of Abcg1 by AICAR was independent of the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor pathway but dependent on ERK activation. AICAR elevates Abcg1 expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism that stabilizes the mRNA. Using a heterologous system with luciferase as a reporter, we further identify the Abcg1 mRNA 3′-UTR responsible for the regulatory effect of AICAR. Prevention of ABCG1 expression by small interfering RNA abolished the AICAR-mediated attenuation on foam cell formation. Furthermore, increased ABCG1 expression and reduced lipid accumulation were demonstrated in AICAR-treated macrophages isolated from apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (apoE−/− mice). AICAR treatment also inhibited atherosclerotic plaque formation in apoE−/− mice. Our findings elucidate a precise mechanism involved in the prevention of atherogenesis by AMPK.

https://openalex.org/W2090166751,"The niche model has been widely used to model the structure of complex food webs, and yet the ecological meaning of the single niche dimension has not been explored. In the niche model, each species has three traits, niche position, diet position and feeding range. Here, a new probabilistic niche model, which allows the maximum likelihood set of trait values to be estimated for each species, is applied to the food web of the Benguela fishery. We also developed the allometric niche model, in which body size is used as the niche dimension. About 80% of the links in the empirical data are predicted by the probabilistic niche model, a significant improvement over recent models. As in the niche model, species are uniformly distributed on the niche axis. Feeding ranges are exponentially distributed, but diet positions are not uniformly distributed below the predator. Species traits are strongly correlated with body size, but the allometric niche model performs significantly worse than the probabilistic niche model. The best-fit parameter set provides a significantly better model of the structure of the Benguela food web than was previously available. The methodology allows the identification of a number of taxa that stand out as outliers either in the model's poor performance at predicting their predators or prey or in their parameter values. While important, body size alone does not explain the structure of the one-dimensional niche."
https://openalex.org/W1975452261,"Hypoxia in adipose tissue has been postulated as a possible contributor to obesity-related chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction. HIF1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α), a master signal mediator of hypoxia response, is elevated in obese adipose tissue. However, the role of HIF1α in obesity-related pathologies remains to be determined. Here we show that transgenic mice with adipose tissue-selective expression of a dominant negative version of HIF1α developed more severe obesity and were more susceptible to high fat diet-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared with their wild type littermates. Obesity in the transgenic mice was attributed to impaired energy expenditure and reduced thermogenesis. Histological examination of interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) in the transgenic mice demonstrated a markedly increased size of lipid droplets and decreased mitochondrial density in adipocytes, a phenotype similar to that in white adipose tissue. These changes in BAT of the transgenic mice were accompanied by decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced expression of key thermogenic genes. In the transgenic mice, angiogenesis in BAT was decreased but was little affected in white adipose tissue. These findings support an indispensable role of HIF1α in maintaining the thermogenic functions of BAT, possibly through promoting angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2032996159,"Exercise induces a pleiotropic adaptive response in skeletal muscle, largely through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). PGC-1α enhances lipid oxidation and thereby provides energy for sustained muscle contraction. Its potential implication in promoting muscle refueling remains unresolved, however. Here, we investigated a possible role of elevated PGC-1α levels in skeletal muscle lipogenesis in vivo and the molecular mechanisms that underlie PGC-1α-mediated de novo lipogenesis. To this end, we studied transgenic mice with physiological overexpression of PGC-1α and human muscle biopsies pre- and post-exercise. We demonstrate that PGC-1α enhances lipogenesis in skeletal muscle through liver X receptor α-dependent activation of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) promoter and by increasing FAS activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we establish a direct interaction between PGC-1α and the liver X receptor-responsive element in the FAS promoter. Moreover, we show for the first time that increased glucose uptake and activation of the pentose phosphate pathway provide substrates for RNA synthesis and cofactors for de novo lipogenesis. Similarly, we observed increased lipogenesis and lipid levels in human muscle biopsies that were obtained post-exercise. Our findings suggest that PGC-1α coordinates lipogenesis, intramyocellular lipid accumulation, and substrate oxidation in exercised skeletal muscle in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2134565019,"Acetaminophen [N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP)] is the most common antipyretic/analgesic medicine worldwide. If APAP is overdosed, its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinoneimine (NAPQI), causes liver damage. However, epidemiological evidence has associated previous use of therapeutic APAP doses with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 (TRPA1) channel is expressed by peptidergic primary sensory neurons. Because NAPQI, like other TRPA1 activators, is an electrophilic molecule, we hypothesized that APAP, via NAPQI, stimulates TRPA1, thus causing airway neurogenic inflammation. NAPQI selectively excites human recombinant and native (neuroblastoma cells) TRPA1. TRPA1 activation by NAPQI releases proinflammatory neuropeptides (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) from sensory nerve terminals in rodent airways, thereby causing neurogenic edema and neutrophilia. Single or repeated administration of therapeutic (15-60 mg/kg) APAP doses to mice produces detectable levels of NAPQI in the lung, and increases neutrophil numbers, myeloperoxidase activity, and cytokine and chemokine levels in the airways or skin. Inflammatory responses evoked by NAPQI and APAP are abated by TRPA1 antagonism or are absent in TRPA1-deficient mice. This novel pathway, distinguished from the tissue-damaging effect of NAPQI, may contribute to the risk of COPD and asthma associated with therapeutic APAP use."

https://openalex.org/W2095429692,"Cysteine synthesis in bacteria and plants is catalyzed by serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase (OAS-TL), which form the hetero-oligomeric cysteine synthase complex (CSC). In plants, but not in bacteria, the CSC is assumed to control cellular sulfur homeostasis by reversible association of the subunits. Application of size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a hexameric structure of mitochondrial SAT from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSATm) and a 2:1 ratio of the OAS-TL dimer to the SAT hexamer in the CSC. Comparable results were obtained for the composition of the cytosolic SAT from A. thaliana (AtSATc) and the cytosolic SAT from Glycine max (Glyma16g03080, GmSATc) and their corresponding CSCs. The hexameric SAT structure is also supported by the calculated binding energies between SAT trimers. The interaction sites of dimers of AtSATm trimers are identified using peptide arrays. A negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG = -33 kcal mol(-1)) explains the spontaneous formation of the AtCSCs, whereas the measured SAT:OAS-TL affinity (K(D) = 30 nm) is 10 times weaker than that of bacterial CSCs. Free SAT from bacteria is >100-fold more sensitive to feedback inhibition by cysteine than AtSATm/c. The sensitivity of plant SATs to cysteine is further decreased by CSC formation, whereas the feedback inhibition of bacterial SAT by cysteine is not affected by CSC formation. The data demonstrate highly similar quaternary structures of the CSCs from bacteria and plants but emphasize differences with respect to the affinity of CSC formation (K(D)) and the regulation of cysteine sensitivity of SAT within the CSC."

Indeed, increased levels of p25 and Cdk5 activity have been reported in AD brains.

For most of these studies, however, the focus has been on aminothiazol compounds resembling roscovitine, a kinase inhibitor that competes with the ATP binding site in Cdk5 and other kinases. These drugs do not act specifically on Cdk5-p25 but also inhibit Cdk5-p35 and other Cdks essential for normal development and function. This could be responsible for serious secondary side effects and thereby compromise any therapeutic value. Our approach to this problem, however, is based on earlier studies, where we identified a peptide of 125 amino acid residues of p35 (CIP) that inhibited Cdk5-p25 activity and rescued cortical neurons from Aβ-induced apoptosis without affecting Cdk5-p35 activity (27Zheng Y.L. Li B.S. Amin N.D. Albers W. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This approach might prove to be a more effective way to suppress deregulated Cdk5-p25 hyperactivity inducing neurodegenerative pathology. For a therapy to be effective, however, it must be small enough to pass the blood-brain barrier; a large peptide of 125 residues may be problematic, to say the least. For that reason, we set out to produce a smaller peptide of CIP with equivalent specificity. Based on an analysis of Cdk5-p25 structure and molecular dynamics, several smaller peptides were produced and tested. We identified a 24-residue peptide, called p5, that more effectively inhibited Cdk5-p25 activity in cortical neurons than CIP without affecting endogenous Cdk5-p35 or other Cdks. The small size and specificity of p5 inhibition make it an excellent candidate for therapeutic trials in animal models of AD. p35 (C-19) polyclonal antibody, Cdk5 (C-8) polyclonal antibody, and Cdk5 (J-3) monoclonal antibody at 1:500 dilutions, Cdc2 anti-PSTAIR antibody, and Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), all used at 1:300–500 dilutions. Phospho-Tau-Ser199/Ser202, PHF1, Tau1, and Tau5 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from BIOSOURCE International Inc. (Camarillo, CA) and used at 1:1000 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively. AT-8 and AT180 antibodies were purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL) and used at 1:500. Phospho-Tau-Ser422 was purchased from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) and used at 1:1000. Other antibodies include caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA) and used at 1:1000 dilutions, whereas β-tubulin antibody from Sigma was used at 1:2000. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and used at 1:2000. Secondary fluorescence-conjugated Oregon Green and Texas Red antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at 1:400. Cdk5 inhibitor roscovitine was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). p5 peptide was synthesized by 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlboro, MA). The AdEasy system was kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). A series of Cdk5-related genes were generated by PCR with the following primers with additional restriction enzyme (NotI and EcoRV) sequences underlined and Myc tag sequences capitalized: 1) p35, forward primer (tttgcggccgccAtgggcacggtgctgtccct) and reverse primer (tttgatatcttaccgatccaggcctagga; 2) p25 forward primer (tttgcggccgccAtggcccagcccccaccggccca) and reverse primer (the same as p35); 3) Cdk5, forward primer (tttgcggccgccAtgcagaaatacgagaaactgga) and reverse primer (tttgatatcttagggcggacagaagtcgg); 4) p5, forward primer (tttgcggccgccATGGCATCAATGCAGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGAtgaaggaggccttttgggaccg) and reverse primer (tttgatatcttaggcatttatctgcagcatcttt). Recombinant adenoviruses were generated according to the protocol (28He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). Briefly, all PCR fragments were cloned into a shuttle vector, pAdTrack-CMV. The resultant plasmids were linearized and subsequently co-transformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with an adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. Recombinants were linearized and transfected into 293-1 cells to generate the recombinant adenoviruses. High viral titers were purified by CsCl banding and mixed with 2× Storage Buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, and 50% glycerol, filter-sterilized). Viruses were stored as stocks at −20 or −70 °C. The titers of virus were checked by GFP when infected with related cells. Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were prepared from E-18 rat fetuses as described previously (29Zheng Y.L. Li B.S. Veeranna Pant H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24026-24032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After 7 days, cells were infected independently or co-infected with empty vector (EV), the constructs of p5, p25, p35, wild-type Cdk5, and dominant negative Cdk5 (changing Lys33 to Thr33) using the adenoviral vector (pAdTrack-CMV) packaging system as described above. After 48 h, cells were treated with roscovitine (20 μm) for 1 h and/or for 6 h with 10 μm Aβ(1–42) (incubated at 37 °C for 7 days before use). The cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry analyses or lysed with lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. Cortical neuron cultures were prepared and plated on the coverslips as described. Human embryo kidney cells (HEK293) were grown as described previously (27Zheng Y.L. Li B.S. Amin N.D. Albers W. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In these experiments, HEK293 cells on day 1 or neurons on day 5 were transfected with or without Myc-p5-GFP using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (27Zheng Y.L. Li B.S. Amin N.D. Albers W. Pant H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, an equal amount of total protein (20 μg/lane) was resolved on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. This membrane was incubated in blocking buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS) plus 5% dry milk (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C in primary antibodies. The membranes were then washed four times in TTBS (5 min/each), followed by incubation in secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate at a dilution of 1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. Western blots were analyzed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL kit following the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Kinase assays were performed as described previously (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 7 days in culture (DIC) primary rat cortical neurons were infected with p25, p35, Cdk5 wild type, dominant negative Cdk5, and p5 using the lentiviral gene delivery as described earlier. Cdk5 was immunoprecipitated using the polyclonal C8 antibody overnight at 4 °C, and immunoglobulin was isolated using Protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then once with 1× kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Endogenous Cdks were immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells using their respective antibodies and treated as above. Kinase assays were performed in the same buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.185 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP with 20 μg of histone H1 as the substrate. Phosphorylation was performed in a final volume of 50 μl, incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, and stopped by the addition of 10% SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Coomassie, destained, dried, and exposed to autoradiography. In pad assays, 25-μl aliquots of the incubation mixture were placed on a Whatman p80 paper square, washed and dried, and placed in a scintillation vial for counting. Tubulin polymerization was performed as detailed in a previous report (31Hou Z. Li Q. He L. Lim H.Y. Fu X. Cheung N.S. Qi D.X. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18666-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, active kinase Cdk5-p35 (2 ng/μl) or active Cdk5-p25 (1 ng/μl) was incubated with β-tubulin (enzyme/tubulin at 1:100) in PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0) supplemented with 1 mm GTP at 35 °C for 45 min. Following the incubation, Cdk5 kinase assays were performed with or without the addition of 0.45 or 0.90 μm p5. Immunocytochemistry analysis was performed as described previously (23Zheng Y.L. Kesavapany S. Gravell M. Hamilton R.S. Schubert M. Amin N. Albers W. Grant P. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed on coverslips for 30 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized and blocked in 5% FBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 1 h. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After a wash in PBS (three times, 15 min each) the coverslips were incubated with fluorescein goat anti-mouse IgG or Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG and secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by washing three times with PBS and mounting in an aqueous medium. Fluorescent images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images were processed and merged by Adobe Photoshop software. Primary cortical neuron cells were cultured for 5 days on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and transfected with or without p5 using Lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h, TUNEL staining was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed three times in PBS, fixed for 1 h at room temperature in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice. After washing two times with PBS, TUNEL reaction mixture (50 μl) was added and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C for 1 h. TUNEL staining and fluorescent images were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images were processed and merged by Adobe Photoshop software. As demonstrated in our previous studies, CIP, a 125-amino acid truncated peptide from p35 (residues 154–279), is a highly effective and specific inhibitor of Cdk5-p25 activity. It reduces Tau hyperphosphorylation and protects transfected HEK cells and neurons from apoptosis induced by Cdk5-p25 (23Zheng Y.L. Kesavapany S. Gravell M. Hamilton R.S. Schubert M. Amin N.

To produce a smaller and more effective inhibitory peptide of Cdk5-p25 for potential therapeutic use, we designed and constructed five short peptides in GST vectors, as shown in Fig. 1A. These are GST-p1 (Glu211–Ala277), 67 amino acid residues; GST-p2 (Met237–Ala277), 41 residues; GST-p3 (Glu221-Leu267), 47 residues; GST-p4 (Glu221–Leu249), 29 residues; and GST-p5 (Lys254–Ala277), 24 residues. Each was incubated with active Cdk5-p25 in a kinase assay in vitro. The results indicated that all short peptides inhibited Cdk5-p25 activities significantly, but only p3 and p5 are more effective inhibitors than CIP (Fig. 1B). Although both exhibit almost 100% inhibition in vitro, we chose to study p5 in detail because it is the smaller fragment. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that residues Glu255, Trp259, and Ala233 of the p5 peptide bind to the PSSALRE motif of Cdk5, further supporting a potent inhibitor role for p5. In a dose-dependent kinase assay, we compared the effective inhibitory concentration of p5 for both the Cdk5-p25 and Cdk5-p35 complexes. His-p5 peptide was added at different concentrations to the in vitro assay containing 100 μm [γ32-P]ATP and histone H1. The results are shown in Fig. 2. We found that inhibition increased progressively with increasing p5 concentration in both complexes (Fig. 2, compare A and B with C and D). Although Cdk5-p25 activity is significantly greater, the kinetics of inhibition was similar for both enzyme complexes. For example, at 0.05 μm p5, activities of both Cdk5-p35 and Cdk5-p25 were inhibited at about 30%, (compare lanes 2 in B and D), whereas 1.2 μm p5 virtually eliminated activity in both cases (compare lanes 7 in B and D). Under these in vitro conditions, p5 inhibition was not specific for Cdk5-p25. If specificity of p5 inhibition is not evident in vitro, is it present in cortical neurons? To examine this question we used E-18 rat cortical neurons co-infected with Cdk5 and p5, p35, or p25 in various constructs. The AdEasy-based viral infection system, used to introduce the appropriate genes into cortical neurons, typically yielded ∼60–70% efficiency (Fig. 3B). We utilized Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies to examine the expression of Cdk5, p35, and p25 genes in cortical neurons (Fig. 3, A and B). Neurons were infected at 5 DIC, and lysates were harvested after 48 h to ensure proper integration and infection rates and high expression levels. As seen in Fig. 3A, infected Cdk5 showed dramatically higher expression (lanes 3–8) compared with controls (con), EV (lanes 1 and 2), and p5 only (lane 9). Infected p35 and p25 also showed robust increases in the amounts of expressed protein (lanes 5, 6, and 8 and lanes 3, 4, and 7, respectively). Endogenous p35 (lanes 1–4, 7, 9, and 10) was expressed at much lower levels when compared with endogenous Cdk5 (lanes 1, 2, 9, and 10), whereas p25 showed no endogenous expression. To determine the specificity of p5 inhibition in cortical neurons, Cdk5 immunoprecipitates were prepared from each infected culture, and kinase activity was assayed in vitro (Fig. 3, C (radioautographs) and D (pad assay)). Endogenous basal levels of Cdk5 activity were shown in control (non-infected cells) and vector (EV)-infected neurons (lanes 1 and 2). Neurons infected with Cdk5-p25 showed remarkably high activity (lane 3); when co-infected with p5, however, activity decreased more than 90% (p < 0.01 compare lane 4 with lane 3). Activity in neurons co-infected with Cdk5-p35, although much lower than Cdk5-p25, exhibited only 10–20% inhibition when co-infected with p5 (p > 0.05; compare lane 6 with lane 5). These results suggest that p5 minimally affects Cdk5-p35 activity within infected neurons as much as it inhibits Cdk5-p25 activity. The more important question is whether p5 inhibits endogenous Cdk5-p35 activity. We show that cells infected only with p5 exhibit no reduction in activity (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lane 9). Complete inhibition, however, does occur in the presence of roscovitine (lane 10), suggesting that p5 does not inhibit endogenous Cdk5-p35 activity. Cells infected with dominant negative Cdk5, as negative controls, exhibit endogenous levels of activity (lanes 7 and 8). In summary, p5 does not inhibit Cdk5-p35 activity in neuronal cells to the same extent as Cdk5-p25. It has been suggested that amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, pathological hallmarks of several neurodegenerative disorders, are linked to deregulated Cdk5 and neuronal death. According to one model, β-amyloid, being toxic, may evoke abnormal calcium influx into neurons, which activates calpains. These proteases cleave p35 to p25, which forms a more stable and hyperactive complex with Cdk5. Hyperactivation of Cdk5 leads to the aberrant phosphorylation of Tau and neurofilaments in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and ALS (19Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J.

Several studies in different laboratories, including our own, have shown that primary cortical neurons, when treated with Aβ(1–42) are induced to form Cdk5-p25 complexes, hyperactive Cdk5 activity, hyperphosphorylation of Tau, and neuronal apoptosis (44Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). To determine whether p5 will inhibit endogenous Tau phosphorylation induced by Aβ treatment in cortical neurons, 7-day-old cortical neurons, infected with EV or with p5, were treated with Aβ for 6 h, lysed, and prepared for Cdk5 immunoprecipitation and kinase assay. The data are shown in Fig. 4. Aβ treatment causes an approximately 3-fold increase in endogenous Cdk5 activity as visualized by histone H1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B, fifth panel, lane 2). Infected p5, however, dramatically reduced Cdk5 activity in the Aβ-treated neurons to basal levels (lane 3). Western blot assays of whole cell lysates from similarly transfected cortical neurons treated with Aβ revealed an up-regulation of the expression of p25 (Fig. 4A, third panel, lanes 2–4). The increased p25 expression was correlated with an increased level of endogenous Tau phosphorylation at residues Ser199/Ser202 as detected by two different phospho-Tau antibodies, AT8 and Ser(P)199/Ser(P)202 (Fig. 4, C and D, panels 1 and 2, lane 2), whereas infection of p5 inhibited the Aβ-mediated Tau hyperphosphorylation, restoring it to basal levels (lane 3). In order to confirm that Tau was hyperphosphorylated by Cdk5 and not by other kinases, we used a Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, to co-treat cells with Aβ. The results showed that the Tau phosphorylation was significantly inhibited (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, C and D, first and second panels, lane 4). To confirm these results, Tau1 antibody was used to detect the non-phosphorylated Tau Ser199/Ser202 (Fig. 3C, third panel). The results showed that the non-phospho-Tau was decreased in Aβ-treated cells (compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4). We also used Tau antibody Ser(P)404, PHF antibody AT180 (which recognizes Thr(P)231), and Ser(P)422 antibody to observe whether p5 affects other Tau phosphorylation residues (Fig. 4, E and F).

Different protein ligands, which recognize the same receptor GSL, can bind differentially in a cell or model membrane context, and cholesterol can play a central role (20Hinoi E. Takarada T.

This, combined with the hydrogen bond network between membrane GSLs (23Lundén B.M. Löfgren H. Pascher I. Chem Phys Lipids. 1977; 20: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), provides a (thermodynamically strained (1Lingwood C.A. Glycoconj.

Lingwood C.A. Wong C.H. Carbohydrate-based Drug Discovery. Wiley-VCH Press, Weinheim, Germany2003: 761-780Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant in the context of cellular GSL accumulation in cholesterol-enriched detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) (25Brown D.A. Physiology. 2006; 21: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Although the nature of DRM correlation to lipid rafts of model systems (26Lingwood D. Simons K. Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar) is a matter of debate, detergent insolubility can be indicative of specific lateral interactions involving both lipids and proteins (27Helenius A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 29-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). In this context, we have found detergent resistance to be a useful probe of “aglycone” regulation of GSL receptor presentation in tissues (28Khan F. Proulx F. Lingwood C.A.

Escherichia coli-derived Verotoxins (VTs) are associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and hemorrhagic colitis. Verotoxin 1 (VT1) and Verotoxin 2 (VT2, more frequently associated with human disease), bind the neutral GSL, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3, CD77, or pk blood group antigen) (30Lingwood C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but binding is affected by the lipid (aglycone) moiety (13Boyd B. Magnusson G. Zhiuyan Z. Lingwood C.A. Eur. J.

Although VT1 and VT2 only bind Gb3 (31Okuda T. Tokuda N. Numata S. Ito M. Ohta M. Kawamura K. Wiels J. Urano T. Tajima O. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

This implies cellular recognition of aglycone GSL modulation also. DRM Gb3 is required for VT1 transmembrane signaling (32Katagiri Y.U. Mori T. Nakajima H. Katagiri C. Taguchi T. Takeda T.

Elucidation of aglycone properties influencing membrane GSL carbohydrate presentation presents an experimental challenge. We developed a method to prepare simple, sucrose gradient separated, detergent-resistant GSL/cholesterol vesicles (42Nutikka A. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with the aim of defining potential membrane components influencing GSL carbohydrate-protein ligand binding. We now find that vesicle separation has yet to equilibrate under these conditions. Prolonged centrifugation and increased gradient resolution, unexpectedly, showed ligand binding is restricted to a minor buoyant vesicle fraction, and the bulk GSL/cholesterol DRM bilayer vesicles are, in some way, unavailable for recognition. This effect was found for the binding of all GSLs tested, to their appropriate protein ligands. Surprisingly, these model vesicles proved an accurate predictor of the properties of cell-derived DRM vesicles and membrane GSL expression in cells. A large fraction of cellular GSL can be “cloaked” by cholesterol to prevent ligand recognition. VT1 and VT2 were purified as described previously (43Nutikka A. Binnington-Boyd B. Lingwood C.A. Philpot D. Ebel F. Methods in Molecular Medicine. Humana Press, Totowa, NY2003: 187-195Google Scholar). mAb anti-VT1 (clone PH1; IgG1) and rabbit antiserum against the VT1 B-subunit were prepared in our laboratory. Rabbit antiserum against the VT2 variant, VT2e, was a gift from Dr. C. Gyles, University of Guelph, and was used for VT2 detection. Gb3 was purified from human kidney (44Pellizzari A. Pang H. Lingwood C.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1363-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad. Monosialoganglioside (GM1), sulfatide (SGC), cholesterol, methyl β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), and latrunculin B were from Sigma. HRP-cholera toxin (CTx) B-subunit was from List Biological Labs, [3H]cholesterol was from ICN. R5 HIV gp120 (a single ∼120-kDa peak by gel filtration) and mAb anti-gp120 (clone F425 B4a1; IgG1) were from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent program. Rabbit anti-caveolin1 (N20) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GM1 was a gift from Dr. D. Mahuran, Hospital for Sick Children Toronto. Rat IgM mAb anti-Gb3 (clone 38.13) (45Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 6485-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by Dr. J. Wiels, Institut Gustave Roussy, Paris. Mouse mAb anti-SSEA4 was kindly provided by Dr. R. Kannagi, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan. Mouse IgG2b mAb anti-Gb3 (clone BGR23) was from Seikagaku Corp. Biotinylated Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin 1 was from Vector Laboratories. The glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (P4) (46Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) was purchased from Matreya and diluted from 2 mm stock solution in DMSO. VT1 and VT2 (100–200 μg) were iodinated for 1 min with 0.2 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) in an Iodogen-coated glass tube. Unreacted iodine was removed by gel-filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-25, and the specific activity (cpm/μg) was determined by protein assay. Radiolabeled VT was stored at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Radiolabeled VT exhibited no significant loss in Vero cell cytotoxicity, and binding to Vero cell monolayers was saturable and inhibited by a 10-fold excess of unlabeled toxin. GSL/cholesterol vesicles were generated by a scale reduction of the described procedure (42Nutikka A. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2:1 ratio of Gb3 (or in some cases for gp120 binding, GalCer or sulfatide (SGC), or cholera toxin binding GM1 (50 μg) and cholesterol (25 μg) in ethanol were dried together (in later unmasking studies another GSL (50 μg) was included) and dissolved in 750 μl of MES-Triton buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100). The solution was vortexed (1 min), sonicated (1 min), heated at 55 °C (5 min), and vortexed again (1 min). Then 750 μl of 70% (w/v) sucrose solution in MES buffer was added, gently mixed, and allowed to stand at room temperature for ∼1 h. The mixture was placed below 1 ml of 30% sucrose containing 1 μg/ml 125I-labeled VT or unlabeled VT1, VT2, mAb anti-Gb3, gp120, or HRP-CTB, each used at 1–4 μg/ml. This was overlaid successively with 1 ml of 30% sucrose (in later experiments 25% sucrose was used to minimize mixing of this layer with the ligand-containing layer) and 1.5 ml of 5% of sucrose. Condensed lipid species were separated by flotation ultracentrifugation using an SW55Ti rotor at 34,000 rpm for 72 h, 20 °C. The duration of centrifugation was empirically defined for resolution of the GSL-bound ligand. Vesicle separation was not affected by temperature (4 °C or 20 °C) but was improved as compared with the original full scale method (42Nutikka A. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). From the top of the tube, 10 fractions, 500 μl each, were then collected and counted in a γ-counter to determine 125I-VT distribution in the gradient. Unlabeled ligands were detected by dot blot as described below. In some experiments GSL/cholesterol vesicles were separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation without ligand. Vesicle fraction aliquots were immobilized on nitrocellulose, and then ligand binding to the immobilized vesicles was immunodetected. In some cases fractions 9/10 were pooled. Equal volumes of the gradient fractions were loaded onto nitrocellulose (Whatman Protran BA85) using a dot blot apparatus (Shliecher & Schuell, Minifold I microsample filtration manifold). The samples were washed with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% skim milk or BSA blocking solution for 1 h. The membrane was rinsed with TBS and then probed for bound ligand or when ligand was not included in the gradient, used for ligand binding to the immobilized vesicles. Briefly, the immobilized vesicles were incubated with VT1, VT2, gp120, or anti-Gb3 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, the blots washed, and bound ligand was detected with appropriate antibody followed by HRP-conjugated second antibody. As an alternative to determine the distribution of VT1 in gradient fractions, equal volumes from each fraction were mixed with 1/5 volume of non-reducing 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Ten μl of each sample were subject to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The VT1-A subunit was detected with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the A-subunit (47Tam P. Lingwood C.A. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 2700-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunoblots and TLCs were quantitated using ImageJ (48Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Gb3/cholesterol vesicles were prepared as above and processed for post-embedding cryo-immuno-EM, either before or after separation by sucrose density centrifugation. To aid in sectioning, the vesicles were stained with toluene blue dye for 1 min before excess MES buffer was added, and the solution was vortexed and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 20 °C. The pelleted vesicles were then air-dried for at least 1 h at room temperature. Vesicles were infiltrated in gelatin (20% in PBS) before cryo-freezing. Thin sections were cut using a Leica cryomicrotome and mounted on grids at the Advanced Bioimaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children. For immunogold labeling, section grids were first washed by flotation on a drop of PBS. Sections were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS and then incubated with 5 μg/ml VT-1 in PBS followed by washing and incubation with rabbit anti-VT1 B serum diluted 1:200 in PBS (both 1 h). Bound antibodies were detected with 10 (5Kannagi R. Stroup R. Cochran N.A. Urdal D.L. Young Jr., W.W. Hakomori S.I. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4997-5005PubMed Google Scholar) nm gold-conjugated protein A. Sections were post-fixed in 2% uranyl acetate in water for 15 min at room temperature before treatment with methyl cellulose. VT1 was omitted in control sections. Sections of sucrose gradient separated “fraction B” Gb3/cholesterol vesicles were treated with rat IgM mAb anti-Gb3 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h, washed, and bound antibody detected with 3 nm gold-labeled goat anti-rat IgM antibody. Monoclonal rat IgM (clone eBRM) served as an isotype control to define background antibody binding to the vesicles. All steps were performed at room temperature. Stained grids were imaged using a JEM2001 transmission electron microscope. Lipids were extracted from sucrose fractions by one of two methods. Neutral lipids/glycolipids were isolated by extracting 150 μl of each fraction with chloroform/methanol 2:1 followed by Folch partition (49Fantini J. Cook D.G. Nathanson N. Spitalnik S.L. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 2700-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The upper phase was removed, and the lower phase was washed 2× with theoretical upper phase to remove sucrose. The lower phase was dried under nitrogen gas, and ∼25% of the sample was separated by TLC in chloroform:methanol:water 65:25:4 (v/v). Phospholipids were detected using iodine vapor and imaged by scanning prior to Gb3 detection by VT1 overlay. Cholesterol was detected by ferric chloride spray (50Lowry R.R. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For total lipid extraction (gangliosides included), 150 μl of each fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 50% methanol in water to dissolve the membranes. The samples were loaded onto 50-mg C18 columns equilibrated in 10% aqueous methanol. Columns were washed with 50% methanol, then lipids were eluted with 2 ml of 100% methanol followed by 2 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1). Solvent was dried, and lipids were separated using the TLC solvent chloroform:methanol:water (60:35:8). After phospholipid detection, TLC plates were probed for GM1 using biotinylated CTx B subunit and Gb3 using VT1 (51Nutikka A. Binnington-Boyd B. Lingwood C. Philpot D. Ebel F. Methods in Molecular Medicine. Humana Press, Totowa, NY2003: 197-208Google Scholar). Cells were grown to near confluence in four 150-cm2 dishes, washed briefly, and harvested by scraping in 5 mm EDTA in PBS, and centrifugation at 4 °C. Glycosphingolipid-depleted cells were prepared by culture for 7 days in 2 μm P4 prior to harvest. The cells were suspended in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl containing a protease inhibitor mixture (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, E64, aprotinin, leupeptin, and bestatin) and disrupted by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle. Nuclei and debris were removed by spinning at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g in an SW55Ti rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellet was suspended gently in 1 ml of ice-cold 25 mm MES, pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl. Protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA assay, Pierce). Membranes stored frozen at −80 °C before use or prepared from cell pellets frozen for up to 1 month gave identical results. For generation of DRMs, membrane preparation equivalent to 600 μg of protein was made up to a volume of 375 μl and mixed with an equal volume of 0.5% Triton X-100 on ice. The membranes were treated for 30 min on ice and equilibrated to room temperature. The sample was mixed with an equal volume of 70% sucrose in MES buffer and allowed to sit for 1 h at room temperature, and then sucrose gradient conditions were as described for glycolipid-cholesterol mixtures. For MβCD treatment of membranes, 600 μg of membrane protein was treated with 70% sucrose containing 10 mm MβCD at room temperature for 1 h following detergent extraction and prior to sucrose gradient centrifugation. Culture cells were depleted of cholesterol by treatment with 10 mm MβCD for 10 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium. A partial survey of the potential of Gb3 to bind to other GSLs and lipids was performed using a simple TLC overlay procedure we developed. 1 μg of lipid samples was applied to triplicate TLC grids and air-dried. Lipids on one grid were visualized with orcinol spray. The other two grids were blocked in TBS containing 1% BSA then washed. In a glass tube, 20 μg of Gb3 (dried from ethanol under N2) was suspended in 2.5 ml of TBS containing 1% BSA by heating at 40 °C for 20 min, mixed in a bath sonicator for 1 min, and gently vortexed for 30 s. The TLC grids were incubated in “aqueous Gb3” (∼8 μm Gb3) or TBS/BSA alone for 1 h at room temperature. The grids were washed 3× with TBS, and then Gb3 was detected by VT1 binding as described above. Prior to labeling, cells were washed with serum-free medium (HMEM: 20 mm HEPES-buffered Erhles minimal essential medium containing 0.02% BSA) and chilled on ice. Alexa488-VT1B (5 μg/ml) was added for 20 min on ice. The cells were washed twice with HMEM then fixed, for surface labeling, or pre-warmed HMEM was added, and the cells were maintained at 37 °C for 15 min to internalize bound VT1B. The medium was replaced with HMEM (control) or HMEM containing 10 mm MβCD for 10 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed twice with warm HMEM then cooled on ice. Unmasked surface Gb3 was labeled with Texas Red-labeled VT1B (5 μg/ml) for 20 min on ice. After washing, cells were fixed on ice with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed, and then mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). 5 μg/ml DAPI was included in the mounting medium for nuclear labeling. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope (21Tam P. Mahfoud R. Nutikka A. Khine A.A. Binnington B. Paroutis P. Lingwood C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 216: 750-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using our method to generate detergent-resisting Gb3/cholesterol vesicles (42Nutikka A. Lingwood C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and centrifuging to equilibrium, VT binding vesicles were separated from the bulk Gb3 vesicles (Fig. 1). 125I-VT1/VT2 bound only in the first (± second) fraction (vesicle fraction A) (Fig. 1A), which contained low Gb3 levels (Fig. 1B). >95% of the Gb3 was in higher density fractions (3,4,5-vesicle fraction B), not bound by VT1 or VT2. Thus, Verotoxin only binds a minor, more buoyant subset of Gb3/cholesterol vesicles. The cholesterol and Gb3 gradient distributions coincide (Fig. 1, B and C). The Gb3/cholesterol ratio, measured with [3H]cholesterol, was constant at ∼1.4, which approximates the micelle-to-vesicle transition for GM1/cholesterol mixtures (52Hirai M. Koizumi M. Hirai H. Hayakawa T. Yuyama K. Suzuki N. Kasahara K. J. Phys. Condens. Matter. 2005; 17: S2965-S2977Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Triton was distributed throughout the gradient (not shown). Gb3 distribution was unaffected by the presence of VT: the same result was obtained when VT1 was omitted from the gradient and post-bound to the vesicles immobilized on nitrocellulose after separation (Fig. 1B). In either case, only a minor subfraction (<5%) of Gb3 vesicles at the gradient top was bound. An IgG mAb anti-Gb3 showed the same restricted binding as VT1/VT2 (Fig. 2i, rows a–c). However, for an IgM mAb anti-Gb3 (45Wiels J. F"
https://openalex.org/W1973769775,"PGC-1α is a potent, inducible transcriptional coactivator that exerts control on mitochondrial biogenesis and multiple cellular energy metabolic pathways. PGC-1α levels are controlled in a highly dynamic manner reflecting regulation at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Here, we demonstrate that PGC-1α is rapidly degraded in the nucleus (t½ 0.3 h) via the ubiquitin proteasome system. An N-terminal deletion mutant of 182 residues, PGC182, as well as a lysine-less mutant form, are nuclear and rapidly degraded (t½ 0.5 h), consistent with degradation via the N terminus-dependent ubiquitin subpathway. Both PGC-1α and PGC182 degradation rates are increased in cells under low serum conditions. However, a naturally occurring N-terminal splice variant of 270 residues, NT-PGC-1α is cytoplasmic and stable (t½ >7 h), providing additional evidence that PGC-1α is degraded in the nucleus. These results strongly suggest that the nuclear N terminus-dependent ubiquitin proteasome pathway governs PGC-1α cellular degradation.

These results strongly suggest that the nuclear N terminus-dependent ubiquitin proteasome pathway governs PGC-1α cellular degradation. In contrast, the cellular localization of NT-PCG-1α results in a longer-half-life and possible distinct temporal and potentially biological actions."
https://openalex.org/W2072663871,"Observations of Golgi fragmentation upon introduction of G protein βγ (Gβγ) subunits into cells have implicated Gβγ in a pathway controlling the fission at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of plasma membrane (PM)-destined transport carriers. However, the subcellular location where Gβγ acts to provoke Golgi fragmentation is not known. Additionally, a role for Gβγ in regulating TGN-to-PM transport has not been demonstrated. Here we report that constitutive or inducible targeting of Gβγ to the Golgi, but not other subcellular locations, causes phospholipase C- and protein kinase D-dependent vesiculation of the Golgi in HeLa cells; Golgi-targeted β(1)γ(2) also activates protein kinase D. Moreover, the novel Gβγ inhibitor, gallein, and the Gβγ-sequestering protein, GRK2ct, reveal that Gβγ is required for the constitutive PM transport of two model cargo proteins, VSV-G and ss-HRP. Importantly, Golgi-targeted GRK2ct, but not a PM-targeted GRK2ct, also blocks protein transport to the PM. To further support a role for Golgi-localized Gβγ, endogenous Gβ was detected at the Golgi in HeLa cells. These results are the first to establish a role for Golgi-localized Gβγ in regulating protein transport from the TGN to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2071169764,"The bumblebee Bombus impatiens is increasingly used as a model in comparative studies of colour vision, or in behavioural studies relying on perceptual discrimination of colour. However, full spectral sensitivity data on the photoreceptor inputs underlying colour vision are not available for B. impatiens. Since most known bee species are trichromatic, with photoreceptor spectral sensitivity peaks in the UV, blue and green regions of the spectrum, data from a related species, where spectral sensitivity measurements have been made, are often applied to B impatiens. Nevertheless, species differences in spectral tuning of equivalent photoreceptor classes may result in peaks that differ by several nm, which may have small but significant effects on colour discrimination ability. We therefore used intracellular recording to measure photoreceptor spectral sensitivity in B. impatiens. Spectral peaks were estimated at 347, 424 and 539 nm for UV, blue and green receptors, respectively, suggesting that this species is a UV-blue-green trichromat. Photoreceptor spectral sensitivity peaks are similar to previous measurements from Bombus terrestris, although there is a significant difference in the peak sensitivity of the blue receptor, which is shifted in the short wave direction by 12–13 nm in B. impatiens compared to B. terrestris."
https://openalex.org/W2140415204,"Condensation of chromatin into higher order structures is mediated by intra- and interfiber nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Our goals in this study were to determine the impact specific activator-dependent histone acetylation had on chromatin condensation and to ascertain whether acetylation-induced changes in chromatin condensation were related to changes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity. To accomplish this, an in vitro model system was constructed in which the purified transcriptional activators, Tax and phosphorylated CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein), recruited the p300 histone acetyltransferase to nucleosomal templates containing the human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 promoter sequences. We find that activator-dependent p300 histone acetylation disrupted both inter- and intrafiber nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and simultaneously led to enhanced RNAPII transcription from the decondensed model chromatin. p300 histone acetyltransferase activity had two distinct components: non-targeted, ubiquitous activity in the absence of activators and activator-dependent activity targeted primarily to promoter-proximal nucleosomes. Mass spectrometry identified several unique p300 acetylation sites on nucleosomal histone H3 (H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, and H3K37). Collectively, our data have important implications for understanding both the mechanism of RNAPII transcriptional regulation by chromatin and the molecular determinants of higher order chromatin structure."

Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to aging, we hypothesized that lowering T might decrease mitochondrial ROS production. We measured respiratory response and ROS production in isolated mitochondria at 32, 35, and 37 °C. Lowering T decreased the rates of resting (state 4) and phosphorylating (state 3) respiration phases. Surprisingly, this respiratory slowdown was associated with an increase of ROS production and hydrogen peroxide release and with elevation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, ΔΨm. We also found that at lower T mitochondria produced more carbon-centered lipid radicals, a species known to activate uncoupling proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2094961730,"Maspin has been identified as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for its anti-angiogenic property is unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of maspin on endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and migration in a cell culture system. We found that maspin was expressed in blood vessels ECs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Maspin significantly enhanced HUVEC cell adhesion to various matrix proteins. This effect was dependent on the activation of integrin β1, which subsequently led to distribution pattern changes of vinculin and F-actin. These results indicated that maspin affects cell adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization through an integrin signal transduction pathway. Analysis of HUVECs following maspin treatment revealed increased integrin-linked kinase activities and phosphorylated FAK levels, consistent with increased cell adhesion. Interestingly, when HUVECs were induced to migrate by migration stimulatory factor bFGF, active Rac1 and cdc42 small GTPase levels were decreased dramatically at 30 min following maspin treatment. Using phosphorylated FAK at Tyr397 as an indicator of focal adhesion disassembly, maspin-treated HUVECs had elevated FAK phosphorylation compared with the mock treated control.

Angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis. Blood vessels in solid tumor are composed of endothelial and tumor cells. These mosaic vessels allow for the shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature and transport of tumor cells to the second site through a circulation system. Identifying angiogenic growth factors and inhibitors and characterizing their contribution to endothelial cell migration and proliferation will not only help us to gain insight of the biology of angiogenesis network, but also provide potential candidates for developing more efficient cancer therapeutic strategies targeting angiogenesis. Our laboratory identified maspin as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor (1Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Its anti-angiogenic property was later confirmed by Cher et al. (2Cher M.L. Biliran Jr., H.R. Bhagat S. Meng Y. Che M. Lockett J. Abrams J. Fridman R. Zachareas M. Sheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, unlike PAI-1 and PAI-2, maspin does not directly inhibit serine proteases (5Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol.

For many years, it has not been clear how maspin controls angiogenesis, especially how maspin regulates endothelial cell (EC) motility. ECs can be activated by exogenous stimuli such as bFGF and VEGF and produce matrix metalloproteinases to degrade matrix surrounding the ECs. ECs could escape from the vessel walls and invade surrounding tissue and also proliferate to form solid sprouts connecting neighboring vessels. Cell adhesion and migration govern the escape of ECs from the original vessel structures. Many molecules produced by ECs or surrounding tissue regulate this process. The integrin family plays an important role in the EC adhesion process. Thus, it is not surprising that molecules affecting the interaction between integrins and EC matrix will likely regulate angiogenesis and EC function. In fact, several proteins that regulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion emerge as key modulators of vascular functions (6Bass R. Fernández A.M. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46845-46848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Pezzatini S. Morbidelli L. Solito R. Paccagnini E. Boanini E. Bigi A. Ziche M.

Previously, our laboratory showed that maspin interacts with integrin β1 in mammary epithelial cells (10Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we have provided direct evidence that maspin inhibits angiogenesis through controlling EC cell adhesion, migration, and adhesion-mediated cell signaling pathway. In particular, we have shown that maspin increases endothelia cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN), laminin, collagen, and vitronectin, which in turn activates integrin β1, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and the FAK signal transduction pathway. Subsequent changes in focal adhesion and cytoskeleton reorganization result in the attachment and spreading of ECs on the matrix. Furthermore, we discovered that maspin also blocked EC cell migration by disrupting focal adhesion disassembly. This report identifies maspin as one of the key molecules that play a key role in EC cell adhesion and migration. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in endothelial basic medium, and harvested when cells reached 70–80% confluent. Anti-Rac1 and anti-ILK antibodies and myelin basic protein (MBP) protein were obtained from Upstate, Inc., vinculin antibody and collagen were from Sigma, anti-integrin αvβ3 (LM609) and anti-integrin β1 (AIIB2) were a kind gift from Dr. Karl S. Matlin. Vitronectin was obtained from Chemicon. Anti-active integrin β1 was from Pharmingen and anti-cdc42 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Laminin-1 and fibronectin were purchased from Invitrogen. Other cell culture reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. GST-Maspin is mouse maspin fused to GST as described previously (7Zhang M. Sheng S. Maass N. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 49-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparations of GST-Maspin and GST followed the procedure as described in Ref. 7Zhang M. Sheng S. Maass N. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 49-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Recombinant proteins were pre-treated with polymyxin B beads and dialyzed against PBS before being used in cell culture. Mouse embryonic yolk sac samples at E9.5 were fixed and sectioned to 5-μm slides. Anti-maspin antibody (ABS4A, 0.25 μg/μl, 1:250) was used for immunostaining as described before (13Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Maspin immunostaining in HUVECs was done using the same ABS4A antibody at the same concentration with a Texas Red-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody. Cells were counterstained with DAPI. For vinculin and integrin β1 immunostaining, HUVECs were first serum starved for 4 h and detached by 0.05% trypsin EDTA. After incubating with 0.5 μm GST-Maspin or GST protein in serum-free endothelial basic medium for 30 min, cells were seeded to FN-coated coverslips for 30 min with or without bFGF. Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. For the nocodazole-treated group, serum-starved HUVECs were first incubated with 10 nm nocodazole for 4 h and then treated with 0.5 μm GST-Maspin or GST, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Fixed cells were incubated with antibodies against vinculin (1 μg/μl, 1:200) or active integrin β1 (0.5 μg/μl, 1:100) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with the appropriate second antibodies labeled with FITC or Texas Red. Nuclei were stained by DAPI. Images were acquired with a ×100 objective using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. HUVEC cells were serum-starved for 4 h, detached with 0.05% trypsin, and then incubated with GST-Maspin or GST for the indicated time at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After lysing cells with RIPA buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture), cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-PY20 antibody and separated by an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transferring to immunoblot the PVDF membrane (Bio-Red). Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphorylated FAK antibody and blots were visualized with chemiluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.). For the quantitation of active Rac1 and cdc42, starved HUVECs were preincubated with bFGF (20 ng/ml) prior to GST-Maspin or GST treatment. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with PAK1 and immunoblotted with anti-Rac1 or anti-cdc42 antibodies. An anti-Tyr(P)397-FAK antibody was used to detect phosphorylated FAK at Tyr397 site. An anti-FAK antibody against total FAK was purchased from Pharmingen and used at 1:200 dilution (0.2 μg/μl). Maspin Western immunoblot analysis was done using a mouse maspin polyclonal antibody as described previously (10Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NunclonTM 96-well flat-bottom polyvinyl chloride plates (NuncTM, Roskilde, Denmark) were covered with FN, laminin, collagen, or vitronectin at 15 μg/ml or the indicated concentrations, and then blocked with 1% BSA for 30 min. Serum-starved HUVEC cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA and re-suspended in serum-free endothelial basic medium at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml. Cells were then incubated with GST-Maspin or GST at 0.5 μm concentration at 37 °C for 30 min. In the antibody-blocking assay, cells were first incubated with anti-maspin polyclonal rabbit antibody (0.5 μg/μl, 1:200) or anti-β1 antibody (AIIB2, 0.2 μg/μl, 1:80) for 20 min before GST-Maspin or GST treatment, and then added to the matrix-coated plates, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 0.5 h. After washing the plate with PBS to remove unattached cells, the adhered HUVEC cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 10% ethanol. The violet stain was solubilized with 1:1 (v:v) 0.1 m NaH2PO4 (pH 4.5) and ethanol, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm with a microplate reader. ILK kinase assay was performed using a rabbit immunoaffinity purified ILK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). MBP served as the substrate and could be phosphorylated by active ILK. HUVECs were first incubated with GST-Maspin or GST for 1 h and then lysed in RIPA buffer. Cell extracts (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated by protein A-agarose beads, which were conjugated with ILK antibody. After washing the beads once with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT), beads were re-suspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing the MBP substrate (2 μg), 10 mm ATP, and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with occasional mixing and separated by electrophoresis in a 10% PAGE gel. Phosphorylated proteins were quantified after exposure to autoradiographic film. Selected maspin siRNAs (229 and 455) were cloned into pSUPER.retro.puro vector (Oligo Engine) as previously described (10Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and transfected into PT67 packaging cells. Supernatants containing virus were added to HUVEC cells for 2 days in the presence of 2 μg/ml of Polybrene. Empty pSUPER.retro and siRNA negative control (sequence 1; Ambion) were used as negative controls. After infection for 2 days, cells were selected with 1 μg/ml of puromycin. Maspin knockdown efficiency was evaluated by Western blot analysis using a maspin polyclonal antibody as described previously (10Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Pooled cells of siRNA stable clones were used in the adhesion assays. Cell motility assay were performed with a HitKit (Cellomics, Inc.) assay as described (53Qin L. Liu Z. Chen H. Xu J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 3819-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, blue fluorescent beads were added to wells of a 96-well plate pre-coated with FN (1.5 μg/well). After incubating the plate in the dark at 37 °C for 60 min, the extra beads were removed with PBS buffer. HUVECs were pre-treated with 0.5 μm GST-Maspin or GST, respectively, with or without bFGF, and plated to the wells of a 96-well plate at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/ml. After incubation for 2, 7, and 18 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, cells were fixed with 5.5% formaldehyde for 60 min and stained with a rhodamine-phalloidin. Images from five randomly selected areas were taken for each sample under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope and the track areas were quantitatively analyzed using a NIH Image J software. Focal adhesion disassembly assay was performed as described (14Ezratty E.J. Partridge M.A. Gundersen G.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2005; 7: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Briefly, nocodazole was applied to activate Rho GTPase and stimulate the formation of focal adhesion and stress fibers in the cells. After nocodazole treatment, cells were washed with PBS and focal adhesion started to disassemble. Starved HUVECs were incubated with 10 nm nocodazole for 4 h. After washing out the drug with PBS, cells were incubated with 0.5 μm GST-Maspin or GST, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 0-, 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min time points, followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. For Western blot analysis, starved cells were first treated with 10 nm nocodazole for 4 h and incubated with 0.5 μm GST-Maspin or GST for the indicated times as described above. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and extracts were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gel to determine the level of Tyr(P)397-FAK. Maspin is known to be expressed in the epithelial cells of mammary and prostate glands (15Sager R. Sheng S. Pemberton P. Hendrix M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 213: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistently, we also detected expression of maspin in embryonic endothelial cells and stromal cells in blood islands by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A). In cultured HUVECs, positive maspin signals were observed in the cytoplasm in a punctate staining pattern (Fig. 1C). Additionally, Western blotting analysis revealed maspin expression in HUVECs (Fig. 1E). Secreted maspin may act on the surface of ECs to regulate cell adhesion, in a manner similar to mammary epithelial-derived maspin that acts on the cell surface to modulate adhesion to the laminin 1-rich matrix (2Cher M.L. Biliran Jr., H.R. Bhagat S. Meng Y. Che M. Lockett J. Abrams J. Fridman R. Zachareas M. Sheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we seeded HUVECs in wells pre-coated with FN and treated the cells with different concentrations of recombination GST-Maspin or GST. Maspin treatment enhanced cell adhesion on FN in a concentration-dependent manner. The enhanced cell adhesion peaked with 0.5 μm GST-Maspin treatment (Fig. 1F). To examine the effect of maspin on HUVEC adhesion on different matrices, HUVEC cells were seeded in wells pre-coated with FN (15 μg/ml), laminin (2 μg/ml), collagen I (15 μg/ml), and vitronectin (1 μg/ml) and treated with 0.5 μm GST-Maspin or GST protein. Maspin significantly enhanced HUVEC cell adhesion to these matrices with varied effects (Fig. 1G). To determine whether the enhanced cell adhesion is caused by the interaction of exogenous GST-Maspin on cell membrane not the endogenous maspin, HUVEC-derived maspin was knocked down by RNA interference. Western blot analysis showed that maspin was knocked down efficiently (80% reduction) in HUVECs (Fig. 1I), and these HUVEC-siRNA maspin cells displayed significant reduction in cell adhesion (90% of wild type HUVECs). However, when HUVEC-siRNA maspin cells were treated with GST-Maspin they responded with enhanced cell adhesion, similar to the HUVEC-siRNA control and wild type HUVECs (Fig. 1H). Previous reports showed that different regions of maspin protein participated in the regulation of cell migration, depending on the cell types and matrix contexts (16Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reactive site loop (RSL) or other regions of maspin are involved in HUVEC cell adhesion, several maspin mutants were tested by adhesion assay (Fig. 2A). A deletion mutant Mp (1–139 amino acids (aa)) abolished the effect of maspin on HUVEC cell adhesion. Mp (140–375 amino acids) retained most of the enhancing effect of maspin on adhesion (Fig. 2B), suggesting the 140–375-aa region may play the important role in cell adhesion. Mp (1–225 aa) slightly enhanced HUVEC adhesion (Fig. 2B). Previous studies showed that the maspin RSL domain plays a role in regulating breast cancer cell migration (17Ngamkitidechakul C. Warejcka D.J. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31796-31806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Arginine 340, located in the RSL motif in maspin, is critical for its interaction with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and involved in regulating cell migration (18Yin S. Lockett J. Meng Y. Biliran Jr., H. Blouse G.E. Li X. Reddy N. Zhao Z. Lin X. Anagli J. Cher M.L. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To test the role of this region in cell adhesion, we generated maspin mutants with deletion of the C terminus containing the RSL domain and a mutant with point mutation at 340 aa (Arg to Ala) in the RSL region. The cell adhesion assay showed that both mutants could enhance HUVEC cell adhesion, but at a reduced level compared with wild type maspin (Fig. 2, A and B). Using a polyclone anti-maspin antibody (raised against the full-length of maspin protein) we found that cell adhesions on both FN and laminin were significantly blocked by this antibody (Fig. 2, C and D). These findings confirm the specific enhancement of cell adhesion by maspin. Integrins play an important role in cell adhesion. To address whether exogenous maspin affects cell adhesion through integrin, we examined the activation status of integrin following maspin treatment. Because integrin α5β1 mediates cell adhesion on FN, we first examined whether integrin β1 was involved in maspin-mediated HUVEC cell adhesion on FN. Activation of integrin β1 can be detected with a unique β1 antibody that recognizes the activated β1 present within integrin clusters (19Abraham S. Zhang W. Greenberg N. Zhang M. J. Urol. 2003; 169: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis, using this specific antibody, showed that integrin β1 was rapidly activated following the treatment of GST-Maspin. Notably, formation of the integrin cluster was observed throughout the surface of HUVECs following GST-Maspin treatment (Fig. 3A). As a control, GST treatment did not activate integrin β1 in HUVECs (Fig. 3B). On average, there were 3 sites of clustered integrins observed on each HUVEC treated with GST (n = 8). On the contrary, the GST-Mapsin-treated HUVECs contained 22 clusters per cell (n = 10) (p < 0.05). In general, clustered integrins (indicative of activation) are presented on the protuberant edge of cells, a requirement for focal adhesion formation. However, GST-Maspin-treated HUVECs displayed a unique pattern of activated integrin β1. The distribution of activated integrin β1, in GST-Maspin-treated HUVECs, was in a non-polarized manner (Fig. 3A). To further confirm the activation of integrin β1 by maspin, we employed an anti-integrin β1 blocking antibody (AIIB2) to determine whether it could abolish maspin-mediated enhancement of cell adhesion on FN. HUVECs were preincubated with AIIB2 antibody for 60 min and then treated with GST-Maspin or GST. As expected, AIIB2 antibody treatment completely blocked maspin-mediated enhancement of cell adhesion. On the contrary, when HUVECs were first treated by GST-Maspin and then incubated with the AIIB2 antibody, the antibody no longer blocked the enhanced cell adhesion by GST-Maspin (Fig. 3C). Similar results were observed in another adhesion assay using laminin 1 as the matrix (Fig. 3D). Integrin signal is transferred from outside into the intracellular compartment through the integrin cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of integrin β1 interacts with ILK, which subsequently phosphorylates a series of signaling molecules in the downstream pathway. In particular, ILK could phosphorylate a MBP, which can be used as substrate in the ILK kinase assay. If maspin activates HUVEC integrin β1, ILK activity should be increased following GST-Maspin treatment. Using MBP as the substrate in the ILK assay, we found that extracts from GST-Maspin-treated HUVECs can phosphorylate more MBP compared with the GST-treated HUVECs group (Fig. 3E), indicating that GST-Maspin treatment increased ILK activity in HUVECs. Integrin activation leads to phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK is a cytoplasmic non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, whose phosphorylation is required by downstream signaling in many cell types. To examine the effect of maspin on phosphorylated FAK in HUVECs, cell extracts harvested from GST-Maspin or GST-treated HUVECs were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FAK antibody and blotted with PY20 antibody, which recognizes all tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We found that the level of phosphorylated FAKs was increased at 30 min following GST-Maspin treatment, which returned to baseline at 60 min (Fig. 3F). One of the cellular responses to integrin activation is cytoskeleton reorganization. Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein that stabilizes the interaction between talin and actin or talin and membrane. By immunofluorescence staining, we found that the vinculin pattern changed drastically in maspin-treated HUVECs. In particular, we found that in GST-Maspin-treated HUVECs, the discontinuous acicular signals were observed in 30% of cells (n = 50) and distributed along the periphery of HUVECs at 30 min following treatment (Fig. 4A). However, at 60 min, 70% of cells (n = 50) exhibited the acicular signals and the density of signals became much stronger compared with 30 min (Fig. 4B). The strength of acicular signals retained the same intensity in 70% of cells at the 120-min time point (n = 50) (Fig. 4C). On the contrary, in the GST-treated control group, less than 10% of cells were observed with very weak signals surrounding the cell periphery at 30 min (n = 50) (Fig. 4D). There was no increase in the number of positive cells nor in the signal intensity in GST-treated HUVECs at the 60- or 120-min time points (Fig. 4, E and F). Phalloidin was used to monitor the changes of actin cytoskeleton in GST- or GST-Maspin-treated HUVECs. We found that GST-Maspin treatment in HUVECs led to rapid formation of microfilaments, which extended into focal adhesions at 30 min. Abundant thin filaments were distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4G). Up to 60 min post-GST-Maspin treatment, more microfilaments were formed and extended into the focal adhesions, which were distributed in a radial-like pattern along the cell peripheral in an unpolarized manner (Fig. 4H). There were more thin filaments distributed in the cytoplasm as compared with the control cells at the same time point. Even at 120 min after GST-Maspin treatment, there were still more numbers of microfilaments and thin filaments observed as compared with the control treated HUVECs (Fig. 4I), suggesting that GST-Maspin treatment led to reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which facilitates cell adhesion and subsequent spreading on matrix. GST treatment led to different F-actin pattern in HUVECs. Linear F-actin filaments and very few microfilaments were observed scattered in the cytosol of HUVECs at 30 min (Fig. 4J). Up to 60 min, the microfilament amount in cells increased. Most were surrounding the nuclei and a small portion extended into focal adhesions that were distributed in a polarized manner. There were also some thin filaments in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4K). At 120 min of GST treatment, microfilaments in cells were decreased, whereas a small amount of thin filaments with weak staining were observed scattered in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4L). Cell migration is a complex process, including delicate control of cell adhesion, disassembly of adhesion, and changes of cytoskeleton. The effect of maspin on HUVEC cell migration was examined by monitoring the migration track of cells on the matrix following GST-Maspin or GST treatments at different time points (2, 7, and 18 h) with or without bFGF. GST-Maspin treatment significantly reduced the HUVEC cell migration rate at all time points (Fig. 5A, panels a–f). However, in the presence of bFGF, GST-Maspin treatment exhibited much stronger inhibition on cell migration with a decrease of over 50% of the migration area compared with the GST treatment (Fig. 5A, panels g–l). We also examined the pattern of the focal adhesion complex in HUVECs treated with bFGF and GST-Maspin or bFGF and GST. Using vinculin immunofluorescence staining, we monitored the changes of focal adhesion in these HUVECs. In GST-treated HUVECs stimulated with bFGF, focal adhesions were present in a polarized pattern of distribution. Punctate vinculin signals were located at the migrating edge of the HUVECs. However, HUVECs treated with GST-Maspin and bFGF displayed a non-polarized, immobile pattern (data not show). Cell migration is generally associated with the increase of active Rac1 and cdc42. We further examined Rac1 and cdc42 Rho GTPase levels in HUVEC cells following GST-Maspin or GST treatment. In accordance with the pattern of focal adhesion, we f"

In addition, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer expresses a higher level of ATBF1, suggesting a role of ATBF1 in ER-positive breast cancer. In this study, we examined whether and how ATBF1 affects the ER function in breast cancer cells. We found that ATBF1 inhibited ER-mediated gene transcription, cell growth, and proliferation in ER-positive breast cancer cells. In vitro and in vivo immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that ATBF1 interacted physically with the ER and that multiple domains in both ATBF1 and ER proteins mediated the interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ATBF1 inhibited ER function by selectively competing with the steroid receptor coactivator AIB1 but not GRIP1 or SRC1 for binding to the ER. These findings not only support the concept that ATBF1 plays a tumor-suppressive role in breast cancer, they also provide a mechanism for how ATBF1 functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2036437603,"Bacteriophage endolysins include a group of new antibacterials reluctant to development of resistance. We present here the first structural study of the Cpl-7 endolysin, encoded by pneumococcal bacteriophage Cp-7. It contains an N-terminal catalytic module (CM) belonging to the GH25 family of glycosyl hydrolases and a C-terminal region encompassing three identical repeats of 42 amino acids (CW_7 repeats). These repeats are unrelated to choline-targeting motifs present in other cell wall hydrolases produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae and its bacteriophages, and are responsible for the protein attachment to the cell wall. By combining different biophysical techniques and molecular modeling, a three-dimensional model of the overall protein structure is proposed, consistent with circular dichroism and sequence-based secondary structure prediction, small angle x-ray scattering data, and Cpl-7 hydrodynamic behavior. Cpl-7 is an ∼115-Å long molecule with two well differentiated regions, corresponding to the CM and the cell wall binding region (CWBR), arranged in a lateral disposition.

Bacteria and bacteriophages produce a variety of enzymes that cleave the peptidoglycan, the cell wall hydrolases (CWHs), 3The abbreviations used are: CWHcell wall hydrolaseCMcatalytic moduleCW_7cell wall-binding repeat of Cpl-7CWBRcell wall-binding regionPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationSAXSsmall angle X-ray scatteringSSsecondary structure. either to lyse host cells or to re-model the cell wall during growth and division. Many of these enzymes have a modular structure and are composed of catalytic units linked to a number of other modules. The Cpl-7 lysozyme, the lytic enzyme (endolysin) encoded by the pneumococcal bacteriophage Cp-7, consists of a catalytic N-terminal domain fused to a C-terminal region containing three identical tandem repeats of 48 amino acids (the third motif has the last six residues missing), which is essential for activity and unique among CWHs encoded by the pneumococcus and its bacteriophages (1García P. García J.L. García E. Sánchez-Puelles J.M. López R. Gene. 1990; 86: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2García P. García J.L. López R. García E. Waldor M.K. Friedman D.L. Adhya S. Phages: Their Role in Bacterial Pathogenesis and Biotechnology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C2005: 335-361Google Scholar). However, the same type of repeats (termed CW_7 hereafter) has been later identified in other proteins putatively associated with bacterial cell wall degradation activity (3Donovan D.M. Foster-Frey J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 287: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The catalytic module (CM) of Cpl-7 belongs to the GH25 family of glycosyl hydrolases and shows 85.6% sequence identity with the CM of the Cpl-1 lysozyme, the endolysin encoded by the pneumococcal bacteriophage Cp-1 (4García J.L. García E. Arrarás A. García P. Ronda C. López R. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cell wall binding region (CWBR) of Cpl-1, made of six tandem copies of ∼20 amino acid residues plus a terminal tail, belongs to the family of pneumococcal choline-binding modules (5López R. García E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 553-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Its lytic activity is thus conditioned by the presence of choline moieties in pneumococcal teichoic and lipoteichoic acids and becomes inhibited at high choline concentrations (IC50 = 2 mm) (1García P. García J.L. García E. Sánchez-Puelles J.M. López R. Gene. 1990; 86: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6García P. Paz González M. García E. García J.L. López R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cpl-7 degrades pneumococcal cell walls containing either choline or ethanolamine and retains full activity even in the presence of high concentrations of these amino alcohols (7Diaz E. López R. Garcia J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5464-5471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This strongly indicates that the C-terminal modules of Cpl-7 and Cpl-1 are responsible for cell wall targeting but recognize different structural elements of the bacterial envelope. Indeed, the loss of the CWBR by controlled proteolytic digestion reduces 4 orders of magnitude the activity of Cpl-7 CM against pneumococcal cell walls containing either choline or ethanolamine (8Sanz J.M. Díaz E. García J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reduced activity of this truncated form is comparable with those reported for the isolated CM of Cpl-1 against both types of substrates and for the full-length form of Cpl-1 when assayed against ethanolamine-containing cell walls, and it reflects the intrinsic activity of Cpl-7 and Cpl-1 CMs without cooperation of their cell wall-binding motifs. The relationship between the CW_7 repeats and the substrate specificity displayed by the Cpl-7 lysozyme was clearly demonstrated by construction of a chimeric protein, LC7, consisting of the CM of the LytA amidase (the major pneumococcal autolysin and a choline-dependent enzyme) fused to the C-terminal region of Cpl-7 (7Diaz E. López R. Garcia J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5464-5471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This chimeric enzyme exhibited an amidase activity capable of degrading ethanolamine-containing cell walls not inhibited by choline. Furthermore, the CWBR also determined the optimal pH for the catalytic activity of LC7 and the parental enzymes. Interestingly, the acquisition of one or two CW_7-like motifs by the endopeptidase module of the λSa2 endolysin, a bifunctional enzyme containing endopeptidase and β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities, not only increased the activity on several streptococcal strains but was shown to be essential for its activity on staphylococci (3Donovan D.M.

In contrast, although the CM of Cpl-7 has been recently crystallized (13Silva-Martin N. Molina R. Angulo I. Mancheño J.M. García P. Hermoso J.A. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr.

Because of their unique ability to cleave peptidoglycan in a generally species-specific manner, endolysins represent a novel class of antibacterial agents (enzybiotics) and provide a mean of selective and rapid killing of pathogenic bacteria, refractory to resistance development (14Fischetti V.A.

The presence in the Cpl-7 endolysin of a cell wall-binding motif that may recognize a distinct element of the cell wall opens new possibilities to the potential use of both the wild-type enzyme and chimeric constructions bearing CW_7 repeats as efficient enzybiotics against Streptococcus pneumoniae and other Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. This study reports the first structural characterization of the Cpl-7 lysozyme using low resolution experimental techniques, i.e. CD, analytical ultracentrifugation, and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and three-dimensional modeling. Cpl-7 behaves as a monomer in solution, and its two modules are arranged forming an elongated particle of ≅115 Å long. The CM has the (βα)5β3 barrel characteristic of the GH25 family, whereas the CWBR would include three tandemly assembled, three-helical bundles whose disposition reminds a super-helical structure. The high resolution models proposed here for the isolated modules together with the SAXS-derived model for the overall protein structure provide clues to facilitate the identification of residues and surfaces important for Cpl-7 attachment to the cell wall. Finally, the three-helical bundle formed by the CW_7 repeat seems to be conserved in the related motifs that have been identified, in variable number and position, linked to a variety of catalytic units and cell wall-binding motifs in many putative proteins potentially involved in cell wall metabolism.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and Cpl-7 lysozyme (38,438 Da; Entrez code, AAA72844) was purified from Escherichia coli RB791 cells harboring pCP700. E. coli cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg ml−1) to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of ∼0.6. Lactose was then added (2% w/v final concentration) and incubation continued overnight. Cells were harvested at 4 °C by centrifugation in an SLA-3000 rotor (Sorvall) for 20 min at 8,000 rpm, resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9 (Pi buffer), and disrupted in a French pressure cell press. The insoluble fraction was separated by centrifugation (13,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall) for 20 min), and the supernatant was treated with streptomycin sulfate (0.8% w/v final concentration) to precipitate nucleic acids. The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation and subjected to a fractioning at increasing concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitated between 20 and 35% (w/v) of salt saturation were resuspended and exhaustively dialyzed against Pi buffer (24 h, 5×, 500 ml), and then loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (15 × 2 cm) at 0.5 ml min−1 flow rate. The column was washed with Pi buffer until the initial base line (A280) was recovered. A discontinuous NaCl gradient was then applied using a Pharmacia LKB fast-protein liquid chromatograph (GE Healthcare). After a first gradient from 0 to 0.3 m of salt (60 min), followed by washing with 0.3 m NaCl until base-line recovering, the protein was eluted with a gradient from 0.3 to 0.5 m NaCl (60 min) followed by 30 min of washing with 1 m NaCl. Cpl-7 eluted around 0.46 m salt, and the fractions collected showed a single band in SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide) whose mobility agreed with the protein theoretical mass. Fractions with A280/A260 ratios ≥1.8 were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against Pi buffer before being stored at −20 °C. Those with lower absorbance ratios were subjected to an additional gel filtration chromatography step in a SuperoseTM 12 column (GE Healthcare; 30 × 1.5 cm) to remove minor contaminations by nucleic acids. The protein was eluted (0.5 ml min−1) isocratically with Pi buffer, and the collected fractions were stored as above. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C, and reagents (Sigma) were of analytical grade. Protein activity was tested using [methyl-3H]choline-labeled pneumococcal cell walls (7Diaz E. López R. Garcia J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5464-5471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cpl-7 concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm of 65,700 ± 700 m−1 cm−1, determined according to Gill and von Hippel (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Cpl-7 was sequenced using an automatic sequencer (model 477A from Applied Biosystems) as described previously (25Speicher D.W. Methods. 1994; 6: 262-273Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CD spectra (average of four scans) were recorded in the far-UV region using a Jasco-J810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp.) equipped with a Peltier-type cell holder. Measurements were performed using a scan rate of 20 nm min−1, a response time of 4 s, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and protein concentrations of 5.2 and 26 μm (1- and 0.2-mm path length cells, respectively). Buffer contribution was subtracted from the experimental data, and the corrected ellipticity was converted to mean residue ellipticity using an average molecular mass per residue of 112.39. Secondary structure (SS) content was estimated by deconvolution of the experimental curves with CONTIN (26Provencher S.W. Glöckner J.

Final prediction data include only those residues whose secondary structure was predicted with reliability above 86% by at least two of the three methods. Sedimentation velocity measurements were carried out using an Optima XL-A (absorption optics) and an Optima XL-I (interference) analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for detection of concentration gradients. The experiments were performed in Pi buffer at 45,000 rpm, with 400 μl of protein solution in each cell, using double sector Epon-charcoal centerpieces. Differential sedimentation coefficients, c(s), were calculated by least squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the program SEDFIT (32Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). The SEDNTERP program (33Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) was used to calculate standard sedimentation coefficients, s20,w, from the experimental values, the effective Stokes radius (RS), and the frictional ratio (f/f0) assuming a specific hydration grade of 0.404 g of water/g of protein. A partial specific volume of 0.722 ml g−1 at 20 °C was calculated from the amino acid composition (33Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed at 20 °C by centrifugation of 80 μl samples at 10,000, 12,000 and 17,000 rpm in the Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge. Conservation of mass in the cell was checked in all the experiments. Data were analyzed following previously reported protocols (34Varea J. Monterroso B. Sáiz J.L. López-Zumel C. García J.L.

The theoretical value of the sedimentation coefficient of ab initio and high resolution models proposed for the overall structure were calculated using HYDRO and HYDROPRO (35Garcia de la Torre J.

A search for homologues of Cpl-7 modules in the nonredundant protein sequence data base at NCBI using PSI-BLAST (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) returned the catalytic module of the Cpl-1 lysozyme (PDB code 1h09) as the best matching structure for the CM of Cpl-7. However, no sequences related to the CWBR with known structure were found. Protein-fold recognition methods were therefore applied using the FUGUE (38Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), 3D-PSSM (39Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol.

Proteins. 2007; 68: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) servers, taking as searching target either the sequence of the whole module or a single CW_7 repeat. Only the sequences identified as the best hits by at least two searching methods showing some relevant residue conservation and a good correlation with the SS of the CWBR were considered as possible templates for the structural model. Sequence alignments were performed using Clustal_X (41Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar) and corrected, when necessary, by manual adjustment with SEAVIEW (42Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar) using as a guide the predicted SS of the target. The structural models were built automatically using the Swiss-Model server in the alignment mode (43Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6040) Google Scholar), and their quality was evaluated with PROCHECK (44Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), VERIFY3D (45Eisenberg D. Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), QMEAN (46Benkert P. Tosatto S.C. Schomburg D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2008; 71: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), and ERRAT (47Colovos C. Yeates T.O. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Several cycles of model building, realignment, and validation were repeated for the CWBR until no further optimization of the structure was achieved. The best structural models of each module were inspected visually to identify atomic clashes that were relieved by manually twisting the amino acid side chains using the Sybyl software (Sybyl version 7.2, Tripos Inc.). After addition of all hydrogen atoms, the energy of the optimized structures was minimized with the AMBER force field implemented in the Sybyl package, using 3000 steps of the conjugate gradient minimization, and the quality of the final models was evaluated again as indicated above. Data collection was performed at the 2.1 station of Daresbury's synchrotron. The camera was set to cover ranges of the scattering vector (defined as reciprocal Bragg spacing, i.e. 2 sinφ/λ) from ∼0.001 to 0.060 Å−1, and data collected ranged from 0.045 to 0.05 Å−1. Absolute values of the scattering vector were obtained by reference to the orders of the 67 nm repeat in wet rat tail collagen. The temperature of the samples was set at 4 °C, and the x-ray scattering profiles were recorded in 60 time frames of 30 s. Prior to SAXS data collection, Cpl-7 samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 (TL100.3 rotor), and the lowest part of the protein solution was discarded to remove possible aggregates. Data processing was performed using the software package provided by the Collaborative Computational Project for Fiber Diffraction and Solution Scattering. Raw data were normalized by beam intensity and detector response before being processed. Time frames showing radiation damage were removed before averaging. The Guinier plot of log(I(s)) against s2, where I(s) is the scattered intensity, was used to check the quality of the scattering data and the presence or absence of aggregates or interparticle interferences in solution (48Jacques D.A. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 642-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A first estimation of Rg and the forward scattering intensity (Io) was obtained from the slope and the y-intercept in the range of s values where the Guinier plot fits to a straight line (48Jacques D.A. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 642-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The radius of gyration (Rg), Io, and the pair distance distribution function (p(r)) were then calculated from the experimental scattering data using the package GNOM (49Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2971) Google Scholar). The maximum dimension of the particle, Dmax, was determined empirically by examining the qualities of the fits of p(r) Fourier transform to the experimental data for a given range of Dmax values. Ab initio bead models of Cpl-7 were constructed with DALAI_GA (50Chacón P. Morán F. Díaz J.F. Pantos E. Andreu J.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2760-2775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) using SAXS data. Typically, 10 models were generated, superimposed, and aligned in pairs with SUPCOMB (51Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The models with lowest average spatial discrepancy were considered to be the most probable, and the most divergent ones were considered as outliers. The selected aligned structures were averaged (DAMAVER) and filtered (DAMFILT) using as cutoff in DAMFILT the 70% of its default value (52Wriggers W. Chacón P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 773-776Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The molecular envelope of the final model was obtained using the Situs package (53Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28368) Google Scholar), and the structural models built for the isolated modules were manually docked in this envelope using the USCF-Chimera program (54Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). The scattering profile and the radius of gyration of Cpl-7 model based in the docked structures were calculated with CRYSOL (55Sayers E.W. Barrett T. Benson D.A. Bolton E. Bryant S.H. Canese K.

The Cpl-7 lysozyme is the only member known of the pneumococcal CWH family whose activity does not require the presence of phosphocholine residues in teichoic and lipoteichoic acids associated to the bacterial cell wall (2García P.

C2005: 335-361Google Scholar). Instead of the choline-binding repeats that characterize pneumococcal CWHs, the CWBR of Cpl-7 includes three identical repeats of 48 amino acids (the CW_7 repeats), found for the first time in this lysozyme (1García P. García J.L. García E. Sánchez-Puelles J.M. López R. Gene. 1990; 86: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), although in the third one the last six residues are missing.

https://openalex.org/W2146426286,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a basic cellular process that plays a key role in normal embryonic development and in cancer progression/metastasis. Our previous study indicated that EMT processes of mouse and human epithelial cells induced by TGF-β display clear reduction of gangliotetraosylceramide (Gg4) and ganglioside GM2, suggesting a close association of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) with EMT. In the present study, using normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, we found that levels of Gg4 and of mRNA for the UDP-Gal:β1-3galactosyltransferase-4 (β3GalT4) gene, responsible for reduction of Gg4, were reduced in EMT induced by hypoxia (∼1% O(2)) or CoCl(2) (hypoxia mimic), similarly to that for TGF-β-induced EMT. An increase in the Gg4 level by its exogenous addition or by transfection of the β3GalT4 gene inhibited the hypoxia-induced or TGF-β-induced EMT process, including changes in epithelial cell morphology, enhanced motility, and associated changes in epithelial vs. mesenchymal molecules. We also found that Gg4 is closely associated with E-cadherin and β-catenin. These results suggest that the β3GalT4 gene, responsible for Gg4 expression, is down-regulated in EMT; and Gg4 has a regulatory function in the EMT process in NMuMG cells, possibly through interaction with epithelial molecules important to maintain epithelial cell membrane organization."
https://openalex.org/W1496900694,"G-protein signaling modulators (GPSM) play diverse functional roles through their interaction with G-protein subunits. AGS3 (GPSM1) contains four G-protein regulatory motifs (GPR) that directly bind Gα(i) free of Gβγ providing an unusual scaffold for the ""G-switch"" and signaling complexes, but the mechanism by which signals track into this scaffold are not well understood. We report the regulation of the AGS3·Gα(i) signaling module by a cell surface, seven-transmembrane receptor. AGS3 and Gα(i1) tagged with Renilla luciferase or yellow fluorescent protein expressed in mammalian cells exhibited saturable, specific bioluminescence resonance energy transfer indicating complex formation in the cell. Activation of α(2)-adrenergic receptors or μ-opioid receptors reduced AGS3-RLuc·Gα(i1)-YFP energy transfer by over 30%. The agonist-mediated effects were inhibited by pertussis toxin and co-expression of RGS4, but were not altered by Gβγ sequestration with the carboxyl terminus of GRK2. Gα(i)-dependent and agonist-sensitive bioluminescence resonance energy transfer was also observed between AGS3 and cell-surface receptors typically coupled to Gα(i) and/or Gα(o) indicating that AGS3 is part of a larger signaling complex. Upon receptor activation, AGS3 reversibly dissociates from this complex at the cell cortex. Receptor coupling to both Gαβγ and GPR-Gα(i) offer additional flexibility for systems to respond and adapt to challenges and orchestrate complex behaviors."

The current model to explain this specific recruitment of CE to Pol II as opposed to Pol I and Pol III rests on the interaction between CE and the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit Rpb1 and more specifically between the CE nucleotidyltransferase domain and the phosphorylated CTD. Through biochemical and diffraction analyses, we demonstrate the existence of a distinctive stoichiometric complex between CE and the phosphorylated Pol II (Pol IIO).

Pol II also couples transcription to nuclear processes including pre-mRNA modifications (1McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S.

Coupling RNA processing with synthesis is presumed to be critical in restricting the temporal window during which unmodified transcripts are vulnerable to degradation by endogenous ribonuclease activities (8Furuichi Y.

The Pol II elongation complex coordinates these transactions to help orchestrate control over gene expression (for review, see Ref. 11Perales R. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 178-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Such coordination is mediated by specific and reversible interactions among Pol II and the factors involved in elongation.The formation of RNA 5′ cap structure, m7GpppN, is the first transcription-coordinated RNA modification event, and it occurs as soon as the transcript attains ∼25 nucleotides (12Coppola J.A.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7572-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The RNA cap is formed in three enzymatic steps (16Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 17Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 1-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (i) removal of the 5′ γ-phosphate catalyzed by the RNA triphosphatase; (ii) attachment of a GMP to the 5′ diphosphate by the guanylyltransferase; (iii) methylation of the 5′ guanine by the cap methyltransferase. The first two of these steps are closely linked and coupled to Pol II transcription in most organisms. Mammals combine their triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase into a bi-functional capping enzyme (CE) encoded by a single gene. Fungal CEs comprise the two enzymes in a tightly associated complex, as exemplified by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CE, a heterotetrameric complex consisting of the guanylyltransferase Ceg1 and triphosphatase Cet1 subunits (18Gu M. Rajashankar K.R. Lima C.D. Structure. 2010; 18: 216-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 19Ghosh A. Lima C.D. Wiley Interdiscipl. Rev.: RNA. 2010; 1: 152-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence has also suggested non-catalytic roles of the CE in transcription regulation. For instance, stimulation of CE by HIV Tat promotes read-through of the viral genome (20Chiu Y.L. Ho C.K. Saha N. Schwer B. Shuman S. Rana T.M. Mol.

Cotranscriptional capping is effectuated by the specific interaction between a CE and its cognate RNA polymerase that supports a stoichiometric CE-polymerase complex (13Hagler J. Shuman S.

J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2293-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).The issue of class specificity in CE recruitment arises in eukaryotes because of the existence of three related RNA polymerases, Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III, that share five subunits (Rpb5, -6, -8, -10, and -12) but synthesize different classes of RNAs (28Woychik N.A. Liao S.M. Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Capping is specifically targeted to Pol II transcription complexes (1McCracken S. Fong N.

Importantly, mRNAs that are forced to be transcribed by Pol I, Pol III, or T7 RNA polymerase are uncapped (30Lo H.J. Huang H.K. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell.

It is known that CTD phosphorylation occurs reversibly on the serine-2, -5, or -7 residues in its heptapeptide motif, 1YSPTSPS7. It is also known that CTD phosphorylation patterns correlate with discrete stages of transcription (37Buratowski S. Nat. Struct.

CE binding to Pol II is stimulated by the phosphorylation at either Ser-2 or Ser-5 positions in the CTD (39Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol.

The binding per se does not require the presence of transcript in Pol II, as has been observed either in the absence of RNA polymerization events (3Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) or with the purified polymerase (33Yue Z. Maldonado E. Pillutla R. Cho H. Reinberg D. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12898-12903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the elongation factor Spt5 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe seems to contribute a CE recruitment function in vivo that overlaps with the function provided by the CTD (45Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19639-19648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 46Schneider S. Pei Y. Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although evidence exists for a functional interaction between Spt5 and CE in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (47Lindstrom D.L. Squazzo S.L. Muster N. Burckin T.A. Wachter K.C. Emigh C.A. McCleery J.A. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hartzog G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1368-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), it remains unclear if this interaction is critical in targeting CE to Pol II transcription because of a lack of biochemical and structural data on this issue. Because S. cerevisiae Spt5 also participates in Pol I transcription (48Schneider D.A. French S.L. Osheim Y.N. Bailey A.O. Vu L. Dodd J. Yates J.R. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12707-12712Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), Spt5 is not likely to be a decisive factor in the specific recruitment of CE to Pol II in budding yeast, although it may contribute a salubrious effect on the proper assembly of CE into the early elongation complex.The current model for Pol II-linked cotranscriptional RNA 5′-capping rests on the binding of CE to the phosphorylated CTD (CTD-P) (1McCracken S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9577-9585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The CTD is present but disordered in the Pol II crystal structure and may extend from the globular core of Pol II into bulk solution (49Spåhr H. Calero G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9185-9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Structural studies of a complex between the Cgt1 subunit (Candida albicans homolog of S. cerevisiae Ceg1) and synthetic CTD heptads bearing Ser(P)-5 have revealed interactions with about 2.5 CTD repeats that are coordinated in a surface groove within the nucleotidyltransferase (NT) domain of Cgt1 (51Fabrega C. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Given that there are 26–27 heptad repeats in the CTD of S. cerevisiae and the CE structures are highly conserved between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, one could expect at least eight copies of CE to bind, possibly distributively, along the CTD of yeast Pol II upon CTD phosphorylation. However, it is difficult to conceive that such spatially undefined interactions can provide the precise spatial and temporal information required to target CE activity to a narrow window within the transcription cycle. Furthermore, recent experiments with human cells found that the CTD alone was not sufficient for enhancing cotranscriptional processing in vivo, suggesting the involvement of additional Pol II components and/or associated factors in the process (52Natalizio B.J. Robson-Dixon N.D. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8692-8702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It, therefore, appears that CTD-P alone does not fully account for the Pol II specificity in CE recruitment even though CTD phosphorylation is critical for RNA capping in vivo.Here, we present evidence for a mechanism that complements the CTD-P-only recruitment model for CE function, thus shedding light on the Pol II-specificity in cotranscriptional targeting of the budding yeast CE. We demonstrate a distinctive and stoichiometric CE-Pol IIO complex that requires two interfaces on the polymerase. One interface is based on the CTD-P as expected from the common model and the Cgt1/CTD-P cocrystal structure (51Fabrega C. Shen V. Shuman S. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1549-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The other interface deemed important for the recognition is formed with the Pol II multihelical Foot domain (50Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Mutational impairment of either interface disrupts the stability of the complex in vitro and compromises cell growth, whereas overexpression of CE suppresses the in vivo effects of the interface mutations. Mutational evidence also indicates that the Foot domain plays an essential role in imparting specificity toward Pol II as opposed to Pol I and Pol III. Our data indicate that the simultaneous formation of the dual interface is necessary and sufficient to stabilize CE binding to the polymerase. Hence, the dual interface is the physical basis for specifying RNA CE to Pol II transcription in vivo. We also show that each of the two interfaces alone is unable to support stable interactions with CE. Therefore, the post-initiation Pol II capping complex may dissociate as soon as the state of either interface is changed, a modus operandi that seems suitable for the dynamic assembly and disassembly of multiprotein complexes involved in transcription regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA polymerases were purified directly from the budding yeast S. cerevisiae by applying the TAP-tagging strategy (53Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) with the procedures given in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Pol IIO was generated using the in vitro phosphorylation by MAP kinase 2 (MAPK2) under a condition known to produce both Ser(P)-2 and Ser(P)-5 sites but with preference toward Ser-5 positions (supplemental Experimental Procedures). The Pol IIO was indistinguishable from that generated with the yeast TFIIK kinase, a subcomplex of TFIIH (supplemental Fig. S1B), which is responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of the CTD and the recruitment of CE (29Rodriguez C.R.

Lee D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14276-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As such, the Pol IIO generated in vitro was suitable for binding studies with CE. The heterodimeric yeast CE and its individual subunits (Ceg1 and Cet1) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures.Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusions were constructed using PCR primers corresponding to sequence regions that each encompassed a Pol II structural domain (50Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), i.e. the CTD of Rpb1, Rpb1-Foot, Rpb2-Lobe (residues 216–407), Rpb5, Rpb6, and Rpb8 subunits and Rpb6 truncations. GST-CTD-P and MBP-CTD-P were generated by the same in vitro phosphorylation procedure as used for generating Pol IIO. The GST- and MBP-mediated chromatographic procedures are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures.Affinity capture by calmodulin-coupled beads was used in analyzing CE recognition of RNA polymerases. The calmodulin-binding peptide on the C terminus of a polymerase subunit (Rpb7 for Pol II, Rpb8 for Pol I) was derived from the TAP purification procedure. The calmodulin-binding peptide allowed the immobilization of a polymerase complex on calmodulin beads. Detailed conditions are given in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Size exclusion chromatography was applied to assess stabilities of the various polymerase-CE complexes under the conditions given in the supplemental Experimental Procedures.For the determination of protein stoichiometry, the gels resulting from affinity assays and size-exclusion chromatography experiments were stained with Coomassie Blue and digitized with an optical scanner (CanoScan-4400F) that proved to produce an even background. Intensities of bands (e.g. Ceg1 and Rpb2 for CE and Pol II, respectively) were quantified with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare), normalized against their respective molecular weights, and used to determine the stoichiometry.Western blotting was performed using antibodies directed against Ceg1 (55Schwer B. Shuman S. RNA. 1996; 2: 574-583PubMed Google Scholar) and Cet1 (56Myers L.C. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 883-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for the yeast CE and against Rpb4 (NeoClone) for yeast Pol II. The bands were quantified using the ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad).Plasmid shuffle assays were based on the counter-selection of URA3-containing cells by 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) and performed with standard procedures. Details of the shuffling experiment and also the Ceg1 overexpression in the strains are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. The coimmunoprecipitation experiments were done with cell extracts of FOA-resistant strains, each carrying an rpb1 allele, using the procedure given in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. X-ray crystallography was employed to reveal structural aspects of the interaction between CE and Pol II. Detailed procedures and conditions are given in the supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Pol II also couples transcription to nuclear processes including pre-mRNA modifications (1McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S.

Coupling RNA processing with synthesis is presumed to be critical in restricting the temporal window during which unmodified transcripts are vulnerable to degradation by endogenous ribonuclease activities (8Furuichi Y.

The Pol II elongation complex coordinates these transactions to help orchestrate control over gene expression (for review, see Ref. 11Perales R. Bentley D. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 178-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Such coordination is mediated by specific and reversible interactions among Pol II and the factors involved in elongation.The formation of RNA 5′ cap structure, m7GpppN, is the first transcription-coordinated RNA modification event, and it occurs as soon as the transcript attains ∼25 nucleotides (12Coppola J.A.

Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 17Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 1-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (i) removal of the 5′ γ-phosphate catalyzed by the RNA triphosphatase; (ii) attachment of a GMP to the 5′ diphosphate by the guanylyltransferase; (iii) methylation of the 5′ guanine by the cap methyltransferase. The first two of these steps are closely linked and coupled to Pol II transcription in most organisms. Mammals combine their triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase into a bi-functional capping enzyme (CE) encoded by a single gene. Fungal CEs comprise the two enzymes in a tightly associated complex, as exemplified by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CE, a heterotetrameric complex consisting of the guanylyltransferase Ceg1 and triphosphatase Cet1 subunits (18Gu M. Rajashankar K.R. Lima C.D. Structure. 2010; 18: 216-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 19Ghosh A. Lima C.D. Wiley Interdiscipl. Rev.: RNA. 2010; 1: 152-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence has also suggested non-catalytic roles of the CE in transcription regulation. For instance, stimulation of CE by HIV Tat promotes read-through of the viral genome (20Chiu Y.L. Ho C.K. Saha N. Schwer B. Shuman S. Rana T.M. Mol.

A precise mechanism for how the N-type Ca2+ channel plays a role in neurodegenerative disease, however, is unknown. In this study, we immunized N-type Ca2+ channel α1B-deficient (α1B−/−) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55 and analyzed the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The neurological symptoms of EAE in the α1B−/− mice were less severe than in the WT mice. In conjunction with these results, sections of the spinal cord (SC) from α1B−/− mice revealed a reduction in both leukocytic infiltration and demyelination compared with WT mice. No differences were observed in the delayed-type hypersensitivity response, spleen cell proliferation, or cytokine production from splenocytes between the two genotypes. On the other hand, Western blot array analysis and RT-PCR revealed that a typical increase in the expression of MCP-1 in the SC showed a good correlation with the infiltration of leukocytes into the SC. Likewise, immunohistochemical analysis showed that the predominant source of MCP-1 was activated microglia. The cytokine-induced production of MCP-1 in primary cultured microglia from WT mice was significantly higher than that from α1B−/− mice and was significantly inhibited by a selective N-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, ω-conotoxin GVIA or a withdrawal of extracellular Ca2+.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disorder of the CNS leading to a progressive decline of motor and sensory functions and permanent disability. The pathogenesis of MS consists of two phases, inflammation and neurodegeneration (1Steinman L. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar).

Although no single animal model mimics a human autoimmune disease completely, EAE resembles the pathology found in MS, including infiltration of activated peripheral inflammatory cells into the CNS, loss of myelin, and axonal damage (2Taneja V.

In addition, activated macrophages are the predominant leukocytes in CNS infiltrates of afflicted animals and patients, similar to the infiltrates that characterize Th1-dependent delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) (7Platt J.L.

Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are localized in the plasma membrane, and VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry into cells is essential for a wide variety of physiological events. Structurally, VGCCs are composed of an oligomeric complex of proteins consisting of five subunits: α1, α2, β, γ, and δ. The α1 subunit is the pore-forming component and functions as the voltage sensor (10Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The subunits are classified by their pharmacological and electrophysiological properties as P-, Q-, N-, L-, R-, and T-type (11Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The α1B (CaV2.2) gene encodes the α1 subunit of the N-type Ca2+ channel, which is specifically expressed in the nervous system and is predominantly coupled to synaptic transmission. In addition, the N-type Ca2+ channel might play critical roles in the process of neurodegeneration, and its inhibition reduces neuronal damage and improves behavioral outcomes accompanied with traumatic brain injury (12Berman R.F. Verweij B.H. Muizelaar J.P. J. Neurosurg. 2000; 93: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Lee L.L. Galo E. Lyeth B.G. Muizelaar J.P. Berman R.F. Exp.

In MS and EAE, the N-type Ca2+ channel is reported to accumulate within the axons of demyelinating lesions (3Kornek B. Storch M.K. Bauer J. Djamshidian A. Weissert R. Wallstroem E. Stefferl A. Zimprich F. Olsson T. Linington C. Schmidbauer M. Lassmann H. Brain. 2001; 124: 1114-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The pathophysiological role of N-type Ca2+ channel in MS/EAE, however, is not known. To understand the pathophysiological function of the N-type Ca2+ channel in EAE, a genetic approach seems quite useful. Mice lacking the α1B subunit, a functional component of the N-type Ca2+ channel, exhibit a normal lifespan without apparent behavioral abnormalities (15Ino M. Yoshinaga T. Wakamori M. Miyamoto N.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6793-6797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, neurodegeneration has not been examined thus far in these mice. In this study we induced EAE in α1B−/− mice and their wild type (WT) littermates with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35–55 (MOG35–55) to elucidate how the N-type Ca2+ channel affects the pathology of EAE. All animal procedures conformed to the Japanese regulations for animal care and use, following the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of the Japanese Association for Laboratory of Animal Science, and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Eisai Co., Ltd. and Chiba University. Mice with a non-functional α1B subunit of the N-type Ca2+ channel were previously generated by gene-targeting methods using a TTS ES cell line derived from an F1 embryo between CBA and C57BL/6 (15Ino M. Yoshinaga T. Wakamori M. Miyamoto N. Takahashi E. Sonoda J. Kagaya T. Oki T. Nagasu T. Nishizawa Y. Tanaka I. Imoto K. Aizawa S. Koch S. Schwartz A. Niidome T. Sawada K. Mori Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5323-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For the present experiments, α1B−/− female mice (backcrossed generation into C57BL/6NCrlCrlj) were kept in specific pathogen-free facilities and maintained at constant temperature (22 °C ± 2 °C) and humidity (55 ± 5%) with a 12:12 h light:dark cycle. The mice had free access to a normal diet (MF, Nippon CLEA, Inc., Tokyo) and water. The α1B−/− and WT littermate female mice (8–12 weeks) were used for most experiments. Genotypes were identified by PCR from DNA of tail biopsies. The primers used to screen the α1B wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous genotypes were NP6 (5′-TGGCACCTTATGCCTTGCACGGTGCCTGCG-3′), NP8 (5′-GGTCGAGATGGCTTGCGGGACCCGTTGGGA-3′), and AGN2 (5′-GCCTGCTTGCCGAATATCATGGTGGAAAAT-3′), corresponding to nucleotides of the cytoplasmic repeat II–III linker of the α1B-subunit and inserted into phosphoglycerol kinase promoter neomycin resistance gene sequences. PCR were carried out with a first extension at 94 °C for 2 min; followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. A synthetic peptide derived from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein sequence 35–55 (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was synthesized by TORAY Research Center, Inc. (Tokyo). For the induction of EAE, mice were immunized subcutaneously in the four flanks with 100 μg of MOG35–55 emulsified 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, MI) supplemented with 500 μg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra on day 0. In addition, 30 ng of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) was injected intravenously on days 0 and 2. Mice were weighed and observed for signs of EAE daily. Scoring was as follows: 0, no disease; 0.5, partial tail paralysis; 1, complete tail paralysis; 1.5, decline in the righting reflex; 2, impairment of the righting reflex; 2.5, hindlimb weakness; 3, one hindlimb paralysis; 3.5, both hindlimb paralysis; 4, one forelimb paralysis; 4.5, both forelimb paralysis; 5, moribund or dead. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with heparin in saline followed by 10% formalin. The spinal cord (SC) was dissected out and fixed in 10% formalin. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with Luxol fast blue for visualization of demyelination and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for visualization of inflammatory infiltrate. The degree of demyelination was determined by scoring as follows: 0, no demyelination; 1, mild demyelination; 2, moderate demyelination; 3, severe demyelination. The leukocytic infiltration was quantified as the percentage of the total SC area using BZ-9000 Analyzer (Keyence, Osaka). DTH responses to MOG35–55 were measured at 13 days post-immunization (dpi). 20 μg of MOG35–55 in PBS was injected subcutaneously into the ear. Before the challenge and 24 h afterward, ear swelling was measured using a dial thickness gauge. 2,4-Dinitrophenyl keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) was used for additional DTH generation. Mice were immunized with 100 μg of DNP-KLH emulsified 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco, Detroit, MI) subcutaneously into the lumber region. Five days after sensitization, the DNP-KLH-sensitized mice were challenged with an injection of DNP-KLH (25 μg) into the footpads. Before the challenge and 24 h afterward, footpad swelling was measured using a dial thickness gauge. Spleen cells were harvested from mice at 15 dpi and cultured in 96-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well in culture medium containing various concentrations of MOG35–55, 2 μg/ml of anti-mouse CD3, or 2 μg/ml of concanavalin A. 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well on the fifth day, and cells were harvested 16 h later. Radioactivity was measured using a BETA PLATE liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The culture medium for spleen cells consisted of RPMI1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, 500 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For cytokine production assays, mice were immunized with MOG35–55 according to the method used for EAE induction without the pertussis toxin injection. Pertussis toxin injection is essential for EAE induction by increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (21Brabb T. Goldrath A.W. von Dassow P. Paez A. Liggitt H.D. Goverman J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar). In our experience, however, spleen cells from mice suffering from EAE occasionally show a reduction in cytokine production in response to stimuli. At 14 dpi, spleen cells were prepared by plating in 96-well round-bottom plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and stimulated with MOG35–55 or 2 μg/ml of anti-mouse CD3 plus anti-mouse CD28. The resulting supernatants were collected after 72 h and stored at −20 °C until tested. An ELISA was performed to detect the concentration of each cytokine according to the manufacturer's instructions (IL-12, Biolegend, San Diego, CA; IFN-γ, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA; and IL-17, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mice immunized with or without MOG35–55 for 10 days were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with heparin in saline. The SC was dissected out and homogenized in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mg/ml of leupeptin). The homogenates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants (400 μg) were subjected to the Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array 3 (RayBiotech Inc., Norcros, GA), which detects 62 cytokines according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mice immunized with or without MOG35–55 for 10 or 14 days were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with heparin in saline, and the SC was dissected out. Total RNA was prepared from the SC using ISOGEN (Wako Chemicals, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single strand cDNA was synthesized from prepared RNA (1 μg), using Moloney MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. The resulting cDNA sample (1 μl) was subjected to PCR amplification of mouse MCP-1, MIP-1γ, MIP-2, or MIP-3β cDNA using specific primers (sense primer, 5′-AGCACCAGCCAACTCTCACTG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-AGAAGTGCTTGAGGTGGTTGTG-3′ for MCP-1; sense primer, 5′-TCATTCTTACAACTGCTCTTG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-TGAGTTTTGCTCCAATCTTTC-3′ for MIP-1γ; sense primer, 5′-CACCAACCACCAGGCTACAG-3′, antisense primer, 5′-TTTGACCGCCCTTGAGAGTG-3′ for MIP-2; sense primer, 5′-GACTGCTGCCTGTCTGTGAC-3′, antisense primer, 5′-TCTTCAGTCTTCGGATGATG-3′ for MIP-3β). As an internal control, GAPDH cDNA was amplified using specific primers (sense primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, antisense primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Using these primers, PCR was performed at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by individual cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, individual temperature for 60 s, 72 °C for 45 s, with an extension step of 7 min at 72 °C at the end of the last cycle. The individual annealing temperatures, cycle numbers, and product sizes were as follows: 62 °C, 34 cycles and 465-bp for MCP-1; 57 °C, 34 cycles and 314-bp for MIP-1γ; 59 °C, 34 cycles and 167-bp for MIP-2; 59 °C, 34 cycles and 181-bp for MIP-3β; and 54 °C, 27 cycles and 452-bp for GAPDH. To evaluate leukocytic infiltration into the SC, each proximal portion of the SC used for total RNA preparation was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at 4 °C. The SC was then cut into 20-μm thick sections and stained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). In case of elucidating the correlation between inflammatory progression and chemokine (MCP-1 and MIP-1γ) expression, mice immunized with MOG35–55 for 10 or 14 days were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused with heparin in saline, and the SC was dissected out and stored at −20 °C. Each proximal portion of the SC was fixed and confirmed whether or not leukocytes infiltrated into the SC by DAPI staining. Then, total RNA was prepared from the SC without and with leukocytic infiltration at 10 and 14 dpi, respectively, and the synthesized cDNA was subjected to real time PCR. All primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Ccl2, MCP-1; Mm00441242_m1, Ccl9, MIP-1γ; Mm00441260_m1 and GAPDH, customized). Signal values of each gene were normalized by the expression of GAPDH. The SC fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was cut into 20-μm thick sections, which were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The sections were subjected to double staining with rabbit anti-MCP-1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in combination with mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) monoclonal antibody (Cy3-conjugated, Sigma), goat anti-Iba1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam), or mouse anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). In determination of the morphology of activated microglia, a rabbit anti-Iba1 polyclonal antibody (Wako Chemicals, Tokyo) was used. In some experiments, the sections were subjected to double staining with a goat anti-MIP-1γ polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and an anti-CD3 antibody (BD Biosciences). Microglia were prepared as a primary mixed culture with astrocytes. The brain cortex was dissected from neonatal WT and α1B−/− mice (1–3 days old) on a child platform under sterile conditions. Tissue was collected in Leibovitz 15 medium. The cortical tissue was minced and trypsinized for 30 min (0.25% trypsin with 10 mm HEPES buffer, 0.6% glucose, antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen), and DNase I) at 37 °C. The cortical tissues were dissociated into single cells by gentle trituration in culture medium (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic-antimycotic) and filtered through a nylon mesh filter. Suspended cells from two mouse brains were added to each culture flask (75 cm2) with 15 ml of culture medium. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). Culture medium was replaced after 2 days and twice per week thereafter. After 14 days in vitro, microglia were harvested from the mixed glial cell culture by shaking the flasks at 150 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C, which is a purification step for microglia. Microglia and the resulting monolayer astrocytes were then replated for an assay in 96-well plates containing Microglia Culture Medium (SUMITOMO BAKELITE, Tokyo) and DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, respectively. Activation of microglia and astrocytes was performed by stimulation with LPS (Sigma) or a cytokine mixture of TNF-α and IFN-γ at equal concentrations (PeproTech, London) for 24 h. Microglia from WT mice were stimulated with various concentrations of LPS or the cytokine mixture to determine the maximal dose of each agent for MCP-1 induction. To elucidate the effects of ω-conotoxin, GVIA (ω-CgTx) on MCP-1 production in activated microglia, the microglia from WT mice were stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml of LPS or the cytokine mixture (1 ng/ml of TNF-α plus 1 ng/ml of IFN-γ) in the presence or absence of 1 μm ω-CgTx. In some experiments, microglia from WT and α1B−/− mice were stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml of LPS or the cytokine mixture (1 ng/ml of TNF-α plus 1 ng/ml of IFN-γ). To elucidate the role of extracellular Ca2+ in MCP-1 production, microglia from WT mice were stimulated with 0.1 ng/ml of LPS in DMEM or Ca2+-free DMEM (Invitrogen). The supernatants were collected 24 h after stimulation and subjected to an ELISA for MCP-1 according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). The number of microglia or astrocytes per well was detected by using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (DOJINDO, Kumamoto). WT and α1B−/− mice were anesthetized with 10% urethane and perfused with heparin in saline to clear the intravascular blood cells. The SC was extracted by flushing the spinal canal with saline and then minced, trypsinized, and dissociated into single cells as described above. The cells were suspended in ice-cold 75% Percoll (GE Healthcare; 9 volumes of Percoll were mixed with 1 volume of 10× PBS to yield a stock isotonic Percoll solution, and Percoll densities were obtained by dilution with PBS). 3.3 ml of cell suspension was gently applied on 5 ml of ice-cold 25% Percoll using a Pasteur pipette. The density gradient was centrifuged at 800 × g (slow acceleration and no brake) for 25 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation the cells at the interface were collected and washed with PBS. The cells were cultured for 1 day in Microglia Culture Medium before the experiments. Cultured microglia and astrocytes on Lab-Tek chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and subjected to double staining with an anti-Cav2.2 antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in combination with goat anti-Iba1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam) or FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b (BD Biosciences) and guinea pig anti-glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) polyclonal antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After incubating with fluorescent dye-conjugated second antibodies, localization of α1B was observed by a fluorescent microscopy and a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axioplan and LSM510, Zeiss, Oberkochen). In detection of α1B mRNA expression, total RNA was prepared from cultured microglia and astrocytes of the two genotypes, and RT-PCR was performed according to a previous report with a slight modification (22Latour I. Hamid J. Beedle A.M. Zamponi G.W. Macvicar B.A. GLIA. 2003; 41: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Using specific primers for mouse α1B (sense primer, GTGGACAACCTTGCCAATG, antisense primer, GCATGGTCACAATGTAATG) and KOD-FX DNA polymerase (TOYOBO, Osaka), PCR was performed at 98 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, with an extension step of 7 min at 68 °C at the end of the last cycle. The PCR product sizes were 1270 and 1273 bp for splicing variants of α1B. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was conducted using the software package SAS 8.1 (SAS Institute Japan Ltd., Tokyo). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Student's t test, and p values of <0.05 were considered to be significant. WT and α1B−/− mice were immunized with MOG35–55 and monitored up to day 58. As shown in Fig. 1A, α1B−/− mice showed less severe neurological symptoms than WT mice at all time points. This significant difference in the course of disease between WT and α1B−/− mice was also observed for male mice (data not shown). Likewise, the body weight loss in WT mice was significantly more severe than in α1B−/− mice (Fig. 1B). Clinical parameters of this and other experiments are summarized in Table 1. The mean maximal score of α1B−/− mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice, although there was no clear difference in the incidence of the disease between the two genotypes. The day of EAE onset in α1B−/− mice tended to be slower than that in WT mice.TABLE 1Clinical parameters of MOG35–55-induced EAE in WT and α1B−/− miceGenotypenIncidenceOnset (day ± S.E.)Maximal clinical score (±S.E.)WT1413/149.9 ± 0.63.38 ± 0.16α1B−/−1412/1413.2 ± 1.92.75 ± 0.14ap < 0.01, significantly different from the WT group by Student's t test.

Open table in a new tab In α1B−/− mice, demyelination and vacuolation of the thoracic cord were less apparent compared with WT mice in the chronic phase (Fig. 2, A–D). Accordingly, the semi-quantitative scoring of histological features revealed that the degree of demyelination in α1B−/− mice was significantly decreased compared with that in WT mice (Fig. 2E). To evaluate the histopathology of SCs in the acute phase, both α1B−/− and WT mice were immunized with MOG35–55 and sacrificed at 15 dpi when the peak of the acute attack was observed. At this point sections of the SC from most of the WT mice revealed widespread perivascular leukocyte infiltrates, accompanied with severe demyelination (Fig. 3, A and B). On the other hand, sections of α1B−/− SCs showed only focal perivascular leukocytic infiltrates and very slight demyelination (Fig. 3, C and D). The ratio of the leukocyte infiltration area to the whole SC area was significantly reduced in α1B−/− mice compared with the WT mice (Fig. 3E).FIGURE 3Histological detection of leukocyte infiltration into the SC in the acute phase of EAE. Thoracic SC of WT (A and B) and α1B−/− mice (C and D) at 15 dpi were stained using Luxol fast blue-HE double staining. The posterior funiculi of the SC were observed under a high power field (B and D). E, the degree of leukocyte infiltration into the SC of WT (black bar) and α1B−/− (KO, white bar) mice is shown. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. of four sections.

In the above acute phase experiment, we evaluated the DTH response before sacrifice. At 13 dpi, MOG35–55 was subcutaneously injected into the ear, and ear swelling was measured. As shown in Fig. 4A, a DTH response was induced in α1B−/− mice, the extent of which was comparable with that in WT mice. The timing of the challenge with MOG35–55 to the ear, namely, either before or after EAE onset, was irrelevant to DTH generation. In either case, the DTH response to MOG35–55 was equivalent between α1B−/− and WT mice (data not shown). Moreover, we evaluated the DTH response of both genotypes to another antigen, DNP-KLH. This antigen caused swelling in α1B−/− mice equivalent to that seen in WT mice after a challenge on the footpad (Fig. 4B). To further define the immunological function of both WT and α1B−/− mice, we examined the proliferation of spleen cells isolated from WT and α1B−/− mice at 15 dpi.

https://openalex.org/W1968096384,"This study aimed to determine the mechanisms responsible for long-term tissue damage following radiation injury. We irradiated p21-knockout (p21(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice and determined the long-term deleterious effects of this intervention on mesenchyme-derived tissues. In addition, we explored the mechanisms of radiation-induced mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) dysfunction in isolated bone marrow-derived cells. p21 expression was chronically elevated >200-fold in irradiated tissues. Loss of p21 function resulted in a >4-fold increase in the number of skin MSCs remaining after radiation. p21(-/-) mice had significantly less radiation damage, including 6-fold less scarring, 40% increased growth potential, and 4-fold more hypertrophic chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate (P<0.01). Irradiated p21(-/-) MSCs had 4-fold increased potential for bone or fat differentiation, 4-fold greater proliferation rate, and nearly 7-fold lower senescence as compared to WT MSCs (P<0.01). Ectopic expression of p21 in knockout cells decreased proliferation and differentiation potential and recapitulated the WT phenotype. Loss of p21 function markedly decreases the deleterious effects of radiation injury in mesenchyme-derived tissues and preserves tissue-derived MSCs. In addition, p21 is a critical regulator of MSC proliferation, differentiation, and senescence both at baseline and in response to radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2068739916,"The future clinical use of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based hepatocyte replacement therapy depends on the development of an efficient procedure for differentiation of hepatocytes from ESCs. Here we report that a high density of human ESC-derived fibroblast-like cells (hESdFs) supported the efficient generation of hepatocyte-like cells with functional and mature hepatic phenotypes from primate ESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Molecular and immunocytochemistry analyses revealed that hESdFs caused a rapid loss of pluripotency and induced a sequential endoderm-to-hepatocyte differentiation in the central area of ESC colonies. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells were directed toward endodermal and hepatic lineages by FGF2 and activin A secreted from hESdFs. Furthermore, we found that the central region of ESC colonies was essential for the hepatic endoderm-specific differentiation, because its removal caused a complete disruption of endodermal differentiation. In conclusion, we describe a novel in vitro differentiation model and show that hESdF-secreted factors act in concert with regional features of ESC colonies to induce robust hepatic endoderm differentiation in primate pluripotent stem cells.

IntroductionPatients with end stage and genetic liver diseases have been shown to benefit from liver cell replacement therapy (1Akhter J. Johnson L.A. Gunasegaram A. Riordan S.M. Morris D.L. Surgeon. 2007; 5: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, one of the major factors currently limiting the utilization of cellular replacement in the general population with severe liver disease is the lack of consistent sources of transplantable hepatocytes. Ideally, a proliferative stem cell population with robust capacity to generate hepatic cells in vitro will overcome the shortage of transplantable hepatic cells.

The ability of these cells to proliferate indefinitely and to develop into virtually any cell or tissue type, including hepatocytes, makes them likely candidates for cell-based treatment of human diseases.Over the past few decades, studies in vertebrate models have described several signaling pathways critical for the embryonic development of hepatocytes (7Zaret K.S.

For example, it has been shown that selective FGFs can substitute for the cardiac mesoderm to activate the expression of hepatic genes in the endoderm (9Jung J. Zheng M. Goldfarb M. Zaret K.S. Science. 1999; 284: 1998-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In addition to the FGF pathway, bone morphogenic factors (BMPs), which are highly expressed in the septum transversum mesenchyme, are capable of inducing early hepatic fate independently in mice (10Rossi J.M. Dunn N.R. Hogan B.L. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1998-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar).

EB formation has been the most popular method exploited to differentiate ESCs into many cell types including hepatocytes; however, the uncontrolled nature of EB differentiation has made this approach less likely to generate scalable specific cell types with satisfactory purity. Monolayer-adherent culture conditions, on the other hand, have been used successfully to direct primate ESC differentiation into various cell types including hepatocytes (26Hay D.C. Fletcher J. Payne C. Terrace J.D. Gallagher R.C. Snoeys J. Black J.R. Wojtacha D. Samuel K. Hannoun Z. Pryde A. Filippi C. Currie I.S. Forbes S.J. Ross J.A. Newsome P.N. Iredale J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this study, the efficient hepatocyte differentiation induced by the hESdF co-culture system required ESC/iPSCs to be cultured as a monolayer adhering to the culture surface. The monolayer-adherent culture helped to maintain the structural integrity of the two-dimensional ESC colonies and therefore possibly provided a foundation for establishing an unknown feature in the central region of ESC/iPSC cell colonies that is susceptible to differentiation signal(s) secreted by hESdFs.We showed that FGF2 and activin A secreted by hESdFs played critical roles in mediating the hepatic endoderm differentiation in primate pluripotent stem cells. This finding is well supported by results of previous reports, indicating that activin A and FGF2 have positive effects in promoting ESCs to differentiate into endoderms (28Basma H. Soto-Gutiérrez A.

Protoc. 2007; 2: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), it is not possible to manipulate the expression level of the factors secreted by hESdFs along the course of differentiation.However, we still observed efficient hepatocyte differentiation with the presence of mature hepatocytes. Therefore, the persistent presence of factors such as activin A and FGF2, which are important for early stages of differentiation, may not affect the subsequent differentiation and maturation of hepatocytes. Additionally, other growth factors secreted by hESdFs (Fig. 5B), such as BMP4, EGF, and VEGF, which have been shown to be required for hepatic specification of mouse ESC-derived endoderm (21Gouon-Evans V. Boussemart L. Gadue P. Nierhoff D. Koehler C.I. Kubo A. Shafritz D.A. Keller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 45Runge D.M. Runge D. Dorko K.

Boussemart L. Gadue P. Nierhoff D. Koehler C.I. Kubo A. Shafritz D.A. Keller G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Finally, the nonparenchymal cells generated along the hepatic lineages differentiation may also contribute to the differentiation and maturation process by secreting growth factors, because HGF expression was normally detected in hepatic foci after 3 weeks of differentiation (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a combination of hESdF and differentiated ESC secreted factors might be responsible for the hepatocyte differentiation and maturation in our system.In the hESdF co-culture system, the central regions of ESC colonies always transformed into endoderm-like foci, a step that preceded hepatocyte differentiation. Removal of central foci disrupted the progress of hepatic endoderm differentiation and resulted in the acquisition of ectodermal fate by the regenerated cells. We can only speculate about why the central region of the ESC colonies appears so important for hepatic differentiation. It seems unlikely that the hESdF feeders created a growth factor/cytokine signal gradient along the central to peripheral axis of the ESC colonies, because the differentiation foci could still be readily induced in hESdF-conditioned medium alone.Alternatively, there might be heterogeneous populations of pluripotent cells in ESC colonies that are assembled in specific topological compartments in the two-dimensional ESC/iPSC colonies; perhaps only those allocated to the central region of ESC/iPSC colonies could properly respond to hESdF-secreted factors to form hepatic foci. This hypothesis is consistent with a recent observation showing that subpopulations of ESCs with distinct tissue-specific fates can be selected from pluripotent cultures (46King F.W. Ritner C. Liszewski W. Kwan H.C. Pedersen A. Leavitt A.D. Bernstein H.S. Stem Cells Dev. 2009; 18: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and was supported by our microarray analysis comparing the gene expression patterns of the central and rim regions of the ESC colonies (Fig. 3). Future identification of the molecular mechanism by which the distinct hepatocyte-promoting capability of the central region of ESC colonies is established may lead to more efficient control of hepatic differentiation.Consistent with a previous study (40Si-Tayeb K. Noto F.K. Nagaoka M. Li J. Battle M.A. Duris C. North P.E. Dalton S. Duncan S.A. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), we found that different iPSC lines have different capabilities to generate hepatic lineages in response to differentiation stimuli (e.g. hESdF treatment), even though that they are all regarded as fully reprogrammed iPSC lines according to currently used standards (supplemental Fig. S7) for iPSC characterization. These discrepancies may be attributed to currently unknown factors that modulate hepatocyte differentiation, which were somehow defective in some of the iPSC lines. It will be of interest to further explore the mechanisms that constitute the discrepancies among different iPSC clones.In summary, we have developed a simple method that allows scalable hepatocyte generation from primate pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence indicating that hESdF-secreted factors are responsible for the topology-dependent differentiation of endodermal cells to hepatocytes in ESC/iPSC colonies. These findings provide opportunities to further explore the mechanisms underpinning hepatic lineage differentiation and may be useful for future pharmacotoxicology and transplantation applications. IntroductionPatients with end stage and genetic liver diseases have been shown to benefit from liver cell replacement therapy (1Akhter J. Johnson L.A. Gunasegaram A. Riordan S.M. Morris D.L. Surgeon. 2007; 5: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, one of the major factors currently limiting the utilization of cellular replacement in the general population with severe liver disease is the lack of consistent sources of transplantable hepatocytes. Ideally, a proliferative stem cell population with robust capacity to generate hepatic cells in vitro will overcome the shortage of transplantable hepatic cells.

The ability of these cells to proliferate indefinitely and to develop into virtually any cell or tissue type, including hepatocytes, makes them likely candidates for cell-based treatment of human diseases.Over the past few decades, studies in vertebrate models have described several signaling pathways critical for the embryonic development of hepatocytes (7Zaret K.S.

For example, it has been shown that selective FGFs can substitute for the cardiac mesoderm to activate the expression of hepatic genes in the endoderm (9Jung J. Zheng M. Goldfarb M. Zaret K.S. Science. 1999; 284: 1998-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1548623780,"RB plays an essential role in DNA damage-induced growth arrest and regulates the expression of several factors essential for DNA repair machinery. However, how RB coordinates DNA damage response through transcriptional regulation of genes involved in growth arrest remains largely unexplored. We examined whether RB can mediate the response to DNA damage through modulation of ZBRK1, a zinc finger-containing transcriptional repressor that can modulate the expression of GADD45A, a DNA damage response gene, to induce cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. We found that the ZBRK1 promoter contains an authentic E2F-recognition sequence that specifically binds E2F1, but not E2F4 or E2F6, together with chromatin remodeling proteins CtIP and CtBP to form a repression complex that suppresses ZBRK1 transcription. Furthermore, loss of RB-mediated transcriptional repression led to an increase in ZBRK1 transcript levels, correlating with increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) and methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage. Taken together, these results suggest that the RB·CtIP (CtBP interacting protein)/CtBP (C terminus-binding protein) /E2F1 complex plays a critical role in ZBRK1 transcriptional repression, and loss of this repression may contribute to cellular sensitivity of DNA damage, ultimately leading to carcinogenesis.

The DNA damage response that responds to genotoxic stress induced by radiation, chemicals, and endogenous reactive oxygen species is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes (1Feuerhahn S. Egly J.M. Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 467-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). The cellular responses to DNA damage include activation of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair (3Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). In mammals, multiple partially overlapping DNA repair mechanisms, including base excision, recombination, and mismatch repair, are required for proper DNA damage repair. Defects in these repair pathways frequently lead to irreparable DNA damage, aging, and cancer. RB, a prototypic tumor suppressor (4Huang H.J. Yee J.K. Shew J.Y. Chen P.L. Bookstein R. Friedmann T. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Science. 1988; 242: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), is essential for regulating cell cycle progression through interaction with binding partners such as E2F (5Chellappan S.P. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). In quiescent and early G1 cells, RB associates with the E2F family of transcription factors to repress the expression of E2F-responsive genes involved in cell cycle progression (6Hurford Jr., R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N. Genes & Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). As cells progress toward S-phase, RB is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases, releasing E2F, which opens the DNA replication origin, and induces transcription of S-phase genes (7Chen P.L. Scully P. Shew J.Y. Wang J.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 1193-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). When RB is lost or inactivated, DNA replication origins become readily accessible, resulting in uncontrolled transcription of S-phase genes and ultimately leading to premature S-phase progression (8Morgenbesser S.D. Williams B.O. Jacks T. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1994; 371: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). RB also plays an essential role in DNA damage-induced growth arrest (9Harrington E.A. Bruce J.L. Harlow E. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11945-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and transcriptional regulation of several DNA damage-repair factors involved in the ultraviolet (UV) damage repair process, including FEN1, XPC, RPA2–3, RFC4, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (10Bosco E.E. Mayhew C.N. Hennigan R.F. Sage J. Jacks T. Knudsen E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have established that phosphorylation of RB inactivates its binding activity with its interacting partners and promotes cell cycle progression (11Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar); a recent study, however, indicated that the phosphorylation of RB at Ser-612 represents an activating event in response to DNA damage, suggesting a novel role of RB in DNA damage response (12Inoue Y. Kitagawa M. Taya Y. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2083-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Of all the E2F family members, E2F1 appears to be unique in its ability to induce both proliferation and apoptosis (13DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In addition, it displays properties of both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor (14Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D.

Recent studies have revealed at least two mechanisms of E2F/RB-mediated gene repression: the recruitment of a histone deacetylase (19Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although the expressions of many cell cycle genes are subject to RB/E2F repression (23Frolov M.V. Dyson N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2173-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether any of these genes participate in RB-mediated DNA damage response. ZBRK1 was identified as a transcriptional repressor that recognizes a consensus DNA element, GGGXXXCAGXXXTTT (24Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ZBRK1 exhibits two different modes of repression: its C-terminal domain binds the BRCA1·CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein) co-repressor complex (25Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal KRAB domain binds to the KAP1 co-repressor (26Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J.

ZBRK1 thus represents the first KRAP zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) harboring two independent repression domains. ZBRK1 association with BRCA1 and CtIP repress transcription of Angiopoietin 1 (27Furuta S. Wang J.M. Wei S. Jeng Y.M. Jiang X. Gu B. Chen P.L. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H.

The same repressor complex can also regulate the DNA damage response gene GADD45A for the maintenance of genomic integrity (29Wang X.W. Zhan Q. Coursen J.D. Khan M.A. Kontny H.U. Yu L. Hollander M.C.

Res. 2005; 569: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). ZBRK1 is rapidly degraded upon DNA damage through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (32Yun J. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7305-7314Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that the genes repressed by ZBRK1 may be activated during DNA damage. This further substantiates the role of ZBRK1 in DNA damage response. In this communication, we show that the ZBRK1 promoter contains an authentic E2F1 binding site that serves as the platform for the RB·E2F1·CtIP (CtBP interacting protein)·CtBP (C terminus-binding protein) complex-mediated transcriptional repression of ZBRK1. This regulation is intimately correlated with cellular sensitivity toward UV- and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) 3The abbreviations used are: MMSmethyl methanesulfonateDAPADNA affinity precipitation assayCtIPCtBP interacting proteinCtBPC terminus-binding protein. -induced DNA damage.

The detection of endogenous ZBRK1 was performed as described in Zheng et al. (25Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Antibody against β-actin was purchased from Sigma. MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 (MB-468) breast cancer cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. MCF10A cells were cultured as described in Debnath et al. (34Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). DNA-damage induction was performed using the UV-Crosslinker (Spectroline) at 40 J/m2 or 0.05% MMS (Sigma). To measure the half-life of exogenous GFP-ZBRK1 and endogenous ZBRK1 protein, cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) alone or combined with either UV or MMS. Protein lysates were harvested at various time points for Western blot analysis. The ZBRK1 promoter fragments −1113 to +47 bp (ZBRK1-A) and −624 to +47 bp (ZBRK1-B) were obtained by PCR. The primers used were as follows: ZBRK1/KpnI-1113, 5′-GGGGTACCCAATTCTGGCTCTGCTCTTCC-3′; ZBRK1/KpnI-624, 5′-GGGGTACCGACAGAGCAAGACTCCGTCTC-3′; ZBRK1/HindIII+47, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCCAGATACACAAGAAGGGCCTC-3′. The PCR fragments were cloned into the yTA vector and verified by sequencing. The KpnI/HindIII fragment was subcloned into the promoter-less pGL2-basic vector. Mutant reporter plasmids were derived from −1113/+47 WT and −624/+47 WT using site-directed mutagenesis in accordance to the instructions in QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Promoter DNA constructs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the reporter assay, lysates were harvested 16 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was analyzed using the luciferase assay system. Luciferase activity was normalized to the level of relative luciferase activity per microgram of extracted protein. siRNA duplexes purchased from Invitrogen were: siE2F1, 5′-UGGACCACCUGAUGAAUAUTT-3′, siRB-1, 5′-ACAGAAGAACCUGAUUUUATT-3′, and siRB-2, 5′-GAUACCAGAUCAUGUCAGATT-3′. Reverse transcription-PCR total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol RNA extraction reagent. Three micrograms of extracted RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with SuperScript III for cDNA synthesis. PCR was performed using primer pairs indicated as follows: human ZBRK1, 5′-GACATATGGAAAGTTGATCATGTGCTG-3′ and 5′-ATTCACTGCACACATGATGCTTCTCTA-3′; E2F1, 5′-CATCCAGCTCATTGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCACCTACGGTCTCC-3′; GADD45A, 5′-CGCTACATGGATCAATGGGT-3′ and 5′-TTTTCCTTCCTGCATGGTTC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phos-phate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′; and β-actin, 5′-CCCAAGGCCAACCGCGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-TCTTCATTGTGCTGGGTGCCA-3′. The primers used to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous ZBRK1 are as follows: GFP, 5′-CGAGAAGCGCGATCACATGG-3′; ZBRK1, 5′-CTTCTTGTGTATCTGGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CTCCAGTGTTATGGATTCCT 3′. PCR were run for 35 cycles for E2F1, ZBRK1, and GADD45A, and 25 cycles for GAPDH and β-actin. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Nuclear extracts were prepared from MCF7 cells for DAPA. DAPA was performed with a slight modification from the procedures detailed in Zhu et al. (35Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W.G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μg of nuclear extract and 2 μg of biotinylated E2F motif of the ZBRK1 promoter were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, before pulldown by streptavidin-agarose beads. The precipitated products were washed three times with cold PBS and eluted for separation by SDS-PAGE. The sequence of the biotinylated E2F motif of ZBRK1 promoter was 5′-GGCCCTCTTTTGGCCCCTCATATG-3′. ChIP assay was performed essentially as described by Wang et al. (36Wang J.M. Tseng J.T. Chang W.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3365-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sheared chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific to E2F1, RB, CtIP, CtBP, or control mouse IgG at 4 °C overnight. The DNA was dissociated from the immunoprecipitated chromatin prior to PCR amplification. For the re-ChIP assay, the first immune complex was washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm EDTA), twice with low-salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA), resolved in 10 mm DTT at 37 °C, diluted in ChIP dilution buffer, and processed according to the same ChIP assay protocol using the indicated antibodies. The primers used for PCR amplification were as follows: ZBRK1p/−419, 5′-CATTCTCTGGGATACCTACACCTG-3′; ZBRK1p/−107, 5′-CTGTAAAATGGCCGCGCCCATAGC-3′; and GL2 primer, 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′. The amplified DNA products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by sequencing. Cells were embedded in agarose gel and spread on a frosted microscope slide before lysing in lysis buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C. After lysis, cells were preincubated for 20 min at 4 °C in electrophoresis buffer (0.3 m NaOH and 1 mm EDTA, pH > 13) before alkaline gel electrophoresis at 24 V/300 mA for 15 min. Following electrophoresis, the slides were rinsed with neutralization buffer and allowed to dry before staining with ethidium bromide for visualization under fluorescence microscopy. The tail moment was quantified by a computerized image analysis program. The tail moment was calculated by multiplying the total intensity of the Comet tail by the migration distance from the center of the Comet head. For the TUNEL assay, the Apoptosis Detection System Fluorescein (Promega) was used. Cells grown on coverslips were treated with UV or MMS and allowed to recover for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min before storage at −20 °C in 70% ethanol for at least 30 min. The coverslips were then washed in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and rinsed twice with PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The percentage of red fluorescing cells (TUNEL positive) was determined using images captured by fluorescence microscope. The lentiviral expression vectors pLKO.1-shLuc, containing 5′-CTTCGAAATGTCCGTTCGGTT-3′, and pLKO.1-shZBRK1, containing 5′-CGTAACCATGAACGACTTCAT-3′, were obtained from the National RNAi Core Facility located at the Genomic Research Center of Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica. Virus was harvested after co-transfecting pLKO.1-shLuc or pLKO.1-shZBRK1 vector with pMD2.G and psPAX2 into Phoenix cells using Lipofectamine 2000. RB plays a critical role in the response to DNA damage. However, the precise mechanism by which RB mediates the DNA damage response remains unclear. Because ZBRK1 serves as a repressor regulating DNA damage response genes (25Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RB may act as an up-stream regulator of ZBRK1 for this purpose. To address this possibility, we examined the correlation between the expression of RB protein and ZBRK1 transcript in RB-depleted cells. As shown in Fig. 1, when RB was depleted by siRNA, the ZBRK1 transcript level was increased, suggesting that RB acts as a negative regulator of ZBRK1 transcription. Because RB is known to serve as co-repressor with E2F1 for the regulation of several genes, the ZBRK1 promoter sequence was analyzed using the TFSEARCH website, revealing a putative E2F binding motif (supplemental Fig. S1). To validate whether this putative E2F motif is biologically functional, we examined the promoter activity of ZBRK1 in cells transfected with reporter constructs containing the 5′-flanking regions of the human ZBRK1 gene, −1113/+47 (ZA), −624/+47 (ZB), or their corresponding E2F motif mutants (ZAmE and ZBmE) (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, ZAmE and ZBmE induced a 6- and 14-fold induction, respectively, in luciferase activity when compared with wild-type constructs ZA and ZB. It was noted that a higher luciferase activity was observed in the ZBmE mutant construct with a shorter promoter region when compared with the longer ZAmE mutant promoter (Fig. 2B), implicating the presence of a potential negative regulatory element within the −1113 to −624-bp region flanking the ZBRK1 promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that the E2F recognition site identified on the ZBRK1 promoter is biologically active.FIGURE 2The E2F motif in the ZBRK1 promoter is a negative response element.

Wild-type and mutant E2F motifs are represented by open and closed ellipses, respectively. B, the E2F motif in the ZBRK1 promoter plays an important negative role. The relative activities of various ZBRK1 reporter constructs were analyzed in MCF10A cells (left panel). Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments, and the data shown are from one representative assay. Fold-induction in luciferase activity in reporters with the mutant E2F1 motif are shown after normalization to the wild-type ZBRK1 reporter (right panel, mean ± S.D., n = 3). **, p < 0.01 versus ZA; ###, p < 0.001 versus ZB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RB interacts with several E2F family members (37Attwooll C. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To test which E2F family member is involved in this E2F motif-mediated repression of the ZBRK1 gene, we transfected cells with various E2F expression vectors, including E2F1, E2F4, and E2F6, and examined the expression of ZBRK1 by RT-PCR and Western blot. E2F1, but not E2F4 or E2F6, showed specific inhibition of ZBRK1 expression at the RNA and protein levels (Fig. 3A) although the expressions of E2F1, E2F4, and E2F6 were comparable (supplemental Fig. S2). To further test whether this repression is promoter-mediated, a reporter construct containing the ZBRK1 promoter was co-transfected into cells with E2F1, E2F4, or E2F6 expression vectors. We found that only E2F1 specifically repressed the ZBRK1 promoter activity (Fig. 3B). To confirm the authenticity of E2F1-mediated ZBRK1 repression, we examined ZBRK1 promoter activity in comparison to MCL-1, CCND1, and AURKA promoters. MCL-1 was previously reported to be negatively regulated by E2F1 (38Croxton R. Ma Y. Song L. Haura E.B. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas CCND1 and AURKA were reported to be positively regulated by E2F1 (39Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 12146-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 40Tanaka M. Ueda A. Kanamori H. Ideguchi H. Yang J. Kitajima S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10719-10726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, we also found MCL-1 to be repressed, whereas CCDN1 and AURKA were activated upon E2F1 expression. Using these controls, ZBRK1 promoter activity was demonstrated to be repressed upon E2F1 expression (Fig. 3C). Consistently, depletion of E2F1 by siRNA resulted in an increase in ZBRK1 expression at both the RNA and protein levels (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results support the notion that E2F1 specifically represses ZBRK1 transcription. RB plays an important role in E2F1-mediated transcriptional repression of several genes, such as cdc25A (41Wu L. Goodwin E.C. Naeger L.K. Vigo E. Galaktionov K. Helin K. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7059-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and cyclin E (42Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RB coordinates with E2F1 in repressing ZBRK1 transcription, we performed a ZBRK1 reporter assay in cells with RB depleted by siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, depletion of RB enhanced ZBRK1 promoter activity (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1). This was also the case in cells transfected with E2F1 (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4), suggesting that depletion of RB reverses the E2F1-mediated repression of ZBRK1. On the contrary, promoter activity of the ZBmE reporter containing the mutant E2F motif was unaffected by either RB depletion or E2F1 overexpression (Fig. 4A, compare lane 7 with 12). To confirm this finding, we transfected the ZB and ZBmE reporters into RB-negative Saos-2 and RB-reconstituted SR5 cells (43Liu F. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3124-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and found that the presence of RB in SR5 cells negatively affected ZB reporter activity, but not the activity of ZBmE (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that RB coordinates with E2F1 to regulate the ZBRK1 promoter through the E2F motif. Because RB is known to bind to the CtIP·CtBP co-repressor complex to repress transcription (21Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is likely that this repressor complex may participate in RB·E2F1-mediated ZBRK1 gene repression. To investigate this possibility, we used two CtIP mutants: one with CtBP interaction disrupted by the deletion of PLDLS sequence (44Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and one with RB interaction disrupted by an N-terminal mutation from LXCXE to LXCXK (Fig. 5A) (21Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 9574-9579Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of wild-type (WT) CtIP, but not the mutants, repressed ZBRK1 reporter activity (Fig. 5B). To test whether E2F1, RB, CtIP, and CtBP bind to the E2F motif of the ZBRK1 promoter, we performed a DNA precipitation assay using a biotinylated E2F DNA motif and found that E2F1, RB, CtIP, and CtBP all bind to the E2F motif (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we performed a ChIP assay to test in vivo binding of the E2F1·RB·CtIP·CtBP complex to the ZBRK1 promoter and found that increased binding can be detected upon E2F1 increase (Fig. 5D). To further validate that RB, CtIP, CtBP, and E2F1 exist as one multiprotein repressor complex on the ZBRK1 promoter, a Re-ChIP assay was performed. Immunoprecipitation was first performed with E2F1 antibodies followed by a second immunoprecipitation with RB, CtIP, or CtBP antibodies. The result showed that RB, CtIP, CtBP, and E2F1 formed a complex on the ZBRK1 promoter and binding was enhanced in cells with E2F1 overexpression, suggesting that E2F1 may participate in the recruitment of the RB·CtIP·CtBP complex to the ZBRK1 promoter (Fig. 5E). To demonstrate the importance of the E2F motif as the platform for the recruitment of RB·CtIP·CtBP complex, we performed a ChIP assay to examine the presence of the complex on exogenously expressed wild-type and ZBmE promoters. Only the promoter containing the wild-type E2F1 site bound the RB·CtIP·CtBP complex (Fig. 5F). Similar results were obtained in U2OS cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, the E2F motif of the ZBRK1 promoter is a platform for the E2F1·RB·CtIP·CtBP complex-mediated transcriptional repression of ZBRK1. Because both RB and ZBRK1 participate in DNA damage response, we next examined the relationship between ZBRK1 and RB expression profiles upon treatment with DNA damage inducers. We compared the mRNA and protein levels of ZBRK1 and its downstream target GADD45A in RB-proficient MCF7 and RB-deficient MDA-MB-468 (MB-468) cells. ZBRK1 expression was found to be higher in MB-468 cells than MCF7 cells, and GADD45A expression was inversely correlated with ZBRK1 expression patterns. When MCF7 and MB-468 cells were treated with DNA damage inducers (UV and MMS), expression of γ-H2AX and GADD45A correlated with a reduction in ZBRK1 expression (Fig. 6, A and B). These results support the notion that upon UV and MMS treatment, RB forms a complex with E2F1 to repress ZBRK1 expression, in turn to derepress the expression of GADD45A. In the absence of RB, the repression of ZBRK1 was lost and the expression of GADD45A was compromised upon DNA damage, likely leading to improper resolution of DNA damage. To confirm that DNA damage inducers lead to E2F1"

According to previous studies, the age-related differences primarily pertain to the use of strategic corrections and the generation of explicit knowledge on which strategic corrections are based, whereas the acquisition of an (implicit) internal model of the novel visuo-motor transformation is unaffected. The present study aimed to assess the impact of augmented information on the age-related variation of visuo-motor adjustments.Participants performed aiming movements controlling a cursor on a computer screen. Visual feedback of direction of cursor motion was rotated 75 degrees relative to the direction of hand motion. Participants had to adjust to this rotation in the presence and absence of an additional hand-movement target that explicitly depicted the input-output relations of the visuo-motor transformation. An extensive set of tests was employed in order to disentangle the contributions of different processes to visuo-motor adjustment. Results show that the augmented information failed to affect the age-related variations of explicit knowledge, adaptive shifts, and aftereffects in a substantial way, whereas it clearly affected initial direction errors during practice and proprioceptive realignment.Contrary to expectations, older participants apparently made no use of the augmented information, whereas younger participants used the additional movement target to reduce initial direction errors early during practice. However, after a first block of trials errors increased, indicating a neglect of the augmented information, and only slowly declined thereafter. A hypothetical dual-task account of these findings is discussed. The use of the augmented information also led to a selective impairment of proprioceptive realignment in the younger group. The mere finding of proprioceptive realignment in adaptation to a visuo-motor rotation in a computer-controlled setup is noteworthy since visual and proprioceptive information pertain to different objects."
https://openalex.org/W2062716788,"A lysine residue in the putative proton uptake pathway of the ATP synthase a-subunit is found only in alkaliphilic Bacillus species and is proposed to play roles in proton capture, retention and passage to the synthase rotor. Here, Lys-180 was replaced with alanine (Ala), glycine (Gly), cysteine (Cys), arginine (Arg), or histidine (His) in the chromosome of alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4. All mutants exhibited octylglucoside-stimulated ATPase activity and β-subunit levels at least as high as wild-type. Purified mutant F(1)F(0)-ATP synthases all contained substantial a-subunit levels. The mutants exhibited diverse patterns of native (no octylglucoside) ATPase activity and a range of defects in malate growth and in vitro ATP synthesis at pH 10.5. ATP synthesis by the Ala, Gly, and His mutants was also impaired at pH 7.5 in the presence of a protonophoric uncoupler. Thus Lys-180 plays a role when the protonmotive force is reduced at near neutral, not just at high pH. The Arg mutant exhibited no ATP synthesis activity in the alkaliphile setting although activity was reported for a K180R mutant of a thermoalkaliphile synthase (McMillan, D. G., Keis, S., Dimroth, P., and Cook, G. M. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 17395-17404). The hypothesis that a-subunits from extreme alkaliphiles and the thermoalkaliphile represent distinct variants was supported by demonstration of the importance of additional alkaliphile-specific a-subunit residues, not found in the thermoalkaliphile, for malate growth of B. pseudofirmus OF4. Finally, a mutant B. pseudofirmus OF4 synthase with switched positions of Lys-180 (helix 4) and Gly-212 (helix 5) retained significant coupled synthase activity accompanied by proton leakiness."
https://openalex.org/W2040519510,"The voltage-gated sodium channel (Na(v)) 1.8 contributes substantially to the rising phase of action potential in small dorsal root ganglion neurons. Na(v)1.8 is majorly localized intracellularly and its expression on the plasma membrane is regulated by exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Previous work has identified an ER-retention/retrieval motif in the first intracellular loop of Na(v)1.8, which prevents its surface expression. Here we report that the transmembrane segments of Na(v)1.8 also cause this channel retained in the ER. Using transferrin receptor and CD8α as model molecules, immunocytochemistry showed that the first, second, and third transmembrane segments in each domain of Na(v)1.8 reduced their surface expression. Alanine-scanning analysis revealed acidic amino acids as critical factors in the odd transmembrane segments. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that calnexin interacted with acidic amino acid-containing sequences through its transmembrane segment. Overexpression of calnexin resulted in increased degradation of those proteins through the ER-associated degradation pathway, whereas down-regulation of calnexin reversed the phenotype. Thus our results reveal a critical role and mechanism of transmembrane segments in surface expression and degradation of Na(v)1.8."
https://openalex.org/W2054165573,"Chk2 is a critical regulator of the cellular DNA damage repair response. Activation of Chk2 in response to IR-induced damage is initiated by phosphorylation of the Chk2 SQ/TQ cluster domain at Ser19, Ser33, Ser35, and Thr68. This precedes autophosphorylation of Thr383/Thr387 in the T-loop region of the kinase domain an event that is a prerequisite for efficient kinase activity. We conducted an in-depth analysis of phosphorylation within the T-loop region (residues 366–406). We report four novel phosphorylation sites at Ser372, Thr378, Thr389, and Tyr390. Substitution mutation Y390F was defective for kinase function. The substitution mutation T378A ablated the IR induction of kinase activity. Interestingly, the substitution mutation T389A demonstrated a 6-fold increase in kinase activity when compared with wild-type Chk2. In addition, phosphorylation at Thr389 was a prerequisite to phosphorylation at Thr387 but not at Thr383. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis revealed IR-induced phosphorylation and subcellular distribution of Chk2 phosphorylated species. We observed IR-induced increase in phosphorylation at Ser379, Thr389, and Thr383/Thr389. Phosphorylation at Tyr390 was dramatically reduced following IR. Exposure to IR was also associated with changes in the ratio of chromatin/nuclear localization. IR-induced increase in chromatin localization was associated with phosphorylation at Thr372, Thr379, Thr383, Thr389, Thr383/Thr387, and Thr383/Thr389. Chk2 hyper-phosphorylated species at Thr383/Thr387/Thr389 and Thr383/Thr387/Thr389/Tyr390 relocalized from almost exclusively chromatin to predominately nuclear expression, suggesting a role for phosphorylation in regulation of chromatin targeting and egress. The differential impact of T-loop phosphorylation on Chk2 ubiquitylation suggests a co-dependence of these modifications. The results demonstrate that a complex interdependent network of phosphorylation events within the T-loop exchange region regulates dimerization/autophosphorylation, kinase activation, and chromatin targeting/egress of Chk2. Chk2 is a critical regulator of the cellular DNA damage repair response. Activation of Chk2 in response to IR-induced damage is initiated by phosphorylation of the Chk2 SQ/TQ cluster domain at Ser19, Ser33, Ser35, and Thr68.

The results demonstrate that a complex interdependent network of phosphorylation events within the T-loop exchange region regulates dimerization/autophosphorylation, kinase activation, and chromatin targeting/egress of Chk2. The activation of checkpoint mechanisms is critical to maintenance of genomic integrity(1Lukas J. Lukas C. Bartek J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage activation of the damage checkpoints prevents cellular division so as to protect against permanent genetic change. The checkpoint effector kinase Chk2 performs an essential role in mediating upstream damage sensing signals to downstream regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis (2Antoni L. Sodha N. Collins I. Garrett M.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 3Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y. Poon R.Y. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 5016-5029PubMed Google Scholar). The coordinated transfer of signal from damage sensing to cell response is dependant upon the temporal activation/deactivation of Chk2 kinase and is at least partially mediated through phosphorylation status. Damage sensing, initial end processing, and repair involve the recruitment of cellular factors that in turn serve as signals to activate the checkpoint response. In the case of double strand breaks, the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex processes double strand breaks to single strand DNA, which in turn recruits additional repair complexes. The presence of MRE11-RAD50-NBS1, single strand DNA, and a variety of other factors serves to initiate ATM/ATR/DNA-PK activation (5McGowan C.H. Russell P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Activated ATM/DNA-PK directly phosphorylates the N-terminal SQ/TQ domain of Chk2. The specific SQ/TQ residues involved are Ser19, Thr26, Ser28, Ser33/Ser35, Ser50, and Thr68 (6Buscemi G. Carlessi L. Zannini L. Lisanti S. Fontanella E. Canevari S. Delia D. Mol. Cell.

Phosphorylation of the SQ/TQ regulatory domain serves to propagate the damage-induced signal and initiates the autophosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387 within the T-loop region of the kinase domain. Autophosphorylation is essential for attaining conformation conducive to kinase activity (9Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Schwarz J.K. Lovly C.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 598-609PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Thr383/Thr387 is conducted in trans thus requiring a second Chk2 protein. The dimerization and oligomerization steps are also facilitated by the FHA protein-protein interaction domain (8Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Schwarz J.K. Lovly C.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 598-609PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation subsequent to Chk2 kinase activation can also occur at Ser516 through a cis-acting mechanism. However, although Ser516 phosphorylation impacts downstream signaling, it is not a prerequisite to kinase activation (11Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36163-36168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of phosphorylation within the T-loop region of the Chk2 kinase domain, we targeted this region in a direct analysis of the global phosphorylation status. We utilized site-directed multiple reaction monitoring to identify and quantify the changes in phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation. We identified three novel phosphorylation sites, including one tyrosine phosphorylation event at Tyr390, that are required for kinase function. Phosphorylation of one of these residues, Thr389, was a prerequisite for phosphorylation at Thr387. In response to ionizing radiation (IR), phosphorylation at individual sites within this region were associated with changes in chromatin versus soluble nuclear localization. Conversely, phosphorylation at multiple sites was associated with an increase in nuclear versus chromatin protein. We confirmed the dependence of ubiquitylation on phosphorylation at Ser379 and extended this finding for Thr383 as well. Interestingly, the kinase-inactive Y390F mutant retained ubiquitylation. Together, these results provide for a more complex model of Chk2 activation involving interdependent phosphorylation within the T-loop region that regulates kinase activity, early DNA damage-induced chromatin targeting, and subsequent chromatin egress. The S-Chk2 expression vector has been described (12Gupta S.K. Guo X. Durkin S.S. Fryrear K.F. Ward M.D. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29431-29440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HEK293T17 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed by standard calcium phosphate transfection method. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cytosolic (S2), soluble nuclear (S3), and chromatin-bound (P3) proteins were collected according to methods we have described previously (12Gupta S.K.

S-Chk2 proteins were affinity-precipitated from 500–1000 μg of total protein sample either from whole protein lysates or from the three fractions (S2, S3, and P3) described above by incubation with 50–100 μl of S-proteinTM agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI). The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of bind/wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The protein was eluted from the beads by re-suspension in an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol followed by boiling for 10 min. Eluates were electrophoresed in a NuPAGE® Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris 2The abbreviations used are: Bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMRMmultiple reaction monitoring.

Bands of interest were manually excised from the gel for further analysis. 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol multiple reaction monitoring. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays were developed using the MIDASTM workflow system and optimized for tryptic peptides derived from the activation loop of Chk2. In addition, MRM transition pairs capable of discriminating between individual phosphorylation sites in multiply phosphorylated peptides were empirically obtained from MS/MS scans derived from prior analysis of Chk2 using an LTQ mass spectrometer (12Gupta S.K.

The samples were analyzed by nano-LC-MRM/MS using a hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer 4000 (QTRAP® LC/MS/MS system, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) coupled to a Tempo NanoLC system (Eksigent Technologies, Dublin, CA). The chromatography conditions were: Solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid) and Solvent B (95% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid). Tryptic digests (8-ml injections) were eluted at 500 nl/min with PicoFrit columns (75-mm inner diameter, 2-mm tip opening, New Objective, Woburn, MA) slurry-packed in house with 10 cm of reversed-phase, 5-mm 100 Angstrom Magic C18 resin (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) and with a gradient of 5–10% Solvent B in 3 min, 10–60% solvent B in 48 min, and 60–95% solvent B for 5 min before re-equilibration with 95% A for 7 min. Data acquisition was performed with an ion spray voltage of 2800 V, curtain gas of 20 p.s.i., nebulizer gas of 10 p.s.i., and an interface heater temperature of 125 °C. Collision energy, declustering potential, and collision cell exit potential were optimized for maximum transmission and sensitivity of each MRM transition. A dwell time of 10 ms was used for MRM analysis of the digests, and in all the experiments. Four MRM transitions per peptide were monitored and acquired at unit resolution both in the first and third quadrupole (Q1 and Q3) to maximize specificity. All LC-MRM/MS experiments were performed in triplicate. Two Chk-2 internal tryptic peptides of sequence 198VFVFFDLTVDDQSVYPK (IS1) 263EADPALNVETEIEILK (IS2) and that were empirically determined to have stable and reproducible ionization characteristics were used for normalization of all MRM pairs within a run. The internal peptide standards were evaluated over multiple runs to ensure that their relative area ratios (∼3.5:1) were consistent. Further analysis was only done in experiments with deviations of <12%. Phosphopeptide quantitation analysis was performed automatically using MultiQuantTM software (Applied Biosystems). Internal standard peak areas were calculated, and the values were summed for each experiment. The highest value among the four runs (Chromatin/Nuclear/+IR/−IR) was used as a baseline and to develop a normalization factor for all values within an experiment. MS/MS spectra were searched against the SwissProt non-redundant data base (SwissProt 57.1) using an in house Mascot Daemon Server (Matrix Science). Search parameters included fixed carbamidomethylation of cysteines; trypsin digestion with one missed cleavage; variable modifications included oxidized methionines, phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues; precursor mass tolerance of 50 ppm; product ion mass tolerance of 0.5 Da; and scoring settings for ESI Q Trap. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to introduce single amino acid changes by altering one nucleotide at specific sites in the S-Chk2 template. The primers containing the desired mutation were designed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutagenesis PCR reactions and subsequent bacterial transformations were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid DNA was isolated from colonies grown under ampicillin selection, and the constructs containing the desired mutation were identified by sequence analysis (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ). The plasmid DNA was amplified then isolated using the PureLink HiPure Plasmid Filter Maxiprep Kit (Invitrogen). Sequences of all mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression was confirmed by transfection and Western analysis using anti-Chk2 monoclonal antibody (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). Total protein concentrations were determined by Protein Assay Dye Reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amount of protein lysate from different samples containing DTT and NuPAGE SDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) was heated at 70 °C for 10 min and then separated through a NuPAGE® Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen). The proteins were then transferred onto Immobilon-FL (Millipore, Billerica, MA) membrane using a Trans-blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 400 mA for 50 min. Following blocking for 1 h with Odyssey blocker (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), membranes were incubated in primary antibody mixture containing mouse monoclonal anti-Chk2 antibody diluted 1:4,000 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) and Chk2 phosphoryl-T383 antibody diluted 1:1,000 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Chk2 phosphoryl-T387 antibody diluted 1:500 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), Chk2 phosphoryl-T68 antibody diluted 1:2000 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), Chk2 phosphoryl-S516 antibody diluted 1:500 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Chk2 phosphoryl-S33/S35 antibody diluted 1:500 (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA) or rabbit anti-GFP antibody diluted 1:2,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight. Membranes were washed 5 min four times with PBS-T prior to incubation with a mixture of goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, conjugated to IR 680Dye and IR 800Dye (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), respectively, diluted 1:20,000. Excess antibody was removed with three 5-min washes in PBS-T. Prepared membranes were scanned for fluorescence emission at 700 and 800 nm, using an Odyssey® infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). Densitometric analysis of fluorescent signals was performed using the Odyssey scanner software. Chk2 kinase assays were carried out using the K-LISA Checkpoint Activity Kit (Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals Inc., San Diego, CA). Expression and isolation of Chk2 was achieved as described above. The S-bead-bound Chk2 was washed three times with bind/wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and once with the 1× kinase assay buffer from the kit. The kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of ATP, MgCl2, and biotinylated substrate peptide (KKKVSRSGLYRSPSMPENLNRPR), derived from Cdc25C. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant containing phosphorylated substrate peptide was transferred to Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates. The captured phosphorylated substrate was detected using the peptide specific phosphoserine detection antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Activity was determined by the absorbance at dual wavelengths 450/570 nm. S-GFP isolated under the same conditions was used a negative control during the assays. The amount of Chk2 in the assay was determined by recovery of protein into Laemmli buffer and analysis by Western following SDS-PAGE separation. Standard deviation across triplicate reactions was used to generate error estimates. HEK293T17 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding S-Chk2 (WT and mutants) and HA-tagged ubiquitin using the CaCl2 precipitant method. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in M-PER mammalian protein extraction buffer (Pierce) supplemented with N-ethylmaleimide (5 mm), protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo, Rockford, IL), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Ectopically expressed S-Chk2 was affinity precipitated as described above. The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and Western analysis. Rabbit anti-HA antibody (Zymed Laboratory, Carlsbad, CA, 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer) and mouse anti-Chk2 antibody were used to detect ubiquitylated Chk2 and affinity-precipitated total Chk2. A comprehensive physical characterization of protein post-translational modification requires expression of sufficient amount of protein. We overexpressed Chk2 with an incorporated S tag for subsequent purification from the human cell line HEK293/T17. Because the cellular background can influence protein modification we examined endogenous Chk2 for IR-induced phosphorylation by immunoassay. In Fig. 1A, we show that this cell line displayed a normal response to IR in terms of the damage-response specific phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser35, Thr68, Thr383, and Ser516. We have previously demonstrated that this cell line displays intact downstream signaling by Chk2 in response to IR (13Haoudi A. Daniels R.C. Wong E. Kupfer G. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37736-37744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results suggest that our chosen cell model is appropriate to the proposed studies. It was into this background that we transiently expressed the Chk2 fusion protein and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. The Chk2-expressing cells were subjected to IR prior to protein isolation and purification. The purified protein was normalized to total Chk2 and then assessed for kinase activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expressed and purified Chk2 protein displayed kinase activity, which was induced following exposure to IR. We then purified Chk2 protein from individual cytoplasmic, nuclear, and chromatin fractions, separated proteins by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Coomassie staining for total protein (Fig. 1C). The relative amount of cytoplasmic Chk2 is in mass excess to protein in the nucleus. When we examined total purified transiently expressed Chk2 protein for IR-induced phosphorylation, we found that only residues Ser33/Ser35 displayed a measureable IR response (see Fig. 4). This is likely due to the overexpression and localization of the transfected Chk2 protein into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, S2 fraction). However, when we isolated Chk2 protein from the chromatin fraction we were able to observe additional IR-induced phosphorylation as we show for the T-loop residue Thr383 (Fig. 1D). Thus, the remainder of our experiments was conducted using Chk2 isolated from nuclear and chromatin fractions. MRM on a triple quadruple mass spectrometer allows for sensitive and specific quantitation of multiple post-translational modifications in proteins from highly complex samples (14Kondrat R.W. Cooks R.G. McLaughlin J.L. Science. 1978; 199: 978-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Unwin R.D. Griffiths J.R. Leverentz M.K. Grallert A. Hagan I.M. Whetton A.D. Mol.

Protoc. 2009; 4: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The essential requirement for the technology is the ability to detect a specific precursor ion (Q1 m/z) that is indicative of the targeted peptide, to isolate that ion for collision-induced fragmentation and, finally, to detect unique product ion (Q3 m/z), following fragmentation. We applied an MRM approach toward the discovery and quantitation of Chk2 T-loop phosphorylation species. We evaluated multiple putative phosphorylation sites in Chk2 by detecting signature ions unique for each specific modification event. Specifically we targeted eight sites in the activation T-loop of Chk2 protein (amino acid residues 365–406). This analysis is not possible using conventional antibody-based approaches due to the close proximity of multiple phosphorylation sites. MRM assays were developed using the MIDASTM workflow and optimized for tryptic peptides derived from the activation loop of Chk2. Two non-phosphorylated Chk-2 tryptic peptides were used for normalization of all MRM pairs across experimental runs. The sequence and the product ions selected for monitoring Chk2 peptides in the MRM assay are illustrated in supplemental Fig. 1 and listed in supplemental Table 1. We isolated Chk2 protein from chromatin and nuclear fractions and conducted a survey for presence of phosphorylation in the target region. We were able to confirm the presence of known Chk2 phosphorylation at Ser379, Thr383, and Thr387. In addition, we identified four novel phosphorylation events at Ser372, Thr378, Thr389, and Tyr390. The modification at Tyr390 is the second report of a tyrosine phosphorylation of Chk2 (17King J.B. Gross J. Lovly C.M. Rohrs H. Piwnica-Worms H. Townsend R.R. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We could find no evidence of phosphorylation at Ser367. Quantitation of each Chk2 species in response to IR allowed for determination of IR-induced phosphorylation events. An example of the raw data is shown in supplemental Fig. 2, and the results for this analysis are summarized in Fig. 2. The most striking change response to IR was phosphorylation at Thr389. We observed a 26-fold increase in the monophosphorylated peptide. We also could confirm previous observations that Ser379 was IR-inducible. Monophosphorylation at Thr383 was only slightly increased following IR, but the double phosphorylation at Thr383/Thr389 nearly doubled following IR. Unique among all of the phosphorylated residues in this region, we saw no evidence of independent phosphorylation at Thr387 indicating that modification at this residue is a co-dependent process. In some cases we observed a reduction in the presence of a phosphorylated species. We reasoned that this was the result of either IR-induced dephosphorylation or a phosphorylation event associated with inactive Chk2 (naïve to IR). Phosphorylation at Thr378 was not induced by exposure to IR but rather showed a damage-induced reduction in phosphorylated form. In addition, Chk2 phosphorylation species Thr383/Tyr390, Thr387/Tyr390, Thr389/Tyr390, and Thr383/Thr387/Tyr390 were also reduced following IR. Notable among the IR-induced reduction in phosphorylated species was the quadruple phosphorylated Chk2 species Thr383/Thr387/Thr389/Tyr390, which displayed a more than 12-fold decrease. In fact, most Chk2 proteins in which Tyr390 site was phosphorylated showed reduced levels following IR. In this analysis we compared Chk2 species isolated from nuclear and chromatin cellular compartments. For each compartment we analyzed Chk2 before and after exposure to 5 Gy IR. We conducted a direct quantitation of each experimental condition and normalized to internal and external peptide controls. In this way we could achieve relative quantitation of the nuclear/chromatin distribution of each targeted Chk2 phosphorylation site. Our quantitation approach allowed for an assessment of IR-induced changes in the distribution of Chk2 species between chromatin and the nucleus (Fig. 3). We considered a 2-fold increase in the percent of a species in the chromatin as the criteria for chromatin targeting. Conversely we considered a 2-fold decrease in the percentage of a species in the chromatin as the criteria for chromatin egress. Designation as egress was contraindicated if the chromatin decrease was associated with a decrease in the percent of the same species in the nucleus. We observed a damage-induced chromatin targeting of Chk2 phosphorylated at Thr383 and Thr383/Thr387, consistent with these modifications signaling Chk2 activation and damage targeting. We observed a similar chromatin targeting of Chk2 phosphorylated at Ser372, Ser379, and Thr389. In addition, the double phosphorylation species Thr378/Ser379 and Thr383/Thr389 also displayed chromatin targeting following IR. Interestingly, only two species, the triple phosphorylation at Thr383/Thr387/Thr389 and the quadruple phosphorylation species at Thr383/Thr387/Thr389/Tyr390 displayed chromatin egress as defined in our study. This result would suggest that, although single and double phosphorylations in the T-loop signal recruitment to chromatin in response to damage, hyperphosphorylation of the same protein signals chromatin egress. In total these data support a model in which sequential phosphorylation of residues in the T-loop region regulate IR response. To determine whether the novel phosphorylation events were critical to activation of Chk2, we conducted site-directed mutational analysis. We engineered substitution of S/T > A to probe the functional significance of phosphorylation at specific T-loop region sites. The targeted substitution mutations T378A, S379A, T383A, T387A, and T389A were introduced into the S-Chk2 background. These T-loop region mutations, along with wild-type protein and the well characterized mutation at T68A, were transiently expressed in HEK293/T17 cells and subsequently isolated and purified. The purified protein was then assessed for kinase activity in vitro. The measured kinase activity from each study point was normalized to total purified protein as shown in Fig. 4A. As shown in Fig. 4B, wild-type protein displayed IR-inducible kinase activity. The T68A mutant retained kinase function but was reduced for response to IR. The substitution mutations S379A, T383A, and T387A showed dramatically reduced kinase activity. New to this study, we show that substitution at T378A retained wild-type basal kinase activity but failed to respond to IR. Interestingly, the substitution mutation of T389A resulted in a 6-fold increase in basal kinase activity when compared with wild-type protein. This result suggested that phosphorylation at Thr389 may represent a repressive phosphorylation event. We next examined the dependence of specific Chk2 phosphorylation signaling events upon selected substitution mutations. Chk2 isolated from total cell lysates was examined for phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser35, Thr68, Thr383, and Thr387 (Fig. 5). As expected the substitution mutation at Thr68 was the only mutant that ablated reaction with anti-Chk2 pThr68. Although the overall intensity was altered, the strict dependence of Ser33/Ser35 phosphorylation upon DNA damage was unaffected by any of the tested mutants. Consistent with previous studies the phosphorylation of Thr383 and Thr387 were interdependent, because mutation at either site ablates recognition by relevant antibody to the other site. Interestingly, the T389A mutant protein displays phosphorylation at Thr383 but not at Thr387. Thus, phosphorylation at Thr389 may be a prerequisite for Thr387 modification. These results confirmed the interdependence of Thr383 and Thr387 and proposed a novel dependence of Thr387 phosphorylation upon Thr389. The use of so-called phosphorylation mimetics is problematic primarily due to the difficulty in interpretation of negative data. However, the use of mimetics in which protein function is restored can provide useful structural inferences. Therefore, we introduced aspartic acid substitutions for serine/threonine at T378D, S379D, T383D, T387D, and T389D (Fig. 6A). These mutations were generated to specifically rescue kinase activity of these mutations. Substitution mutations T378D, S379D, and T383D resulted in kinase activity indistinguishable from the relevant T/S > A mutatio"

To date, the effecting cytoplasmic domain and the shed extracellular domain have been in the same polypeptide. In this study, shedding of GPIbα, the ligand-binding subunit of the platelet GPIb-IX complex and a marker for platelet senescence and storage lesion, was assessed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with/without functional GPIbα sheddase ADAM17. Mutagenesis of the GPIb-IX complex, which contains GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX subunits, revealed that the intracellular membrane-proximal calmodulin-binding region of GPIbβ is critical for ADAM17-dependent shedding of GPIbα induced by the calmodulin inhibitor, W7. Perturbing the interaction between GPIbα and GPIbβ subunits further lessened the restraint of GPIbβ on GPIbα shedding. However, contrary to the widely accepted model of calmodulin regulation of ectodomain shedding, the R152E/L153E mutation in the GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain disrupted calmodulin binding to GPIbβ but had little effect on GPIbα shedding. Analysis of induction of GPIbα shedding by membrane-permeable GPIbβ-derived peptides implicated the association of GPIbβ with an unidentified intracellular protein in mediating regulation of GPIbα shedding. Overall, these results provide evidence for a novel trans-subunit mechanism for regulating ectodomain shedding.

Overall, these results provide evidence for a novel trans-subunit mechanism for regulating ectodomain shedding. A large number of transmembrane proteins expressed on the cell surface undergo ectodomain shedding, a process in which the protein is cleaved at a site close to the outer surface of the cell membrane and subsequently its ectodomain released from the cell (1Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Because ectodomain shedding plays a vital role in various cellular processes, including cell growth and proliferation, mammalian development, cell migration, and inflammation, its aberration often leads to disease states including cancer (2Peschon J.J.

Ectodomain shedding is in essence an enzyme-driven proteolytic reaction; therefore, in general there are two ways to regulate it. One way is to modulate the activity of the enzyme that is often referred to as sheddase; the other is to modulate the accessibility of the shedding substrate to the sheddase. Most sheddases belong to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAMa disintegrin and metalloproteaseCaMcalmodulinGPglycoproteinDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideGCglycocalicinFmoc9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonylCHOChinese hamster ovaryPBSphosphate-buffered saline. protease family within the metzincin superfamily (1Seals D.F.

In addition to extracellular signals such as ligand binding to the shedding substrate (9Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol.

Cell. 2005; 123: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), intracellular signals can also induce shedding of a protein without affecting the catalytic activity of the sheddase. The first reported example of this mechanism is the induction of shedding of L-selectin by calmodulin (CaM) inhibitors (11Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K. Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). CaM co-immunoprecipitates with L-selectin from cell lysates and binds directly to the isolated cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin. Treating L-selectin-expressing cells with trifluoperazine, a CaM inhibitor, causes dissociation of CaM from L-selectin and up-regulates shedding of L-selectin (11Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CaM inhibitors rapidly trigger shedding of other membrane proteins by a mechanism independent of protein kinase C and calcium influx, both of which can activate ADAMs (13Díaz-Rodríguez E. Esparís-Ogando A. Montero J.C. Yuste L. Pandiella A. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, point mutations in the L-selectin cytoplasmic domain, such as L320E, disrupt CaM association and significantly increase L-selectin shedding (11Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I.

Since the report on L-selectin, treatment of CaM inhibitors, such as trifluoperazine and W7 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide), has been found to induce shedding of a number of membrane receptors (13Díaz-Rodríguez E.

These membrane receptors contain a cluster of basic residues in the membrane-proximal region of their cytoplasmic domain, many of which have been shown to associate with CaM. Thus, it appears that CaM association with the cytoplasmic domain of a membrane protein helps to inhibit its shedding. Dissociation of CaM, either by exogenous inhibitors or disrupting mutations in the CaM-binding site, would up-regulate shedding. The glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX complex is a platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor and other ligands that play important roles in hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammation (22Clemetson K.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 98: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions ADAM17 cleaves GPIbα, the main ligand-binding subunit of the GPIb-IX complex (Fig. 1A), at a site between membrane-proximal residues Gly464 and Val465 (23Bergmeier W.

Berndt M.C. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), GPIbα does not conform to previous observations in that its cytoplasmic domain does not contain a CaM-binding sequence. Instead, the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbβ, another subunit in the GPIb-IX complex that is not shed, contains a membrane-proximal positively charged sequence that interacts with CaM (27Andrews R.K. Munday A.D. Mitchell C.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the GPIb-IX complex GPIbα is associated with two GPIbβ subunits via extracellular membrane-proximal disulfide bonds and noncovalent transmembrane domain interactions (28Luo S.Z. Mo X.

Lu N. Padilla A. López J.A. Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23050-23059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Mo X. Luo S.Z. López J.A. Li R. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To ensure accurate comparison of GPIbα surface expression levels among various transfected cells, key parameters including the amount of vector DNA and transfection efficiency were kept constant (33Mo X. Lu N. Padilla A. López J.A. Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23050-23059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CHO cells transfected with sham vectors (for 0% expression level) and with the wild-type GPIb-IX complex (for 100% expression level) were always included in each transfection experiment. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were used for shedding assays as described below. The CHO cell line stably expressing the wild-type GPIb-IX complex was obtained as described (32Mo X. Luo S.Z. Munday A.D. Sun W. Berndt M.C. López J.A. Dong J.F. Li R. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 6: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The surface expression level of GPIbα was analyzed by flow cytometry (32Mo X. Luo S.Z. Munday A.D. Sun W. Berndt M.C. López J.A. Dong J.F. Li R. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 6: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 33Mo X. Lu N. Padilla A. López J.A. Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23050-23059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were incubated with 2 μg/ml of anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibody WM23 for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA), and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After a final wash with PBS/BSA to remove unbound antibody, the cells were fixed and examined in a Beckman-Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. To quantitate the GPIbα surface expression level, the mean fluorescence intensity of the entire cell population (10,000 cells) was normalized to the value of cells expressing the wild-type complex set as 100%. To measure W7-induced shedding of GPIbα, transfected CHO cells (approximately 5 × 105 cells) were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and treated with either 150 μm W7 or 5% DMSO at 37 °C for 3 h. Proteins contained in the PBS supernatant were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h. Cells were either assayed for surface expression of GPIbα by flow cytometry, or lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1% Triton X-100) containing a 1:50 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells (Sigma). The supernatant from the cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 15,600 × g for 5 min at room temperature. To measure constitutive shedding of GPIbα from transiently transfected cells, the culture medium was collected 2 days after transfection, and glycocalicin (GC) released into the medium was immunoprecipitated with WM23 and protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). In both experiments, glycocalicin precipitated from the medium or full-length GPIbα in cell lysates were resolved in an 8% Tris glycine/SDS gel under reducing or non-reducing conditions, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blotted with WM23. As a loading control, blots were stained with anti-actin antibody (Sigma). To assess expression of HA-tagged GPIbβ and GPIX, cell lysates were resolved in 12% Tris glycine/SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blotted with anti-HA antibody (Sigma) and polyclonal anti-GPIX antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Antibody binding was detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence substrates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, the membrane was exposed to Kodak BioMax X-AR film or directly visualized and quantitated using a GeneGnome HR imaging system (Syngene BioImaging, Frederick, MD). The exposure time was adjusted to avoid saturation and to ensure exposure in the linear range. The relative intensity of the blotted bands was quantitated with background correction, and normalized against the intensity of the corresponding actin band. The GC:GPIbα ratio for the wild-type and mutant GPIb-IX complex, an indicator of the extent of GPIbα shedding, is calculated as the ratio of the level of GC measured by Western blot to the surface expression level of GPIbα quantitated by flow cytometry. The ratios were then normalized to that of the wild-type complex in the same experiment set as 1.0. Cell lysates were incubated with 20 μg of GST-CaM (27Andrews R.K. Munday A.D. Mitchell C.A. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 1 h, and then incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline and bound HA-tagged GPIbβ was eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved using a 5–20% Tris glycine/SDS gel under reducing conditions, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with anti-HA antibody. N-terminal palmitoylated peptides, palmitoyl-RLRRLRARAR (named pal-WT), palmitoyl-RLEELRARAR (pal-151E/152E), and palmitoyl-RLREERARAR (pal-152E/153E), were synthesized on Fmoc-Ala-Wang resin using standard Fmoc/tBu chemistry and the HBTU/HOBt protocol (36Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC and confirmed by mass spectrometry. CHO cells stably expressing the GPIb-IX complex (32Mo X. Luo S.Z. Munday A.D. Sun W. Berndt M.C. López J.A. Dong J.F. Li R. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 6: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, incubated in the same buffer with each peptide at the indicated concentrations or 5% DMSO as solvent control at 37 °C for 2 h. The extent of GPIbα shedding induced by the peptide treatment, including GC release into the PBS buffer and decrease of the GPIbα surface expression level, was measured as described above. The human GPIb-IX complex is primarily expressed in anucleate platelets that are not amenable to mutagenesis studies. CHO cells, which do not express endogenous GPIb-IX, have been used in studies of ectodomain shedding (37Müllberg J. Rauch C.T. Wolfson M.F. Castner B. Fitzner J.N. Otten-Evans C. Mohler K.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45255-45268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As in platelets, GPIbα is found in the plasma membrane of transfected CHO K1 cells, and its efficient expression requires cotransfection of GPIbβ and GPIX (30López J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mo X. Luo S.Z. López J.A. Li R. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To assess shedding of GPIbα in CHO cells, we monitored the amount of soluble extracellular domain of GPIbα, also known as GC (39Clemetson K.J. Naim H.Y. Lüscher E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), released into the culture medium by immunoblotting and measured concurrently the level of GPIbα remaining on the cell surface by flow cytometry. As in platelets (24Gardiner E.E. Karunakaran D. Shen Y. Arthur J.F. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), GPIbα is constitutively shed from stably or transiently transfected CHO cells expressing the GPIb-IX complex (referred in this study as Ibα/Ibβ/IX cells). Shedding can be further up-regulated by W7 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C, supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, both basal and W7-induced GPIbα shedding from CHO cells is abrogated by GM6001, a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor. Finally, the complete lack of free GC in the culture medium of transfected CHO M2 cells that lack functional ADAM17 (31Li X. Fan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27365-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), despite expression of a high level of GPIbα, clearly indicates that shedding of GPIbα in transfected CHO cells is catalyzed by ADAM17, as also true for platelets (Fig. 1D). Thus, transiently transfected CHO cells are a suitable model system for studies of GPIbα shedding. Because W7 treatment induces ectodomain shedding by presumably dissociating CaM from the shedding substrate, we reasoned that the element responding to W7-induced shedding of GPIbα should reside in cytoplasmic domains of the GPIb-IX complex. Moreover, genetic alteration of the cytoplasmic domains should abolish W7-induced shedding of GPIbα and/or enhance constitutive shedding of GPIbα. Initially, whole domain replacement was carried out to locate the cytoplasmic sequence critical for W7-induced shedding of GPIbα. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα was replaced by the GPIX counterpart, not known to associate with any intracellular proteins or play a role in GPIb-IX assembly (IbαIX). The cytoplasmic domain of GPIX was replaced by a polyalanine sequence (IXpA). Because the membrane-proximal region of the GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain is absolutely required for surface expression of the GPIb-IX complex (34Mo X. Luo S.Z. López J.A. Li R. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), only the membrane-distal region that contains residues 161–181 was truncated in this study (Ibβ160Δ). To characterize the effect of these changes on GPIbα shedding, each mutant construct was cotransfected with the other two wild-type subunits into CHO K1 cells (e.g. IbαIX with wild-type GPIbβ and GPIX, designated as IbαIX/Ibβ/IX in Fig. 2B). The transfected cells were treated with 150 μm W7 or solvent (5% DMSO) for 2 h in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 37 °C, after which the extent of W7-induced GPIbα shedding was monitored. Consistent with previous observations (34Mo X. Luo S.Z. López J.A. Li R. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40Dong J.F. Li C.Q. Sae-Tung G. Hyun W. Afshar-Kharghan V. López J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12421-12427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 41Mangin P. David T. Lavaud V. Cranmer S.L. Pikovski I. Jackson S.P. Berndt M.C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. Lanza F. Blood. 2004; 104: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), some, but not all, alterations in cytoplasmic domains caused a moderate decrease in expression of the GPIb-IX complex in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Because the level of GC released into the culture medium depends on both shedding efficiency and the abundance of GPIbα as shedding substrate, the difference in GPIbα surface expression level precluded the direct comparison of GC levels between cell lines as an accurate assessment of the mutational effect on GPIbα shedding efficiency. Instead, a relative ratio of the level of shedding product versus the level of remaining shedding substrate on the cell surface, the GC:GPIbα ratio, was normalized against the corresponding ratio observed in cells expressing the wild-type GPIb-IX complex (Ibα/Ibβ/IX), and used to denote the extent of GPIbα shedding. The inclusion of only the GPIbα surface expression level, but not its overall expression level, in measurement of GPIbα shedding makes irrelevant the possibility that a mutated GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain may alter the distribution of GPIbα between the cell surface and internal compartments. Comparison of GC:GPIbα ratios for cells transiently expressing wild-type and mutant complexes (Fig. 2B) indicated that although replacement of GPIbα or GPIX cytoplasmic domains, or truncation of the membrane-distal region of the GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain, affected surface expression of GPIbα, none of the mutations abolished W7-induced shedding of GPIbα nor did they significantly alter its extent. Thus, it appears that the membrane-proximal region of the GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain, which contains the CaM-binding site and is the only cytoplasmic sequence in the GPIb-IX complex that had not been changed in our study, may be critical for mediating W7-induced shedding of GPIbα. Because replacing the membrane-proximal region of the GPIbβ cytoplasmic domain with a polyalanine sequence abolished surface expression of GPIbα (34Mo X. Luo S.Z. López J.A. Li R. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thus making it impossible to monitor its shedding, site-specific mutagenesis was performed to probe the role of this region in the regulation of GPIbα shedding. More specifically, GPIbβ residues 149–154 were mutated to Glu, one or two residues at a time. The mutant GPIbβ was transiently cotransfected with wild-type GPIbα and GPIX in CHO K1 cells, to enable evaluation of constitutive shedding of GPIbα (Fig. 3). In all cases, GPIbα shedding was mediated by ADAM17, because no GC was generated from transfected CHO M2 cells lacking functional ADAM17 and surface GPIbα levels were relatively higher than those in transfected CHO K1 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Some mutations, such as IbβR149E in which GPIbβ residue Arg149 was mutated to Glu, caused a significant decrease in surface expression of GPIbα (Fig. 3B). Nonetheless, in most cells sufficient GPIbα was expressed to allow characterization of GPIbα shedding. All single Glu mutant complexes exhibited GC:GPIbα ratios indistinguishable from wild-type. In contrast, double Glu mutant complexes exhibited different GC:GPIbα ratios. Although the GC:GPIbα ratio of cells expressing the GPIbβ-R152E/L153E mutant complex (Ibα/IbβR152E/L153E/IX) was the same as that of wild-type, ratios of cells expressing Ibα/IbβR149E/L150E/IX, Ibα/IbβL150E/R151E/IX, or Ibα/IbβR151E/R152E/IX complexes were significantly higher than wild-type (Fig. 3B). These cells had little GPIbα on the surface, likely due to a combination of decreased GPIbα expression and increased shedding activity. Together, these results show that the membra"
https://openalex.org/W2124747442,"Antibiotic resistance has become a worldwide medical problem. To find new ways of overcoming this phenomenon, we investigated the role of the membrane-active oligo-acyl-lysyl (OAK) sequence C(12)K-7α(8), in combination with essentially ineffective antibiotics. Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against gram-negative multidrug-resistant strains of Escherichia coli revealed combinations with sub-MIC OAK levels that acted synergistically with several antibiotics, thus lowering their MICs by several orders of magnitude. To shed light into the molecular basis for this synergism, we used both mutant strains and biochemical assays. Our results suggest that bacterial sensitization to antibiotics was derived mainly from the OAK's capacity to overcome the efflux-enhanced resistance mechanism, by promoting backdoor entry of otherwise excluded antibiotics. To facilitate simultaneous delivery of the pooled drugs to an infection site, we developed a novel OAK-based cochleate system with demonstrable stability in whole blood. To assess the potential therapeutic use of such cochleates, we performed preliminary experiments that imitate systemic treatment of neutropenic mice infected with lethal inoculums of multidrug resistance E. coli. Single-dose administration of erythromycin coencapsulated in OAK-based cochleates has decreased drug toxicity and increased therapeutic efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our findings suggest a potentially useful approach for fighting efflux-enhanced resistance mechanisms."

Stimulation with a mixture containing IL-3, IL-6, stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, and Flt3 ligand induced Ccn3/Nov mRNA over 100-fold in WT (control) but not Stat5a/b-null KSL cells. CCN3/NOV is a positive regulator of human HSC self-renewal and development of committed blood cells. Without stimulation, the Ccn3/Nov signal level was low in control KSL cells similar to Stat5a/b-null KSL cells. To determine which cytokine activates the Ccn3/Nov gene, we analyzed Lineage(-) c-Kit(+) (KL) and 32D cells using quantitative PCR and ChIP assays. Although stimulation with a mixture lacking IL-3 prevented the induction of Ccn3/Nov in control KL cells, IL-3 alone could induce Ccn3/Nov mRNA in control KL and 32D cells. ChIP assays using 32D cells revealed IL-3-induced binding of STAT5A/B to a γ-interferon-activated sequences site in the Ccn3/Nov gene promoter.

CHP1 localizes to the plasma membrane, the Golgi apparatus, and the nucleus and functions to regulate trafficking of early secretory vesicles, activation of T cells, and expression and transport of the Na-H exchanger NHE1. Although CHP1 contains nuclear export signals, whether its nuclear and cytoplasmic localization is regulated and has distinct functions remain unknown. We show that CHP1 is predominantly in the nucleus in quiescent fibroblasts, is translocated to cytoplasmic compartments with growth medium, and that translocation is inhibited by mutations in the nuclear export motifs. In a screen for proteins co-precipitating with CHP1 in quiescent cells we identified the upstream binding factor UBF, a DNA-binding protein and component of the RNA polymerase I complex regulating RNA synthesis. The CHP1-UBF interaction is restricted to the nucleus and inhibited by Ca(2+). Nuclear retention of CHP1 attenuates the abundance of UBF in the nucleolus and inhibits RNA synthesis when quiescent cells are transferred to growth medium. These data show UBF as a newly identified CHP1-binding protein and regulation of RNA synthesis as a newly identified function for nuclear-localized CHP1, which is distinct from CHP1 functions in the cytosol."

IntroductionThe vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase is an endoplasmic reticulum integral membrane enzyme. It post-translationally modifies certain proteins important in several physiologically important areas, including blood coagulation. The modification involves the addition of a carboxyl group to the γ-carbon of glutamic acid residues in the amino portion of the vitamin K-dependent substrate.In addition to the glutamic acid and CO2, which provides the added carboxyl group, other substrates required for the reaction are vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) 4The abbreviations used are: KH2vitamin K1 hydroquinoneMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonatePC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. and oxygen. During carboxylation KH2 is converted to the epoxide; thus carboxylase is also an epoxidase.The primary interaction between carboxylase and most of its protein substrates is through the propeptides of the substrates. Binding is of high affinity, which allows the substrate to bind long enough for multiple carboxylations to occur.In addition to being the primary binding site for carboxylase, the propeptide also exerts an effect on carboxylase catalysis. Factors IX and X and prothrombin propeptides, when bound to carboxylase, increase the activity of the enzyme toward small glutamate-containing substrates (1Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cheung A. Engelke J.A. Sanders C. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9697-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For the most part these results suggest that the propeptides induce a conformational change or stabilize a more active conformation in the carboxylase active site. The efficiency of the change appears to be similar for the propeptides of prothrombin and factors IX and X. The fact that these propeptides have different sequences implies that the conserved residues control both binding and allosterism. However, even deleting the Phe-16 residue, which is important for binding, only decreases affinity but not stimulation of activity (1Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Thermodynamic arguments indicate that if the propeptide effect has to do with substrate binding, then substrate binding should affect propeptide binding.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that under catalytic conditions, koff for the propeptide of factor IX was slower than in the absence of catalysis and that the Kd for that peptide was lower under catalytic conditions.

There are other reports that seem to imply that other substrate binding events affect the carboxylase conformation and its activity (4Li S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Walsh C.T.

U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9069-9074Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In the present study we have extended the investigation of the effect of propeptide and substrates on carboxylase function, including measuring the Kd of several propeptides in the absence of substrates, determining the effect of the substrates (KH2 and FLEEL) on propeptide dissociation from carboxylase and the effect of various propeptides with widely varying affinities for carboxylase on FLEEL activity and kinetics. Our goal was to determine the following: 1) Is the wide variation of carboxylase affinity of the propeptides similar in the absence of catalysis as it has been shown to be during catalysis? 2) Is stabilization of the propeptide-carboxylase complex by FLEEL a general phenomenon among propeptides, and do substrates other than FLEEL affect the stability of the complexes alone or in combination? 3) Is the substrate effect on the propeptide-carboxylase complex similar for all propeptides? 4) Is the effect on small substrate carboxylation similar for all propeptides as suggested for the propeptides of factors IX and X and prothrombin? 5) Are there amino acid residues necessary for these functions other than those already recognized as important for binding to carboxylase, and finally, how do these effects contribute to enzyme specificity and/or efficiency?DISCUSSIONOur goal in the present study was to further understanding of the structural and functional interactions of carboxylase with its substrates. All indications are that the propeptides of vitamin K-dependent protein precursors provide most of the energy for their binding to the carboxylase. It is also likely that the propeptide of such a protein constitutes the first site to interact with the enzyme. As the first binding event it most likely sets the stage for binding of the other substrates. In addition, the turnover rate during carboxylation of peptide substrates depends to a certain extent on the propeptide affinity for the carboxylase (7Lin P.J. Straight D.L. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6560-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For these reasons we felt that the carboxylase-bound propeptide would be a good model for the enzyme vitamin K-dependent protein precursor complex. Our idea was to characterize the carboxylase-propeptide interaction without substrates and then study the effect of substrates on the stability of the complex.As we expected, based on results from previous work, we found the propeptides exhibit a broad range of affinities (12Stanley T.B.

Otherwise there is wide variation in the character of most residues.In contrast to the variation in affinities, the propeptides we tested all stimulated FLEEL carboxylation to a similar extent. Even for the differences in stimulation there is no correlation between stimulatory effect and propeptide affinity. As with affinity, we were unable to identify the patterns of primary structure necessary for the effect on FLEEL. These results agree with observations regarding the prothrombin and factor X (wild-type and truncated) as well as factor IX propeptides (1Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol.

The results regarding the relationship between propeptide sequence, affinity for carboxylase, and the ability to stimulate carboxylase activity indicate that binding requires relatively few conserved residues, and once any propeptide binds, the active carboxylase conformations are all similar.As we discussed in our previous work, at least part of the increase in carboxylase catalytic activity is caused by increased FLEEL binding (19Mutucumarana V.P. Acher F. Straight D.L. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46488-46493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because propeptide binding affects FLEEL, FLEEL binding must affect propeptide binding. In fact earlier studies had shown that FLEEL or catalytic conditions slowed the factor IX propeptide dissociation from carboxylase (6Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Lin P.J. Straight D.L. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6560-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Our present work extends these earlier studies to investigate the effect of individual substrates on the propeptide-carboxylase complex. In the absence of substrates, the dissociation data did not fit a single exponential equation. On the other hand, when we added substrate(s) to the propeptide-carboxylase mixture, a single exponential equation adequately fit the dissociation data. KH2 and FLEEL decreased the koff for the prothrombin and protein C propeptides as well as for that of factor IX. The effect of both together was greater than either substrate alone. These results and those from the earlier study suggest that substrate binding to the enzyme-propeptide complex causes a shift in equilibrium to a conformation that has higher affinity for the propeptide, and as a result, higher catalytic activity (20Rishavy M.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9836-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).To determine whether a multiple conformation model fits our results, we analyzed our data using the software Dynafit (13Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Dynafit allows testing the fit of data to a given mechanism(s). Our dissociation data fit a mechanism that includes two forms of carboxylase and a mechanism in which two propeptides bind to one carboxylase. Although an earlier report suggested that carboxylase might bind two propeptide molecules (21Hallgren K.W. Hommema E.L. McNally B.A. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15045-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Presnell et al. (6Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed that the carboxylase binds only one propeptide. Therefore we conclude that a model in which at least two forms of carboxylase exist, which have different affinities for propeptide and presumably propeptide-containing substrates, best describes this interaction. Comparing our results to those of earlier studies puts our results into the context of how substrate binding affects carboxylase activity and specificity and may put the earlier studies into the context of how substrate binding affects carboxylase structure.Li et al. (4Li S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6384-6390Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) showed that epoxidation and carboxylation can uncouple. In other words, when all substrates other than CO2 are present, epoxidation of KH2 occurs without carboxylation. This indicates that if all other substrates are present, the CO2 is not needed until the last step in carboxylation: addition to the γ-carbanion of glutamate. It is consistent with the prediction of Uotila (22Uotila L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), who concludes from kinetic results that CO2 was likely the last substrate to react. This also fits logically with our results that indicate bicarbonate does not affect the koff of propeptide from the carboxylase.Sugiura et al. (10Sugiura I. Furie B. Walsh C.T. Furie B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 9069-9074Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that carboxylase does not catalyze epoxidation of KH2 in the absence of propeptide or FLEEL. The reaction is fastest, ∼10-fold faster than with any single component, with both FLEEL and propeptide. FLEEL alone is more effective than propeptide alone. As the authors suggest, this indicates that binding of both or either causes a conformational change that increases the epoxidase activity and/or KH2 binding.The experiments of Bouchard et al. (8Bouchard B.A. Furie B. Furie B.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9517-9523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that N-ethylmaleimide inhibited carboxylase. Glu-containing substrates, such as FLEEL or a peptide containing the propeptide of prothrombin and the first 10 residues of its Gla domain, increased the rate of inactivation, but propeptide alone did not. They also report that KH2 protects from inactivation only when a Glu-containing substrate is present. These results are in some ways hard to interpret because N-ethylmaleimide is expected to modify Cys residues. It now appears that Cys residues are not directly involved in carboxylase catalysis, as was previously thought. However, these studies are consistent with our hypothesis that substrate binding supports multiple conformations of the carboxylase.A more recent work by Rishavy et al. (23Rishavy M.A. Hallgren K.W. Yakubenko A.V. Shtofman R.L. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13239-13248Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) implicates two lysine residues (Lys-217 and Lys-218), not cysteines, as important in catalysis. Quantum chemical calculations are consistent with this model, but they also support a second possible mechanism for removal of the KH2 proton involving only one lysine (24Davis C.H. Deerfield 2nd, D. Wymore T. Stafford D.W. Pedersen L.G. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2007; 26: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because both models are similar for our purposes, we will focus on the two-lysine model in this discussion.Rishavy et al. (23Rishavy M.A. Hallgren K.W. Yakubenko A.V. Shtofman R.L. Runge K.W. Berkner K.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13239-13248Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) propose that Lys-218, in combination with Lys-217, is involved in deprotonating KH2. According to this model, in the absence of substrates Lys-218(0) is not charged, but Lys-217(+1) is, perhaps because of the proximity of the two lysines to one another. They further suggest that when the Glu substrate approaches the lysine pair, it interacts with Lys-217(+1), thus allowing Lys-218(0) to acquire a proton. Assuming the KH2 is nearby, Lys-218(0) can then remove the hydroxyl proton that starts the pathway to the vitamin K alkoxide, the strong base necessary for carbanion formation, and on to carboxylation of the Glu residue.We interpret our results presented here and those of others described above to support a mechanism that might occur as follows. First, the vitamin K-dependent protein binds to carboxylase through its propeptide. As mentioned above the two lysines (Lys-217 and Lys-218) of carboxylase involved in catalysis are adjacent to one another, allowing one residue to remain uncharged (Lys-218(0)). Therefore, when substrate binds, the glutamate(s) to be carboxylated must not be near Lys-217 and Lys-218. If the glutamate were in proximity to the lysines at this point, then the glutamate with a negative charge and the lysine with a positive charge (Lys-217(+1)) could interact. If that occurred in the absence of KH2, then the free lysine, Lys-218(0), could acquire a proton from solvent and thus not be available to remove the KH2 proton necessary for strong base production. Therefore, to set the stage for glutamate interaction with the active site, propeptide binding must first cause the conformational change that promotes KH2 binding near the lysines. Next KH2 binding supports a conformation that brings the glutamate substrate in proximity to Lys-217(+1) and Lys-218(0). Now through its negative charge, the glutamate residue binds Lys-217(+1), freeing Lys-218(0), which can then abstract the hydroquinone proton from the nearby KH2. Glutamate binding to Lys-217(+1) is essential for a second reason; the glutamate negative charge must be neutralized to make its γ-proton removal energetically favorable (25Davis C.H. Deerfield 2nd, D. Stafford D.W. Pedersen L.G. J. Phys. Chem. 2007; 111: 7257-7261Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). That step is necessary to produce the carbanion precursor of carboxylation. According to Davis et al. (24Davis C.H. Deerfield 2nd, D. Wymore T. Stafford D.W. Pedersen L.G. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2007; 26: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), after removal of the proton from the hydroquinone group on KH2, the rest of the reactions producing γ-carboxyglutamic acid are relatively energetically favorable. IntroductionThe vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase is an endoplasmic reticulum integral membrane enzyme. It post-translationally modifies certain proteins important in several physiologically important areas, including blood coagulation. The modification involves the addition of a carboxyl group to the γ-carbon of glutamic acid residues in the amino portion of the vitamin K-dependent substrate.In addition to the glutamic acid and CO2, which provides the added carboxyl group, other substrates required for the reaction are vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) 4The abbreviations used are: KH2vitamin K1 hydroquinoneMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonatePC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. and oxygen. During carboxylation KH2 is converted to the epoxide; thus carboxylase is also an epoxidase.The primary interaction between carboxylase and most of its protein substrates is through the propeptides of the substrates. Binding is of high affinity, which allows the substrate to bind long enough for multiple carboxylations to occur.In addition to being the primary binding site for carboxylase, the propeptide also exerts an effect on carboxylase catalysis. Factors IX and X and prothrombin propeptides, when bound to carboxylase, increase the activity of the enzyme toward small glutamate-containing substrates (1Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cheung A. Engelke J.A. Sanders C. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem.

Furie B. Jacobs M.R. Vermeer C. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9697-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For the most part these results suggest that the propeptides induce a conformational change or stabilize a more active conformation in the carboxylase active site. The efficiency of the change appears to be similar for the propeptides of prothrombin and factors IX and X. The fact that these propeptides have different sequences implies that the conserved residues control both binding and allosterism. However, even deleting the Phe-16 residue, which is important for binding, only decreases affinity but not stimulation of activity (1Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Thermodynamic arguments indicate that if the propeptide effect has to do with substrate binding, then substrate binding should affect propeptide binding. Presnell et al. (6Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) demonstrated that under catalytic conditions, koff for the propeptide of factor IX was slower than in the absence of catalysis and that the Kd for that peptide was lower under catalytic conditions.

Chem. 2004; 279: 6560-6566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed that Glu-containing peptides stabilize the propeptide-carboxylase complex. There are other reports that seem to imply that other substrate binding events affect the carboxylase conformation and its activity (4Li S. Furie B.C. Furie B. Walsh C.T.

Our goal was to determine the following: 1) Is the wide variation of carboxylase affinity of the propeptides similar in the absence of catalysis as it has been shown to be during catalysis? 2) Is stabilization of the propeptide-carboxylase complex by FLEEL a general phenomenon among propeptides, and do substrates other than FLEEL affect the stability of the complexes alone or in combination? 3) Is the substrate effect on the propeptide-carboxylase complex similar for all propeptides? 4) Is the effect on small substrate carboxylation similar for all propeptides as suggested for the propeptides of factors IX and X and prothrombin? 5) Are there amino acid residues necessary for these functions other than those already recognized as important for binding to carboxylase, and finally, how do these effects contribute to enzyme specificity and/or efficiency?"

We investigated strategies to generate CTLs specific for autologous Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC), the most frequent tumor in mankind, using circulating lymphocytes.Classic Mixed Lymphocyte Tumor Cultures with NSCLC cells consistently failed to induce tumor-specific CTLs. Cross-presentation in vitro of irradiated NSCLC cells by autologous dendritic cells, by contrast, induced specific CTL lines from which we obtained a high number of tumor-specific T cell clones (TCCs). The TCCs displayed a limited TCR diversity, suggesting an origin from few tumor-specific T cell precursors, while their TCR molecular fingerprints were detected in the patient's tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, implying a role in the spontaneous anti-tumor response. Grafting NSCLC-specific TCR into primary allogeneic T cells by lentiviral vectors expressing human V-mouse C chimeric TCRalpha/beta chains overcame the growth limits of these TCCs. The resulting, rapidly expanding CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines stably expressed the grafted chimeric TCR and specifically recognized the original NSCLC.This study defines a strategy to efficiently induce and propagate in vitro T cells specific for NSCLC starting from autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes."
