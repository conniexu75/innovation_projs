https://openalex.org/W2028426093,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a complex spectrum of cellular and molecular characteristics including several dramatic changes in the populations of peripheral leukocytes. These changes include general leukopenia, activation of B and T cells, and maturation of granulocytes. The manifestation of SLE in peripheral blood is central to the disease but is incompletely understood. A technique for rigorously characterizing changes in mixed populations of cells, microarray expression deconvolution, has been applied to several areas of biology but not to SLE or to blood. Here we demonstrate that microarray expression deconvolution accurately quantifies the constituents of real blood samples and mixtures of immune-derived cell lines. We characterize a broad spectrum of peripheral leukocyte cell types and states in SLE to uncover novel patterns including: specific activation of NK and T helper lymphocytes, relationships of these patterns to each other, and correlations to clinical variables and measures. The expansion and activation of monocytes, NK cells, and T helper cells in SLE at least partly underlie this disease's prominent interferon signature. These and other patterns of leukocyte dynamics uncovered here correlate with disease severity and treatment, suggest potential new treatments, and extend our understanding of lupus pathology as a complex autoimmune disease involving many arms of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2157932359,"Human embryonic stem cells have unique value for regenerative medicine, as they are capable of differentiating into a broad variety of cell types. Therefore, defining the signalling pathways that control early cell fate decisions of pluripotent stem cells represents a major task. Moreover, modelling the early steps of embryonic development in vitro may provide the best approach to produce cell types with native properties. Here, we analysed the function of key developmental growth factors such as Activin, FGF and BMP in the control of early cell fate decisions of human pluripotent stem cells. This analysis resulted in the development and validation of chemically defined culture conditions for achieving specification of human embryonic stem cells into neuroectoderm, mesendoderm and into extra-embryonic tissues. Importantly, these defined culture conditions are devoid of factors that could obscure analysis of developmental mechanisms or render the resulting tissues incompatible with future clinical applications. Importantly, the growth factor roles defined using these culture conditions similarly drove differentiation of mouse epiblast stem cells derived from post implantation embryos, thereby reinforcing the hypothesis that epiblast stem cells share a common embryonic identity with human pluripotent stem cells. Therefore the defined growth factor conditions described here represent an essential step toward the production of mature cell types from pluripotent stem cells in conditions fully compatible with clinical use ant also provide a general approach for modelling the early steps of mammalian embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1986453124,"Background Decisions involving risk often must be made under stressful circumstances. Research on behavioral and brain differences in stress responses suggest that stress might have different effects on risk taking in males and females. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, participants played a computer game designed to measure risk taking (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task) fifteen minutes after completing a stress challenge or control task. Stress increased risk taking among men but decreased it among women. Conclusions/Significance Acute stress amplifies sex differences in risk seeking; making women more risk avoidant and men more risk seeking. Evolutionary principles may explain these stress-induced sex differences in risk taking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1983498205,"The persistence of transcriptionally silent but replication-competent HIV-1 reservoirs in Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART)-treated infected individuals, represents a major hurdle to virus eradication. Activation of HIV-1 gene expression in these cells together with an efficient HAART has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy aimed at decreasing the pool of latent viral reservoirs. Using the latently-infected U1 monocytic cell line and latently-infected J-Lat T-cell clones, we here demonstrated a strong synergistic activation of HIV-1 production by clinically used histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) combined with prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting nuclear factor (NF)- kappaB inducer. In J-Lat cells, we showed that this synergism was due, at least partially, to the synergistic recruitment of unresponsive cells into the expressing cell population. A combination of prostratin+HDACI synergistically activated the 5' Long Terminal Repeat (5'LTR) from HIV-1 Major group subtypes representing the most prevalent viral genetic forms, as shown by transient transfection reporter assays. Mechanistically, HDACIs increased prostratin-induced DNA-binding activity of nuclear NF-kappaB and degradation of cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitor, IkappaBalpha . Moreover, the combined treatment prostratin+HDACI caused a more pronounced nucleosomal remodeling in the U1 viral promoter region than the treatments with the compounds alone. This more pronounced remodeling correlated with a synergistic reactivation of HIV-1 transcription following the combined treatment prostratin+HDACI, as demonstrated by measuring recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the 5'LTR and both initiated and elongated transcripts. The physiological relevance of the prostratin+HDACI synergism was shown in CD8(+)-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HAART-treated patients with undetectable viral load. Moreover, this combined treatment reactivated viral replication in resting CD4(+) T cells isolated from similar patients. Our results suggest that combinations of different kinds of proviral activators may have important implications for reducing the size of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in HAART-treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2082983359,"Notch is a transmembrane receptor that controls cell fate decisions during development and tissue homeostasis. Both activation and attenuation of the Notch signal are tightly regulated by endocytosis. The adaptor protein Numb acts as an inhibitor of Notch and is known to function within the intracellular trafficking pathways. However, a role for Numb in regulating Notch trafficking has not been defined. Here we show that mammalian Notch1 is constitutively internalized and trafficked to both recycling and late endosomal compartments, and we demonstrate that changes in Numb expression alter the dynamics of Notch1 trafficking. Overexpression of Numb promotes sorting of Notch1 through late endosomes for degradation, whereas depletion of Numb facilitates Notch1 recycling. Numb mutants that do not interact with the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, Itch, or that lack motifs important for interaction with endocytic proteins fail to promote Notch1 degradation. Our data suggest that Numb inhibits Notch1 activity by regulating post-endocytic sorting events that lead to Notch1 degradation.

Our data suggest that Numb inhibits Notch1 activity by regulating post-endocytic sorting events that lead to Notch1 degradation. The Notch receptor is a heterodimeric, single pass, transmembrane protein that is an integral component of a conserved signaling pathway required for embryonic and postnatal development. Notch signaling controls cell fate decisions, maintenance of stem cells, cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis through direct cell to cell contact (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Transmission of the Notch signal is initiated through binding of the Notch receptor to transmembrane ligands of the Delta/Serrate/Lag2 family expressed on neighboring cells (2Schweisguth F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R129-R138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lai E.C. Development. 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces a sequential series of proteolytic cleavage events leading to a final intramembrane cleavage by the γ-secretase complex that releases the active intracellular domain of Notch (4Kidd S. Lieber T. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). This form of Notch functions within the nucleus as a cotransactivator with the CSL (CBF1/RBPjκ, Suppressor of Hairless Su(H), Lag1) family of transcription factors to modulate transcription of target genes such as Hes1 (the mammalian homologue of the hairy and enhancer of split gene complex in Drosophila) and Herp (Hes-related) genes (6Iso T.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The coordinated processing, endocytosis, and trafficking of the Notch receptor and its ligand are important in controlling Notch activation. Ubiquitin-dependent internalization and recycling of Delta/Serrate/Lag2 ligands have an established role in the activation of Notch signaling (8Seugnet L. Simpson P. Haenlin M. Dev.

In contrast, much less is known regarding the role of endocytosis and trafficking of the Notch receptor itself. Studies to date suggest that endocytosis of Notch is important for ligand-mediated activation of Notch. Monoubiquitination and endocytosis of a constitutively active mutant form of the Notch1 receptor were shown to enhance γ-secretase cleavage and activate downstream signaling events in a mammalian system (20Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israël A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutational analysis in Drosophila showed that entry into the early endosome is necessary for Notch activation (21Vaccari T. Lu H. Kanwar R. Fortini M.E. Bilder D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination and trafficking through the endocytic pathway also play a role in the down-regulation of Notch. A conserved di-leucine sorting motif identified in the cytoplasmic tail of the Caenorhabditis elegans Notch receptor, LIN-12, mediates its constitutive internalization and degradation during vulval development (22Shaye D.D. Greenwald I. Nature. 2002; 420: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). WWP-1, the C. elegans orthologue of the Drosophila ubiquitin ligases Suppressor of Deltex (Su(Dx)) and dNedd4, is required for LIN-12 down-regulation (23Shaye D.D. Greenwald I. Development. 2005; 132: 5081-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in Drosophila both Su(Dx) and dNedd4 act to limit Notch signaling by regulating post-endocytic sorting of Notch (24Wilkin M.B. Carbery A.M. Fostier M. Aslam H. Mazaleyrat S.L. Higgs J.

Matsuno K. Hayashi S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 2228-2236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest that both entry and trafficking of Notch within the endocytic pathway are important in the regulation of its activity. However, the factors involved in sorting Notch into activation or degradative pathways are poorly characterized. Genetic evidence in Drosophila has shown that the adaptor protein Numb acts as an inhibitor of Notch signaling during development of both the peripheral and central nervous systems and during muscle cell differentiation (26Zhong W.

Mammalian Numb orthologues appear to function in a conserved fashion within the mammalian Notch1 pathway (26Zhong W. Feder J.N. Jiang M.M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

For example, overexpression of mammalian Numb antagonizes Notch1-dependent transactivation of the Hes1 promoter (32McGill M.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Both Drosophila and mammalian Numb are asymmetrically localized in dividing precursor cells and are preferentially segregated to one of the two daughter cells upon cell division, thus ensuring cells adopt distinct cell fates, through the suppression of Notch signaling (26Zhong W.

Numb binds to the α-adaptin subunit of the AP-2 complex (clathrin adaptor protein 2) in both Drosophila and mammalian cells (42Santolini E. Puri C. Salcini A.E. Gagliani M.C. Pelicci P.G.

Numb also interacts with EH domain-containing proteins Eps15 and the EHD/RME-1 family of endocytic proteins (41Smith C.A. Dho S.E. Donaldson J. Tepass U. McGlade C.J. Mol. Biol.

In mammalian cells, knockdown of Numb using RNA interference or overexpression of Numb or short fragments of Numb interferes with transmembrane protein endocytosis and trafficking through an unknown mechanism (41Smith C.A.

It has been proposed that Numb suppression of Notch signaling is mediated through AP-2 recruitment and regulation of Notch endocytosis (43Berdnik D. Török T. González-Gaitán M. Knoblich J.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 46Le Borgne R. Bardin A. Schweisguth F.

STKE. 2002; 2002: PE52PubMed Google Scholar), although to date there is no direct evidence to support this model. Previously, we showed that Numb also binds to the Su(Dx) orthologue Itch and cooperates with Itch to enhance the ubiquitination of membrane-associated Notch1 (32McGill M.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23196-23203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), suggesting that Numb might function in a post-endocytic compartment to regulate Notch trafficking. Here we investigate the role of Numb in the ligand-independent endocytosis and trafficking of Notch1. We show that overexpression of Numb promotes Notch1 trafficking and degradation, whereas depletion of Numb facilitates Notch1 recycling.

Full-length mouse Notch1 cDNA (FL-Notch1), containing a single internal Myc epitope tag cloned into the HindIII site between amino acid residues Ala2292 and Ser2293, was subcloned into pcDNA1(+) vector. All Numb mutant constructs were generated from Numbp66 cDNA and cloned into a pEF vector. NumbΔPTBC was generated using PCR-amplified fragments representing amino acids Met1 to Lys85 and Lys174 to the stop codon and fused in-frame to the pEF parental vector. NumbΔC has a deletion of the sequence coding for the 41 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. All cDNAs generated by PCR were verified by sequencing in both directions. Itch cDNAs were the kind gift from G. Gish and T. Pawson. HA-tagged Notch1 cDNA (pBOS HA-N1) has been described previously (15Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Olsen S.L. D'Souza B. Yao C. Weinmaster G. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-NotchIC (06-808, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and rabbit anti-NotchEC (06-809, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) antibodies were used for immunoblots. Rabbit anti-intracellular domain of Notch (2421, Cellular Signaling), goat anti-NotchC20 (sc-6015, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Myc (9E10 ascites), and rabbit anti-HRS antibodies (kind gift of S.

Anti-Numb was generated in rabbits with a synthetic peptide to the carboxyl terminus as described previously (30Dho S.E. French M.B. Woods S.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33097-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Wisent) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and transfected with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pooled transfected cells were replated in individual 6-cm dishes for time course experiments. C2C12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% calf serum. C2C12 cells that stably express full-length, HA-tagged Notch1 were grown in 10% FBS and 5% calf serum supplemented with 2 μg/ml puromycin. C2C12 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) using 3 μg of cDNA per 6-well dish and 12 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Equal numbers of pooled transfected cells were replated in individual 6-cm dishes. Cells were used 18 to 24 h post-transfection. For siRNA silencing experiments, two 21-nucleotide siRNA oligomers (Dharmacon Research) were designed to regions corresponding to the Numb coding sequence (GCACCUGCCCAGUGGAUCC) and 3′-untranslated region sequence (GUAGCACAUUGCAACAACA). The Scramble II duplex from Dharmacon (D-001205-20) was used as a negative control for siRNA activity. Only C2C12 cells were used for siRNA experiments because significant knockdown of endogenous Numb could not be achieved in HEK293T cells. Overexpression or depletion of Numb was confirmed by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-Numb. Transfected cells grown to 70% confluency were cooled on ice for 30 min, washed with cold PBS, and then labeled with EZ-Link NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in biotinylation buffer (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 4 °C. After two washes with cold PBS, cells were incubated with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 100 mm glycine for 5 min on ice to quench unconjugated biotin and washed several times with cold PBS. One sample plate was removed and lysed in PLC lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride containing COMPLETE protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)) to measure total surface biotinylation. A second sample plate was also removed to determine the efficiency of removal of biotinyl groups on the cell surface by three 20-min treatments with 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MeSNa) in pre-chilled stripping buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.6) at 4 °C. The remaining samples were then incubated at 37 °C in pre-warmed DMEM containing 10% FBS over 30 min. At indicated time points, cells were washed in cold PBS and stripped of surface biotin in MeSNa stripping buffer (as described above). Cells were then lysed and protein lysates quantitated. Equal amounts of protein lysate were mixed with immobilized streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C to isolate biotinylated proteins and then washed three times in Nonidet P-40 wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40). The bed volume was removed with a 30-gauge needle before resuspending in SDS-Laemmli sample buffer. Recovered biotinylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using indicated antibodies. In all experiments, whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot to examine FL-Notch and Numb expression. For internalization experiments, cells were labeled with biotin as described above and incubated at 18 °C in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6. Shifting cells to 18 °C results in an accumulation of endocytosed proteins in early or sorting endosomes in many cell types (49Sorkin A. Krolenko S. Kudrjavtceva N. Lazebnik J. Teslenko L.

At indicated time points cells were MeSNA-stripped, lysed in PLC lysis buffer, and intracellular biotinylated Notch examined using streptavidin-Sepharose beads as described above. For recycling assays, biotinylated cells were incubated at 18 °C for 2 h in DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 10% FBS to accumulate internalized biotinylated surface proteins, and then MeSNa-stripped as described above. After washing with cold PBS, cells were shifted to 37 °C to resume trafficking. At the indicated time points, one set of cells was stripped of surface biotin and lysed, and a second set was incubated in stripping buffer without MeSNA and then lysed. Intracellular pools of biotinylated protein were examined as described above. For protein quantification, protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and signals quantified by densitometric scanning using an Alpha Innotech Fluorochem 8000 imaging system. Data were acquired using the Alpha Innotech Fluorochem 8000 software and exported to Excel (Microsoft) for analysis. All statistical analysis comparisons were done with Student's t test in Excel. For subcellular localization studies, HEK293T and C2C12 cells were plated onto poly-l-ornithine-coated glass coverslips 18 h before use. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing Ca2+ and 30 mm sucrose for 20 min at room temperature, washed with 100 mm glycine in PBS/Ca2+ for 10 min, and then permeabilized for 10 min with either 0.2% Triton X-100 or 0.05% saponin in PBS/Ca2+. After several washes in PBS, cells were blocked with 3% normal donkey serum in PBS/Ca2+ for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking serum for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed five times for 5 min in PBS/Ca2+ and primary antibodies indirectly labeled for 30 min at 37 °C as follows: Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, and Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:500; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were washed with PBS and mounted in DAKO mounting medium. Cells were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca AG CCD camera and spinning disk confocal scan head. Volocity software was used to acquire and analyze images. Figures were made using Adobe Photoshop digital image software (San Jose, CA). To label the late endosomal/lysosomal cell compartment, cells were incubated overnight in normal growth media containing 10 μg/ml FITC-conjugated 70-kDa dextran (Molecular Probes) followed by a 2-h chase period in dextran-free media containing anti-HA. Cells expressing HA-N1, grown on polyornithine-coated coverslips (∼50% confluent), were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated anti-HA (1:1000) in growth media for 30 min. After cooling on ice and washing with cold growth media, anti-mouse IgG-binding sites on cell surface Alexa488 anti-HA were blocked by incubation with excess unlabeled anti-mouse (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and then re-warmed to 37 °C in growth media between 0 and 30 min. Alexa488 anti-HA that had re-inserted into the plasma membrane during this incubation period was identified by incubation with Cy3-labeled anti-mouse (1:500) at 4 °C for 15 min followed by washing and fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were imaged using a 25× water objective (0.8 NA) and spinning disk confocal microscope as described above. The total cellular, endocytosed HA-Notch1 (Alexa488 anti-HA fluorescence intensity) and cell surface Alexa488 anti-HA labeled HA-N1 (Cy3-α mouse fluorescence intensity) were quantified using the measurement functions of Volocity imaging software. To examine constitutive Notch1 receptor trafficking, we measured the internalization and subsequent trafficking of surface-labeled endogenous Notch1 in C2C12 cells. Subconfluent C2C12 cells were surface-labeled with biotin at 4 °C and then incubated at 37 °C to allow internalization and post-endocytic trafficking of biotinylated Notch1. At specific time points, the cells were treated with MeSNa to remove any biotin label on proteins remaining at the cell surface. Intracellular biotinylated Notch1 protein was recovered with streptavidin beads and quantified by Western blot analysis using anti-Notch1 antibodies. Biotinylation of both subunits of the Notch1 heterodimer was observed confirming that the processed Notch1 receptor is present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Following incubation at 37 °C, a steady increase in intracellular biotinylated Notch1 was observed (Fig. 1A, lower panel) indicating that endogenous Notch1 is constitutively internalized from the cell surface. A similar analysis of HEK293T cells expressing the full-length Notch1 receptor (FL-Notch1) was also performed. In HEK293T cells, both subunits of the Notch1 heterodimer were biotinylated at the plasma membrane indicating that ectopically expressed Notch1 is processed and present at the cell surface (Fig. 1B, upper and lower panels, respectively). Similar to endogenous Notch1 in C2C12 cells, biotinylated FL-Notch1 was endocytosed and accumulated intracellularly in 293T cells (Fig. 1B) demonstrating that both endogenous and ectopically expressed Notch1 are constitutively trafficked. To examine post-endocytic trafficking of Notch1, HEK293T cells expressing FL-Notch1 were labeled with biotin at 4 °C and then incubated at 18 °C to allow internalization of biotinylated FL-Notch1 from the plasma membrane under conditions that block recycling to the cell surface. Cells were then treated with MeSNa to remove biotin at the cell surface and returned to 37 °C to resume trafficking. At the indicated time points, cells were either lysed to examine the total amount of biotinylated protein or treated a second time with MeSNa before lysis to remove biotin from proteins that had returned to the cell surface. A steady loss in the intracellular pool of biotinylated FL-Notch1, with almost complete loss after 30 min, was observed (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 and lanes 2–4, lower panel) suggesting that internalized FL-Notch1 was either being returned to the cell surface or degraded. To assess FL-Notch1 degradation, the rate of change in the total amount of biotinylated FL-Notch1 was measured in cells shifted to 37 °C but not stripped of surface biotin a second time. Under these experimental conditions, the total amount of biotinylated FL-Notch1 remained relatively unchanged at 5 min (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 and lane 2, upper panel) suggesting that the loss of biotinylated FL-Notch1 from the intracellular pool at 5 min is the result of recycling to the cell surface. However, by 30 min the total cellular, biotinylated FL-Notch1 had decreased suggesting that a portion of biotinylated FL-Notch1 is targeted for degradation at later times. A similar trend was observed when an antibody against the extracellular domain of the FL-Notch heterodimer (Fig. 1D) was used, indicating that the intact receptor is constitutively trafficked. We used immunocytochemistry and antibody uptake experiments to further investigate the constitutive internalization and trafficking of Notch1 toward a degradative pathway or recycling to the plasma membrane. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pBOS HA-N1, which encodes full-length Notch1 with an extracellular amino-terminal HA tag (15Nichols J.T. Miyamoto A. Olsen S.L. D'Souza B. Yao C.

https://openalex.org/W1970785350,"Morphine is a powerful analgesic natural product produced by the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. Although formal syntheses of this alkaloid have been reported, the morphine molecule contains five stereocenters and a C-C phenol linkage that to date render a total synthesis of morphine commercially unfeasible. The C-C phenol-coupling reaction along the biosynthetic pathway to morphine in opium poppy is catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase salutaridine synthase. We report herein on the identification of salutaridine synthase as a member of the CYP719 family of cytochromes P450 during a screen of recombinant cytochromes P450 of opium poppy functionally expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells. Recombinant CYP719B1 is a highly stereo- and regioselective enzyme; of forty-one compounds tested as potential substrates, only (R)-reticuline and (R)-norreticuline resulted in formation of a product (salutaridine and norsalutaridine, respectively). To date, CYP719s have been characterized catalyzing only the formation of a methylenedioxy bridge in berberine biosynthesis (canadine synthase, CYP719A1) and in benzo[c]phenanthridine biosynthesis (stylopine synthase, CYP719A14). Previously identified phenol-coupling enzymes of plant alkaloid biosynthesis belong only to the CYP80 family of cytochromes. CYP719B1 therefore is the prototype for a new family of plant cytochromes P450 that catalyze formation of a phenol-couple."
https://openalex.org/W2021645796,"Background Dopamine and dopamine transporters (DAT, which regulate extracellular dopamine in the brain) are implicated in the modulation of attention but their specific roles are not well understood. Here we hypothesized that dopamine modulates attention by facilitation of brain deactivation in the default mode network (DMN). Thus, higher striatal DAT levels, which would result in an enhanced clearance of dopamine and hence weaker dopamine signals, would be associated to lower deactivation in the DMN during an attention task. Methodology/Principal Findings For this purpose we assessed the relationship between DAT in striatum (measured with positron emission tomography and [11C]cocaine used as DAT radiotracer) and brain activation and deactivation during a parametric visual attention task (measured with blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging) in healthy controls. We show that DAT availability in caudate and putamen had a negative correlation with deactivation in ventral parietal regions of the DMN (precuneus, BA 7) and a positive correlation with deactivation in a small region in the ventral anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 24/32). With increasing attentional load, DAT in caudate showed a negative correlation with load-related deactivation increases in precuneus. Conclusions/Significance These findings provide evidence that dopamine transporters modulate neural activity in the DMN and anterior cingulate gyrus during visuospatial attention. Our findings suggest that dopamine modulates attention in part by regulating neuronal activity in posterior parietal cortex including precuneus (region involved in alertness) and cingulate gyrus (region deactivated in proportion to emotional interference). These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of stimulant medications (increase dopamine by blocking DAT) in inattention reflect in part their ability to facilitate the deactivation of the DMN."
https://openalex.org/W2041602058,"The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is essential for the pathogenesis and transmission of prion diseases. PrP(C) is bound to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, although a secreted, soluble form has also been identified. Previously we reported that PrP(C) is subject to ectodomain shedding from the membrane by zinc metalloproteinases with a similar inhibition profile to those involved in shedding the amyloid precursor protein. Here we have used gain-of-function (overexpression) and loss-of-function (small interfering RNA knockdown) experiments in cells to identify the ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases) involved in the ectodomain shedding of PrP(C). These experiments revealed that ADAM9 and ADAM10, but not ADAM17, are involved in the shedding of PrP(C) and that ADAM9 exerts its effect on PrP(C) shedding via ADAM10. Using dominant negative, catalytically inactive mutants, we show that the catalytic activity of ADAM9 is required for its effect on ADAM10. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that ADAM10, but not ADAM9, cleaved PrP between Gly(228) and Arg(229), three residues away from the site of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The shedding of another membrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein beta-secretase BACE1, by ADAM9 is also mediated via ADAM10. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PrP(C) shedding or activation of both PrP(C) and PrP(Sc) shedding by ADAM10 overexpression in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma N2a cells does not alter the formation of proteinase K-resistant PrP(Sc). Collectively, these data indicate that although PrP(C) can be shed through the action of ADAM family members, modulation of PrP(C) or PrP(Sc) ectodomain shedding does not regulate prion conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2121689499,"Here we report the complete genome sequence of Teredinibacter turnerae T7901. T. turnerae is a marine gamma proteobacterium that occurs as an intracellular endosymbiont in the gills of wood-boring marine bivalves of the family Teredinidae (shipworms). This species is the sole cultivated member of an endosymbiotic consortium thought to provide the host with enzymes, including cellulases and nitrogenase, critical for digestion of wood and supplementation of the host's nitrogen-deficient diet. T. turnerae is closely related to the free-living marine polysaccharide degrading bacterium Saccharophagus degradans str. 2-40 and to as yet uncultivated endosymbionts with which it coexists in shipworm cells. Like S. degradans, the T. turnerae genome encodes a large number of enzymes predicted to be involved in complex polysaccharide degradation (>100). However, unlike S. degradans, which degrades a broad spectrum (>10 classes) of complex plant, fungal and algal polysaccharides, T. turnerae primarily encodes enzymes associated with deconstruction of terrestrial woody plant material. Also unlike S. degradans and many other eubacteria, T. turnerae dedicates a large proportion of its genome to genes predicted to function in secondary metabolism. Despite its intracellular niche, the T. turnerae genome lacks many features associated with obligate intracellular existence (e.g. reduced genome size, reduced %G+C, loss of genes of core metabolism) and displays evidence of adaptations common to free-living bacteria (e.g. defense against bacteriophage infection). These results suggest that T. turnerae is likely a facultative intracellular ensosymbiont whose niche presently includes, or recently included, free-living existence. As such, the T. turnerae genome provides insights into the range of genomic adaptations associated with intracellular endosymbiosis as well as enzymatic mechanisms relevant to the recycling of plant materials in marine environments and the production of cellulose-derived biofuels."
https://openalex.org/W1993885330,"Background Schizophrenia is a severe disabling brain disease affecting about 1% of the population. Individual microRNAs (miRNAs) affect moderate downregulation of gene expression. In addition, components required for miRNA processing and/or function have also been implicated in X-linked mental retardation, neurological and neoplastic diseases, pointing to the wide ranging involvement of miRNAs in disease. Methods and Findings To explore the role of miRNAs in schizophrenia, 59 microRNA genes on the X-chromosome were amplified and sequenced in males with (193) and without (191) schizophrenia spectrum disorders to test the hypothesis that ultra-rare mutations in microRNA collectively contribute to the risk of schizophrenia. Here we provide the first association of microRNA gene dysfunction with schizophrenia. Eight ultra-rare variants in the precursor or mature miRNA were identified in eight distinct miRNA genes in 4% of analyzed males with schizophrenia. One ultra-rare variant was identified in a control sample (with a history of depression) (8/193 versus 1/191, p = 0.02 by one-sided Fisher's exact test, odds ratio = 8.2). These variants were not found in an additional 7,197 control X-chromosomes. Conclusions Functional analyses of ectopically expressed copies of the variant miRNA precursors demonstrate loss of function, gain of function or altered expression levels. While confirmation is required, this study suggests that microRNA mutations can contribute to schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2000253660,"The length of the endogenous period of the human circadian clock (tau) is slightly greater than 24 hours. There are individual differences in tau, which influence the phase angle of entrainment to the light/dark (LD) cycle, and in doing so contribute to morningness-eveningness. We have recently reported that tau measured in subjects living on an ultradian LD cycle averaged 24.2 hours, and is similar to tau measured using different experimental methods. Here we report racial differences in tau. Subjects lived on an ultradian LD cycle (1.5 hours sleep, 2.5 hours wake) for 3 days. Circadian phase assessments were conducted before and after the ultradian days to determine the change in circadian phase, which was attributed to tau. African American subjects had a significantly shorter tau than subjects of other races. We also tested for racial differences in our previous circadian phase advancing and phase delaying studies. In the phase advancing study, subjects underwent 4 days of a gradually advancing sleep schedule combined with a bright light pulse upon awakening each morning. In the phase delaying study, subjects underwent 4 days of a gradually delaying sleep schedule combined with evening light pulses before bedtime. African American subjects had larger phase advances and smaller phase delays, relative to Caucasian subjects. The racial differences in tau and circadian phase shifting have important implications for understanding normal phase differences between individuals, for developing solutions to the problems of jet lag and shift work, and for the diagnosis and treatment of circadian rhythm based sleep disorders such as advanced and delayed sleep phase disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2059417998,"Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a mechanism of energy dissipation in higher plants protects photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers from damage by excess light. NPQ involves a reduction in the chlorophyll excited state lifetime in the PSII harvesting antenna (LHCII) by a quencher. Yet, little is known about the effect of the quencher on chlorophyll excited state energy and dynamics. Application of picosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that NPQ involves a red-shift (60 ± 5 cm−1) and slight enhancement of the vibronic satellite of the main PSII lifetime component present in intact chloroplasts. Whereas this fluorescence red-shift was enhanced by the presence of zeaxanthin, it was not dependent upon it. The red-shifted fluorescence of intact chloroplasts in the NPQ state was accompanied by red-shifted chlorophyll a absorption. Nearly identical absorption and fluorescence changes were observed in isolated LHCII complexes quenched in a low detergent media, suggesting that the mechanism of quenching is the same in both systems. In both cases, the extent of the fluorescence red-shift was shown to correlate with the lifetime of a component. The alteration in the energy of the emitting chlorophyll(s) in intact chloroplasts and isolated LHCII was also accompanied by changes in lutein 1 observed in their 77K fluorescence excitation spectra.

Both the proposed zeaxanthin- and lutein-quenching mechanisms assume very close (van der Waals) contact between the quenching xanthophyll and chlorophyll.

Acta. 1991; 1059: 355-360Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22.Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 23.Miloslavina Y. Wehner A. Lambrev P.H. Wientjes E. Reus M. Garab G. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that such associates have red-shifted absorption and fluorescence spectra. Low temperature (77K) fluorescence spectra of quenched LHCII aggregates possess a 20-nm red-shifted band, F700 (22.Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which was also detected in leaves and thylakoids frozen in the NPQ state (21.Ruban A.V. Rees D. Noctor G.D. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 355-360Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24.Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The F700 emitting chlorophylls appeared to possess very little or no absorption, indicating they may arise from chlorophyll-chlorophyll excitonic interactions (22.Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Later, low temperature (77K) time-resolved fluorescence spectra demonstrated F700 was one of several red-shifted bands present in aggregated LHCII, however, because they all possessed much longer lifetimes than the main F680 band it was considered unlikely that they could act as quenchers (25.Mullineaux C.W. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Holzwarth A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 23-28Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26.Vasil'ev S. Irrgang K.D. Schrötter T. Bergmann A. Eichler H.J. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7503-7512Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, the most red-shifted of these bands, F700, was absent in non-aggregated LHCII quenched in a gel media (15.Ilioaia C. Johnson M.P. Horton P. Ruban A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29505-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). F700 was therefore suggested to reflect intersubunit LHCII chlorophyll interactions rather than being directly related the quencher (15.Ilioaia C. Johnson M.P. Horton P. Ruban A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29505-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). While the latter study did not exclude the event of LHCII aggregation during NPQ formation, it did demonstrate that an intrinsic change in pigment interactions rather than protein aggregation per se is the cause of quenching. Nonetheless, a small red-shift of both the chlorophyll a absorption and fluorescence emission at room temperature was still observed and found to be in good correlation with the strength of quenching (15.Ilioaia C. Johnson M.P. Horton P. Ruban A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29505-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of NPQ on chlorophyll excited state energy and dynamics we have undertaken a combined time-resolved and steady state spectroscopic study on isolated intact chloroplasts. Common quenching-induced features were found in the time-resolved and excitation fluorescence spectra in both chloroplasts and LHCII, suggesting a common mechanism of quenching involving changes in the environment of the emitting chlorophyll(s) and lutein 1. Spinach plants were grown for 8–9 weeks in Sanyo plant growth cabinets with an 8-h photoperiod at a light intensity of 250 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 and a day/night temperature of 22/18 °C. Intact chloroplasts were prepared as described by Crouchman et al. (27.Crouchman S. Ruban A. Horton P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts devoid of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin (−Zea) were prepared from spinach leaves dark adapted for 1 h. Chloroplasts enriched in zeaxanthin (+Zea) were prepared from leaves pretreated for 30 min at 350 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 under 98% N2, 2% O2. Chlorophyll concentration was determined according to the method of Porra et al. (28.Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Spinach trimeric LHCIIb was isolated as previously described in Ruban et al. (29.Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). LHCII was desalted in a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) and 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Quenched LHCII was prepared by removal of detergent by SM-2 bioabsorbent beads (Bio-Rad) allowing for a 10-time reduction in fluorescence yield as determined by a PAM-101 fluorometer (Heinz Walz). Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured with a Dual-PAM-100 chlorophyll fluorescence photosynthesis analyzer (Heinz Walz) using the liquid cell adapter. Intact chloroplasts were measured in a quartz cuvette at a concentration of 12 μm chlorophyll under continuous stirring in the presence of 100 μm methyl viologen as a terminal electron acceptor. Actinic illumination (350 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) was provided by arrays of 635 nm LEDs. Fo (the fluorescence level with PSII reaction centers open) was measured in the presence of a 10 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 measuring beam. The maximum fluorescence in the dark-adapted state (Fm), during the course of actinic illumination (Fm′) and in the subsequent dark relaxation periods was determined using a 0.8-s saturating light pulse (4000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). The quantum yield of PSII was defined as ((Fm-Fo)/Fm) and NPQ as ((Fm-Fm′)/Fm′). Pigment composition was determined by reversed phase HPLC using a LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (Merck) and a Dionex Summit chromatography system as previously described (30.Johnson M.P. Havaux M. Triantaphylidès C. Ksas B. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Davison P.A. Ruban A.V. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22605-22618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Pigments were extracted from LHCII or chloroplasts with and without zeaxanthin/antheraxanthin following induction and subsequent recovery of NPQ as described above. The results of pigment analysis are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Absorption changes in the 610–740-nm region were measured using a SLM DW2000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. LHCII and +Zea chloroplasts were measured in a quartz cuvette at a chlorophyll concentration of 4 μm under continuous stirring. The instrument slit width was 1 nm, and the scan rate was 1 nm s−1. Room temperature fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on leaves and intact chloroplasts (4 μm chlorophyll) between 600 and 800 nm using a Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-3 spectrophotometer. Excitation was defined at 435 nm with a 5-nm spectral bandwidth. The light intensity was 100 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. The fluorescence spectral resolution was 1 nm. Low temperature fluorescence excitation spectra of LHCII and intact chloroplasts (4 μm chlorophyll) were detected at 680 nm (isolated LHCII) or 685 nm (chloroplasts) with a 4-nm spectral bandwidth. The excitation spectral resolution was 1 nm. Spectra were normalized at 380 nm. Time-correlated single photon counting measurements were performed using a FluoTime 200 ps fluorometer (PicoQuant). Fluorescence lifetime decay kinetics were measured on LHCII and intact chloroplasts (4 μm chlorophyll) using excitation provided by a 470-nm laser diode using a 10 MHz repetition rate. These settings were carefully chosen to be far below the onset of singlet-singlet exciton annihilation (<0.1 pJ). Fluorescence was detected at 680 nm (isolated LHCII) or 685 nm (chloroplasts) with a 1-nm slit width. The instrument response function was ∼50 ps. Time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) were measured in the 655–760-nm detection region with 1-nm steps. The resolution of the time-to-amplitude converter was 4 ps/channel. For lifetime analysis, FluoFit software (PicoQuant) was used. The quality of the fits was judged by the χ2 parameter (supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, the autocorrelation function of the weighted residual data were obtained as a measure of the correlation between residuals in distinct channels separated by various times (supplemental Fig. S1B). Because the residual values should be normally distributed in a good fit (not correlated) the autocorrelation data are randomly distributed around zero and their fluctuations are small (supplemental Fig. S1B). In addition a support plane analysis was performed (supplemental Fig. S1C) by calculating the χ2 as a function of each single parameter to estimate the region of the function below the tolerance level. This analysis is useful for verification of the number of components and possible localization of additional components missed by the fitting procedure. The components of the support plane analysis (functions χ2/χ2min) were found to be symmetric indicting that the number of components found by the fitting procedure was correct. Fig. 1A shows typical chlorophyll fluorescence induction traces measured on isolated intact chloroplasts possessing violaxanthin as the only xanthophyll cycle carotenoid (−Zea) (NPQ = 0.9 ± 0.1) and those enriched in zeaxanthin (+Zea) (NPQ = 2.45 ± 0.2), illuminated for 5 min at 350 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. The levels of reversible NPQ in these chloroplasts match those found in leaves (20.Johnson M.P. Pérez-Bueno M.L. Zia A. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Following induction of NPQ, the quenching could be sustained in the dark by the addition of 3% (v/v) of a protein cross-linker, glutaraldehyde, 10 s prior to removing the actinic illumination. A similar technique has previously been used to sustain NPQ present in cyanobacteria (31.Scott M. McCollum C. Vasil'ev S. Crozier C. Espie G.S. Krol M. Huner N.P. Bruce D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8952-8958Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The absence of NPQ relaxation was confirmed by application of saturating light pulses (Fig. 1A, trace 3). When administered to chloroplasts prior to the onset of actinic illumination glutaraldehyde greatly slowed the rate of fluorescence quenching and prevented formation of any rapidly relaxing NPQ (Fig. 1A, trace 4). However, in the presence of a lower actinic light intensity (100 μmol of photons m−2 s−1), which was just sufficient to reach the maximum level of fluorescence (Fm), no quenching was observed (Fig. 1A, trace 5). Glutaraldehyde was therefore used to prevent the reversal of NPQ or to sustain the Fm level of fluorescence in the absence of quenching, allowing measurement of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectra in the Fm and NPQ states. The alternative use of an uncoupler, nigericin, to sustain Fm (preventing any NPQ formation) and lowering the pH of the chloroplast incubation medium from 7.6 to 5.2 to prevent relaxation of the NPQ state (32.Rees D. Noctor G. Ruban A.V. Crofts J. Young A.J. Horton P. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 31: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), gave similar results to those obtained with glutaraldehyde (data not shown). The use of 3-(3′,4′-dichlorophenyl)-l,l-dimethylurea (DCMU) to close PSII reaction centers was avoided due to the well known quenching effect of oxidized plastoquinone, which could affect the Fm lifetime. Fig. 1B shows the fluorescence spectra of dilute chloroplasts and those of spinach and Arabidopsis leaves. It is very clear that the chlorophyll concentration in leaves is too high for detection of the correct fluorescence spectrum, which in turn is essential for obtaining not only steady-state but also time-resolved fluorescence spectra (see below). Reabsorption reduces dramatically the PSII fluorescence intensity at 685 nm, causes a red shift of this band but leaves almost unchanged its vibronic satellite band around 740 nm. A small amount of PSI fluorescence, peaking at around 720 nm, also contributes in this region (Fig. 1B, clearly seen as a broad shoulder in Spinach leaf spectrum). The absorption spectra in the chlorophyll QY region of intact chloroplasts were measured in the Fm and NPQ states. The NPQ-−-Fm absorption difference spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. It resembles remarkably closely the aggregated-−-trimeric LHCII difference spectrum (Fig. 2). Both spectra possessed a major positive band in the 684–687-nm region, a minor band at 660 nm and two negative bands at 675 and 647–652 nm. The emergence of similar absorption red-shift both in vitro and in vivo suggests that quenching in both systems has a selective effect on chlorophyll a. To narrow down the identification of the chlorophyll pigments involved in the shift it was important to perform fluorescence spectral measurements, reflecting the state of only the emitting pigments. Fig. 3A displays reabsorption-free room temperature fluorescence spectra of intact chloroplasts in the Fm and NPQ states. Fluorescence emission in +Zea chloroplasts in the NPQ state is red-shifted relative to the Fm state by ∼1.5 nm and there is a slight enhancement of the vibronic satellite in the 710–760 nm region. Similar, albeit smaller, changes were observed in the −Zea chloroplasts in the NPQ state (Fig. 3A). Zeaxanthin seems to enhance both the NPQ and the extent of the fluorescence red-shift in chloroplasts. Fig. 3B shows the fluorescence spectra of 10 times quenched LHCII aggregates in comparison to unquenched trimeric LHCII. As in intact chloroplasts, quenching resulted in a clear red-shift (∼2.5 nm) of the fluorescence emission and enhancement of the vibronic satellite. These changes are very different from those induced by the denaturation of the complex induced by high temperature or detergent treatment (Ref. 15 and supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, the observed spectral alterations induced by quenching were completely reversible (15.Ilioaia C. Johnson M.P. Horton P. Ruban A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29505-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). LHCII is the major contributor to the room temperature fluorescence of intact chloroplasts due to the shallowness of the PSII reaction center trap, its excitation diffusion limited kinetics and the relative size of the peripheral antenna (∼250 chlorophylls) compared with the CP43/47 core antenna (∼36 chlorophylls) (33.Broess K. Trinkunas G. van der Weij-de Wit C.D. Dekker J.P. van Hoek A. van Amerongen H. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 3776-3786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the enhancement of the vibronic satellite in isolated chloroplasts is likely to be due, at least in part, to an increased relative contribution from photosystem I (PSI) fluorescence particularly at ∼720 nm, because of quenching of PSII fluorescence. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were used to separate different spectral components of the chloroplast emission, find those associated with the NPQ state, and determine whether they possess the red-shifted fluorescence and enhanced vibronic satellite. Fig. 4 displays the fluorescence decay profiles of both intact chloroplasts (A) and isolated LHCII complexes (B). To our knowledge, these are the first time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) kinetics ever shown for intact chloroplasts. Indeed, while the published time-resolved fluorescence experiments on thylakoids have shown an NPQ of less than 0.5 (34.Wagner B. Goss R. Richter M. Wild A. Holzwarth A.R. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1996; 36: 339-350Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35.Richter M. Goss R. Wagner B. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12718-12726Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), here we present the decay kinetics corresponding to NPQ levels up to 2.6, i.e. nearly 5 times higher than previously reported. The intensity weighted average fluorescence lifetime in −Zea chloroplasts was 2.14 ± 0.1 ns. The presence of zeaxanthin caused a distinct reduction of the average lifetime to 1.63 ± 0.1 ns (Fig. 4A). Both the Fm lifetime and the average lifetime reduction as a result of violaxanthin de-epoxidation are consistent with previous reports (20.Johnson M.P. Pérez-Bueno M.L. Zia A. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36.Gilmore A.M. Hazlett T.L. Govindjee Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13582-13593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the presence of NPQ the average lifetime was reduced to 1.1 ± 0.1 ns in −Zea chloroplasts and 0.58 ± 0.05 ns in +Zea chloroplasts (Fig. 4A). The average fluorescence lifetime in isolated trimeric LHCII was 4.1 ± 0.2 ns, which was quenched to 0.4 ± 0.1 ns in aggregated LHCII (Fig. 4B). Fig. 5 shows the results of a lifetime component analysis for the fluorescence decay of intact −Zea and +Zea chloroplasts in comparison to the components of isolated trimeric and aggregated LHCII. Three components were resolved in the chloroplast fluorescence decay. An additional longer component of ∼3.0–3.5 ns, reported in several studies on thylakoids (34.Wagner B. Goss R. Richter M. Wild A. Holzwarth A.R. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1996; 36: 339-350Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35.Richter M. Goss R. Wagner B. Holzwarth A.R.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11046-11054Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was absent in intact chloroplasts, consistent with measurements on leaves (40.Moise N. Moya I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1657: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is possible that this longer lifetime is caused by detergent effects/osmotic shock in the isolated thylakoids and PSII particles used in these studies. Another component of 1.26 ± 0.1 ns in our studies had a ∼30% smaller amplitude than the 2.4 ± 0.2 ns one (Fig. 5A). The two separate PSII lifetime components may arise from some heterogeneity in antenna size and/or state. The shorter 350–500 ps PSII lifetime component, sometimes reported in the literature (34.Wagner B. Goss R. Richter M. Wild A. Holzwarth A.R. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

https://openalex.org/W2139570884,"Background Acute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the public health importance, little is known about the etiology of these acute respiratory illnesses in many regions of South America. In 2006, the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) initiated a collaboration to characterize the viral agents associated with ILI and to describe the clinical and epidemiological presentation of the affected population. Methodology/Principal Findings Patients with ILI (fever ≥38°C and cough or sore throat) were evaluated in clinics and hospitals in 13 Peruvian cities representative of the four main regions of the country. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, as well as epidemiological and demographic data, were collected from each patient. During the two years of this study (June 2006 through May 2008), a total of 6,835 patients, with a median age of 13 years, were recruited from 31 clinics and hospitals; 6,308 were enrolled by regular passive surveillance and 527 were enrolled as part of outbreak investigations. At least one respiratory virus was isolated from the specimens of 2,688 (42.6%) patients, with etiologies varying by age and geographical region. Overall the most common viral agents isolated were influenza A virus (25.1%), influenza B virus (9.7%), parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, (HPIV-1,-2,-3; 3.2%), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 2.6%), and adenoviruses (1.8%). Genetic analyses of influenza virus isolates demonstrated that three lineages of influenza A H1N1, one lineage of influenza A H3N2, and two lineages of influenza B were circulating in Peru during the course of this study. Conclusions To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive study to date of the etiologic agents associated with ILI in Peru. These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory pathogens are circulating in Peru and this fact needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients reporting with ILI. Furthermore, these data have implications for influenza vaccine design and implementation in South America."
https://openalex.org/W2138508337,"Understanding the structural and assembly dynamics of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has direct relevance to the development of therapeutic agents for Alzheimer disease. To elucidate these dynamics, we combined scanning amino acid substitution with a method for quantitative determination of the Abeta oligomer frequency distribution, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP), to perform ""scanning PICUP."" Tyr, a reactive group in PICUP, was substituted at position 1, 10, 20, 30, or 40 (for Abeta40) or 42 (for Abeta42). The effects of these substitutions were probed using circular dichroism spectroscopy, thioflavin T binding, electron microscopy, PICUP, and mass spectrometry. All peptides displayed a random coil --> alpha/beta --> beta transition, but substitution-dependent alterations in assembly kinetics and conformer complexity were observed. Tyr(1)-substituted homologues of Abeta40 and Abeta42 assembled the slowest and yielded unusual patterns of oligomer bands in gel electrophoresis experiments, suggesting oligomer compaction had occurred. Consistent with this suggestion was the observation of relatively narrow [Tyr(1)]Abeta40 fibrils. Substitution of Abeta40 at the C terminus decreased the population conformational complexity and substantially extended the highest order of oligomers observed. This latter effect was observed in both Abeta40 and Abeta42 as the Tyr substitution position number increased. The ability of a single substitution (Tyr(1)) to alter Abeta assembly kinetics and the oligomer frequency distribution suggests that the N terminus is not a benign peptide segment, but rather that Abeta conformational dynamics and assembly are affected significantly by the competition between the N and C termini to form a stable complex with the central hydrophobic cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1967760762,"Despite overwhelming evidence implicating the prion protein (PrP) in prion disease pathogenesis, the normal function of this cell surface glycoprotein remains unclear. In previous reports we demonstrated that PrP mediates cellular iron uptake and transport, and aggregation of PrP to the disease causing PrP-scrapie (PrPSc) form results in imbalance of iron homeostasis in prion disease affected human and animal brains. Here, we show that selective deletion of PrP in transgenic mice (PrPKO) alters systemic iron homeostasis as reflected in hematological parameters and levels of total iron and iron regulatory proteins in the plasma, liver, spleen, and brain of PrPKO mice relative to matched wild type controls. Introduction of radiolabeled iron (59FeCl3) to Wt and PrPKO mice by gastric gavage reveals inefficient transport of 59Fe from the duodenum to the blood stream, an early abortive spike of erythropoiesis in the long bones and spleen, and eventual decreased 59Fe content in red blood cells and all major organs of PrPKO mice relative to Wt controls. The iron deficient phenotype of PrPKO mice is reversed by expressing Wt PrP in the PrPKO background, demonstrating a functional role for PrP in iron uptake and transport. Since iron is required for essential metabolic processes and is also potentially toxic if mismanaged, these results suggest that loss of normal function of PrP due to aggregation to the PrPSc form induces imbalance of brain iron homeostasis, resulting in disease associated neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1974944381,"Background The DAZ family genes boule, daz and dazl encode RNA binding proteins essential for fertility of diverse animals including human. dazl has bisexual expression in both mitotic and meiotic germ cells, whereas daz has male premeiotic expression, and boule is largely a unisexual meiotic regulator. Although boule has been proposed as the ancestor for dazl/daz by gene duplication, it has been identified only in invertebrates and mammals. It has, however, remained unclear when and how the DAZ family has evolved in vertebrates. Methodology and Principal Findings This study was aimed at identifying and characterizing the DAZ family genes in fish as the basal vertebrate. We show that boule and dazl coexist in medaka and stickleback. Similar to the medaka dazl (Odazl), the medaka boule (Obol) is maternally supplied and segregates with primordial germ cells. Surprisingly, Obol is expressed in adult germ cells at pre-meiotic and meiotic stages of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. However, the maximal meiotic Obol expression in spermatocytes contrasts with the predominant pre-meiotic Odazl expression in spermatogonia, and the diffuse cytoplasmic Obol distribution in early oocytes contrasts with the Odazl concentration in the Balbinani's body. Conclusions The identification of fish boule and dazl genes provides direct evidence for the early gene duplication during vertebrate evolution. Our finding that Obol exhibits bisexual expression in both embryonic and adult germ cells considerably extends the diversity of boule expression patterns and offers a new insight into the evolutions of DAZ family members, expression patterns and functions in animal fertility."
https://openalex.org/W1992549938,"Methamphetamine (METH) is an illicit toxic psychostimulant which is widely abused. Its toxic effects depend on the release of excessive levels of dopamine (DA) that activates striatal DA receptors. Inhibition of DA-mediated neurotransmission by the DA D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, protects against METH-induced neuronal apoptosis. The initial purpose of the present study was to investigate, using microarray analyses, the influence of SCH23390 on transcriptional responses in the rat striatum caused by a single METH injection at 2 and 4 hours after drug administration. We identified 545 out of a total of 22,227 genes as METH-responsive. These include genes which are involved in apoptotic pathways, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and in transcription regulation, among others. Of these, a total of 172 genes showed SCH23390-induced inhibition of METH-mediated changes. Among these SCH23390-responsive genes were several genes that are regulated during ER stress, namely ATF3, HSP27, Hmox1, HSP40, and CHOP/Gadd153. The secondary goal of the study was to investigate the role of DA D1 receptor stimulation on the expression of genes that participate in ER stress-mediated molecular events. We thus used quantitative PCR to confirm changes in the METH-responsive ER genes identified by the microarray analyses. We also measured the expression of these genes and of ATF4, ATF6, BiP/GRP78, and of GADD34 over a more extended time course. SCH23390 attenuated or blocked METH-induced increases in the expression of the majority of these genes. Western blot analysis revealed METH-induced increases in the expression of the antioxidant protein, Hmox1, which lasted for about 24 hours after the METH injection. Additionally, METH caused DA D1 receptor-dependent transit of the Hmox1 regulator protein, Nrf2, from cytosolic into nuclear fractions where the protein exerts its regulatory functions. When taken together, these findings indicate that SCH23390 can provide protection against neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting METH-mediated DA D1 receptor-mediated ER stress in the rat striatum. Our data also suggest that METH-induced toxicity might be a useful model to dissect molecular mechanisms involved in ER stress-dependent events in the rodent brain."
https://openalex.org/W2147068327,"Hemojuvelin (HJV) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein and binds both bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and neogenin. Cellular HJV acts as a BMP co-receptor to enhance the transcription of hepcidin, a key iron regulatory hormone secreted predominantly by liver hepatocytes. In this study we characterized the role of neogenin in HJV-regulated hepcidin expression. Both HJV and neogenin were expressed in liver hepatocytes. Knockdown of neogenin decreased BMP4-induced hepcidin mRNA levels by 16-fold in HJV-expressing HepG2 cells but only by about 2-fold in cells transfected with either empty vector or G99V mutant HJV that does not bind BMPs. Further studies indicated that disruption of the HJV-neogenin interaction is responsible for a marked suppression of hepcidin expression. Moreover, in vivo studies showed that hepatic hepcidin mRNA could be significantly suppressed by blocking the interaction of HJV with full-length neogenin with a soluble fragment of neogenin in mice. Together, these results suggest that the HJV-neogenin interaction is required for the BMP-mediated induction of hepcidin expression when HJV is expressed. Combined with our previous studies, our results support that hepatic neogenin possesses two functions, mediation of cellular HJV release, and stimulation of HJV-enhanced hepcidin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2017634217,"Background Recent studies designed to identify the mechanism by which retinal horizontal cells communicate with cones have implicated two processes. According to one account, horizontal cell hyperpolarization induces an increase in pH within the synaptic cleft that activates the calcium current (Ca2+-current) in cones, enhancing transmitter release. An alternative account suggests that horizontal cell hyperpolarization increases the Ca2+-current to promote transmitter release through a hemichannel-mediated ephaptic mechanism. Methodology/Principal Findings To distinguish between these mechanisms, we interfered with the pH regulating systems in the retina and studied the effects on the feedback responses of cones and horizontal cells. We found that the pH buffers HEPES and Tris partially inhibit feedback responses in cones and horizontal cells and lead to intracellular acidification of neurons. Application of 25 mM acetate, which does not change the extracellular pH buffer capacity, does lead to both intracellular acidification and inhibition of feedback. Because intracellular acidification is known to inhibit hemichannels, the key experiment used to test the pH hypothesis, i.e. increasing the extracellular pH buffer capacity, does not discriminate between a pH-based feedback system and a hemichannel-mediated feedback system. To test the pH hypothesis in a manner independent of artificial pH-buffer systems, we studied the effect of interfering with the endogenous pH buffer, the bicarbonate/carbonic anhydrase system. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase allowed for large changes in pH in the synaptic cleft of bipolar cell terminals and cone terminals, but the predicted enhancement of the cone feedback responses, according to the pH-hypothesis, was not observed. These experiments thus failed to support a proton mediated feedback mechanism. The alternative hypothesis, the hemichannel-mediated ephaptic feedback mechanism, was therefore studied experimentally, and its feasibility was buttressed by means of a quantitative computer model of the cone/horizontal cell synapse. Conclusion We conclude that the data presented in this paper offers further support for physiologically relevant ephaptic interactions in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2040068921,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme that has guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolyzing activity in addition to its transamidating function. Studies show that TG2 is a player in mediating cell death processes. However, there is far from a consensus about the role of this enzyme in cell death processes as it appears to be dependent upon the cell type, stimuli, subcellular localization and conformational state of the enzyme. The purpose of this study was to dissect the role of TG2 in the cell death processes. To this end, we created and characterized 4 distinct point mutants of TG2, each of which differs from the wild type by its conformation or by lacking an important function. We also prepared these mutants as nuclear targeted proteins. By overexpressing mutant or wild type forms of TG2 in HEK 293 cells, we investigated the modulatory role of the protein in the cell death process in response to three stressors: thapsigargin, hyperosmotic stress and oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). All of the TG2 constructs, except the R580A mutant (which cannot bind guanine nucleotides and is therefore more prone to exhibit transamidating activity), either did not significantly affect the cell death processes or were protective. However in the case of the R580A mutant, cell death in response to high thapsigargin concentrations, was significantly increased. Intriguingly, nuclear localization of R580A-TG2 was sufficient to counteract the pro-death role of cytoplasmic R580A-TG2. In addition, nuclear localization of TG2 significantly facilitated its protective role against OGD. Our data support the hypothesis that the transamidation activity of TG2, which is mostly quiescent except in extreme stress conditions, is necessary for its pro-death role. In addition, nuclear localization of TG2 generally plays a key role in its protective function against cell death processes, either counteracting the detrimental effect or strengthening the protective role of the protein."

Regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5) is a negative regulator of G protein-mediated signaling that is strongly expressed in vessels during angiogenesis; however, the role of RGS5 in hypoxia has not been fully understood. Under hypoxic conditions, we found that the expression of RGS5, but not other RGS, was induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). RGS5 mRNA was increased when HUVEC were incubated with chemicals that stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), whereas hypoxia-stimulated RGS5 promoter activity was absent in HIF-1β−/− cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is regulated by HIF-1, did not appear to be involved in hypoxia-induced RGS5 expression; however, VEGF-mediated activation of p38 but not ERK1/2 was increased by RGS5. Overexpression of RGS5 in HUVEC exhibited a reduced growth rate without affecting the cell proliferation. Annexin V assay revealed that RGS5 induced apoptosis with significantly increased activation of caspase-3 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Small interfering RNA-specific for RGS5, caspase-3 inhibitor, and p38 inhibitor resulted in an attenuation of RGS5-stimulated apoptosis. Matrigel assay proved that RGS5 significantly impaired the angiogenic effect of VEGF and stimulated apoptosis in vivo. We concluded that RGS5 is a novel HIF-1-dependent, hypoxia-induced gene that is involved in the induction of endothelial apoptosis. Moreover, RGS5 antagonizes the angiogenic effect of VEGF by increasing the activation of p38 signaling, suggesting that RGS5 could be an important target for apoptotic therapy.

More than 25 RGS proteins have been identified, and there are indications that each will specifically regulate a particular G protein-coupled receptor pathway (10.De Vries L. Gist Farquhar M.

RGS5 mRNA expression was found markedly decreased in a model of three-dimensional capillary morphogenesis (16.Bell S.E. Mavila A. Salazar R. Bayless K.J. Kanagala S. Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2755-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is also reported that RGS5 mRNA is highly expressed in endothelial cells in the tumor vasculature of human renal cell carcinoma (17.Furuya M. Nishiyama M. Kimura S. Suyama T. Naya Y. Ito H. Nikaido T. Ishikura H. J. Pathol. 2004; 203: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and astrocytomas but not in HIF-1α deficient tumors (18.Berger M. Bergers G. Arnold B. Hämmerling G.J. Ganss R. Blood. 2005; 105: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). RGS5 is responsible for the abnormal tumor vascular morphology in mice. Loss of RGS5 results in pericyte maturation, vascular normalization, and consequent marked reductions in tumor hypoxia and vessel leakiness (19.Hamzah J. Jugold M. Kiessling F. Rigby P. Manzur M.

These findings argue for an important role of RGS5 in endothelial function. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways are involved in cellular responses to many extracellular stimuli and are major targets for drug discovery. RGS5 is a negative modulator of the angiotensin AT1a receptor. The inhibition of RGS5 expression enhanced angiotensin-stimulated inositol phosphate release (20.Wang Q. Liu M. Mullah B. Siderovski D.P. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24949-24958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, RGS5 attenuated endothelin-1-, sphingosine-1-phosphate-, and platelet-derived growth factor-induced ERK phosphorylation, which indicates that RGS5 exerts control over the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β and GPCR-mediated signaling pathways (14.Cho H. Kozasa T. Bondjers C. Betsholtz C. Kehrl J.H. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We conducted the present study to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling the regulation of RGS5 in hypoxic endothelium and the function of RGS5 in endothelial cells. The results presented here demonstrated that hypoxia increased RGS5 expression, which was mediated by HIF-1. Increased RGS5 expression induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells via increase of p38 MAPK activation. We report here, for the first time, that RGS5 is a novel hypoxia-inducible molecule involved in the regulation of endothelial cell behavior, indicating that RGS5 plays an important role in homeostasis in hypoxic endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured following the manufacturer's instructions. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells-1 (HMEC-1; Center of Disease Control) were cultured in MCDB-131 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 2 mm l-glutamine. C4-B13NBii1 (HIF-1β−/−) and vT2 (HIF-1β+/+) cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Hypoxic exposure was performed using a molecular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) flushed with 5% CO2 and 95% N2. The concentration of oxygen (∼1%) was determined before and after incubation by using an oxygen analyzer (Vascular Technology). Other reagents used to mimic hypoxia included dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) (BIOMOL), cobalt chloride (CoCl2), and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-DHB) (Sigma). Full-length RGS5 cDNA was obtained using reverse transcription-PCR from HUVEC and confirmed to be correct sequences corresponding to GenbankTM (NM_003617). RGS5 cDNA was cloned into pBMN-GFP vectors (Orbigen). In 10-cm dishes, 6 × 106 293T cells were transfected with pBMN-GFP-RGS5, pMD-VSVG, pJK3, and pCMV-tat using Polyethylenimine (Polysciences). Forty-eight h post transfection, virus-containing medium was collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and used to transduce HUVEC. Overexpression of RGS5 was confirmed by Western blotting. siRNA targeting human RGS5 were synthesized by Genpharma, Inc. (ZhangJiang). Two duplexes of siRNA (siRNA-1: 5′-AGAUGGCUGAGAAGGCAAATT-3′, 5′-UUUGCCUUCUCAGCCAUCUTG-3′ and siRNA-2: 5′-GCGUGAUUCCCUGGACAAATT-3′, 5′-UUUGUCCAGGGAAUCACGCCA-3′) were confirmed to have knockdown ability by Northern and Western blotting. Another duplex of RNA that is not targeted to any human genes was used as a control. HUVEC were transfected with siRNA at a final concentration of 50 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from cells by TRIzol (Invitrogen). Fifteen μg of RNA were loaded per lane, separated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then UV-cross-linked. Northern blot was performed by using a digoxin Northern starter kit (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's instruction. An RNA probe for human RGS5 containing digoxin-labeled dUTP was used for hybridization. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Boston BioProducts), and proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After being blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 with 5% nonfat milk, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then probed with primary antibodies (RGS5 polyclonal antiserum was obtained by immunized rabbits, 1:2,000; RGS2 and RGS4 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000; Bax, Bcl-2, and p53 antibodies were from BD Bioscience, 1:1,000; and total and cleaved caspase-3, total and phosphorylated p38, and ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling, 1:1,000) overnight at 4 °C and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were detected with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). A series of fragments encompassing the 5′-flanking region of the human RGS5 gene (GenBankTMNT_004487) were obtained by PCR from human genomic DNA and cloned into PGL-3 vector (Promega). The cultured cells including HMEC-1, HIF-1β−/−, and HIF-1β+/+ were transfected with the constructs using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were exposed to CoCl2 or hypoxia for 5 h, and luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Matrigel assays were carried out as described (21.Zeng H. Qin L. Zhao D. Tan X. Manseau E.J. Van Hoang M. Senger D.R. Brown L.F. Nagy J.A. Dvorak H.F. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SKMEL/VEGF cells (1 × 107) alone or mixed with 1 × 107 Phoenix cells infected with retrovirus expressing RGS5 were suspended in 0.5 ml of growth factor-reduced matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into nu/nu mice. Tissues were harvested, photographed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and immunostaining. Three individual experiments were performed, n = 4 per group in each experiment. Frozen sections of the matrigel blocks were washed and incubated with anti-CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences) and counterstained by hematoxylin as described previously (22.Pettersson A. Nagy J.A. Brown L.F. Sundberg C. Morgan E. Jungles S. Carter R. Krieger J.E. Manseau E.J. Harvey V.S. Eckelhoefer I.A. Feng D. Dvorak A.M. Mulligan R.C. Dvorak H.F. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescent CD31 and TUNEL double staining, sections were incubated with anti-CD31 antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Subsequent TUNEL staining was based on instruction of an apoptosis detection kit (Roche Applied Science). All slides were imaged on a Leica DM IRB fluorescent microscope. 104 cells were plated in each well of 12-well plates. At 5 h after plating (day 1) and at 2, 3, and 4 days after plating, the cells were fixed in 100% ethanol and subsequently stained with 0.1% crystal violet dissolved in 10% ethanol. After staining and thorough washing, the dye was extracted with 10% acetic acid, and absorbance was measured at 590 nm. Caspase inhibitor, cabobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) (BIOMOL) was used in the cell growth measurements. To measure cell proliferation, HUVEC transduced with RGS5 or control were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated with 1 μCi/ml 3H[thymidine] at 37 °C for 4 h. Medium was then removed, and the wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Radioactivity was extracted with 1 n NaOH and added to a scintillation vial containing 4 ml of ScintiVerse II (Fisher) solution. Thymidine incorporation was measured using a scintillation counter. Wells that contained no cells were labeled and counted to provide background counts. The cell migration rate was measured by wound healing assay. Equal numbers of cells (1 × 105) were plated in 12-well plates. The monolayer of cells were wounded by manual scratching with a pipette tip and then photographed in phase contrast with a Nikon microscope (0 h point) and placed into complete growth medium. Matching wound regions were photographed after 6, 12, and 24 h. The DNA ladder was examined in the infected HUVEC that were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. Cells were then removed from tissue culture plates by trypsin and resuspended in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 ng/ml proteinase K) for 4 h at 50 °C. DNA was extracted using phenol and chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA) and treated with RNase for 30 min at 37 °C. Ten micrograms of the DNA were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Using an apoptosis assay kit (Invitrogen), annexin V binding assay was performed in confluent infected HUVEC in serum-free medium under hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 24 h and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). For each treatment, 10,000 cells were counted and then evaluated using Cell Quest software. Cells that were annexin V-positive and propidium iodide-negative were counted for early stages of apoptosis. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. HUVEC were exposed to hypoxic conditions (O2<1%) for periods of 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. As compared with cultured HUVEC in normoxia (21% O2), RGS5 mRNA expression was induced by hypoxia immediately from 0.5 h, continuously increased up to 12 h, and peaked at 3 h (2.30 ± 0.25-fold). The increased RGS5 expression returned to baseline at 24 h (Fig. 1A). In addition to the increase of RGS5 mRNA, the protein level was also induced from 3 h to 12 h after hypoxia and declined at 24 h. RGS5 protein expression showed a time-dependent pattern, whereas the other two RGS family members that were also expressed in endothelial cells, RGS2 and RGS4, were not induced by hypoxia (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that hypoxia exclusively up-regulate the expression of RGS5 in endothelial cells. We next focused on which mechanism was involved in the regulation of RGS5 by hypoxia. CoCl2 is recognized as a hypoxia-mimicking compound that stabilizes HIF, a key transcriptional regulator activated only in hypoxic conditions. Incubation of HUVEC in the presence of 150 μm CoCl2 resulted in an induction of RGS5 mRNA (Fig. 2A) with the same time-dependent pattern as the hypoxia induction (data not shown). To further investigate whether the induction of RGS5 is HIF-1-regulated in endothelial cells, HUVEC were incubated in the presence of prolyl hydroxylases inhibitor, ethyl 3,4-DHB or DMOG. As shown in Fig. 2B, exposure of HUVEC to 200 μm DHB for 6 h resulted in a strong increase of RGS5 mRNA expression. Similarly, the cells incubated in the presence of 500 μm DMOG for 6 h, in which the HIF-1α degradation would be blocked for the same duration, showed a significant increase of RGS5 mRNA expression (Fig. 2C). In addition to the increase of RGS5 mRNA, the expression of RGS5 protein was also induced in HUVEC incubated with CoCl2, DHB, and DMOG respectively (Fig. 2D). Together, these results indicate that RGS5 mRNA and protein expression are controlled by changes in oxygen level and that HIF-1α is involved in the regulation of RGS5 in hypoxic endothelial cells. To evaluate whether RGS5 is a target gene for HIF-1α, promoter regions of RGS5 were cloned and constructed. In HMEC-1, the activities of the luciferase construct of RGS5 promoter were measured. As shown in Fig. 3A, exposure of HMEC-1 transfected with RGS5 promoter of various length sequences including 2.4 kb (down to −2214); 1.1 kb (to −772); 0.64 kb (to −413); and 0.46 kb (to −236), but not 0.32 kb (to −93) to CoCl2 (150 μm, 6 h) led to an increase in luciferase activity when compared with HMEC-1 not incubated with CoCl2. In addition, when the construct of RGS5 promoter (2.4 kb) was transfected into the cells lacking HIF-1β, with which HIF-1α forms obligate heterodimers (23.Wood S.M. Gleadle J.M. Pugh C.W. Hankinson O. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15117-15123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and then exposed to hypoxia, no induction of RGS5 promoter activity was detected, whereas induction was observed (1.6 ± 0.11-fold) in the control cells normally expressing HIF-1β (Fig. 3B). These results imply that the HIF pathway is required for hypoxia-regulated RGS5 expression. VEGF is an important gene regulated by HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions. VEGF signaling has broad effects on the growth of endothelial cells. To examine the relationship between these two HIF-dependent genes, RGS5 and VEGF, HUVEC were treated with VEGF by different doses and duration. The results showed that VEGF did not regulate RGS5 expression (Fig. 4A). However, in HUVEC with overexpressing RGS5 (RGS5 o/e) (Fig. 4B), VEGF-induced p38 activation was significantly increased, but ERK1/2 activation was not changed (Fig. 4C). A decreased phosphorylation level of p38 was observed in the HUVEC transfected with RGS5 siRNA (Fig. 4, D and E). These results suggest that HIF-1 independently regulates VEGF and RGS5, but RGS5 can affect the VEGF pathway. Hypoxia-induced genes could lead to endothelial cells to undergo opposing processes, either angiogenesis or apoptosis; however, little is known regarding the functional properties of RGS5 in endothelial cells under hypoxia. To test the consequence of up-regulation of RGS5 in hypoxia, functional properties of RGS5 in endothelial cells were examined in HUVEC with RGS5 o/e. As shown in Fig. 5A, a growth curve demonstrated that the HUVEC with RGS5 o/e grew significantly slower than the control cells that were infected with empty vectors. However, this growth defect did not present in parallel to the proliferative rates that were measured by thymidine incorporation (Fig. 5B), which indicated that the ability of RGS5 might not be correlated to hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Wound healing scratch assays were performed to determine whether stable RGS5 expression would also affect the endothelial migration (Fig. 5C). Both the control and the RGS5 o/e cells completed the wound healing within 24 h. No significant difference was observed during the process. Because RGS5 attenuated the growth rate of endothelial cells but did not impact its proliferation, it has been considered that RGS5 may affect the apoptosis of endothelial cells. To test this possibility, apoptosis was induced by withdrawing serum and growth factors from HUVEC culture medium for 24 h. In Fig. 6A, a DNA laddering analysis illustrated a significant increase of apoptosis in HUVEC with RGS5 o/e compared with controls. In addition, an increase of activated caspase-3 was observed in HUVEC with RGS5 o/e (Fig. 6B), which could be blocked by application of Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 6C), and consequently resulted in preventing the RGS5-attenuated endothelial cell growth (Fig. 6D). Moreover, in HUVEC with RGS5 o/e, pro-apoptotic protein Bax was significantly increased by nutrient deprivation whereas there was no difference in Bcl-2 expression between RGS5 o/e and control cells, indicating that the apoptosis occurred because of the change in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio (24.Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). In addition, p53 was not regulated in RGS5 o/e endothelial cells (Fig. 6B) although it was correlated with the induction of apoptosis in hypoxic endothelial cells (25.Stempien-Otero A. Karsan A. Cornejo C.J. Xiang H. Eunson T. Morrison R.S. Kay M. Winn R. Harlan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8039-8045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Other than changes of apoptotic factors, RGS5 o/e endothelial cells undergoing apoptosis was also confirmed by FACS analysis. Fig. 6E demonstrated an increase in the numbers of annexin V-positive and propidium iodide-negative cells in HUVEC with RGS5 o/e in comparison to controls after exposure to serum free medium for 24 h (18.35% versus 2.73%), whereas application of p38 inhibitor SB203580 (20 μm) to RGS5 o/e HUVEC resulted in a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, with silencing of the RGS5 gene, HUVEC were rescued to a certain extent from hypoxia-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6F). These findings suggest that RGS5 was involved in the enhancement of apoptosis in association with p38 MAPK activation in endothelial cells. To further elucidate the function of RGS5 in the in vivo setting, matrigel assay was performed in nude mice. On day 3 after implantation of matrigel plugs that were incorporated with SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells expressing VEGF-A165 (SK-MEL/VEGF cells) and/or Phoenix cells packaging retroviruses expressing RGS5, expression of RGS5 in the vasculature of matrigel was confirmed by Western blotting and immunostaining (Fig. 7A). The angiogenic responses were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry for the endothelial cell marker CD31 (Fig. 7B). Strong angiogenesis was induced in plugs containing SK-MEL/VEGF cells (Fig. 7B, b). However, the matrigel plug that contained RGS5 significantly impaired the VEGF-induced angiogenesis (Fig. 7B, d) evidenced by the decreased vessel density accounted by CD31 positive cells (Fig. 7C). TUNEL and CD31 labeling were performed to evaluate endothelial cell apoptosis. As Fig. 7D illustrates, the concurrent TUNEL/CD31-positive cells were only observed in the matrigel plug that contained expressing RGS5. Hypoxia and ischemia trigger a multitude of responses designed to compensate for reduced oxygen availability. In endothelial cells, these responses include increased expression of growth factors and their receptors to induce angiogenesis (5.Brunelle J.K. Chandel N.S. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7.Mandriota S.J. Pyke C. Di Sanza C. Quinodoz P. Pittet B. Pepper M.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 2077-2089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other hand, hypoxia-regulated genes can lead cells to apoptosis to maintain the homeostasis (3.Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F.

Thus, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that hypoxia-related genes use to regulate endothelial cell behavior may aid in the comprehension of vascular homeostasis. In this report, we demonstrated that regulator of G protein signaling 5 is a novel hypoxia-induced gene in endothelial cells. Expression of RGS5 can be significantly induced by hypoxia at both mRNA and protein levels. Hypoxia induces expression of RGS5 but not RGS2 and RGS4, although these three RGS members have been reported to express in endothelial cells (12.Kirsch T. Wellner M. Luft F.C. Haller H. Lippoldt A.

https://openalex.org/W2066777575,"Enzyme-catalyzed, post-translational modifications of core histones have been implicated in the complex changes in gene expression that drive early mammalian development. However, until recently the small number of cells available from the preimplantation embryo itself has prevented quantitative analysis of histone modifications at key regulator genes. The possible involvement of histone modifications in the embryo's response to extracellular signals, or as determinants of cell fate or lineage progression, remains unclear. Here we describe the use of a recently-developed chromatin immunoprecipitation technique (CChIP) to assay histone modification levels at key regulator genes (Pou5f1, Nanog, Cdx2, Hoxb1, Hoxb9) as mouse embryos progress from 8-cell to blastocyst in culture. Only by the blastocyst stage, when the embryonic (Inner Cell Mass) and extra-embryonic (Trophoblast) lineages are compared, do we see the expected association between histone modifications previously linked to active and silent chromatin, and transcriptional state. To explore responses to an environmental signal, we exposed embryos to the histone deacetylase inhibitor, anti-epileptic and known teratogen valproic acid (VPA), during progression from 8-cell to morula stage. Such treatment increased H4 acetylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation at the promoters of Hoxb1 and Hoxb9, but not the promoters of Pou5f1, Nanog,Cdx2 or the housekeeping gene Gapdh. Despite the absence of detectable Hoxb transcription, these VPA-induced changes were heritable, following removal of the inhibitor, at least until the blastocyst stage. The selective hyperacetylation of Hoxb promoters in response to a histone deacetylase inhibitor, suggests that Hox genes have a higher turnover of histone acetates than other genes in the preimplantation embryo. To explain the heritability, through mitosis, of VPA-induced changes in histone modification at Hoxb promoters, we describe how an epigenetic feed-forward loop, based on cross-talk between H3 acetylation and H3K4 methylation, might generate a persistently increased steady-state level of histone acetylation in response to a transient signal."
https://openalex.org/W2165792408,"Aldosterone is the principal hormonal regulator of sodium homeostasis in vertebrates. It exerts its actions through the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) that regulates the transcription of specific target genes. In recent years, a number of MR target genes have been identified that are involved in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a key modulator of renal sodium absorption. Here we report the identification of cnksr3 as a direct MR target gene that is up-regulated in response to physiological concentrations of aldosterone. The cnksr3 promoter exhibits two functional aldosterone-responsive regions, which were bound by the MR as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In vivo, CNKSR3 was highly expressed in the renal cortical collecting duct (CCD), the prime target segment of aldosterone-regulated sodium retention in the kidney. CCD cell lines stably overexpressing or silencing CNKSR3 were electrophysiologically analyzed and show that CNKSR3 expression correlated with and is required for ENaC-mediated transepithelial sodium transport. In parallel, CNKSR3 expression led to decreased MEK phosphorylation. We conclude that CNKSR3, a homologue of scaffold proteins involved in MAPK pathway regulation, is a direct target of MR and is required for the maintenance of transepithelial sodium transport in the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1993495903,"The mechanisms of how ligands enter and leave the binding cavity of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) have been a puzzling question over decades. Liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) is a unique family member which accommodates two molecules of fatty acids in its cavity and exhibits the capability of interacting with a variety of ligands with different chemical structures and properties. Investigating the ligand dissociation processes of LFABP is thus a quite interesting topic, which however is rather difficult for both experimental approaches and ordinary simulation strategies. In the current study, random expulsion molecular dynamics simulation, which accelerates ligand motions for rapid dissociation, was used to explore the potential egress routes of ligands from LFABP. The results showed that the previously hypothesized “portal region” could be readily used for the dissociation of ligands at both the low affinity site and the high affinity site. Besides, one alternative portal was shown to be highly favorable for ligand egress from the high affinity site and be related to the unique structural feature of LFABP. This result lends strong support to the hypothesis from the previous NMR exchange studies, which in turn indicates an important role for this alternative portal. Another less favored potential portal located near the N-terminal end was also identified. Identification of the dissociation pathways will allow further mechanistic understanding of fatty acid uptake and release by computational and/or experimental techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2063119628,"Islets from adult rat possess weak antioxidant defense leading to unbalance between superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide-inactivating enzymatic activities, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) rending them susceptible to oxidative stress. We have shown that this vulnerability is influenced by maternal diet during gestation and lactation.The present study investigated if low antioxidant activity in islets is already observed at birth and if maternal protein restriction influences the development of islet antioxidant defenses. Rats were fed a control diet (C group) or a low protein diet during gestation (LP) or until weaning (LPT), after which offspring received the control diet. We found that antioxidant enzymatic activities varied with age. At birth and after weaning, normal islets possessed an efficient GPX activity. However, the antioxidant capacity decreased thereafter increasing the potential vulnerability to oxidative stress. Maternal protein malnutrition changed the antioxidant enzymatic activities in islets of the progeny. At 3 months, SOD activity was increased in LP and LPT islets with no concomitant activation of CAT and GPX. This unbalance could lead to higher hydrogen peroxide production, which may concur to oxidative stress causing defective insulin gene expression due to modification of critical factors that modulate the insulin promoter. We found indeed that insulin mRNA level was reduced in both groups of malnourished offspring compared to controls. Analyzing the expression of such critical factors, we found that c-Myc expression was strongly increased in islets from both protein-restricted groups compared to controls.Modification in antioxidant activity by maternal low protein diet could predispose to pancreatic islet dysfunction later in life and provide new insights to define a molecular mechanism responsible for intrauterine programming of endocrine pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W2065794410,"Insulators and domain boundaries both shield genes from adjacent enhancers and inhibit intrusion of heterochromatin into transgenes. Previous studies examined the functional mechanism of the MYC insulator element MINE and its CTCF binding sites in the context of transgenes that were randomly inserted into the genome by transfection. However, the contribution of CTCF binding sites to both gene regulation and maintenance of chromatin has not been tested at the endogenous MYC gene.To determine the impact of CTCF binding on MYC expression, a series of mutant human chromosomal alleles was prepared in homologous recombination-efficient DT40 cells and individually transferred by microcell fusion into murine cells. Functional tests reported here reveal that deletion of CTCF binding elements within the MINE does not impact the capacity of this locus to correctly organize an 'accessible' open chromatin domain, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the formation of a competent, transcriptionally active locus. Moreover, deletion of the CTCF site at the MYC P2 promoter reduces transcription but does not affect promoter acetylation or serum-inducible transcription. Importantly, removal of either CTCF site leads to DNA methylation of flanking sequences, thereby contributing to progressive loss of transcriptional activity.These findings collectively demonstrate that CTCF-binding at the human MYC locus does not repress transcriptional activity but is required for protection from DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2067711873,"Background Phenotype and function of regulatory T cells (Treg) largely depend on the presence of the transcription factor FOXP3. In contrast to mice, human Treg cells express isoforms of this protein. Besides the full length version (FOXP3fl), an isoform lacking the exon 2 (FOXP3Δ2) is co-expressed in comparable amounts. Recently, a third splice variant has been described that in addition to exon 2 also misses exon 7 (FOXP3Δ2Δ7). Exon 7 encodes for a leucine zipper motif commonly used as structural dimerization element. Mutations in exon 7 have been linked to IPEX, a severe autoimmune disease suggested to be caused by impaired dimerization of the FOXP3 protein. Principal Findings This study shows that the lack of exon 7 does not affect (homo-) dimerization. Moreover, the interaction of FOXP3Δ2Δ7 to RUNX1, NFAT and NF-kB appeared to be unchanged in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and reporter gene assays, when compared to FOXP3fl and FOXP3Δ2. Nevertheless, retroviral transduction with FOXP3Δ2Δ7 failed to induce the typical Treg-associated phenotype. The expression of FOXP3-induced surface molecules such as CD25 and CTLA-4 were not enhanced in FOXP3Δ2Δ7 transduced CD4+ T cells, which also failed to exhibit any suppressive capacity. Notably, however, co-expression of FOXP3fl with FOXP3Δ2Δ7 resulted in a reduction of CD25 expression by a dominant negative effect. Conclusions The leucine zipper of FOXP3 does not mediate dimerization or interaction with NFAT, NF-kB and RUNX1, but is indispensable for the characteristic phenotype and function in Treg cells. FOXP3Δ2Δ7 could play a role in regulating the function of the other FOXP3 isoforms and may be involved in cancer pathogenesis, as it is overexpressed by certain malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026798977,"Background YKL-40 is a chitinase-like glycoprotein encoded by the chitinase 3-like 1 gene, CHI3L1, localized at chromosome 1q32.1. Increased levels of serum YKL-40 have been reported to be a biomarker for asthma and a reduced lung function. Interestingly, the C-allele of the -131 C→G (rs4950928) polymorphism of CHI3L1 has been shown to associate with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reduced lung function suggesting that variations in CHI3L1 may influence risk of asthma. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association of common variation in the CHI3L1 locus with asthma, atopy and lung function in a large population-based sample of adults. Methods/Principal Findings Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CHI3L1 including rs4950928 were genotyped in 6514 individuals. Asthma was defined as self-reported history of physician-diagnosed asthma. Total IgE and specific IgE to inhalant allergens were measured on serum samples. Lung function was measured by spirometry. Homozygosity of the rs4950928 G allele as compared to homozygosity of the C allele was associated with self-reported physician diagnosed asthma (OR 1.5 (95% CI, 1.00–2.26)) and with prevalence of atopic asthma (OR 1.93 (95% CI, 1.21–3.07)) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, socio-economic class and BMI. Carriers of rs883125 G allele had a significantly lower prevalence of atopy (OR 0.82 (CI, 0.72; 0.94)) as compared to homozygosity of the C allele. None of the SNPs examined were significantly associated with FEV1. However, two SNPs (rs10399931and rs4950930) appeared to be significantly associated with FEV1/FVC-ratio. Subgroup analyses of never-smokers did not consistently influence the associations in an either positively og negatively way. Conclusions In contrast to previous studies, the rs4950928 G allele, and not the C allele, was found to be associated with asthma. A few other SNPs of the CHI3L1 was found to be significantly associated with atopy and FEV1/FVC ratio, respectively. Thus, more studies seem warranted to establish the role of CHI3L1 gene in asthma and atopy."

Most of the studies about resistance have focused on point mutations on BCR/ABL. However, other types of resistance that do not imply mutations in BCR/ABL have been also described. In the present report we aim to study the role of several MAPK in IM resistance not associate to BCR/ABL mutations. Therefore we used an experimental system of resistant cell lines generated by co-culturing with IM (K562, Lama 84) as well as primary material from resistant and responder patient without BCR/ABL mutations. Here we demonstrate that Erk5 and p38MAPK signaling pathways are not implicated in the acquired resistance phenotype. However, Erk2, but not Erk1, is critical for the acquired resistance to IM. In fact, Bcr/Abl activates preferentially Erk2 in transient transfection in a dose dependent fashion through the c-Abl part of the chimeric protein. Finally, we present evidences demonstrating how constitutive activation of Erk2 is a de novo mechanism of resistance to IM. In summary our data support the use of therapeutic approaches based on Erk2 inhibition, which could be added to the therapeutic armamentarium to fight CML, especially when IM resistance develops secondary to Erk2 activation."

Although Ca2+ influx through several membrane Ca2+ channels is known to regulate vasoconstriction of the DA, the role of the T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) in DA closure remains unclear. Here we found that the expression of α1G, a T-type isoform that is known to exhibit a tissue-restricted expression pattern in the rat neonatal DA, was significantly up-regulated in oxygenated rat DA tissues and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Immunohistological analysis revealed that α1G was localized predominantly in the central core of neonatal DA at birth. DA SMC migration was significantly increased by α1G overexpression. Moreover, it was decreased by adding α1G-specific small interfering RNAs or using R(−)-efonidipine, a highly selective T-type VDCC blocker. Furthermore, an oxygenation-mediated increase in an intracellular Ca2+ concentration of DA SMCs was significantly decreased by adding α1G-specific siRNAs or using R(−)-efonidipine. Although a prostaglandin E receptor EP4 agonist potently promoted intimal thickening of the DA explants, R(−)-efonidipine (10−6m) significantly inhibited EP4-promoted intimal thickening by 40% using DA tissues at preterm in organ culture.

We found that Ca2+ influx through T-type VDCCs promoted oxygenation-induced DA closure through SMC migration and vasoconstriction. Timed pregnant Wistar rats were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The DA was obtained from rat fetuses on the 19th day of gestation (preterm) and on the 21st day of gestation (term) and from neonates within at least 6 h after delivery. The DAs on the 19th day of gestation remained immature, whereas they became mature on the 21st day of gestation. All of the animals were cared for in compliance with the guiding principles of the American Physiologic Society. The experiments were approved by the Ethical Committees on Animal Experiments of Waseda University and Yokohama City University School of Medicine. R(−)-Efonidipine, a highly selective T-type VDCC blocker, and ONO-AE1–329, a selective prostaglandin E receptor EP4 agonist, were provided by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Saitama, Japan) and ONO Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Nitrendipine, a selective L-type VDCC blocker, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. α1G plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Lory at Université Montpellier (Montpellier, France). Collagenase II was from the Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Lakewood, NJ). Collagenase/dispase was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was purchased from Invitrogen. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB and 10% buffered formalin were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Elastase type II-A, trypsin inhibitor type I-S, bovine serum albumin V, penicillin-streptomycin solution, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-α1G and anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-Ki-67 antibody was purchased from Dako. To examine the expression of α1G protein after birth, we used pooled tissues obtained from one littermate of Wistar rat neonates on the day of birth. After excision, the tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (5.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H. Yokota S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1660-H1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the immunoperoxidase of α1G subunit and Ki-67 in the rat DA, tissue staining and immunohistochemistry were carried out as previously explained (5.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H. Yokota S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

Vascular SMCs in primary culture were obtained from the DAs of Wistar rat embryos on embryonic day 21, as described previously (5.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H. Yokota S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1660-H1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21.Yokoyama U.

Invest. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The confluent cells for four to six passages were used in the experiments. We checked that these cells were in a more differentiated state than the cells of primary isolations, although the cells for four to six passages were in a less differentiated state than DA tissues at term and adult aortic artery, when the differentiation state was determined by the expression of marker genes of SMC differentiation such as SM1, SM2, and SMemb (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, it should be noted that the phenotype of cultured DA SMCs was not completely the same as the contractile phenotype of tissues of the DA and aorta. To examine the effect of a change in oxygen tension, DA SMCs were cultured in a hypoxic chamber (1% O2, 5% CO2) and then transferred to a normoxic chamber (21% O2, 5% CO2). The migration assay was performed using 24-well transwell culture inserts with polycarbonate membranes (8-μm pores; Corning Inc.) as described previously with some minor modifications (21.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using a fibronectin-coated membrane of a Boyden chamber, we examined an acute (∼4 h) effect of T-type VDCC on SMC migration by overexpression of a α1G protein or by inhibition with R(−)-efonidipine or with α1G-specific siRNAs. To examine the effect of T-type VDCC on actively migrating SMCs, 10% FCS was used as a potent stimulator for SMC migration. A full-length of rat α1G cDNA was ligated to pcDNA3.1 plasmid vector. Plasmid DNAs were purified using a High Pure plasmid isolation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Genome-ONE NEO, an inactivated, column-purified HVJ-E vector, was purchased from Ishihara Sangyo Co. Ltd.(Osaka, Japan). Plasmid DNAs were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two double-standard 21-bp siRNAs to the selected region of α1G subunit cDNA were purchased from Qiagen. The antisense siRNA sequences targeting α1G subunit were 5′-UAGCAUUGGACAGGAAUCGdTdA-3′ and 5′-UAAUGUGACGAGAAUGCGCdAdT-3′. AllStars negative control siRNA purchased from Qiagen was used as a control nonsilencing siRNA. siRNAs were transfected as previously described (21.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both isolation of total RNA from pooled tissues or cultured SMCs and generation of cDNA and reverse transcription-PCR analysis for α1G subunit were carried out as described previously (5.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H. Yokota S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1660-H1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The forward primer specific for α1G subunit was 5′-cctgatttcttttcgcccag-3′. The reverse primer specific for α1G subunit was 5′-tggcaaaaggctctttcgtag-3′. The 5′ and 3′ primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-cccatcaccatcttccaggagcg-3′ and 3′-gcagggatgatgttctgggctgcc-5′. The abundance of each gene was determined relative to internal control using a Quantitect primer assay (Qiagen). For each reverse transcription-PCR experiment that included a reverse transcription negative control, we confirmed that there was no amplification in any reaction. DA SMCs were loaded with fura-2/AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) in a Tyrode solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH7.4). The DA SMCs on a 96-well microplate (Nunc) were superfused with the solution containing 2.5 μm fura-2/AM for 20 min at 37 °C. After the dye loading, the loading buffer was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with loading buffer. DA SMCs were incubated for 24 h under the following conditions within the dye loading time: a humidified chamber, 5% CO2, and 1% O2 at 37 °C. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration of DA SMCs was performed using the ARVOTMMX fluorescence microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) from 5 min at room air after the hypoxic incubation. Fura-2/AM was excited at 340 and 390 nm with fluorescence emission detected using a 510-nm band pass filter. We evaluated intracellular Ca2+ concentration with the use of the observed fluorescence ratio 340/390 nm. Ex vivo DA organ culture was prepared as described previously (21.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal arteries including the DA on the 19th day of gestation were stimulated for 2 days by R(−)-efonidipine under the following conditions: a humidified chamber, a concentration of 10−6m in 0.5% FCS containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% CO2, and 95% ambient mixed air at 37 °C. The segments were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Morphometric analyses were conducted using Win Roof version 5.0 software (Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Intimal cushion formation was defined as [intimal area]/[medial area]. After the maternal rats were anesthetized on the 21st day of gestation with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), the fetuses at embryonic day 21 were delivered by cesarean section. Either the vascular ring of the DA or the descending aorta was placed in a tissue bath and kept at 37 °C. Two tungsten wires (30 μm in diameter) were threaded into the lumen, and the preparation was mounted in a two-channel myograph (Dual Wire myograph system 410A; Unique Medical, Tokyo, Japan). One tungsten wire was connected to a micro-manipulator, and the other was connected to a force transducer. All of the vascular rings were initially stabilized for at least 60 min with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (Sigma-Aldrich) that was equilibrated with room air and whose temperature was maintained at 37 °C by a heated water jacket. Isometric tension was continuously monitored using a PowerLab/8 SP system (ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO). After stabilization, the vascular ring was exposed to 1 μm of indomethacin-containing Krebs-Henseleit solution for at least 10 min at 37 °C. After the vascular ring was washed with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution and relaxed, the resting tension was adjusted to 0.30 mN. After a plateau vasoconstriction had been attained using oxygen exposure (95% O2, 5% CO2), R(−)-efonidipine or the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nitrendipine, was added to stimulate vasodilatation. After the vasoconstriction reached a new steady state, the concentration of R(−)-efonidipine was increased from 10−7m to 10−5m. At the end of all experiments, vasoconstriction of the DA was induced by potassium-enriched solutions (22 mm NaCl, 120 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 6 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After the maternal rats were anesthetized on the 21st day of gestation with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), rat newborns were obtained by cesarean section. Immediately after cesarean section, the neonates were given intraperitoneal injections either with R(−)-efonidipine at a concentration of 10 μg/g of body weight or 100 μg/g of body weight or with saline. After injection, the neonates were incubated in room air at 33 °C for 30 or 90 min, and then the DA segments were fixed and analyzed by the same method used in the organ culture. The degrees of vasoconstriction and intimal cushion formation were estimated by [open area]/[total vessel area] and [intimal area]/[medial area], respectively. All of the data are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's unpaired t tests were used to compare mRNA expression in the DA and other tissues. Comparisons between data from multiple groups were performed by unpaired analysis of variance followed by the Student's-Newmann-Keuls test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Our previous study demonstrated that α1G mRNA was predominantly expressed and were significantly up-regulated in the DA during vascular development (5.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H. Yokota S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1660-H1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Then we examined the expression of α1G protein in the DA tissue during the perinatal period. Consistent with the change in the expression of mRNA, the expression levels of α1G protein were significantly up-regulated by 2.3-fold in the neonatal DA just after birth from what they were in the DA on embryonic day 21 (Fig. 1). Because our previous study had demonstrated that α1G protein was strongly expressed in the region of intimal thickening of the mature DA at embryonic day 21 (5.Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H. Yokota S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1660-H1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we further investigated the localization of α1G protein in the DA after birth. We found that the lumen of the rat neonatal DA was filled with densely packed intimal cells within 1 h after birth, whereas the lumen of the aorta was widely open (Fig. 2, A and B). The immunoreaction of α1G protein was strongly stained in these cells of the central core of the DA lumen (Fig. 2C). Ki-67, a nuclear antigen associated with cell proliferation, was also strongly stained in the packed intimal cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that α1G is profoundly expressed in the proliferative cells. We then examined the effect of oxygenation on the expression of α1G in DA SMCs. When the condition of the culture medium was changed from hypoxia (1% oxygen) to normoxia (21% oxygen) in the DA SMCs after 7 h, the expression levels of α1G mRNA were up-regulated by 2.2-fold, and those of protein were up-regulated by 1.9-fold (Fig. 3), although they were unchanged after 1 h. These data may explain the association between the up-regulation of α1G in the rat neonatal DA and an increase in oxygen tension in the circulation after birth. Progressive SMC migration from vascular media into the endothelial layer is an important vascular remodeling process of the DA at birth (1.Smith G.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 35-58PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Rabinovitch M. Semin. Perinatol. 1996; 20: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23.Slomp J. van Munsteren J.C. Poelmann R.E. de Reeder E.G. Bogers A.J. Gittenberger-de Groot A.C. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 93: 25-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings regarding the localization of α1G protein that was observed suggest that α1G regulated the SMC migration of the DA. First, when the expression of α1G mRNA was up-regulated by ∼2.5-fold by transfection of α1G plasmids in DA SMCs (supplemental Fig. S2A), SMC migration was significantly increased by 2.1-fold (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). In the presence of 10% FCS, SMC migration was increased by more than 5-fold, probably because of hormones and/or cytokines that were contained in FCS. It should be noted that FCS did not significantly affect the expression of α1G mRNA (supplemental Fig. S3). α1G overexpression further increased FCS-mediated SMC migration by 1.6-fold (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). Next, we examined the effect of genetic and pharmacological inhibition of T-type VDCC on DA SMC migration. Two different siRNAs for α1G significantly decreased the expression of α1G mRNA and protein in DA SMCs by ∼60% (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C), whereas they did not significantly change the expression of α1C, α1C splice variant, and α1D mRNAs that was abundantly detected in the rat DA (supplemental Fig. S4) After these α1G siRNAs were used, FCS-mediated SMC migration was significantly decreased by ∼42% when compared with that of a nontargeting negative control siRNA (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, R(−)-efonidipine, a recently developed, highly selective T-type VDCC blocker, significantly attenuated FCS-mediated SMC migration by ∼48% in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4C). Mibefradil, another selective T-type VDCC blocker, also significantly attenuated FCS-mediated SMC migration by ∼17% in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05), although its inhibitory effect was weaker than that of R(−)-efonidipine (supplemental Fig. S5). Because vascular remodeling of the DA, including SMC migration, dramatically progresses after birth, we hypothesized that oxygenation might play a critical role in regulating this remodeling through an increase in Ca2+ influx via T-type VDCCs. When cultured DA SMCs were used and when the condition of culture medium was changed from hypoxia to normoxia, SMC migration was increased by ∼2.0-fold in the normoxic group when compared with that in the hypoxic group, either in the absence or presence of 10% FCS (p < 0.01), indicating that oxygenation promoted SMC migration of the DA. Furthermore, we examined the effect of T-type VDCCs on oxygenation-mediated migration. We found that R(−)-efonidipine at a concentration of 10−6m significantly attenuated DA SMC migration by ∼23% when the culture medium was changed from hypoxia to normoxia (p < 0.05), although it exhibited no effect on SMC migration in a continuously hypoxic medium (Fig. 5A). In addition, using one of the α1G-specific siRNAs that significantly decreased the expression of α1G mRNA as presented above, we found that the α1G-specific siRNA significantly decreased DA SMC migration by ∼42% when compared with a nontargeting negative control siRNA in a culture medium changed from hypoxia to normoxia (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5B). However, the α1G-specific siRNA did not suppress SMC migration in a continuously hypoxic medium. It should be noted that FCS was still capable of stimulating DA SMC migration even in the presence of R(−)-efonidipine and α1G-specific siRNA, suggesting that FCS contains some cell migrating factors that are independent of the effect of T-type VDCCs on SMC migration. Taken together, these independent experiments indicated that T-type VDCCs, most likely α1G, played an important role in promoting oxygenation-mediated SMC migration in the DA. It has been known that oxygenation increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the DA to c"
https://openalex.org/W1969672831,"Background Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe intrauterine infections leading to fetal morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of GBS infection in this environment is poorly understood, in part because we lack a detailed understanding of the adaptation of this pathogen to growth in amniotic fluid. To address this knowledge deficit, we characterized the transcriptome of GBS grown in human amniotic fluid (AF) and compared it with the transcriptome in rich laboratory medium. Methods GBS was grown in Todd Hewitt-yeast extract medium and human AF. Bacteria were collected at mid-logarithmic, late-logarithmic and stationary growth phase. We performed global expression microarray analysis using a custom-made Affymetrix GeneChip. The normalized hybridization values derived from three biological replicates at each growth point were obtained. AF/THY transcript ratios representing greater than a 2-fold change and P-value exceeding 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Principal Findings We have discovered that GBS significantly remodels its transcriptome in response to exposure to human amniotic fluid. GBS grew rapidly in human AF and did not exhibit a global stress response. The majority of changes in GBS transcripts in AF compared to THY medium were related to genes mediating metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides. The majority of the observed changes in transcripts affects genes involved in basic bacterial metabolism and is connected to AF composition and nutritional requirements of the bacterium. Importantly, the response to growth in human AF included significant changes in transcripts of multiple virulence genes such as adhesins, capsule, and hemolysin and IL-8 proteinase what might have consequences for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. Conclusions/Significance Our work provides extensive new information about how the transcriptome of GBS responds to growth in AF, and thus new leads for pathogenesis research."
https://openalex.org/W2110299851,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is the largest cause of death in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, having claimed an estimated one third to one half of the 30 million AIDS deaths that have occurred worldwide. Different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb), the causative agent of TB, are known to modify the host immune response in a strain-specific manner. However, a MTb strain-specific impact upon the regulation of HIV-1 replication has not previously been established. Methology/Principal Findings We isolated normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and co-infected them with HIV-1 and with either the well characterized CDC1551 or HN878 MTb clinical isolate. We show that HIV-1 co-infection with the CDC1551 MTb strain results in higher levels of virus replication relative to co-infection with the HN878 MTb strain ex vivo. Furthermore, we show that the distinct pattern of CDC1551 or HN878 induced HIV-1 replication is associated with significantly increased levels of TNF and IL-6, and of the transcription and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor NF-κB, by CDC1551 relative to HN878. Conclusions/Significance These results provide a precedent for TB strain-specific effects upon HIV-1 replication and thus for TB strain-specific pathogenesis in the outcome of HIV-1/TB co-infection. MTb strain-specific factors and mechanisms involved in the regulation of HIV-1 during co-infection will be of importance in understanding the basic pathogenesis of HIV-1/TB co-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2004276430,"Endothelial lipase (EL) is a member of a subfamily of lipases that act on triglycerides and phospholipids in plasma lipoproteins, which also includes lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase. EL has a tropism for high density lipoprotein, and its level of phospholipase activity is similar to its level of triglyceride lipase activity. Inhibition or loss-of-function of EL in mice results in an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol, making it a potential therapeutic target. Although hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase have been shown to function as homodimers, the active form of EL is not known. In these studies, the size and conformation of the active form of EL were determined. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested oligomerization. Ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the active form of EL had a molecular weight higher than the molecular weight of a simple monomer but less than a dimer. A construct encoding a covalent head-to-tail homodimer of EL (EL-EL) was expressed and had similar lipolytic activity to EL. The functional molecular weights determined by radiation inactivation were similar for EL and the covalent homodimer EL-EL. We previously showed that EL could be cleaved by proprotein convertases, such as PC5, resulting in loss of activity. In cells overexpressing PC5, the covalent homodimeric EL-EL appeared to be more stable, with reduced cleavage and conserved lipolytic activity. A comparative model obtained using other lipase structures suggests a structure for the head-to-tail EL homodimer that is consistent with the experimental findings.

The preferred lipoprotein substrates for LPL are the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and very low density lipoproteins; the triglyceride lipase activity of LPL is more than 100-fold greater than its phospholipase activity. The primary lipoprotein substrates for HL are chylomicron remnants, intermediate density lipoproteins, and large triglyceridase-enriched HDL; its triglyceride lipase activity is about 20-fold higher than its phospholipase activity.

However, when this portion of the molecule is expressed without the C-terminal domain, it lacks enzymatic activity against phospholipid (13.Gauster M. Hrzenjak A. Schick K. Frank S. J.

Rader, unpublished observations. Thus, the presence of the C-terminal domain is necessary for activity. All three enzymes are glycosylated to varying degrees, and two of the glycosylation sites (one each in the N- and C-terminal domains) are common to all three enzymes (14.Miller G.C. Long C.J.

The present study tested the hypothesis that EL also functions as a head-to-tail dimer. We used PCR to engineer a head-to-tail dimer of two monomeric subunits of EL (EL-EL) in an approach similar to that of Wong et al. (28.Wong H. Yang D. Hill J.S. Davis R.C. Nikazy J. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) for LPL using the same short hinge of 8 amino acids (GSIEGRLE) to create the head-to-tail dimer of EL (Fig. 1). Two cDNAs of human EL were amplified separately by PCR. Each cDNA contained engineered restriction sites to facilitate assembly and subcloning into the expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/myc-His(−)A (Invitrogen). The sense primer of the first cDNA of EL (5′-ACGTTCTAGAGGCAGGATGAGCAACTCCG-3′) contained an XbaI restriction site and the first 13 coding nucleotides of the EL cDNA. The antisense primer of the first cDNA of EL (5′-CGCTCTCGAGACGACCTTCGATGGATCCGGGAAGCTCCACAGTGGGAC-3′) contained the last 20 coding nucleotides of the EL cDNA, a factor Xa site (coding for 8 amino acids, GSIEGRLE), and an XhoI restriction site. The sense primer of the second cDNA of EL (5′-GCGTCTCGAGAGCCCCGTACCTTTTGGTC-3′) contained an XhoI restriction site and the first 19 coding nucleotides of the mature EL protein. The antisense primer of the second cDNA of EL (5′-TGACAAGCTTTCAGGGAAGCTCCACAGTGGGAC-3′) contained the last 23 coding nucleotides of the EL cDNA and a HindIII restriction site. These two PCR products were purified, digested using XbaI, XhoI, and HindIII restriction enzymes, and then ligated using T4 ligase from a rapid ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). The final product contained sequences coding for the signal peptide of EL, the mature EL protein, an 8-amino acid-peptide linker containing a factor Xa site, and another mature EL protein (Fig. 1). To allow comparison of the levels of expression of the dimeric construct (EL-EL) and wild-type EL, we constructed C-terminal myc-His-tagged proteins by inserting the full-length cDNA into pcDNA3.1/myc-His(−)A plasmid expression vector (Invitrogen). The construct was sequenced to confirm accuracy. HEK293 cells and sublines stably expressing profurin or PC5a were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic supplement (Invitrogen). The cells were transfected with EL constructs using LipofectamineTM reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty four h after transfection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 units/ml heparin (Sigma) and incubated for another 24 h. Thirty min prior to harvesting this conditioned medium, more heparin was added to the medium, bringing the final concentration of heparin to 20 units/ml. Conditioned media were collected, subjected to low speed centrifugation, and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. For some experiments where high enzyme activity was required (sucrose gradients and radiation inactivation), the conditioned medium was concentrated 5-fold using an Amicon ultracentrifugal filtration device (30,000 Mr cutoff) (Millipore). The levels of protein expression of wild-type EL and EL-EL were estimated by Western blot. For each experiment, we used conditioned medium from cells transfected to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a negative control. Ten μl of conditioned media were resolved on 10% BisTris or 7% Tris acetate SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected using either a polyclonal rabbit anti-human EL primary antibody specific for a peptide in the N-terminal region or a monoclonal mouse anti-Myc primary antibody (clone 9E10) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Conditioned media from HEK293 cells transfected with GFP and co-transfected with EL-myc-His and EL-FLAG or a 1:1 mixture of media from HEK293 cells, which had been transfected with EL-myc-His or EL-FLAG, were incubated with mouse (or rabbit) anti-Myc (Abcam) or mouse anti-FLAG IgG (Sigma) at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher) for 2 h. Protein G magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were added to each sample, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet were separated after centrifuging for 10 min at 10,000 × g, 4 °C. Pellets were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and eluted from the beads with 4× loading buffer and 10× dithiothreitol (Invitrogen). Western blot analysis of samples was performed using a rabbit anti-EL antibody or a rabbit anti-Myc (Biovision) or a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (HRP conjugate, Sigma). Sucrose gradients were prepared as described (27.Ben-Zeev O. Doolittle M.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 257-266PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–20% sucrose gradients containing 50 mm ammonium hydroxide, pH 8.1, were prepared. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) (110 kDa) was added to each sample to serve as an internal standard. Cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), malate dehydrogenase (74 kDa), and catalase (240 kDa) were centrifuged in two separate tubes and served as external standards. After centrifugation (22 h at 200,000 × g at 4 °C), 600-μl fractions were collected and assayed for enzyme activity and protein concentration. The protein concentration was determined in each fraction of external standards using a commercially available kit (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce). Conditioned medium containing partially cleaved myc-His-tagged EL was prepared by transfection in HEK293 cells as described above. Media containing either uncleaved myc-His-tagged wild-type EL or uncleaved myc-His-tagged EL-EL dimer were prepared in a similar manner by transfection in HEK293 cells that stably express profurin. Apotransferrin (2 mg/ml, Sigma) and G6PDH (4 units/ml, Sigma) were added to the media. Samples of these media (0.55 ml) were placed in glass vials, quick frozen, sealed, and stored at −80 °C. Vials were shipped and returned on dry ice. Irradiations were performed with a linear electron accelerator at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, Bethesda, or at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD. Frozen samples were irradiated at −135 °C with a beam of 13-MeV electrons as described (31.Harmon J.T. Nielsen T.B. Kempner E.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two aliquots not irradiated served as the zero dose controls. Radiation dose was determined with thermoluminescent or alanine dosimeters. Irradiated frozen samples were stored at −80 °C until assayed for triglyceride lipase activity. The activity (A) at each dose was divided by the activity at zero dose (A0) to determine the fractional residual activity at each dose. For each enzyme preparation, the natural logarithm of the fraction remaining was plotted as a function of radiation dose. The slopes of these lines were determined by linear regression (GraphPad Prizm) and were used to calculate molecular mass as described previously (31.Harmon J.T. Nielsen T.B. Kempner E.S. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 65-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The slopes for the inactivation of G6PDH were identical in all sample sets. Emulsions of triolein or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine were used to measure triglyceride lipase or phospholipase activity, respectively (1.McCoy M.G. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Glick J.M.

For the triglyceride lipase assay, the emulsion contained triolein and egg phosphatidylcholine containing glycerol tri[9,10-3H]oleate stabilized with glycerol. For the phospholipase assay, a similar glycerol-stabilized emulsion was used that contained radiolabeled phospholipids ([14C]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) and cholesteryl oleate as the neutral lipid core. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. All enzyme activities are reported as nanomoles of free fatty acid liberated/h-ml conditioned medium as source of enzyme. All assays were done in triplicate. Malate dehydrogenase activity was measured by incubating 2 μl of sample with 294 μl of substrate made of 367.4 μm oxaloacetate and 204 μm NADH in 40 mm Tris-H2SO4, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. The decrease in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. G6PDH activity was measured by incubating 5 μl of sample in a final volume of 200 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADP, and 3.3 mm glucose 6-phosphate for 15 min at 25 °C and monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. The human EL models were generated using the molecular modeling suite MODELLER version 8v1 (Accelrys Discovery Studio, San Diego) and evaluated with MODELLER versions 8v1 and 9v1 (34.Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 35.Fiser A. Sali A.

As input for the modeling algorithm, the human EL protein sequence, NCBI protein data base accession code NP_006024.1, was aligned to the following lipase structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank: Homo sapiens pancreatic lipase and Sus scrofa co-lipase complex (PDB accession code 1N8S), H. sapiens pancreatic lipase and S. scrofa co-lipase complex inhibited by undecane phosphonate methyl ester (PDB accession code 1LPB), and Equus caballus pancreatic lipase (PDB accession code 1HPL). Multiple sequence alignments with the human EL protein sequence and those of the aforementioned three protein structures were generated by ClustalW (EMBL-EBI) using default parameter settings (38.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55757) Google Scholar). The human EL sequence has 27% identity to human pancreatic lipase and 25% identity to horse pancreatic lipase. These identical residues located throughout the crystal structures of the pancreatic lipases served as anchors to guide the modeling of human endothelial lipase. The EL sequence contains 37 residues at the C terminus that were not used in the modeling process because there is no significant sequence homology to the other template lipase structures in this region. The human EL models were evaluated using the discrete optimized protein energy algorithms of MODELLER version 9v1 (39.Shen M.Y. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2507-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). To investigate the model structure in the context of a homodimer, the best scoring human endothelial lipase monomer models were structurally aligned to each monomer of the horse pancreatic lipase homodimer using MacPyMOL version 0.96. To understand the intermolecular interaction of EL, we used two EL constructs, one encoding a FLAG tag and the other a myc-His tag at the C terminus. Neither tag had any effect on EL lipolytic activity (data not shown). Constructs encoding EL-myc-His and EL-FLAG were co-transfected in HEK293 cells. Conditioned medium was harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody to precipitate any Myc-containing proteins. The precipitated proteins were examined by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody as well as an anti-EL antibody specific for a peptide in the N-terminal domain. No immunoreactive bands were detected in conditioned medium from cells transfected with a construct encoding GFP. As shown in Fig. 2, when constructs encoding EL-myc-His and EL-FLAG were co-transfected in HEK293 cells, the anti-FLAG antibody detected FLAG-tagged EL in the material that had been immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, indicating that there was interaction between EL-FLAG and EL-myc-His proteins, consistent with dimer formation. When conditioned medium containing EL-FLAG was mixed with conditioned medium containing EL-myc-His and subsequently immunoprecipitated, no interaction was detected, suggesting that the association between monomeric units occurs intracellularly and that the association between subunits is very strong. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of conditioned medium from cells expressing wild-type EL was used to determine the size of the functional unit of EL. The major peak of the triglyceride lipase activity of EL appeared as a distinct species somewhat smaller than G6PDH (which has a molecular weight of 110,000) as shown in Fig. 3A. A linear relationship was observed when the molecular weights of standard proteins versus sucrose concentrations were plotted (Fig. 3B). The relative molecular weight of the EL functional unit was 94,500, considerably smaller than a dimer of full-length monomers (136 kDa) and larger than a monomer (68 kDa). This functional size is most consistent with partially cleaved forms where part of the cleaved monomer remains associated with an uncleaved monomer (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4A, cleavage products of EL monomer and EL dimer. A schematic diagram is shown of all the potential intermediate forms of EL monomer and EL dimer induced by the proteolytic cleavage of EL by proprotein convertases. All the possible forms varying from uncleaved to partially cleaved and fully cleaved in the case of EL monomer and EL dimer are represented. The relative molecular mass of each of these forms in kDa is shown. B, Western blot of EL and EL-EL detected by an antibody against Myc tag. Expression in HEK293 conditioned media of Myc-tagged EL and EL-EL was detected by Western blot using a mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.

(28.Wong H. Yang D. Hill J.S. Davis R.C. Nikazy J. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) for LPL. The final cDNA product contained sequences coding for the signal peptide of EL, the mature EL protein, the 8-amino acid peptide linker followed by another mature EL protein, and a C-terminal myc-His tag (Fig. 1). The expression of the dimeric construct (EL-EL) was compared with wild-type EL, which was also myc-His-tagged. Western blots of conditioned media of transiently transfected HEK293 cells using an antibody against the Myc tag as primary antibody (Fig. 4B) showed a band corresponding to a full-length monomer (68 kDa) in the case of wild-type EL and a dimer (136 kDa) in the case of EL-EL, as well as the cleavage products that are myc-His-tagged. Although dimeric forms are not always present in Western blots for wild-type EL, a dimeric form and partially cleaved dimer are also visible in the wild-type EL lane. In the Western blot of the same media using an antibody against EL as primary antibody (Fig. 4C), we observed the full-length monomer of wild-type EL (68 kDa) and the full-length dimer of EL-EL (136 kDa), and as expected some cleavage products (20.Jin W. Wang X. Millar J.S. Quertermous T. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of EL-EL we detected cleavage products of intermediate size between a monomer and a dimer corresponding to a monomer plus the N-terminal domain (108 kDa) and a monomer plus the C-terminal domain (96 kDa). We compared the enzymatic activity of wild-type EL and EL-EL using lipid emulsions of triglyceride and phospholipid to measure triglyceride lipase and phospholipase activity, respectively. The EL-EL dimer showed both triglyceride lipase and phospholipase activities. For each transfection, we consistently measured more lipase activity (both triglyceride lipase and phospholipase) in EL-EL despite the protein band in the respective Western blot often appearing of similar or lesser intensity than the band of the full-length wild-type EL (Fig. 4B). The ratio of the triglyceride lipase activity to phospholipase activity (triglyceridase/phospholipase ratio) reflects the substrate specificity of the enzyme and was not significantly different for EL-EL (1.46 ± 0.57) than for EL (1.56 ± 0.24). Thus the EL protein in a dimeric head-to-tail conformation (EL-EL) was active both as a triglyceride lipase and phospholipase. These data are consistent with a model that EL is active as dimer in a head-to-tail conformation. EL is active as a dimer in a head-to-tail conformation, but other intermediate forms could potentially also be active provided that an intact active site is present and preserved. To test that hypothesis, we expressed wild-type EL and EL-EL in HEK293 cells under conditions promoting different levels of cleavage. We used HEK293 cells stably expressing profurin, which has been reported to prevent EL cleavage, or expressing PC5a which has been reported to fully cleave EL (20.Jin W. Wang X. Millar J.S.

https://openalex.org/W2083463425,"The placement of medical research news on a newspaper's front page is intended to gain the public's attention, so it is important to understand the source of the news in terms of research maturity and evidence level.We searched LexisNexis to identify medical research reported on front pages of major newspapers published from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2002. We used MEDLINE and Google Scholar to find journal articles corresponding to the research, and determined their evidence level. Of 734 front-page medical research stories identified, 417 (57%) referred to mature research published in peer-reviewed journals. The remaining 317 stories referred to preliminary findings presented at scientific or press meetings; 144 (45%) of those stories mentioned studies that later matured (i.e. were published in journals within 3 years after news coverage). The evidence-level distribution of the 515 journal articles quoted in news stories reporting on mature research (3% level I, 21% level II, 42% level III, 4% level IV, and 31% level V) differed from that of the 170 reports of preliminary research that later matured (1%, 19%, 35%, 12%, and 33%, respectively; chi-square test, P = .0009). No news stories indicated evidence level. Fewer than 1 in 5 news stories reporting preliminary findings acknowledged the preliminary nature of their content.Only 57% of front-page stories reporting on medical research are based on mature research, which tends to have a higher evidence level than research with preliminary findings. Medical research news should be clearly referenced and state the evidence level and limitations to inform the public of the maturity and quality of the source."
https://openalex.org/W2105056455,"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is a natural infectious agent of mice. Like several other viruses, LDV causes widespread and very rapid but transient activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood. The mechanism of this activation has not been fully described and is the focus of the current studies.A known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is IFNalpha, a cytokine strongly induced by LDV infection. Neutralization of IFNalpha in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro. Since the primary source of virus-induced IFNalpha in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's), we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation. Depletion of pDC's in vivo eradicated both the LDV-induced IFNalpha response and lymphocyte activation. A primary receptor in pDC's for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pattern recognition receptor. Infection of TLR7-knockout mice revealed that both the IFNalpha response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo. Interestingly, virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC-depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFNalpha response.Results indicate that LDV-induced activation of lymphocytes is due to recognition of LDV nucleic acid by TLR7 pattern recognition receptors in pDC's that respond with a lymphocyte-inducing IFNalpha response."
https://openalex.org/W2070036656,"The mechanisms involved in the targeting of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), critical for their functional organization at neuronal synapses, are not well understood. We have identified a novel functional association between α4β2 AChRs and the presynaptic cell adhesion molecule, neurexin-1β. In non-neuronal tsA 201 cells, recombinant neurexin-1β and mature α4β2 AChRs form complexes. α4β2 AChRs and neurexin-1β also coimmunoprecipitate from rat brain lysates. When exogenous α4β2 AChRs and neurexin-1β are coexpressed in hippocampal neurons, they are robustly targeted to hemi-synapses formed between these neurons and cocultured tsA 201 cells expressing neuroligin-1, a postsynaptic binding partner of neurexin-1β. The extent of synaptic targeting is significantly reduced in similar experiments using a mutant neurexin-1β lacking the extracellular domain. Additionally, when α4β2 AChRs, α7 AChRs, and neurexin-1β are coexpressed in the same neuron, only the α4β2 AChR colocalizes with neurexin-1β at presynaptic terminals. Collectively, these data suggest that neurexin-1β targets α4β2 AChRs to presynaptic terminals, which mature by trans-synaptic interactions between neurexins and neuroligins. Interestingly, human neurexin-1 gene dysfunctions have been implicated in nicotine dependence and in autism spectrum disorders. Our results provide novel insights as to possible mechanisms by which dysfunctional neurexins, through downstream effects on α4β2 AChRs, may contribute to the etiology of these neurological disorders.

Additionally, when α4β2 AChRs, α7 AChRs, and neurexin-1β are coexpressed in the same neuron, only the α4β2 AChR colocalizes with neurexin-1β at presynaptic terminals. Collectively, these data suggest that neurexin-1β targets α4β2 AChRs to presynaptic terminals, which mature by trans-synaptic interactions between neurexins and neuroligins. Interestingly, human neurexin-1 gene dysfunctions have been implicated in nicotine dependence and in autism spectrum disorders. Our results provide novel insights as to possible mechanisms by which dysfunctional neurexins, through downstream effects on α4β2 AChRs, may contribute to the etiology of these neurological disorders. The clustering of ion channels or receptors and precise targeting to pre- and postsynaptic specializations in neurons is critical to efficiently regulate synaptic transmission.

These receptors are part of a family of acetylcholine-gated ion channels that are assembled from various combinations of α2–α10 and β2–β4 subunits (3.Millar N.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). AChRs participate in the regulation of locomotion, affect, reward, analgesia, anxiety, learning, and attention (4.Dani J.A.

The α4β2 subtype is the most abundant AChR receptor expressed in the brain. Multiple lines of evidence support a major role for α4β2 AChRs in nicotine addiction. α4β2 AChRs show high affinity for nicotine (6.Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J.M. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3395-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are located on the dopaminergic projections of ventral tegmental area neurons to the medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (7.Charpantier E.

Comp. Neurol. 1989; 284: 314-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β2 AChR subunit knock-out mice lose their sensitivity to nicotine in passive avoidance tasks (9.Picciotto M.R. Zoli M. Léna C. Bessis A. Lallemand Y. Le Novère N. Vincent P. Pich E.M. Brûlet P. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1995; 374: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and show attenuated self-administration of nicotine (10.Picciotto M.R. Zoli M. Rimondini R. Léna C. Marubio L.M. Pich E.M. Fuxe K. Changeux J.P. Nature. 1998; 391: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). α4 AChR subunit knock-out mice also exhibit a loss of tonic control of striatal basal dopamine release (11.Marubio L.M. Gardier A.M. Durier S. David D. Klink R. Arroyo-Jimenez M.M. McIntosh J.M. Rossi F. Champtiaux N. Zoli M. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Finally, experiments with knock-in mice expressing α4β2 AChRs hypersensitive to nicotine demonstrate that α4β2 AChRs indeed mediate the essential features of nicotine addiction including reward, tolerance, and sensitization (12.Tapper A.R. McKinney S.L. Nashmi R. Schwarz J. Deshpande P. Labarca C. Whiteaker P. Marks M.J. Collins A.C. Lester H.A. Science. 2004; 306: 1029-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). High resolution ultrastructural studies show that α4 subunit-containing AChRs are clustered at dopaminergic axonal terminals (13.Arroyo-Jiménez M.M. Bourgeois J.P. Marubio L.M. Le Sourd A.M. Ottersen O.P. Rinvik E. Fairén A. Changeux J.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a sequence motif has been identified within the α4 AChR subunit cytoplasmic domain that is essential for receptor trafficking to axons (14.Xu J. Zhu Y. Heinemann S.F. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9780-9793Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the targeting and clustering of α4β2 AChRs to presynaptic sites in neurons remain elusive. Recently, bi-directional interactions between neurexins and neuroligins have been shown to promote synapse assembly and maturation by fostering pre- and postsynaptic differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 15.Dean C. Dresbach T. Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 21-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16.Craig A.M. Kang Y. Curr. Opin Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 17.Südhof T.C. Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The neurexins are encoded by three genes corresponding to neurexins I–III (18.Missler M. Südhof T.C. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 20-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19.Lisé M.F. El-Husseini A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1833-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), each encoding longer α-neurexins and shorter β-neurexins, because of differential promoter use. Neurexins recruit N- and P/Q-type calcium channels via scaffolding proteins, including calmodulin-associated serine/threonine kinase (20.Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to active zones of presynaptic terminals (21.Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G. Hammer R.E. Gottmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 22.Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Sargsyan V. Aramuni G. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Missler M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4330-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, α-neurexins were shown to specifically induce GABAergic postsynaptic differentiation (23.Kang Y. Zhang X. Dobie F. Wu H. Craig A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2323-2334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Neuroligins, postsynaptic binding partners of neurexins, cluster N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and GABAA receptors by recruiting the scaffolding proteins PSD-95 (post-synaptic density 95) and gephyrin, respectively (24.Nam C.I. Chen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 25.Chih B. Gollan L. Scheiffele P. Neuron. 2006; 51: 171-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neurexins and neuroligins also modulate the postsynaptic clustering of α3-containing AChRs in chick ciliary ganglia (26.Conroy W.G. Nai Q. Ross B. Naughton G. Berg D.K. Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27.Ross B.S. Conroy W.G. Dev. Neurobiol. 2008; 68: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, using multiple experimental strategies, we provide evidence for the formation of complexes between neurexin-1β and α4β2 AChRs and a role for neurexin in the targeting of α4β2 AChRs to presynaptic terminals of neurons. All of the constructs were made by PCR using appropriate pairs of forward and reverse synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Invitrogen) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Rat α4, rat β2, and chicken α7 AChR subunit cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pEF6/Myc-His A as described previously (28.Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.W. Rao J. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mouse neurexin-1β lacking the insert at splice site 4 with an extracellular VSV-G epitope tag at the mature N terminus of the protein (NRX) and mouse neuroligin-1 with an extracellular HA epitope tag at the mature N terminus of the protein (NLG) were kind gifts from Dr. Peter Scheiffele (29.Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The reading frame of full-length mouse NRX (NRX1–447) was amplified by PCR and subcloned between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pEF6A vector. Truncation mutants were also made by PCR to create NRXΔC (NRX1–389) lacking the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain and NRXΔEC (Δ47–360) lacking the entire extracellular domain. Numbering includes the VSV-G tag. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: rat mAbs to the α4 AChR subunit (mAb 299) and to the β2 AChR subunit (mAbs 295 and 270); a mouse mAb to the α7 AChR subunit (mAb 306); a goat polyclonal Ab against the β2 AChR subunit (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) that binds to denatured β2 subunits on immunoblots; rabbit polyclonal Abs against VSV-G (Sigma for immunoblots and Clontech for immunostaining); a mouse monoclonal Ab against HA (AbCam, Cambridge, MA); a goat polyclonal Ab against neurexin I (P-15, sc-14334; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); a mouse monoclonal Ab to neuroligin-1 (Synaptic Systems; Gottingen, Germany); and a mouse monoclonal Ab to synapsin-1 (Synaptic Systems). The bovine anti-goat, goat anti-rat, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs were obtained from Pierce. The Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 594-, and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rat, goat anti-rabbit, and goat anti-mouse secondary Abs were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human tsA 201 cells, a derivative of the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) as previously described (30.Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). tsA 201 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The cultures were prepared essentially as previously described (31.Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi were isolated from embryonic day 18 rat embryos and dissociated by trituration after incubation in 0.25% trypsin/Hanks' balanced salt solution for 15 min at 37 °C (Invitrogen). The cells were plated on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips at 100,000 cells/well and maintained in 500 μl of neurobasal media supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The cells were washed and refed with fresh medium after 16 h. 200 μl of medium was exchanged on DIV 3 and 6–7. The neurons were transfected at DIV 7–10 using the Clontech CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (BD Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA) as described (32.Jiang M. Chen G. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed essentially as previously described (33.Biederer T. Scheiffele P. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After 24 h, transfected tsA 201 cells were coplated at 10,000 cells/well with the neurons (at DIV 12–13), transferred to 30 °C to up-regulate α4β2 AChR expression, and processed for immunocytochemistry at DIV 14–15. Affi-Gel 401 was prepared from Affi-Gel 102 (Bio-Rad). 10 ml of Affi-Gel 102 was washed with 0.5 m NaHCO3, followed by incubation with 10% N-acetyl-dl-homocysteine thiolactone, 0.5 m NaHCO3, pH 8.5, overnight at 4 °C with stirring. The following day, the gel was washed with 0.1 m NaCl and then 0.2 m NaOAc, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. The gel was slurried with deionized H2O, and the pH was adjusted to between 6 and 7. One ml of acetic anhydride was added in five 200-μl aliquots at 10-min intervals, adjusting the pH to between 6 and 7 after each addition with 10 m NaOH. Ten min after the last aliquot was added; the pH was adjusted to 9.5 and incubated for 30 min. The gel was rinsed with deionized H2O until the pH was under 9.0 and then slurried with 20 ml deionized H2O. While stirring, 0.63 g of NaCl, 0.104 g of EDTA, 0.014 g of sodium azide, 0.42 g of Tris, and 55 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol were added. The pH was adjusted to 7.75, and the gel was stored at 4 °C until use. BAC was coupled to Affi-Gel-401 as described (34.Ellena J.F. Blazing M.A. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5523-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). tsA 201 cells were homogenized and incubated in 2% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were incubated with 50 μl of BAC-Affi-Gel 401 overnight at 4 °C. For the negative control, the lysate was incubated with 10 μm nicotine for 15 min prior to the addition of BAC-Affi-Gel 401. The gel was then washed three times with lysis buffer and eluted in sample buffer at 60 °C for 30 min, and then β-mercaptoethanol was added to the eluted samples prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Transfected tsA 201 cells were solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 and subject to pulldowns using the FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) as previously described (30.Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For native AChR pulldowns, the Abs were covalently coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads. Briefly, ∼5 μg of affinity purified anti-β2 (mAb 295) or rat or mouse IgG were incubated with 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Sepharose beads for 2 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.1% azide with gentle rotation. After washing with 200 mm borate buffer + 3 m NaCl, pH 9.0, the beads were incubated with 20 μm dimethylpimelimidate in the 200 mm borate buffer + 3 m NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. After several washes with 200 mm borate buffer + 3 m NaCl, the unreacted sites on the beads were then blocked using 200 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with PBS several times and finally with 200 mm glycine once and then stored at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. Frozen rat brains were homogenized and solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer as previously described (28.Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.W. Rao J. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Detergent-solubilized brain extracts (typically 1–3 ml) were precleared with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose bead slurry and then incubated with 50 μl of mAb covalently cross-linked protein G-Sepharose beads (∼5–10 μg of antibody/50 μl of beads) for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed and eluted with sample buffer (lacking β-mercaptoethanol to avoid reduction of the disulfide linkage of the IgG chains) at 60 °C for 30 min, and then β-mercaptoethanol was added to the eluted samples prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. Following separation using SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with diluted Abs in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk powder. The binding of the primary Abs to proteins was detected using appropriate secondary Abs as previously described (30.Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cell surface α4β2 AChRs and NRX were measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay previously described (28.Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.W. Rao J. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected, tsA 201 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were blocked with 3% BSA/PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-β2 subunit (mAb 295) or anti-VSV-G antibodies in 3% BSA/PBS, washed, fixed with formaldehyde (3%), washed, and blocked again. The cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary Ab for 1 h in the presence of 3% BSA, washed, and incubated with 300 μl of the horseradish peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for 1 h. The absorbance of the supernatant was then measured at 655 nm in a Beckman spectrophotometer. The values obtained using this assay are the mean ± S.E. and were statistically analyzed using an analysis of variance test. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. The nonspecific background to nontransfected cells was typically <0.5% of the total binding observed for transfected cells. For the mixed neuron/tsA 201 cell assays, the cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, Hanks' balanced salt solution (with Ca2+ and Mg2+), pH 7.3 (15 min at room temperature), blocked with 3% normal goat serum, 3% BSA, Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.2% Triton X-100 (30 min at room temperature), and incubated with the appropriate primary (overnight at 4 °C) and secondary (90 min at room temperature) antibodies. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were visualized using an Olympus IX81 spinning disc confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with a xenon arc illumination source through a 60× (numerical aperture, 1.42) or 40× (numerical aperture, 1.35) Olympus oil immersion objective. Single-plane fluorescence images were captured using a Hamamatsu EM camera, and the images were processed using the Slide Book version 4.2 software. When the observed fluorescence intensity of antibody staining observed was weak, post acquisition intensities of images were adjusted in the different channels using the gamma function of the slide book software to enhance visibility of axons and terminal in the figures shown. In all cases, the essential features of the original images were not altered. The figures were then processed with Adobe Photoshop CS. Targeting quantification was determined from 29–71 cells/condition from three independent experiments. Random neuroligin-1-expressing cells were imaged, and the targeting of the constructs was quantified as the number of neurons with targeting/number of neuroligin-1 cells contacted. The values obtained are the means ± S.E. and were statistically analyzed by a Student's t test. α4β2 AChRs in the central nervous system are targeted to presynaptic terminals, but the mechanisms underlying their recruitment remain unclear. We investigated the possibility that β-neurexins, which are also highly enriched at axon terminals, have a functional role in the synaptic targeting of α4β2 AChRs. A neurexin-1β isoform was tested in subsequent functional studies with recombinant α4β2 AChRs. To determine whether NRX forms complexes with recombinant α4β2 AChRs, we coexpressed VSV-G-tagged neurexin-1β (NRX) with the α4 and the N-terminal FLAG-tagged β2 AChR subunits (labeled as α4β2FLAG AChRs) by transfecting tsA 201 cells with their respective cDNAs. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, 1% Nonidet P-40-solubilized cell lysates were incubated with FLAG M2 antibody covalently attached to agarose beads. Proteins eluted from these beads were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analyses using Abs recognizing the α4 AChR subunit, the β2 AChR subunit, and the VSV-G tag. NRX was found in complexes with Nonidet P-40-solubilized α4β2FLAG AChRs (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the complex formation between NRX and α4β2 AChRs is not an artifact of detergent solubilization, we mixed Nonidet P-40-solubilized extracts from cells expressing NRX alone and cells expressing α4β2FLAG AChRs alone in a pulldown experiment using FLAG M2 beads (Fig. 1B). No NRX was coimmunoprecipitated with α4β2FLAG AChRs, indicating that the complex formation between NRX and α4β2 AChRs was not induced by detergent solubilization but instead was due to complex formation within the cell membrane. To further verify that NRX forms complexes with assembled α4β2 AChRs, tsA 201 cells were cotransfected with untagged α4β2 AChRs and NRX and processed as in Fig. 1A. However, in this case (Fig. 1C), the α4β2 AChRs and their associated proteins were captured with a ligand that has a high affinity for α4β2 AChRs (BAC-conjugated to Affi-Gel 401 resin) (35.Anand R. Conroy W.G. Schoepfer R. Whiting P. Lindstrom J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11192-11198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When α4β2 AChRs and NRX were coexpressed, BAC-conjugated beads captured both α4 and β2 AChR subunits, as well as NRX (Fig. 1C, BAC affinity capture, first lane). As a control for BAC capture specificity, lysates were incubated with 10 μm nicotine for 15 min prior to the addition of the BAC-coupled beads. Pretreatment with nicotine blocked the binding of BAC to the receptor complex (Fig. 1C, BAC, second lane). Additionally, BAC failed to capture the α4 AChR subunit if it was not coexpressed with the β2 AChR subunit (data not shown), indicating that only fully formed pentamers are affinity-purified. When the N-terminal HA-tagged neuroligin-1 (NLG), a trans-synaptic binding partner of NRX, was coexpressed with α4β2 AChRs and incubated with BAC, the anti-HA antibody did not detect NLG in the pulldown (Fig. 1C, BAC, third lane), suggesting that the complex formation between NRX and α4β2 AChRs is specific. To determine whether neurexin-1β forms complexes with native α4β2 AChRs, as it does with recombinant α4β2 AChRs, 1% Nonidet P-40-solubilized rat brain membrane extracts were incubated with a β2 AChR subunit-specific mAb (mAb 295 or 270) or nonspecific rat IgGs (as a control), and the eluates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using Abs to the α4 AChR subunit, the β2 AChR subunit, and neurexin-1 (that was reported to cross-react with both the 1α and 1β isoforms). Both α4 and β2 AChR subunits are captured by the anti-β2 antibody. Note that the endogeneous levels of α4β2 AChRs in the lysates lanes of the blot are below the threshold for detection by the anti-α4 and anti-β2 AChR antibodies (Fig. 2A). The anti-neurexin antibody (P-15) detects a ∼66-kDa band in both the lysate lane and the β2 immunoprecipitation lane (Fig. 2A, IP, NRX). No band of this size was observed in the pulldown using the nonspecific IgG as a control. Furthermore, no bands corresponding to neurexin-1α isoforms expected at ∼165 kDa were observed in either the lysates or the pulldowns (Fig. 2A). Hence, we were unable to experimentally determine whether other neurexin-1α isoforms also form complexes with the α4β2 AChRs. When the immunoblots were probed with an anti-neuroligin-1 Ab, a strong band of the expected size (∼110 kDa) was detected in the lysate but was absent in the precipitate captured with the anti-β2 AChR antibody (Fig. 2B). Additionally, an antibody against N-cadherin, a protein expressed in both pre- and post-synaptic membranes, did not detect this protein in the pulldown. These data suggest that neurexin-1β and the α4β2 AChRs are present in specific complexes in vivo. Because the evidence that neurexins form complexes with native α4β2 AChRs relied on the use of a commercially generated anti-neurexin goat polyclonal antiserum (P-15, sc-1334; Santa Cruz) that has not been extensively characterized by other investigators, we additionally verified that this antiserum could recognize recombinant NRX expressed in tsA 201 cells (Fig. 2C). Equal amounts of samples from two eluates of pulldown experiments, one from cells coexpressing α4β2FLAG AChRs and VSV-G-tagged NRX and another from cells coexpressing α4β2FLAG AChRs and VSV-G-tagged NRX lacking its C terminus (NRXΔC), were loaded in parallel, and two sets of blots were probed with neurexin I or VSV-G antiserum. The results show that the neurexin I antiserum recognized both NRX and NRXΔC and that this antiserum weakly binds full-length NRX but is specific in its binding. Stronger reactivity of the Abs with the NRXΔC compared with the full-length NRX is observed possibly because truncation of the C terminus in the NRXΔC construct facilitates increased Ab access to highly antigenic terminal residues of the peptide epitope originally used to raise this antiserum. It is possible that our inability to detect the neurexin-1α isoforms may also be due to conformational masking of this epitope by the extracellular domains of the neurexin-1α isoforms. To investigate the functional significance of the interaction of NRX with the α4β2 AChRs, we first determined whether it affected the steady state levels of recombinant α4 or β2 AChR subunits. Either the pEF6A vector (as a control) or NRX was coexpressed in tsA 201 cells with α4β2 AChRs, and 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analyses using Abs to the α4 and β2 AChR subunits. No significant change in the steady state levels of the α4 or β2 AChR subunits was observed, suggesting that NRX does not play a role in the early events that regulate AChR subunit stability (Fig. 3A). Next, we assessed whether coexpression of NRX with α4β2 AChRs altered the steady state levels of either the α4β2 AChRs or NRX itself on cell surface membranes. Surface expression of the α4β2 AChRs was measured using an Ab to the extracellular domain of the β2 AChR subunit (mAb 295) in conjunction with a previously described enzyme-linked immunoassay (28.Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.W. Rao J. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Similarly, the surface expression level of the NRX was measured with this same assay but using an Ab to the VSV-G tag. The coexpression of α4β2 AChRs with NRX did not significantly change their surface expression levels compared with when they were expressed alone (Fig. 3, B and C). The results suggest that NRX does not affect the trafficking of α4β2 AChRs to the cell surface membrane and vice versa and thus their rate"
https://openalex.org/W2085083968,"Background Therapeutic antibody development is one of the fastest growing areas of the pharmaceutical industry. Generating high-quality monoclonal antibodies against a given therapeutic target is very crucial for the success of the drug development. However, due to immune tolerance, some proteins that are highly conserved between mice and humans are not very immunogenic in mice, making it difficult to generate antibodies using a conventional approach. Methodology/Principal Findings In this report, the impaired immune tolerance of NZB/W mice was exploited to generate monoclonal antibodies against highly conserved or self-antigens. Using two highly conserved human antigens (MIF and HMGB1) and one mouse self-antigen (TNF-alpha) as examples, we demonstrate here that multiple clones of high affinity, highly specific antibodies with desired biological activities can be generated, using the NZB/W mouse as the immunization host and a T cell-specific tag fused to a recombinant antigen to stimulate the immune system. Conclusions/Significance We developed an efficient and universal method for generating surrogate or therapeutic antibodies against “difficult antigens” to facilitate the development of therapeutic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2090164223,"Background Recent studies have emphasized the role of psychosocial stressors as a determinant of asthma, and neighborhoods can be a potential source of such stressors. We investigated the association between parental perception of neighborhood safety and reported lifetime asthma among children. Methodology/Principal Findings Data for the study came from the 2003–04 National Survey of Children Health (NSCH); a nationally representative cross-sectional sample of children aged 0–17 years. Demographic, socioeconomic and behavioral covariates were included in the study. Models were estimated after taking account of weighting and complex survey design. Parental report of whether the child has ever been diagnosed with asthma by a physician was used to define the outcome. Parental report of perception of neighborhood safety was the main exposure. In unadjusted models, the odds ratio (OR) for reporting asthma associated with living in neighborhoods that were perceived to be sometimes or never safe was 1.36 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.21, 1.53) compared to living in neighborhoods that were perceived to be always safe. Adjusting for covariates including exposure to second hand tobacco smoke, mother's self-rated health, child's physical activity and television viewing attenuated this association (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08, 1.43). In adjusted models, the increased odds ratio for reporting asthma was also higher among those who perceived neighborhoods as being usually safe (OR 1.15 95% CI 1.06, 1.26), as compared to always safe, suggestive of a dose-response relationship, with the differentials for usually safe and never safe being statistically significant (p = 0.009). Conclusion Psychosocial stressors may be important risk factors that may impact the pathogenesis of asthma and/or contribute to asthma morbidity by triggering exacerbations through neuroimmunologic mechanisms, as well as social mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2110106284,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rho1 controls actin polarization and cell wall expansion. When cells are exposed to various environmental stresses that perturb the cell wall, Rho1 activates Pkc1, a mammalian Protein Kinase C homologue, and Mpk1, a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), resulting in actin depolarization and cell wall remodeling. In this study, we demonstrate a novel feedback loop in this Rho1-mediated Pkc1-MAPK pathway that involves regulation of Rom2, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Rho1, by Mpk1, the end kinase of the pathway. This previously unrecognized Mpk1-dependent feedback is a critical step in regulating Rho1 function. Activation of this feedback mechanism is responsible for redistribution of Rom2 and cell wall synthesis activity from the bud to cell periphery under stress conditions. It is also required for terminating Rho1 activity toward the Pkc1-MAPK pathway and for repolarizing actin cytoskeleton and restoring growth after the stressed cells become adapted."
https://openalex.org/W1985840481,"Background The serine protease autotransporter EspP is a proposed virulence factor of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). We recently distinguished four EspP subtypes (EspPα, EspPβ, EspPγ, and EspPδ), which display large differences in transport and proteolytic activities and differ widely concerning their distribution within the STEC population. The mechanisms underlying these functional variations in EspP subtypes are, however, unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings The structural basis of proteolytic and autotransport activity was investigated using transposon-based linker scanning mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis and structure-function analysis derived from homology modelling of the EspP passenger domain. Transposon mutagenesis of the passenger domain inactivated autotransport when pentapeptide linker insertions occurred in regions essential for overall correct folding or in a loop protruding from the β-helical core. Loss of proteolytic function was limited to mutations in Domain 1 in the N-terminal third of the EspP passenger. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that His127, Asp156 and Ser263 in Domain 1 form the catalytic triad of EspP. Conclusions/Significance Our data indicate that in EspP i) the correct formation of the tertiary structure of the passenger domain is essential for efficient autotransport, and ii) an elastase-like serine protease domain in the N-terminal Domain 1 is responsible for the proteolytic phenotype. Lack of stabilizing interactions of Domain 1 with the core structure of the passenger domain ablates proteolytic activity in subtypes EspPβ and EspPδ."
https://openalex.org/W1968847161,"YVH1 was one of the first eukaryotic dual specificity phosphatases cloned, and orthologues poses a unique C-terminal zinc-coordinating domain in addition to a cysteine-based phosphatase domain. Our recent results revealed that human YVH1 (hYVH1) protects cells from oxidative stress. This function requires phosphatase activity and the zinc binding domain. This current study provides evidence that the thiol-rich zinc-coordinating domain may act as a redox sensor to impede the active site cysteine from inactivating oxidation. Furthermore, using differential thiol labeling and mass spectrometry, it was determined that hYVH1 forms intramolecular disulfide bonds at the catalytic cleft as well as within the zinc binding domain to avoid irreversible inactivation during severe oxidative stress. Importantly, zinc ejection is readily reversible and required for hYVH1 activity upon returning to favorable conditions. This inimitable mechanism provides a means for hYVH1 to remain functionally responsive for protecting cells during oxidative stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1992674584,"Recent findings indicate that certain classes of hypnotics that target GABA(A) receptors impair sleep-dependent brain plasticity. However, the effects of hypnotics acting at monoamine receptors (e.g., the antidepressant trazodone) on this process are unknown. We therefore assessed the effects of commonly-prescribed medications for the treatment of insomnia (trazodone and the non-benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor agonists zaleplon and eszopiclone) in a canonical model of sleep-dependent, in vivo synaptic plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) known as ocular dominance plasticity.After a 6-h baseline period of sleep/wake polysomnographic recording, cats underwent 6 h of continuous waking combined with monocular deprivation (MD) to trigger synaptic remodeling. Cats subsequently received an i.p. injection of either vehicle, trazodone (10 mg/kg), zaleplon (10 mg/kg), or eszopiclone (1-10 mg/kg), and were allowed an 8-h period of post-MD sleep before ocular dominance plasticity was assessed. We found that while zaleplon and eszopiclone had profound effects on sleeping cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, only trazodone (which did not alter EEG activity) significantly impaired sleep-dependent consolidation of ocular dominance plasticity. This was associated with deficits in both the normal depression of V1 neuronal responses to deprived-eye stimulation, and potentiation of responses to non-deprived eye stimulation, which accompany ocular dominance plasticity.Taken together, our data suggest that the monoamine receptors targeted by trazodone play an important role in sleep-dependent consolidation of synaptic plasticity. They also demonstrate that changes in sleep architecture are not necessarily reliable predictors of how hypnotics affect sleep-dependent neural functions."
https://openalex.org/W2079053528,"Adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells express a cAMP-activated guanine nucleotide exchange protein (Epac2) that may function in ACTH-stimulated cortisol synthesis. Experiments were done to determine whether cAMP analogs that selectively activate Epacs could induce cortisol synthesis and the expression of genes coding for steroidogenic proteins in bovine AZF cells. Treatment of AZF cells with the Epac-selective cAMP analog (ESCA) 8CPT-2'-OMe-cAMP induced large (>100 fold), concentration-dependent, delayed increases in cortisol synthesis and the expression of mRNAs coding for the steroid hydroxylases CYP11a1, CYP17, CYP21, and the steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR). However, a non-hydrolyzable analog of this ESCA, Sp-8CPT-2'-OMe-cAMP, failed to stimulate cortisol production even at concentrations that activated Rap1, a downstream effector of Epac2. Accordingly, putative metabolites of 8CPT-2'-OMe-cAMP, including 8CPT-2'-OMe-5'AMP, 8CPT-2'-OMe-adenosine, and 8CPT-adenine all induced cortisol synthesis and steroid hydroxylase mRNA expression with a temporal pattern, potency, and effectiveness similar to the parent compound. At concentrations that markedly stimulated cortisol production, none of these metabolites significantly activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). These results show that one or more metabolites of the ESCA 8CPT-2'-OMe-cAMP induce cortico-steroidogenesis by activating a panel of genes that code for steroidogenic proteins. The remarkable increases in cortisol synthesis observed in this study appear to be mediated by a novel cAMP-, Epac- and PKA-independent signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2159926305,"SsgA-like proteins (SALPs) are a family of homologous cell division-related proteins that occur exclusively in morphologically complex actinomycetes. We show that SsgB, a subfamily of SALPs, is the archetypal SALP that is functionally conserved in all sporulating actinomycetes. Sporulation-specific cell division of Streptomyces coelicolor ssgB mutants is restored by introduction of distant ssgB orthologues from other actinomycetes. Interestingly, the number of septa (and spores) of the complemented null mutants is dictated by the specific ssgB orthologue that is expressed.

The structure revealed similarities to a class of eukaryotic “whirly” single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding proteins. However, the electro-negative surface of the SALPs suggests that neither SsgB nor any of the other SALPs are likely to interact with nucleotide substrates.

The mechanisms governing the correct timing and localization of cell division is one of the most studied topics in cell biology. In unicellular bacteria like Escherichia coli, cell division occurs at the mid-cell position, away from the chromosomes (1Errington J. Daniel R.A. Scheffers D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2Goehring N.W. Beckwith J. Curr.

Microbiol. 2005; 3: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The key step in this process is the appropriate timing and localization of cell division protein FtsZ to the future septum site, followed by polymerization to the Z-ring and sequential recruitment of the divisome components (1Errington J. Daniel R.A. Scheffers D.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 4Bramhill D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). One of the major advances in our understanding of the cell division process and, in particular, of the function of FtsZ came from elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of FtsZ, which showed striking similarity to the eukaryotic protein tubulin, despite very low sequence similarity (5Löwe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Such prokaryotic ancestry was later also revealed for the cytoskeletal proteins MreB and Mbl, which belong to the actin family (6Löwe J. van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 177-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and underscored the notion of generally conserved principles in cytokinesis. Spore-forming Gram-positive Streptomyces bacteria are an important source of clinically useful antibiotics and anticancer agents (8Hopwood D.A. Streptomyces in Nature and Medicine: the Antibiotic Makers. Oxford University Press, New York2007Google Scholar). In these morphologically complex microorganisms, cell division is distinctly different from that in unicellular bacteria in several ways. For one, they are the only known organisms where FtsZ and MreB are both dispensable for growth (9Mazza P. Noens E.E. Schirner K. Grantcharova N. Mommaas A.M. Koerten H.K. Muth G.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which makes streptomycetes ideal for the study of cytokinesis. Streptomycetes have a complex life cycle that is mechanistically very similar to filamentous fungi, in producing a mycelium and propagating by sporulation (11Elliot M.A. Buttner M.J. Nodwell J.R. Whitworth D.E. Myxobacteria: Multicellularity and Differentiation. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2008: 419-438Google Scholar, 12Chater K.F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). During sporulation, the cell division machinery produces up to 100 septa simultaneously, spaced at around 1 μm, resulting in long chains of uniform and unigenomic spores (10McCormick J.R. Su E.P. Driks A. Losick R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Flärdh K. Leibovitz E. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Mol.

Besides the simultaneous production of multiple septa, cell division in mycelial actinomycetes also differs from that in other bacteria at the molecular level; actinomycetes lack orthologues of MinC and MinE for septum site localization (15Marston A.L. Thomaides H.B. Edwards D.H. Sharpe M.E. Errington J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3419-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 16Autret S. Errington J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 10-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as well as the nucleoid occlusion system Noc and Z-ring anchoring proteins, such as FtsA and ZipA (1Errington J.

Struct. 2004; 33: 177-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Instead, several unique protein families have been identified that play a role in the control of cell division, including CrgA and the SsgA-like proteins (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Del Sol R. Mullins J.G. Grantcharova N. Flärdh K. Dyson P. J.

However, molecular details of their mode of action are so far lacking. The SsgA (sporulation of Streptomyces griseus)-like proteins (SALPs) 3The abbreviations used are:SALPSsgA-like family of proteinsMADmultiwavelength anomalous diffractionTCEPtris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloridessDNAsingle-stranded DNAgRNAguide RNAPIpropidium iodineSytoSyto-82 Orange.are small (around 130–140 residues), actinomycete-specific proteins, which control sporulation-related processes in streptomycetes (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P.

SsgA and SsgB are essential for sporulation of S. coelicolor (21Keijser B.J. Noens E.E. Kraal B. Koerten H.K. van Wezel G.P. FEMS Microbiol.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5653-5662Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SALPs are involved in the control of cell wall-related events, such as septum localization and synthesis, thickening of the spore wall, and autolytic spore separation (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Noens E.E. Mersinias V. Traag B.A. Smith C.P. Koerten H.K. van Wezel G.P. Mol.

Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The morphological complexity of actinomycetes apparently correlates to the number of SALP homologues in each organism, with one paralogue in single spore-forming actinomycetes (e.g. Salinispora or Thermobifida) and up to seven in multispore formers (two in erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea, 3–5 in Frankia, and 6–7 in Streptomyces) (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most SALPs can be assigned to three subfamilies (SsgA, SsgBG, and SsgDE) based on phylogenetic analysis (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At present, there are no functional homologues for the SALPs, and structural information is lacking. To advance our understanding of how SALPs function at the molecular level and to provide a structural template for a unique protein family without obvious relatives in any other organism, we selected the single SALP homologue from the thermophilic soil bacterium Thermobifida fusca (a major degrader of plant cell walls used in waste remediation (24Lykidis A.

In this work, we show that SsgB is most likely the archetypical SALP that occurs in morphologically complex actinomycetes, with an evolutionarily conserved function in the control of development. The three-dimensional structure of the SsgB orthologue from T. fusca was determined and revealed significant structural similarity to a eukaryotic family of ssDNA/gRNA-binding proteins. However, the structure and experimental data both suggest that SALPs probably interact with protein ligands through a hydrophobic region on their surface. E. coli K-12 strains JM109 (25Sambrook J.

For selection of plasmids in E. coli, ampicillin was used, and chloramphenicol was added for ET12567 transformants. For selection in S. coelicolor, we used thiostrepton for pHJL401 and derivatives. Fragments of ∼900 bp harboring the SALP-encoding genes and flanking regions from Salinispora tropica (designated ssgB(Stro)) or from Sacch. erythraea (ssgB(Sery) and SACE5535) (see supplemental Table S3) were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotide pairs SalTr_BF/SalTr_BR, Sery_BF/Sery_BR or Sery_2F/Sery_2R (supplemental Table S2), respectively. Genomic DNA from S. tropica was a kind gift from Paul Jensen (University of California San Diego). PCR products were cloned as EcoRI/BamHI-digested (for ssgB(Sery)) or EcoRI-HindIII-digested (for ssgB(Stro) and for SACE5535) fragments into pHJL401 digested with the same enzymes, resulting in pGWS271 (ssgB(Stro)), pGWS294 (ssgB(Sery)), and pGWS295 (SACE5535) (S1). For the precise sequences of the inserts, see supplemental Fig. S1. To ensure proper expression, the open reading frames of the ssg orthologues from Kineococcus radiotolerans (ssgB(Krad)), Thermobifida fusca (ssgB(Tfus)), and Frankia sp. CcI3 (ssgB(Fran)) and a second SALP-encoding gene from Frankia sp. CcI3 (Francci3_3418) (see supplemental Table S3) were fused to the S. coelicolor ssgB promoter region (nucleotides −171 to −1 relative to the ATG start codon of ssgB (31Kormanec J. Sevcikova B. Mol.

The exact sequences of the inserts of all five constructs are presented as supplemental Fig. S1. Sequences were designed so as to ensure that the promoter sequence was fused to the most likely start codon (nucleotide position 3147086 for ssgB(Krad), 2471763 for ssgB(Tfus), 1632970 for ssgB(Fran), and 4062696 for Francci3_3418 on their respective genomes), based on sequence homology with Streptomyces ssgB. EcoRI/HindIII-digested fragments were cloned into pHJL401 digested with the same enzymes, resulting in pGWS299, pGWS554, pGWS555, and pGWS556 (supplemental Table S1). Strains were grown against coverslips inserted into solid SFM agar plates, as described previously (32Noens E.E. Mersinias V. Willemse J. Traag B.A. Laing E. Chater K.F. Smith C.P. Koerten H.K. van Wezel G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 1244-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After 7 days, spore formation was assessed by phase-contrast light microscopy. For visualization, a Zeiss standard 25 phase-contrast light microscope was used. DNA in spore chains was stained with a mixture of the membrane-impermeant fluorescent dye propidium iodine (PI) (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) and the membrane-permeant Syto-82 Orange (8 μm) (Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed with an Olympus BH2 fluorescence microscope using a 495-nm band pass filter and a 515-nm long pass filter and a 505-nm dichroic mirror in between. In this way, a single image can be made where DNA-bound PI emits a red-colored and DNA-bound Syto-82 emits a green-colored fluorescent signal. Morphological studies on surface-grown aerial hyphae and/or spores by cryo-scanning electron microscopy were performed using a JEOL JSM6700F scanning electron microscope, as described previously (21Keijser B.J.

The ssgB gene from T. fusca YX-ER1 (GenBankTM, YP_290167.1; GI, 72162510; Swiss-Prot, Q47N25) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using PfuTurbo (Stratagene) and primers corresponding to the predicted 5′- and 3′-ends. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pSpeedET, which encodes an expression and purification tag, followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (MGSDKIHHHHHHENLYFQG) at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. The cloning junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein expression was performed in a selenomethionine-containing medium using the E. coli strain GeneHogs (Invitrogen). At the end of fermentation, lysozyme was added to the culture to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml, and the cells were harvested. After one freeze/thaw cycle, the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm TCEP) and passed through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 32,500 × g for 30 min and loaded onto nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The resin was washed with wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm TCEP), and the protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm TCEP). The eluate was buffer-exchanged with HEPES crystallization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 1 mm TCEP) using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and treated with 1 mg of tobacco etch virus protease per 15 mg of eluted protein. The digested eluate was passed over nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with HEPES crystallization buffer, and the resin was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through and wash fractions were combined and concentrated for crystallization assays to 14.4 mg/ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore). SsgB(Tfus) was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method with standard Joint Center for Structural Genomics crystallization protocols (33Santarsiero B.D. Yegian D.T. Lee C.C.

Miller M.D. Deacon A.M. Phizackerley R.P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2002; 35: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (Menlo Park, CA). The crystallization reagent contained 40% (v/v) 1,2-propanediol and 0.1 m acetate, pH 4.5. No additional cryoprotectant was added to the crystal. Diffraction images were initially indexed in tetragonal space group P4, and subsequent structure solution identified the space group as P41 (Table 1). The molecular weight and oligomeric state of SsgB(Tfus) were determined using a PROTEIN KW-803 column (Shodex) precalibrated with gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad). The mobile phase consisted of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics (Protein Data Bank code 3cm1)ParameterValueSpace groupP41Unit cella = b = 64.8 Å, c = 130.6 Åλ1 MADSeλ2 MADSeλ3 MADSeData collectionWavelength (Å)0.91840.97930.9790Resolution range (Å)46.0–2.646.0–2.746.0–2.7No. of observations62,69055,95656,250No. of unique reflections16,52714,74114,382Completeness (%)99.5 (99.3)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.99.6 (100)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.99.6 (99.9)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.Mean I/σ(I)15.0 (2.0)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.16.0 (2.7)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.15.0 (2.3)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.Rsym on I (%)bRsym = Σ|Ii − 〈Ii〉|/Σ|Ii|, where Ii is the scaled intensity of the ith measurement, and 〈Ii〉 is the mean intensity for that reflection.4.6 (72)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.4.4 (52)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.4.9 (63)aHighest resolution shell in parentheses.Model and refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)46.0–2.6Data set used in refinementλ1 MADSeNo. of reflections (total)16,493Cut-off criteria|F| > 0No. of reflections (test)846RcrystcRcryst = Σ‖Fo| − |Fc‖/Σ|Fo|, where Fc and Fo are the calculated and observed structure factor amplitudes, respectively.0.23Completeness (% total)99.4RfreedRfree as for Rcryst, but for 5.0% of the total reflections chosen at random and omitted from refinement.0.27Stereochemical parameters; restraints (r.m.s. observed)Bond lengths (Å)0.011Bond angles (degrees)1.41Average isotropic B-value (Å2)88.7eThis value represents the total B that includes TLS and residual B components.

Open table in a new tab Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 11-1. The data were collected at wavelengths corresponding to the high energy remote (λ1), inflection (λ2), and peak (λ3) of a selenium MAD experiment. The data sets were collected at 100 K using a MarCCD 325 detector (Rayonix). The data processing and structure solution were performed using an automatic structure solution pipeline developed at the Joint Center for Structural Genomics. The MAD data were integrated and reduced using XDS and then scaled with the program XSCALE (35Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). Selenium sites were located with SHELXD (36Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Phase refinement and automatic model building were performed using autoSHARP (37Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol.

Model completion and refinement were performed with COOT (39Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Independently, the structure was also solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction by the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics). Data were reduced, and the structure was solved at 2.75 Å with the HKL-3000 package (42Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar) using data previously collected on the ID-19 beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. Refinement was performed in an analogous way, as described above. The refined model was similar to the one refined using the higher resolution data presented here. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the model was accomplished using MolProbity (43Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Snoeyink J.

All molecular graphs were prepared with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific) unless specifically stated. The electrostatic potential in Fig. 4C was calculated using the program APBS (44Baker N.A. Sept D.

The gene organization around the ssgB genes from Streptomyces species is similar to that of the genetic loci of the single ssg genes from T. fusca, Kineococcus radiotolerans, Nocardioides sp. JS614, Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Salinispora tropica and Salinispora arenicola and to one of the ssg genes from Frankia species alni, CcI3, and EAN1pec and from Sacch. erythraea (Fig. 1). Hence, gene synteny evidence suggests that the ssg genes have been derived from spread and/or duplication of an ancestral ssgB gene in actinomycetes (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This gene synteny includes a gene for tRNAVal upstream of ssgB in all genera and at least three downstream-located tRNA genes (typically specifying tRNAGly, tRNACys, and tRNAVal) in all species except Salinispora. Furthermore, several conserved open reading frames are typically found in the vicinity of ssgB orthologues, including homologues of the S. coelicolor open reading frames SCO1531 for a threonine tRNA synthetase and SCO1540 for a conserved actinobacterial transmembrane protein (Pfam 09656) with three transmembrane domains (Fig. 1). As an exception, despite the gene synteny similarities, phylogenetic analysis places the SALP from A. cellulolyticus outside the SsgBG branch of the SALPs (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that this protein functions as an SsgB orthologue in vivo. Studies on the horizontal transfer of pathogenicity islands in bacteria suggest that tRNA loci are common sites for the integration of foreign DNA sequences (45Ochman H. Lawrence J.G. Groisman E.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar). Another striking feature of SsgB orthologues is that they are 99–100% conserved within the same species, which is the case in all streptomycetes (10 orthologues), in Frankia species (three orthologues), and in Salinispora (two orthologues). In all cases, no more than a single non-conservative amino acid change is afforded close to the C-terminal end, whereas at the nucleotide level, a much higher divergence is found. To establish whether more divergent SsgB proteins from various actinomycetes have functional overlap with SsgB from S. coelicolor, the respective genes were introduced into the S. coelicolor ssgB null mutant GSB1 (21Keijser B.J. Noens E.E. Kraal B. Koerten H.K. van Wezel G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 225: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to analyze their ability to restore sporulation. Low copy number plasmids based on pHJL401 were constructed, containing the ssgB orthologues from Frankia Cci3 (ssgB(Fran); pGWS555), K. radiotolerans (ssgB(Krad); pGWS299), Sacch. erythraea (ssgB(Sery); pGWS294), S. tropica (ssgB(Stro); pGWS271), or T. fusca (ssgB(Tfus); pGWS554). Additionally, we introduced the non-orthologous ssg genes from Sacch. erythraea (SACE5535) and from Frankia sp. CcI3 (Francci3_3418), which do not belong to the SsgBG subfamily (17Traag B.A. van Wezel G.P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2008; 94: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Details of the exact constructs are presented under “Experimental Procedures,” and the precise DNA sequences of the inserts and the predicted gene products are presented in supplemental Fig. S1. These constructs and the control plasmid (pHJL401 without insert) were individually introduced into the S. coelicolor ssgB mutant GSB1 (21Keijser B.J. Noens E.E. Kraal B. Koerten H.K. van Wezel G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 225: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) by transformation of protoplasts. Mutants of S. coelicolor that produce aerial hyphae but fail to sporulate are called whi or white mutants, since they lack the gray spore pigment WhiE (46Chater K.F. J. Gen.

https://openalex.org/W2162674304,"Oxygen metabolism is a strong predictor of the general health and fitness of an organism. In this study, we hypothesized that a divergence in intrinsic aerobic fitness would co-segregate with susceptibility for cardiovascular dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, cardiac function was assessed in rats specifically selected over nineteen generations for their low (LCR) and high (HCR) intrinsic aerobic running capacity. As an integrative marker of native aerobic capacity, run time to exhaustion between LCR and HCR rats had markedly diverged by 436% at generation nineteen of artificial selection. In vivo assessment of baseline cardiac function by echocardiography and catheter-based conductance micromanometry showed no marked difference in cardiac performance. However, when challenged by exposure to acute hypoxia, cardiac pump failure occurred significantly earlier in LCR rats compared to HCR animals. Acute cardiac decompensation in LCR rats was exclusively due to the development of intractable irregular ventricular contractions. Analysis of isolated cardiac myocytes showed significantly slower sarcomeric relaxation and delayed kinetics of calcium cycling in LCR myocytes compared to HCR myocytes. This study also revealed that artificial selection for low native aerobic capacity is a novel pathologic stimulus that results in myosin heavy chain isoform switching in the heart as shown by increased levels of β-MHC in LCR rats. Together, these results provide evidence that alterations in sub-cellular calcium handling and MHC isoform composition are associated with susceptibility to compensatory cardiac remodeling and hypoxia induced pump failure in animals with low intrinsic aerobic capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2020040257,"The translocator protein (TSPO), previously designated as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a protein mainly located in the outer mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotic cells. TSPO is implicated in major physiological functions and functionally associated with other proteins such as the voltage-dependent anionic channel, also designated as mitochondrial porin. Surprisingly, a TSPO-related protein was identified in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides but it was initially considered as a relict of evolution. In the present study we cloned a tspO gene in Pseudomonas fluorescens MF37, a non-photosynthetic eubacterium and we used bioinformatics tools to identify TSPO in the genome of 97 other bacteria. P. fluorescens TSPO was recognized by antibodies against mouse protein and by PK 11195, an artificial ligand of mitochondrial TSPO. As in eukaryotes, bacterial TSPO appears functionally organized as a dimer and the apparent Kd for PK 11195 is in the same range than for its eukaryotic counterpart. When P. fluorescens MF37 was treated with PK 11195 (10−5 M) adhesion to living or artificial surfaces and biofilm formation activity were increased. Conversely, the apoptotic potential of bacteria on eukaryotic cells was significantly reduced. This effect of PK11195 was abolished in a mutant of P. fluorescens MF37 deficient for its major outer membrane porin, OprF. The present results demonstrate the existence of a bacterial TSPO that shares common structural and functional characteristics with its mammalian counterpart. This protein, apparently involved in adhesion and virulence, reveals the existence of a possible new inter kingdom signalling system and suggests that the human microbiome should be involuntarily exposed to the evolutionary pressure of benzodiazepines and related molecules. This discovery also represents a promising opportunity for the development of alternative antibacterial strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2007746952,"Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a pool of circular double stranded DNA molecules found in all eukaryotic cells and composed of repeated chromosomal sequences. It was proposed to be involved in genomic instability, aging and alternative telomere lengthening. Our study presents novel mammalian cell-free system for eccDNA generation. Using purified protein extract we show that eccDNA formation does not involve de-novo DNA synthesis suggesting that eccDNA is generated through excision of chromosomal sequences. This process is carried out by sequence-independent enzymes as human protein extract can produce mouse-specific eccDNA from high molecular weight mouse DNA, and vice versa. EccDNA production does not depend on ATP, requires residual amounts of Mg(2+) and is enhanced by double strand DNA breaks."
https://openalex.org/W2061530497,"Dihydropterin deaminase, which catalyzes the conversion of 7,8-dihydropterin to 7,8-dihydrolumazine, was purified 5850-fold to apparent homogeneity from Drosophila melanogaster. Its molecular mass was estimated to be 48 kDa by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, indicating that it is a monomer under native conditions. The pI value, temperature, and optimal pH of the enzyme were 5.5, 40 °C, and 7.5, respectively. Interestingly the enzyme had much higher activity for guanine than for 7,8-dihydropterin. The specificity constant (kcat/Km) for guanine (8.6 × 106m−1·s−1) was 860-fold higher than that for 7,8-dihydropterin (1.0 × 104m−1·s−1). The structural gene of the enzyme was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis as CG18143, located at region 82A1 on chromosome 3R. The cloned and expressed CG18143 exhibited both 7,8-dihydropterin and guanine deaminase activities. Flies with mutations in CG18143, SUPor-P/Df(3R)A321R1 transheterozygotes, had severely decreased activities in both deaminases compared with the wild type. Among several red eye pigments, the level of aurodrosopterin was specifically decreased in the mutant, and the amount of xanthine and uric acid also decreased considerably to 76 and 59% of the amounts in the wild type, respectively. In conclusion, dihydropterin deaminase encoded by CG18143 plays a role in the biosynthesis of aurodrosopterin by providing one of its precursors, 7,8-dihydrolumazine, from 7,8-dihydropterin. Dihydropterin deaminase also functions as guanine deaminase, an important enzyme for purine metabolism.

Dihydropterin deaminase also functions as guanine deaminase, an important enzyme for purine metabolism. The complexity of the eye color phenotypes of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been the subject of numerous investigations for more than 90 years. Two classes of pigments contribute to the eye color of Drosophila: brown “ommochromes” and red “drosopterins.” Drosopterins, first reported by Lederer (1.Lederer E. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1940; 15: 273-306Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and subsequently by Viscontini et al. (2.Viscontini M. Hadorn E. Karrer P. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 579-585Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), consist of at least five compounds, which have been referred to as drosopterin, isodrosopterin, neodrosopterin, aurodrosopterin, and “fraction e” (3.Schwinck I. Genetics. 1971; 68: s59-s60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the red pigments, drosopterin and isodrosopterin are the major components, whereas aurodrosopterin and neodrosopterin are minor pigments in wild type flies. The chemical structure of drosopterin was determined by Pfleiderer and co-worker (4.Theobald N. Pfleiderer W. Chem. Ber. 1978; 111: 3385-3402Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Drosopterin and its enantiomer, isodrosopterin, consist of a pentacyclic ring system containing a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin (=2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridin-4(1H)-one), a 2-amino-3,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrimido[4,5-b][1,4]diazepin-4-one, and a pyrrole ring (Scheme 1). Based on 1H NMR and UV/visible spectral analyses, the structure of aurodrosopterin was elucidated in 1993 by Yim et al. (5.Yim J. Kim S.J. Walcher G. Pfleiderer W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1970-1979Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), who found that it is the same as that of drosopterin except that it has one less amino group in the pteridine portion. The presence or absence of an amino group in the pteridine moiety is the key characteristic that distinguishes drosopterin from aurodrosopterin (Scheme 1). They also reported the presence of isoaurodrosopterin based on thin layer chromatographic analyses of Drosophila head extracts using various solvent systems (5.Yim J. Kim S.J. Walcher G. Pfleiderer W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1970-1979Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The first step leading to the biosynthesis of drosopterins is the formation of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP by GTP cyclohydrolase I, which is encoded by Punch (6.Mackay W.J. O'Donnell J.M. Genetics. 1983; 105: 35-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 7,8-Dihydroneopterin triphosphate is then converted to 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin (6-PTP) 3The abbreviations used are: 6-PTP6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterinpterin2- amino-4-hydroxypteridinePDApyrimidodiazepineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTLCthin layer chromatographyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.3The abbreviations used are: 6-PTP6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterinpterin2- amino-4-hydroxypteridinePDApyrimidodiazepineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTLCthin layer chromatographyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. by PTP synthase, the product of the purple gene (7.Yim J.J.

Next 6-PTP is converted to pyrimidodiazepine (PDA) by PDA synthase, which is a member of the Omega class glutathione S-transferases and is encoded by the sepia gene (10.Wiederrecht G.J. Paton D.R. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2195-2200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kim J. Suh H. Kim S. Kim K. Ahn C. Yim J. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Aurodrosopterin and its enantiomer, isoaurodrosopterin, are produced nonenzymatically by the one-to-one condensation of 7,8-dihydrolumazine and PDA under acidic conditions (5.Yim J. Kim S.J. Walcher G. Pfleiderer W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1970-1979Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to the production of drosopterin and isodrosopterin, which are produced by a similar nonenzymatic condensation of 7,8-dihydropterin and PDA (Scheme 1). 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin 2- amino-4-hydroxypteridine pyrimidodiazepine high performance liquid chromatography thin layer chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin 2- amino-4-hydroxypteridine pyrimidodiazepine high performance liquid chromatography thin layer chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. In the course of investigating the metabolic fate of tetrahydrobiopterin, Rembold and co-workers (12.Rembold H. Metzger H. Gutensohn W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) found that tetrahydrobiopterin can be degraded to 6-hydroxylumazine by rat liver homogenates. They proposed that tetrahydrobiopterin was converted by nonenzymatic side chain release to 7,8-dihydropterin, which was converted to 7,8-dihydrolumazine, the deaminated counterpart of 7,8-dihydropterin, by a deaminase present in the crude extracts. 7,8-Dihydrolumazine is then converted to 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxylumazine by xanthine oxidase and subsequently to 6-hydroxylumazine by autoxidation. This series of reactions was also observed in D. melanogaster. Takikawa et al. (13.Takikawa S. Tsusue M. Gyure W.L. Insect Biochem. 1983; 13: 361-368Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) demonstrated the conversion of 7,8-dihydropterin to 6-hydroxylumazine using partially purified fly extracts. However, the enzymatic properties of the deaminase and the identity of the gene encoding the protein have not yet been established. Here we purified and characterized Drosophila dihydropterin deaminase and identified its structural gene, CG18143, by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. We provide clear evidence that CG18143, previously annotated as the guanine deaminase gene, is directly involved in the biosynthesis of aurodrosopterin, a minor red eye pigment in Drosophila. The samples of 7,8-dihydrolumazine and PDA were generously gifted to us by Professor Wolfgang Pfleiderer of Konstanz University in Konstanz, Germany. 7,8-Dihydroneopterin triphosphate was prepared enzymatically from GTP by GTP cyclohydrolase I purified from Escherichia coli according to a previously published procedure (14.Yim J.J. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5087-5094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified 7,8-dihydropterin was prepared from pterin by zinc-alkali reduction according to previously described methods (15.Kaufman S. J. Biol.

Drosopterin, isodrosopterin, aurodrosopterin, and neodrosopterin were isolated from Drosophila heads by methods published earlier (5.Yim J. Kim S.J. Walcher G. Pfleiderer W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1970-1979Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Other pteridines were purchased commercially from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). A wild type of D. melanogaster, Oregon-R, was used for the preparation of the enzymes. The breeding populations of the flies were maintained at 25 ± 1 °C in a culture cage on a standard yeast medium with propionic acid added as a mold inhibitor. For the purification of deaminase, adult flies (0–2 days old) were frozen at −70 °C until used. The fly strains used for the mutational analysis included the following. y1 w67c23;;P{y+mDint2 wBR.E.BR SUPor-P} KG04159 (16.Roseman R.R. Johnson E.A. Rodesch C.K. Bjerke M. Nagoshi R.N. Geyer P.K. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1061-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center (Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN), and ;;Df(3R)A321R1,ry (81F; 82A4-6) was a gift from S. A. Wasserman (University of California, San Diego, CA). For the 7,8-dihydropterin deaminase assay, the standard reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm 7,8-dihydropterin, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the enzyme in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation at 40 °C for 10–30 min in the dark, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid, and the mixture was centrifuged to remove the precipitated proteins. A 6.5-μl iodine solution (1% I2, 2% KI) was then added to the acidified reaction mixture to convert the reduced pteridines to their oxidized forms. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the excess iodine was reduced by the addition of 5 μl of 2% ascorbic acid. A portion of this mixture was subjected to HPLC on a reversed-phase C18 column (Inertsil ODS-3, 4.6 × 250 mm; GL Sciences) connected to a photodiode array detector (Waters 996) and a scanning fluorescence detector (Waters 474). The material was eluted isocratically with 85% (v/v) 50 mm ammonium acetate in 15% (v/v) methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The reaction products, lumazine and 6-hydroxylumazine, were monitored by their fluorescence intensities. For the guanine deaminase assay, the standard reaction mixture contained 0.1 mm guanine, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the enzyme in a final volume of 100 μl and was incubated at 40 °C for 10–30 min in the dark. A portion of this mixture was subjected to HPLC with the same equipment as described above. The material was eluted isocratically with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and xanthine was monitored by the absorbance at 270 nm. This assay was carried out spectrophotometrically as described previously (17.Taras M.J. Arnold E.F. Hoak R.D. Rand M.C. Greenberg A.E. Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. American Public Health Association, Washington, D. C1981: 350-352Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reaction mixture contained a 0.25 mm concentration of each substrate, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the enzyme in a final volume of 100 μl. After incubation at 40 °C for 30 min in the dark, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 350 μl of cold deionized water, and 2.5 μl of 3 mm MnSO4 solution was added to the sample. After 25 μl of hypochlorous acid reagent (10 ml of 5% NaOCl solution and 40 ml of water, pH 6.8) was added to the mixture and stirred, 30 μl of phenate reagent (2.5 g of NaOH and 10 g of phenol in 100 ml of water) was immediately added. After 10 min, the increase in absorption at 630 nm was measured relative to the absorption of the control solution. The same reaction mixture without the added enzyme was used as the control. Dihydropterin deaminase was purified from head extracts of D. melanogaster by using conventional column chromatography. All of the operations were carried out at 4 °C. After the flies were frozen with liquid nitrogen, their heads were detached from their bodies by mechanical shock and separated from the other parts by sieving. The fly heads (dry weight of 20 g) were homogenized in 80 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant was used for the subsequent steps. The proteins precipitated in 30–60% saturated ammonium sulfate were redissolved in 12 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The solution was then dialyzed twice against 2 liters of the same buffer for 6 h. The dialyzed ammonium sulfate fraction was introduced into a Sephacryl HR S 300 column (2.5 × 78 cm), and the column was eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The fractions containing the active enzyme were combined (27.5 ml), and solid ammonium sulfate was added to yield a final concentration of 0.1 m. The sample was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 6 fast flow column (1.5 × 11 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.1) containing 0.1 m ammonium sulfate. After the column was washed with the same buffer, elution was carried out with a linear gradient of ethylene glycol from 0 to 50% in 25 mm histidine HCl buffer (pH 6.1) at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The active fractions were combined and concentrated to 5 ml with solid polyethylene glycol (molecular weight = 20,000). This material was dialyzed twice against 1 liter of 25 mm histidine HCl buffer (pH 6.1) for 6 h and loaded on a column of Polybuffer Exchanger 94 (1 × 37 cm) that had been equilibrated previously with 25 mm histidine HCl buffer (pH 6.1). The column was developed with 250 ml of elution buffer (10-fold diluted Polybuffer Exchanger 74, pH 5.0) at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. The active fractions were desalted with 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and concentrated using Amicon Centriplus Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore; molecular mass cutoff, 10,000 Da). The condensation reaction was performed as described previously (5.Yim J. Kim S.J. Walcher G. Pfleiderer W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1970-1979Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 7,8-Dihydropterin was incubated with the purified deaminase, and aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken out at various time points and acidified to pH 2.5 by the addition of 2 m HCl. Each acidified mixture was then incubated with PDA, which had been preincubated at pH 2.5 for 30 min, and the synthesized pigments were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The initial velocities of the catalytic reactions for 7,8-dihydropterin and guanine were determined under standard reaction conditions at various substrate concentrations. All of the experiments were performed three times. Ten different substrate concentrations were prepared within a range of 25–3000 μm for 7,8-dihydropterin and 10–300 μm for guanine. The initial velocities were measured within a 15–20% consumption range for each substrate. The purified enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was silver-stained by a previously described method (18.Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The protein band was excised and in-gel digested with trypsin according to previously published procedures (19.Arnott D. O'Connell K.L. King K.L. Stults J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DETM STR Biospectrometry Workstation. The peptide masses were measured as monoisotopic masses and analyzed against the NCBInr data base using the MS-Fit search algorithm (Protein Prospector, University of California San Francisco Mass Spectrometry Facility, San Francisco, CA). For the data base searches, no restrictions were placed on the species or organisms. Peptides were selected in the mass range of 1000–3000 Da. The coding sequence of CG18143 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. The total RNA was extracted from 0–2-day-old adult flies with TRIzol® reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out under the following conditions: one cycle of 94 °C for 4 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and one cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. For PCR, we used a gene-specific primer set, DPD1 (5′-GGGCCTTCCATATGGCAACCGTGTTTCTTGGAACT-3′) and DPD2 (5′-CGCGGATCCTCATTGGTATCCCTGTTTAATACGC-3′), designed to incorporate the NdeI and BamHI sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the pET 15b vectors and transformed into BL21 cells. Transformants were cultured at 37 °C in 1000 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside at OD 0.5. After 3 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and suspended in 40 ml of ice-cold Binding Buffer (pET system manual, Novagen). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant containing the soluble enzyme was bound to His·Bind Resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA extracted from ;;P{y+mDint2 wBR.E.BR SUPor-P} flies was cut by EcoRI or by a combination of EcoRI and EcoRV, separated on 1% agarose gels, and blotted onto Nytran® N membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The blotted membranes were probed with a 32P-labeled DNA probe covering the 5′ end of the SUPor-P element using QuikHyb® Hybridization Solution (Stratagene) and autoradiographed. The inverse PCR method 4E. J. Rehm, unpublished. was used to obtain the genomic sequence flanking the insertion site of the P element in the ;;P{y+mDint2 wBR.E.BR SUPor-P} flies. A Plac1 (5′-CACCCAAGGCTCTGCTCCCACAAT-3′) and Plac4 (5′-ACTGTGCGTTAGGTCCTGTTCATTGTT-3′) primer set was used for the 5′ junction, and a Pry1 (5′-CCTTAGCATGTCCGTGGGGTTTGAAT-3′) and Pry4-added (5′-CAATCATATCGCTGTCTCACTCAGACT-3′) primer set was used for the 3′ junction. The amplified DNA fragments were directly sequenced using the Plac1 and Pry1 primers. The sequences were analyzed with basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) searches of the Drosophila Genome Database. After the insertion site of the SUPor-P element was identified, genomic DNA isolated from ;;SUPor-P/Df(3R)A321R1 flies was analyzed by PCR to determine whether the deficient region of ;;Df(3R)A321R1,ry (81F; 82A4-6) flies contains CG18143. A pair of primers that covers the CG18143 and P element insert region was used: Df-5′-primer (5′-TCGTCCACTGCCAGGAATCCTCCTTC-3′) and Df-3′-primer (5′-TATGTACAGGTGCGAGCAGTGCA-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of 94 °C for 4 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; and one cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. A male of y1 w67c23 ;;P{y+mDint2 wBR.E.BR SUPor-P} was crossed to ;;TM3/TM6b females. One ;;SUPor-P/TM3 male resulting from this cross was crossed again to ;;TM3/TM6b females. From the cross between the males and ;;SUPor-P/TM3 females of the F2 generation, ;;SUPor-P homozygotes without the y1 mutation in the X chromosome were obtained. To delete the ry mutation from Df(3R)A321R1,ry flies, a recombination method was applied. First ;;Df(3R)A321R1,ry/TM3 males were crossed to Oregon-R virgins, and ;;Df(3R)A321R1,ry/+ virgins were then crossed to ;;TM3/TM6b males. Single male progeny carrying a TM6b balancer were mated in individual vials to ;;Df(3R)A321R1,ry/TM3 females to determine whether the males had a deficient third chromosome. Stocks were established by mating males and females carrying a TM3 balancer. Finally the males carrying a deficient third chromosome were crossed to ry506 females to determine whether the ry mutation on the third chromosome of the deficient fly was deleted. To get ;;Df(3R)A321R1/+, ;;SUPor-P/+, and ;;SUPor-P/Df(3R)A321R1 flies, Df(3R)A321R1/TM3 males were crossed with Oregon-R virgins, and ;;SUPor-P homozygote males were crossed with Oregon-R and ;;Df(3R)A321R1/TM3 virgins. The xanthine and uric acid contents were determined by HPLC using a previously described method (20.Hilliker A.J. Duyf B. Evans D. Phillips J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4343-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Separations were performed on a 4.6 × 250-mm Inertsil ODS-3 reversed-phase column. Uracil, xanthine, and uric acid were monitored at 260, 273, and 292 nm, respectively. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard protein. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated using a Superose S 12 column (1.0 × 40 cm) calibrated with standard molecular mass proteins and blue dextran (2,000,000 Da). SDS-PAGE was performed on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels, and isoelectric focusing was carried out as described previously (22.Awdeh Z.L. Williamson A.R. Askonas B.A. Nature. 1968; 219: 66-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) on a polyacrylamide flat bed gel (0.1 × 14 × 15 cm). TLC was performed with microcrystalline cellulose plates (Eastman Kodak Co. Number 13255 without a fluorescence indicator). For one-dimensional TLC, a 3% ammonium chloride solution was used as a solvent. For two-dimensional TLC, isopropanol, 2% ammonium acetate (1:1, v/v) and 3% ammonium chloride solutions were used as the first and second developing solvents, respectively. Fluorescent spots were detected by a long wave UV lamp. Dihydropterin deaminase from the heads of Drosophila was purified 5850-fold to apparent homogeneity. A summary of this purification is presented in Table 1. Throughout all of the column chromatographic steps, a single activity peak was observed, and the degree of purification was monitored by the increase in the specific activity and by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). The enzyme was purified to a specific activity of 643 units/mg with an activity yield of 4.5%; more than 30 μg of pure protein was routinely obtained from 20 g (dry weight) of 0–2-day-old adult heads. The final preparation of the enzyme did not contain xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase activity, which catalyzes the conversion of 7,8-dihydropterin to 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxypterin. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 48 kDa by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and by size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superose S 12 HPLC column (Fig. 1B), indicating that it is a monomer under native conditions.TABLE 1Summary of purification of dihydropterin deaminaseEnzyme preparationTotal proteinSpecific activityActivity yieldRelative specific activitymgunits/mg%Crude extract46170.111001.0Ammonium sulfate fraction25000.1681.31.5Sephacryl HR S 300 eluate2111.0845.99.8Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow eluate9.518.435.2167Polybuffer Exchanger 94 eluate0.032643.54.55850 Open table in a new tab Forrest et al. (23.Forrest H.S. van Baalen C. Viscontini M. Piraux M. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1960; 43: 1005-1010Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that the 5,6-double bonds of 7,8-dihydrolumazine are readily susceptible to nucleophilic attack, e.g. water addition. According to previous reports (12.Rembold H. Metzger H. Gutensohn W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), 7,8-dihydrolumazine is converted to 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxylumazine either in the presence or in the absence of xanthine oxidase, and 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxylumazine is converted to 6-hydroxylumazine by auto-oxidation. We monitored the enzymatic deamination reaction of 7,8-dihydropterin at different time points (zero time, 20 min, and 12 h) by HPLC. After 20 min of the enzymatic reaction, three peaks were detected, the retention times of which were 4.4, 7.0, and 7.5 min, identical to those of standard 6-hydroxylumazine, lumazine, and pterin, respectively. The UV-visible spectra of these peaks were also identical to those of standard 6-hydroxylumazine, lumazine, and pterin, respectively (data not shown). When the enzymatic reaction was prolonged to 12 h, only 6-hydroxylumazine and pterin peaks were detected with the lumazine peak hardly detected (Fig. 2A, lower panel). These results indicate that 7,8-dihydrolumazine is formed from 7,8-dihydropterin by the enzyme and then nonenzymatically hydroxylated to 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxylumazine, which is converted to 6-hydroxylumazine by iodine oxidation. To identify the deaminase reaction product, we also tried to synthesize aurodrosopterin, which is produced nonenzymatically by the one-to-one condensation of 7,8-dihydrolumazine and PDA under acidic conditions (5.Yim J. Kim S.J. Walcher G. Pfleiderer W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1993; 76: 1970-1979Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For this purpose, aliquots of the deaminase reaction mixture taken out at various time points were incubated with PDA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The synthesized pigments were analyzed by one-dimensional TLC (Fig. 2B). At the early stage of the deamination reaction, only drosopterin and isodrosopterin were detected; as the deamination reaction proceeded, the synthesis of aurodrosopterins gradually increased (Fig. 2B). After the substrate had been fully exhausted, the synthesized pigments were detected at the same position as that of natural aurodrosopterin on a two-dimensional TLC plate (Fig. 2C). Consequently the enzymatic reaction product is 7,8-dihydrolumazine, which is the precursor of aurodrosopterin in nonenzymatic synthesis. Various pteridine compounds were tested for substrate specificity. When the deaminase activity for 7,8-dihydropterin was 100%, the activities for tetrahydropterin, tetrahydrobiopterin, and tetrahydroneopterin were determined to be 71, 62, and 63%, respectively. The enzyme had no deaminase activities for other dihydropteridines such as 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, 7,8-dihydroneopterin, and sepiapterin; it also did not show deaminase activity with fully oxidized pteridines such as pterin, biopterin, neopterin, monapterin, xanthopterin, isoxanthopterin, aminopterin, 6-formylpterin, 6-carboxypterin, and 6-hydroxymethylpterin. Moreover the enzyme did not use folic acid, PDA, drosopterin, or isodrosopterin as a substrate. To determine whether the high reactivities with tetrahydropteridines are due to the nonenzymatic conversion of tetrahydropteridines to 7,8-dihydropterin, the spectral changes in the reaction mixture were examined during the deaminase reaction. When tetrahydropterin was incubated under the standard reaction condition in the absence of enzyme, the UV-visible spectrum of the reaction mixture increased gradually to that of 7,8-dihydropterin up until 20 min. The highest deaminase activity was obtained when the aliquot was taken out at 20 min and used as the source of the substrate. Moreover when the deaminase assay with tetrahydropterin was coupled with 6,7-dihydropteridine reductase (EC 1.5.1.34), which specifically converts quinonoid dihydropteridines to their tetrahydro forms (24.Park D. Park S. Yim J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), no deaminase activity was detected. This result strongly suggests that the reason for the high deaminase activities for tetrahydropteridines is that tetrahydropteridines are converted to 7,8-dihydropterin by nonenzymatic side chain release at position 6 via quinonoid dihydropteridines. Interestingly the enzyme exhibited 40-fold higher activities for guanine than for 7,8-dihydropterin (Table 2) along with 60% activity for 8-azaguanine and 5% activity for guanosine relative to 7,8-dihydropterin. No activity was f"
https://openalex.org/W2053127008,"Background Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are ubiquitous throughout the body, especially in brain, where they mediate numerous effects. MGluRs are classified into groups of which group I, comprising mGluRs 1 and 5, is especially important in neuronal communication. Group I actions are often investigated with the selective agonist, S-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). Despite the selectivity of DHPG, its use has often led to contradictory findings. We now report that a particular commercial preparation of DHPG can produce mGluR-independent effects. These findings may help reconcile some discrepant reports. Methods We carried out electrophysiological recordings in the rat in vitro hippocampal slice preparation, focusing mainly on pharmacologically isolated GABAA-receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Principal Findings: While preparations of DHPG from three companies suppressed GABAergic transmission in an mGluR-dependent way, one batch had an additional, unusual effect. Even in the presence of antagonists of mGluRs, it caused a reversible, profound suppression of inhibitory transmission. This mGluR - independent action was not due to a higher potency of the compound, or its ability to cause endocannabinoid-dependent responses. Field potential recordings revealed that glutamatergic transmission was not affected, and quantal analysis of GABA transmission confirmed the unusual effect was on GABA release, and not GABAA receptors. We have not identified the responsible factor in the DHPG preparation, but the samples were 99% pure as determined by HPLC and NMR analyses. Conclusions In certain respects our observations with the anomalous batch strikingly resemble some published reports of unusual DHPG effects. The present findings could therefore contribute to explaining discrepancies in the literature. DHPG is widely employed to study mGluRs in different systems, hence rigorous controls should be performed before conclusions based on its use are drawn."
https://openalex.org/W2070626861,"My turning point as a scientist was the offer of an assistant professorship to join 15 male colleagues in the Biochemistry Department at the University of Chicago. How I arrived at this position is more circuitous.

Like many other kids who grew up in the cornfield suburbs outside Chicago, playing in swamps and fields was far more interesting than organized sports, particularly when only three other kids lived within earshot of our house. Unlike those kids’ parents, my father was a geochemist and my aunt, a biologist at Argonne National Labs. Both were graduates of the University of Chicago, where I later received an offer.

My father encouraged me to be an elementary school teacher; it was my mother — a homemaker with artistic, musical and gardening talents — who contended that since I cooked well, I’d make a fine chemist. I didn’t believe her. However, I did major in Chemistry at the University of Illinois. As one of three women in a class of 200 physics students, I felt that I had to study hard to be recognized. I pestered the graduate teaching assistants, who explained the science and also taught me how to juggle tennis balls. After each exam, I always anticipated failure, but usually received the best grade and became a good juggler.

On graduating, I hoped to enter the Peace Corps, an American programme for volunteer work in the developing world. I applied to graduate school as a default pathway, exerting my creativity by submitting a two page essay outlining my reasons for refusing to take the graduate school entrance examinations. My options turned out to be graduate school or Idi Amin, Uganda and the Peace Corps.

Without having any college biology, I began Princeton’s graduate programme in Biochemistry. Marc Kirschner’s lectures on differentiation were counter to my maths professors’ views. Bruce Alberts only took the best students — I wasn’t among them. So I chose Charles Gilvarg, an exceptionally smart but demanding advisor researching bacterial sporulation.

Biological equations had too many variables. I worked day and night without solving any problems. I was, however, developing my tennis backhand and broadening my horizons with inexpensive trips to India, Nepal, Bolivia, Peru, Egypt and Turkey. Closer to Princeton, I tasted the pleasures of New York City, discovering restaurants, art and music.

Every now and then an experiment worked, yielding a fresh and exciting way to counter the agony of defeat. I began to enjoy designing my own experiments. I defended my PhD with a modicum of confidence and with a determination to work at the interface of biology and medicine. I chose to work at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with Howard Green, who devised methods to culture human stem cells — epidermal keratinocytes — under conditions where they could be maintained and propagated straight from tissue.

On arrival, I was handed a bucket of rat submaxillary glands and asked to purify EGF (epidermal growth factor) for the lab. I was then asked to search through urine for new growth factors. Perhaps Howard misinterpreted ‘P-Chem’ on my resume. Left to my own devices, I began to identify keratins, their mRNAs and their program of gene expression, as a means to explore epidermal differentiation. I began embarking upon my own trajectory.

I ventured upstairs, downstairs and across the street. Sheldon Penman’s postdocs were the mRNA experts. Gobind Khorana’s postdocs taught me to make Oligo dT cellulose. London’s postdocs were skilled at isolating rabbit reticulocytes for in vitro translations. Jim Rothman was the 32P-labelling expert, Richard Hynes shared my interest in comparing vimentin and keratin, Bryan Roberts at Brandeis was Zen master of methyl mercury gels and the David Baltimore and Phil Sharp labs were embarking on DNA recombinant technology. I thrived in the environment at MIT. My experiments were working. While maintaining my interests in music, art and travelling, I fuelled my passion for science.

In my second year at MIT, Charlie Gilvarg nominated me for a faculty position at the University of Chicago. I was flabbergasted, but overjoyed. An even bigger surprise was the invitation for an interview: a free trip home and a chance to practice being interviewed

Snow was everywhere. I always disliked Chicago’s cold weather, but when the city is hit by a major snowstorm, it is beautiful. My seminar seemed to go smoothly. My discussions with famous scientists were a treat. The lack of expectations was a recipe for relaxation.

Months passed. Fellow MIT postdocs received rejection notices. I wondered if mine had been lost in the mail. After receiving an offer that year, I wondered whether Chicago had been impressed with my ‘confidence’ in not having applied elsewhere.

My father always inspired me to strive to do better. Charlie Gilvarg instilled in me the importance of designing a well-controlled experiment. Marc Kirschner, Bruce Alberts and my other professors at Princeton inspired in me the excitement of the looming revolution in recombinant DNA technology. They exemplified why originality and unconventional thinking are so critical in moving science forward. Howard Green reinforced these lessons. MIT generated an exhilarating environment that stimulated every brain cell I had. It made it easy for those with initiative to thrive. But the offer from the University of Chicago gave me the opportunity to have my own lab, affording me the possibility to pursue my passion."
