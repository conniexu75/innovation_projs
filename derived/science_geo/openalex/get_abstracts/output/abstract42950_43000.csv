https://openalex.org/W1965168699,"In cells that do not express κ immunoglobulin light chain genes, the κ enhancer-binding protein NF-κB is not evident in either cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions. By denaturation, size fractionation, and renaturation, however, NF-κB activity can be revealed in cytosolic fractions, showing that the DNA-binding protein is present but inhibited in its binding activity. By using a variety of protocols involving the dissociating agents sodium desoxycholate and formamide, as much cytosolic NF-κB can be found in the fraction from unstimulated 70Z/3 pre-B cells as is found in the nuclear extract from phorbol ester-activated cells. We conclude that both 70Z/3 and HeLa cells contain apparently cytosolic NF-κB in a form with no evident DNA-binding activity, and phorbol esters both release the inhibition of binding and cause a translocation to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1998047654,"Mice were injected with a monoclonal antibody to interferon-gamma to examine the importance of endogenous production of this lymphokine in resistance against infection with the sporozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Mice with intraperitoneal infections of T. gondii that received no antibody survived and developed chronic T. gondii infection, whereas the infected mice that received the monoclonal antibody died of toxoplasmosis. The activation of macrophages, which kill T. gondii in vivo, was inhibited by administration of the monoclonal antibody, but the production of antibodies to T. gondii was not suppressed. The fact that an antibody to interferon-gamma can eliminate resistance to acute Toxoplasma infection in mice suggests that this lymphokine is an important mediator of host resistance to this parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1517879640,"Mastoparan, a peptide toxin from wasp venom, is a nonspecific secretagogue. We show here that mastoparan increases the GTPase activity and the rate of nucleotide binding of several purified GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) whose function is to couple cell-surface receptors to intracellular mediators. Mastoparan accelerated guanosine-5'-(3-O-thiotriphosphate binding and consequent G protein activation in part by promoting the dissociation of bound GDP, the mechanism by which receptors regulate G proteins. ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin, which uncouples receptors from G proteins, selectively inhibited mastoparan-stimulated activation. Like receptors, mastoparan was more potent if the G protein was reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles and was active at micromolar concentrations of Mg2+. The structure of mastoparan in a lipid bilayer is similar to that predicted for a cationic intracellular loop of G protein-coupled receptors. Mastoparan thus displays a novel mode of toxicity by acting directly on G proteins to mimic the role normally played by agonist-liganded receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1540151595,"The synthesis, processing, and secretion of factor VIII expressed from heterologous genes introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells has been studied. The results show factor VIII to be synthesized as a primary translation product of approximately 230 kDa that can be detected in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. In this compartment, the majority of the factor VIII is in a complex with a resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, binding protein, and may never appear in the medium. Some factor VIII transits the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved to generate the mature heavy and light chains. In the absence of von Willebrand factor in the medium, the secreted heavy and light chains are unassociated and subsequently degraded. In the presence of von Willebrand factor in the medium, the heavy and light chains are secreted as a stable complex and activity accumulates linearly with time. The utilization and complexity of asparagine-linked carbohydrate present on the secreted recombinant-derived factor VIII and human plasma-derived factor VIII were compared and found to be very similar. In both cases, the asparagine-linked carbohydrate moieties on the heavy chain are primarily of the hybrid or complex-type. In contrast, the factor VIII from both sources contains a high-mannose type of asparagine-linked carbohydrate on the light chain."
https://openalex.org/W2128269277,"The transformer (tra) and doublesex (dsx) genes produce sex-specific transcripts that are generated by differential RNA processing. We have examined the effects of mutants in other regulatory genes controlling sexual differentiation on the patterns of processing of the tra and dsx RNA transcripts. Our results demonstrate that the genes suggested by genetic studies to act upstream of tra or dsx in the sex determination hierarchy regulate these two loci at the level of RNA processing. Our data suggest that the order of interaction of the factors controlling sex is X:A>Sxl>tra⩾tra-2>dsx⩾ix>terminal differentiation. While these results cannot preclude regulatory interactions at other levels, the regulation of RNA splicing revealed by these experiments is sufficient to account for all of the known functional interactions between the regulatory genes in this hierarchy."

https://openalex.org/W2000929749,"DNA synthesis in each cell lineage of the early C. elegans embryo was measured using microspectrofluorimetry. Aphidicolin was shown to inhibit DNA synthesis almost instantly and completely. Aphidicolin was then used to investigate how DNA synthesis controls expression of two biochemical markers that appear at different times during gut development: gut granules and a carboxylesterase. We show that marker expression is controlled neither by reaching the normal DNA: cytoplasm ratio, by counting the normal number of rounds of DNA synthesis, nor by a simple lengthening of the cell cycle. Instead, expression of both gut markers requires a short period of DNA synthesis in the first cell cycle after the gut has been clonally established."
https://openalex.org/W302906649,"This study has quantitated changes in the content of labeled and unlabeled arachidonate of neutrophil phosphoglyceride classes and subclasses during cell activation with ionophore A23187. The predominant pools of endogenous arachidonate in the resting neutrophil were found in ethanolamine (68%)-, choline (19%)-, and inositol (12.0%)-containing glycerolipids. Upon stimulation, endogenous arachidonate was lost from primarily ethanolamine (PE) greater than choline (PC) greater than inositol (PI)-linked phosphoglycerides. Released leukotriene B4 and 20-hydroxyleukotriene B4 accounted for 10-35% of the total arachidonate lost from all phosphoglyceride classes. In contrast to the mass loss, ionophore induced a decrease of labeled arachidonate from primarily PC and PI. In the resting neutrophil, 66% of the total arachidonate in PC was found in the 1-alkyl-linked fraction. Furthermore, loss of endogenous arachidonate from 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine accounted for 62% of the decrease of arachidonate from choline-linked phosphoglycerides. In contrast, 60% of the release of labeled arachidonate from PC subclasses originated from 1-acyl molecular species. 1-Alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-PE contained 71% of the arachidonate in ethanolamine-linked phosphoglycerides and was the major PE subclass which was degraded during neutrophil activation with ionophore A23187. These findings demonstrate that human neutrophils contain large ether-linked stores of arachidonate and the capacity to mobilize these stores. In addition, this study points out major discrepancies between using mass or label to determine sources of arachidonate for eicosanoids."

https://openalex.org/W1505155297,"Three closely related, but distinct, GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) are encoded by cDNAs arbitrarily designated Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3. The in vitro translated products of mRNAs prepared from Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3 cDNAs migrate as 41-, 40-, and 41-kDa proteins, respectively, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Antisera were raised against synthetic decapeptides corresponding to a divergent sequence (residues 159-168 for Gi1 and Gi3; 160-169 for Gi2) of the three cDNAs and tested on immunoblots for reactivity with three purified G-proteins, G41 and G40 from brain and G41 from HL-60 cells. LD antisera (Gi1 peptide) react only with brain G41. LE antisera (Gi2 peptide) react only with brain G40, and SQ antisera (Gi3 peptide) react exclusively with HL-60 G41. The results indicate that the 41-kDa G-protein purified from HL-60 cells differs from the purified brain 41-kDa protein and suggest that the HL-60 cell protein corresponds to that encoded by Gi3 cDNA."

https://openalex.org/W1634432451,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is known to increase the levels of neurofilament proteins in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. In this report, we show that the three neurofilament subunits, NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H, are not induced coordinately. NF-H accumulated only after longer term NGF treatment than required for NF-L and NF-M. While NGF treatment resulted in 12- and 14-fold increases in NF-L and NF-M mRNA levels, respectively, over a 14-day period, no increase in the level of NF-H mRNA was observed. This indicated that in PC-12 cells, control of NF-H expression by NGF may occur at the post-transcriptional level. NGF appeared to have no effect on the stability of NF-L mRNA, although it increased the stability of NF-M mRNA relative to that in control PC-12 cells. Analysis of the effect of NGF on the transcription of neurofilament genes showed 4- and 5-fold increases in the rates of NF-L and NF-M gene transcription, respectively, and no increase in the rate of NF-H gene transcription. Taken together these results demonstrate that NGF stimulates the expression of individual neurofilament subunits at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels."
https://openalex.org/W1606317888,"An NAD:cysteine ADP-ribosyltransferase designated ADP-ribosyltransferase C was purified approximately 35,000-fold from human erythrocytes with an 11% yield. The purified ADP-ribosyltransferase C exhibited one predominant protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an estimated molecular weight (Mr) of 28,500. The Km values for NAD and cysteine methyl ester were determined to be 65 and 4,400 microM, respectively. By using human erythrocyte inside-out membrane vesicles, the transferase C was found to ADP-ribosylate the alpha subunit (Mr = 41,000) of Gi, which is a substrate for pertussis toxin. The ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferase C was inhibited by pre-ADP-ribosylation with pertussis toxin. The linkage of ADP-ribose-Gi alpha in the membranes formed by ADP-ribosyltransferase C was as stable to hydroxylamine as that formed by pertussis toxin. These data represent the first demonstration that eukaryotic cells contain an ADP-ribosyltransferase which can catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of a cysteine residue in Gi alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2014832270,"Zeste is a Drosophila regulatory gene that is required for transvection at the bithorax complex. Here we find that purified zeste protein binds to multiple sites just 5' of the initiation site of Ubx RNA. Zeste protein purified from Drosophila cells or from E. coli expressing the zeste gene activates Ubx transcription in vitro. This activation is dependent on the presence of zeste protein binding sites, as it is not observed with a Ubx promoter lacking these sites or with an Adh promoter. These results suggest that transvection involves regulatory elements that act at the level of transcriptional initiation and may be mechanistically similar to activation of transcription by enhancer elements, except that transvection occurs across paired chromosomes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zeste may play a more important role in the normal regulation of Ubx and its other target genes than current genetic evidence implies."
https://openalex.org/W1585193578,"Laminin-nidogen complexes were found to aggregate in the presence of divalent cations in a manner dependent on ion concentration. This effect shows a selectivity for Ca2+, as half-maximal aggregation is achieved already at about 10 microM Ca2+, while Mg2+ induces aggregation at 10-fold higher ion concentrations and always to a lesser extent. When binding of Ca2+ to laminin-nidogen complexes was measured by equilibrium dialysis, a total of about 16 binding sites with dissociation constants in the range of 5-300 microM could be identified. At 50 microM Ca2+, where the aggregation is maximal, only two to three Ca2+ ions are bound to laminin-nidogen complexes, indicating that the aggregation reaction is induced by the binding of Ca2+ to a small number of sites and possibly to a single distinct site. Analysis of Ca2+ binding to various proteolytic fragments of laminin allowed the tentative localization of a high affinity binding site to a large fragment comprising two of the short arms connected by the central part of the laminin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2065872805,"An antigen found only in neuronal nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster is revealed by staining with a monoclonal antibody (Mab44C11). This antigen appears early in development, before neurons show any other signs of antigenic or morphologic differentiation, and persists throughout development. This nuclear staining permits reliable detection of neurons in developmental studies of wild-type and mutant flies. Protein immunoblot analyses and immune precipitation experiments show that the neuronal nuclear antigen is a 50-kilodalton polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1482749592,"Earlier studies have shown that African green monkeys develop a more modest hypercholesterolemia, higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, and less atherosclerosis than cynomolgus monkeys fed diets with the same cholesterol content. In the present study, cynomolgus monkeys were fed less cholesterol than was fed to African green monkeys to induce equivalent hypercholesterolemia in both species. African green monkeys still had 2-fold higher plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations and 2.7-fold higher plasma apolipoprotein (apo) A-I concentrations. Therefore, the higher HDL concentration in African green monkeys appears to result from factors that act independently of dietary cholesterol intake or total plasma cholesterol concentration. Two aspects of HDL production were examined to determine the metabolic basis of the species difference in HDL concentration. The rate of hepatic apoA-I secretion, as estimated by the accumulation of apoA-I in the medium during recirculating liver perfusion, was 5-fold higher in livers of African green monkeys. In addition, the concentration of apoA-I mRNA was 2-fold higher in the liver and 3.7-fold higher in the intestine of African green monkeys. Taken together, these findings indicate that differences in apoA-I production in the liver and small intestine are large enough to be responsible for the differences in the plasma concentrations of HDL and apoA-I between these species. Factors which regulate apoA-I secretion, including modulation of tissue apoA-I mRNA concentrations, are important determinants of plasma HDL concentrations and may contribute to the relative resistance of African green monkeys to dietary cholesterol-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. ApoA-I mRNA was also detected at low levels in the kidney and testis of African green and cynomolgus monkeys but not in the adrenal or brain. The tissue distribution and abundance of apoA-I mRNA in peripheral tissues was very different than that seen for apoE mRNA. Kidney and testis apoA-I mRNAs were the same size as liver apoA-I mRNA when examined by Northern blot analysis. Testis apoA-I mRNA appeared to be functionally active as judged by its presence in cytoplasmic polyribosomes. The low levels of apoA-I expression in kidney and testis are unlikely to contribute significantly to the plasma apoA-I pool but might function in some aspect of local lipid metabolism within these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1495632188,"Polyamine depletion generally results in an inhibition of cell growth. However, the precise role of polyamines in the regulation of cell proliferation is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that polyamine depletion induced by 2-difluoromethylornithine in COLO 320 human colon carcinoma cells results in a greater than 90% decrease in expression of a key gene in the maintenance of cell growth, the c-myc protooncogene. The decrease in c-myc expression accompanying polyamine depletion appears to occur at the transcriptional level. It is not simply a result of decreased growth rate since growth-inhibited cells at confluence maintain a high level of c-myc expression. It is also due to a change in cell cycle phase distribution and is not a reflection of a generalized decrease in gene expression which accompanies a decrease in cellular proliferation. Thus, the expression of the histone H2A gene was similar to and temporally paralleled the growth status of both treated and untreated cells, while the beta-actin and ornithine decarboxylase genes actually had increased expression during polyamine depletion. These studies demonstrate that polyamines may be critical to the expression of c-myc and suggest one mechanism by which they modulate cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1590180091,"Microheterogeneity of different vinculin and meta-vinculin isoforms in adult human tissues and cultured cells was studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting technique. Four isoforms of vinculin (alpha, alpha', beta, and gamma) and two isoforms of meta-vinculin (alpha and beta) were resolved. alpha-, alpha'-, and beta-isoforms of vinculin were found in all cell types and tissue samples analyzed in the present study. gamma-Isoform of vinculin and both alpha- and beta-isoforms of meta-vinculin were found in smooth (aorta wall and myometrium) and cardiac muscle, rather than in skeletal muscle, liver, foreskin fibroblasts, and macrophages. In the primary culture of human aorta smooth muscle cells, the fractional content of gamma-isoform of vinculin and meta-vinculin was dramatically reduced, and, by the onset of intensive cell division, the proteins could hardly be detected. Subcultured human aorta smooth muscle cells did not contain gamma-vinculin and meta-vinculin. We analyzed the microheterogeneity of vinculin and meta-vinculin in three smooth muscle layers of human aorta wall--media, muscular-elastic (adjacent to media) intima, and subendothelial (juxtaluminal) intima. It was shown that in media the fractional content of gamma-isoform of vinculin was 45% and meta-vinculin, 42%; in muscular-elastic intima the fractional content of gamma-vinculin was 42% and meta-vinculin, 36%. However, in subendothelial intima, the share of these proteins was significantly lower than in adjacent muscular-elastic intima and media. Isoactin pattern that is characteristic of smooth muscle was identical in all aortic layers, thus proving the smooth muscle origin of subendothelial intima cells. These findings demonstrate that human aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo and in vitro undergo coordinated differential expression of smooth muscle specific variants of vinculin, i.e. gamma-vinculin and meta-vinculin."
https://openalex.org/W1568527001,"We examined the ability of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants defective in glycosaminoglycan synthesis to metabolize 125I-labeled thrombospondin (TSP). Wild type CHO cells bound and degraded 125I-TSP with kinetics similar to those reported for endothelial cells. Both binding and degradation were saturable (half-saturation at 20 micrograms/ml). When the concentration of labeled TSP was 1-5 micrograms/ml, mutant 745, defective in xylosyltransferase, and mutant 761, defective in galactosyltransferase I, bound and degraded 6- to 16-fold less TSP than wild type; mutant 803, which specifically lacks heparan sulfate chains, bound and degraded 5-fold less TSP than wild type; and mutant 677, which lacks heparan sulfate and has increased levels of chondroitin sulfate, bound and degraded 2-fold less TSP than wild type. Binding and degradation of TSP by the mutants were not saturable at TSP concentrations up to 100 micrograms/ml. Bound TSP was localized by immunofluorescence to punctate structures on wild type and, to a lesser extent, 677 cells. Heparitinase pretreatment of wild type cells caused a 2- to 3-fold decrease in binding and degradation, whereas chondroitinase pretreatment had no effect. Chondroitinase pretreatment of the 677 mutant (deficient heparan sulfate and excess chondroitin sulfate) caused a 2-fold decrease in binding and an 8-fold decrease in turnover, whereas heparitinase pretreatment had no effect. Treatment of wild type cells with both heparitinase and chondroitinase resulted in a 6- to 8-fold decrease in binding and turnover. These results indicate that cell surface proteoglycans mediate metabolism of TSP by CHO cells and that the primary effectors of TSP metabolism are heparan sulfate proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2152935659,"Antibodies against pig thymus poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were obtained with enzyme-hemocyanin conjugates and used for immunoquantitation. The quick-blot procedure used allowed the determination of amounts as low as 1 ng of enzyme from whole cell trichloracetic acid precipitates. When applied to analysis of various human, rodent, and bovine cell types, surprisingly similar amounts of polymerase were found (1-5 ng of pig thymus polymerase equivalents/micrograms of DNA, 2 X 10(5) polymerase molecules/HeLa cell). Also, no significant difference was seen between normal and transformed cells. Polymerase tended to decline in several fibroblast cultures upon reaching confluency, which was not reflected by total polymerase activity. Divergence between total activity and immunogenic equivalents was also seen in alkylated cells and in rat liver treated with phenobarbital. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fractions dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer could also be used to analyze, by Western blotting, the size distribution of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in vivo. Application to various cell types revealed that all mouse and rat cells tested had two immunogenic bands (116 and 98 kDa) of similar intensity. A highly conserved structure of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase may be deduced from the existence of immunogenic and renaturable 116-kDa polypeptide bands even in the low eukaryotes Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostelium discoideum."
https://openalex.org/W1521910964,"Free sialic acid has been found in the cell-conditioned medium of human foreskin fibroblasts. It is proposed that the accumulation of extracellular sialic acid may result from the hydrolysis of GM3 ganglioside on the cell surface of these fibroblasts. Sialidase activities with GM3 ganglioside and sialyllactitol as substrates were demonstrated in cell-conditioned medium, and the levels of their activities correlated positively with cell density. The GM3 sialidase activity at pH 4.5 was 4.1 and 38 pmol/h/ml of medium at sparse and confluent densities, respectively; the corresponding activities with sialyllactitol as the substrate were 12 and 75 pmol/h/ml of medium (pH 4.5). The pH versus activity profiles with GM3 as the substrate suggested the presence of a second sialidase with an optimal activity at pH 6.5 in the conditioned medium of preconfluent cells. This activity was virtually absent in the medium of contact-inhibited cells and could not be assayed with sialyllactitol as the substrate. The turnover of cell surface GM3 was assessed by pulse labeling human foreskin fibroblasts with a radioactive precursor of sialic acid ([1-14C]N-acetylmannosamine) and a radioactive precursor of ceramide ([3,3-3H2]serine). During a chase period of 24 h turnover of the doubly labeled cellular GM3 was observed; there was a loss of about 35% of the 14C-labeled sialic acid without any measureable loss of 3H-labeled ceramide from GM3. We have speculated that the enzyme-catalyzed removal of sialic acid from the GM3 ganglioside on the extracellular aspect of the plasma membrane may be a necessary event involved in the modulation of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1858328737,"The glucose permease (IIGlc/IIIGlc complex) of the bacterial phosphotransferase system mediates sugar transport across the cytoplasmic membrane concomitant with sugar phosphorylation. It contains 3 cysteine residues, of which Cys-204 and Cys-326 are localized in the hydrophobic part and Cys-421 in the hydrophilic part of the IIGlc subunit. The cysteines were replaced, one at a time, by serines, and the effect of these mutations on stability, regulation, and catalytic properties of IIGlc was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Cys-204 and Cys-326 are not required for catalytic function and are not involved in the membrane potential-dependent regulation of IIGlc activity (Robillard, G. T., and Konings, W. N. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 127, 597-604). Replacement of these cysteines by serines results, however, in reduced stability of IIGlc in vivo (C204S) and in vitro (C204S and C326S), indicating that these substitutions in a hydrophobic environment can destabilize the protein structure. Cys-421 is absolutely required for transport and phosphorylation of glucose. C421S can neither be phosphorylated by phospho-IIIGlc nor catalyze the phosphoryl exchange between [14C] glucose and glucose 6-phosphate at equilibrium. C421S does not interfere with the activity of simultaneously expressed wild-type IIGlc. Unexpectedly C421S and wild-type IIGlc support growth on maltose of Escherichia coli ZSC112L (Curtis, S. J., and Epstein, W. (1975) J. Bacteriol. 122, 1189-1199), a strain which otherwise does not grow on this disaccharide as the only carbon source. C421S appears to facilitate the efflux of a growth inhibiting intermediate (glucose?) of maltose. Wild-type IIGlc catalyzes the intracellular phosphorylation of glucose derived from maltose. It is concluded that the cytoplasmic domain of IIGlc interacts with IIIGlc, the cytoplasmic subunit of the glucose permease, and also participates in phosphorylation of glucose, and that phosphorylation occurs independently of transport, although transport of glucose by wild-type IIGlc cannot occur without concomitant phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1500853612,"Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is a plasma enzyme which catalyzes the transacylation of the fatty acid at the sn-2 position of lecithin to cholesterol forming lysolecithin and cholesteryl ester. The substrates for and products of this reaction are present within the plasma lipoproteins upon which the enzyme acts to form the majority of cholesteryl ester in human plasma. We proposed a covalent catalytic mechanism of action for LCAT (Jauhiainen, M., and Dolphin, P. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7032-7034) in which serine and histidine residues mediate lecithin cleavage and two cysteine residues cholesterol esterification. With the aid of sulfhydryl reactive trivalent organoarsenical compounds which are specific for vicinal thiols we have probed the geometry of the catalytic site. p-Aminophenylarsendichloride noncompetitively inactivates cholesterol esterification (Ki = 0.23 mM) by LCAT via alkylation of both catalytic cysteine residues. This reagent does not significantly inactivate lecithin cleavage by LCAT. Full enzyme activity is restored by treatment with 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid. Treatment of LCAT with p-bromoacetylaminophenylarsenoxide blocks the subsequent incorporation of diisopropyl fluorophosphate and iodoacetamide and inactivates both cholesterol esterification and lecithin cleavage. These activities are not restored following 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid treatment. However, the reduced cysteine thiols are regenerated and can catalyze cholesteryl arachidonate formation from arachidonyl-CoA. The control reagent, bromoacetylaniline, which lacks the sulfhydryl-reactive arsenical moiety, does not inactivate LCAT nor is this reagent incorporated into the LCAT protein. We conclude that the two catalytic cysteine residues of LCAT (Cys31 and Cys184) are vicinal with a calculated distance between their sulfur atoms of 3.50-3.62 A. The additional residue alkylated by the bifunctional reagent is within the catalytic site and may represent a previously identified catalytic serine or histidine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1504772139,"The wide range of functions attributed to GTP-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) is reflected in the structural diversity which exists among the α, β, and y subunits of G proteins. Recently two cDNA clones encoding β subunits, β_1 and β_2, were isolated from bovine and human cDNA libraries. We report here that the β_2 gene encodes the 35-kilodalton (kDa) component of the β_(35)/β_(36) subunit of G proteins and that the β_1 gene encodes the 36-kilodalton component. The in vitro translation product of the β_2 cDNA co-migrates with the 35-kDa β subunit (β_(35)), while the in vitro product of the β_1 cDNA co-migrates with the 36-kDa β subunit (β_(36)) on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In addition, antisera generated against synthetic β_2 peptides bind specifically to the β_(35) component of isolated G proteins and to a 35-kDa protein in myeloid cell membranes. Our results suggest that the two β subunits could serve distinct functions, as they are derived from separate genes which have been highly conserved in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1604895168,"To assess whether hepatic glycogen is actively turning over under conditions which promote net glycogen synthesis we perfused livers from 24-h fasted rats with 20 mM D-[1-13C]glucose, 10 mM L-[3-13C]alanine, 10 mM L-[3-13C]lactate, and 1 microM insulin for 90 min followed by a 75-min chase period with perfusate of the same composition containing either 13C-enriched or unlabeled substrates. The peak height of the C-1 resonance of the glucosyl subunits in glycogen was monitored, in real time, using 13C NMR techniques. During the initial 90 min the peak height of the C-1 resonance of glycogen increased at almost a constant rate reflecting a near linear increase in net glycogen synthesis, which persisted for a further 75 min if 13C-enriched substrates were present during the chase period. However, when the perfusate was switched to the unenriched substrates, the peak height of the C-1 resonance of glycogen declined in a nearly linear manner reflecting active glycogenolysis during a time of net glycogen synthesis. By comparing the slopes of the curve describing the time course of the net [1-13C] glucose incorporation into glycogen with the rate of net loss of 13C label from the C-1 resonance of glycogen during the chase period we estimated the relative rate of glycogen breakdown to be 60% of the net glycogen synthetic rate. Whether this same phenomenon occurs to such an appreciable extent in vivo remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1497271125,"The epsilon-amino group of Lys-166 of Rhodospirillum rubrum ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase was postulated as the essential base which initiates catalysis by abstracting the proton at C-3 of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (Hartman, F. C., Soper, T. S., Niyogi, S. K., Mural, R. J., Foote, R. S., Mitra, S., Lee, E. H., Machanoff, R., and Larimer, F. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3496-3501). To scrutinize this possibility, the site-directed Gly-166 mutant, totally devoid of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase activity, was examined for its ability to catalyze each of three partial reactions. When carbamylated at Lys-191 (i.e. activated with CO2 and Mg2+), wild-type enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, the six-carbon reaction intermediate of the carboxylase reaction (Pierce, J., Andrews, T. J., and Lorimer, G. H. (1986a) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10248-10256). Likewise, when carbamylated at Lys-191, the Gly-166 mutant also catalyzed the hydrolysis of this reaction intermediate. The carbamylated wild type catalyzed the enolization of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate as indicated by the transfer of 3H radioactivity from [3-3H]ribulose, 1,5-bisphosphate to the medium. However, even when carbamylated at Lys-191, the mutant protein did not catalyze the enolization of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Additionally, unlike the decarbamylated wild-type enzyme, which catalyzed the decarboxylation of 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate in the absence of Mg2+, the mutant protein was inactive in this partial reaction. These properties exclude the epsilon-amino group of Lys-166 as an obligatory participant in the hydrolysis of 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. In contrast, these properties are consistent with the epsilon-amino group of Lys-166 functioning as an acid-base catalyst in the enolization of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (when the enzyme is carbamylated) and in the decarboxylation of 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (when the enzyme is decarbamylated). Alternatively, Lys-166 may stabilize the transition states of these two partial reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1544838948,"There are 14 potential Asn-X-Thr/Ser glycosylation sites, or sequons, in the yeast external invertase sequence. Of these, 13 are wholly or partially glycosylated to give an average of 9-10 oligosaccharides/subunit (Reddy, V. A., Johnson, R. S., Biemann, K., Williams, R. S., Ziegler, F. D., Trimble, R. B., and Maley, F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6978-6985). On digestion of native holoenzyme by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) an average of about seven oligosaccharides per subunit are released without affecting enzyme activity (Trimble, R. B., and Maley, F. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4409-4412). To determine whether the remaining Endo H-resistant chains were restricted to a limited number of unique sequons or were randomly distributed on all 13, Endo H-treated native invertase was digested with either thermolysin or trypsin and the resultant glycopeptides isolated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gel filtration. It was found that the oligosaccharides attached to Asn92, Asn247, and Asn350 were partially resistant to Endo H, while those at Asn45 and Asn337) were completely resistant. Bio-Gel P-4 analysis revealed the Endo H-resistant oligosaccharides at Asn45, Asn92, Asn247, and Asn337 to be Man8-14GlcNAc, while the minor residual carbohydrate at Asn350 was Man greater than 50GlcNAc. The Endo H-susceptible oligosaccharides at Asn4, Asn146, and Asn256 were Man greater than 50GlcNAc while all other glycosylation sites contained Man8-14GlcNAc. Based on a hydropathic analysis of invertase, the two most Endo H-resistant oligosaccharides at Asn45 and Asn337 were located in the more hydrophobic regions of the molecule. These may form part of the folded protein structure or interacting subunit surfaces, thus restricting their accessibility to Endo H."

https://openalex.org/W1567963927,"We previously constructed a bifunctionally active membrane-bound fusion protein, in which Escherichia coli proline carrier (the product of the putP gene) was linked with beta-galactosidase (the product of the lacZ gene) through a collagen linker (Hanada, K., Yamato, I., and Anraku, Y. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14100-14104). The proline carrier was purified from this site specifically cleavable fusion protein. Cytoplasmic membranes overproducing the fusion protein were solubilized with dodecylmaltoside, and the solubilized fraction was subjected to anti-beta-galactosidase IgG-Sepharose chromatography. The fusion protein was specifically adsorbed to the immunoaffinity resin and then treated with collagenase for splitting the proline carrier moiety of the fusion protein from the beta-galactosidase moiety. The collagenase used for the collagenolysis was then removed by anti-collagenase IgG-Sepharose chromatography. In this way, the proline carrier was purified to more than 95% homogeneity of the protein. Proline transport in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the purified carrier was dependent on the membrane potential and the chemical gradient of Na+ across the membrane with apparent Michaelis constants for proline and for Na+ stimulation of 3.6 microM and 31 microM, respectively. These results indicated that the proline carrier mediates electrogenic Na+/proline symport."
https://openalex.org/W1600380358,"DNA-binding proteins in eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli NS1 and NS2, are generally small basic molecules. In contrast, the archaebacterium Sulfolobus acidocaldarius contains three groups of DNA-binding proteins which have molecular masses of 7, 8, and 10 kDa. In the first group, five proteins (7a-7e) have been identified, while in the second and third group only two proteins each are present, denoted 8a and 8b and 10a and 10b, respectively. In this paper, we present the primary structures of proteins 7a, 7b, and 7e from the first group. All three proteins contain lysyl residues which are monomethylated to different extents. The modified lysines are found in the NH2-terminal regions of all 7-kDa proteins and in the COOH-terminal part of protein 7e. The sequences of the 7-kDa group are highly similar to each other. All of these macromolecules have been shown to interact specifically with DNA. Protein 7e of the 7-kDa group shows the tightest binding to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1524784188,"Clathrin light chains, LCa and LCb, are products of two closely related genes whose mRNAs undergo differential splicing to result in at least four different light chain isoforms. The physiological significance of clathrin light chain diversity remains unclear. To date, the only evidence for a functional distinction of LCa and LCb is the preferential phosphorylation of LCb, which takes place at serine residues and is mediated by coated vesicle-associated casein kinase II. As a first step toward determining the function of light chain diversity, we have mapped the in vitro phosphorylation sites on LCb. We use [32P]ATP to phosphorylate LCb within coated vesicles, followed by sequencing of 32P-labeled chymotryptic peptides thereof, to identify serine residues at positions 11 and 13 as the phosphorylation sites. We find that phosphorylation of LCb within coated vesicles can be inhibited by four monoclonal antibodies specific for different epitopes of the clathrin light chains."
https://openalex.org/W1585849424,"Abstract The DNA polymerase-primase from Drosophila melanogaster contains a cryptic 3'----5' exonuclease that can be detected after separation of the 182-kDa polymerase subunit from the four-subunit enzyme. To determine the specificity of excision of mispaired nucleotides by the exonuclease, we have utilized primed phi X174am3 single-stranded DNA containing a noncomplementary nucleotide at the 3'-primer terminus, opposite deoxyadenosine at position 587 in the amber3 codon of the template strand. In the absence of polymerization, the preference for excision of the mispaired nucleotide from the primer is C greater than A much greater than G. Excision under these conditions is inhibited by the addition of deoxyguanosine monophosphate. Under conditions of concomitant DNA synthesis, the preference for excision at this site becomes A = G much greater than C, and excision is insensitive to deoxyguanosine monophosphate. The high fidelity of DNA synthesis exhibited by the isolated 182-kDa polymerase subunit is not reduced by concentrations of deoxyguanosine monophosphate or adenosine monophosphate that inhibit proofreading by prokaryotic DNA polymerases. Thus, the 3'----5' exonuclease of the Drosophila DNA polymerase-primase participates in exonucleolytic proofreading by excising noncomplementary nucleotides prior to extension of the primer by polymerase action. The deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs N2-(p-butylphenyl)deoxyguanosine triphosphate and N2-(p-butylphenyl)deoxyadenosine triphosphate are potent inhibitors of DNA polymerase alpha. Like calf thymus DNA polymerase delta, recently determined to have proofreading capability, DNA synthesis by the isolated Drosophila 182-kDa polymerase subunit was not inhibited by the two analogs. In contrast, DNA synthesis by the intact Drosophila polymerase-primase complex was inhibited greater than 95% by these analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1678755803,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) is inactivated greater than 1,000-fold when an active site glutamic acid, E553, is mutated to aspartic acid (Douglas, C.M., and Collier, R. J. (1987) J. Bacteriol. 169, 4967-4971). To test the effect of creating a carboxyl-containing side chain at position 553 longer than that of glutamic acid, we first replaced Glu-553 with cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned ETA and then carboxymethylated the cysteine side chain with iodoacetic acid. The E553C mutation reduced ADP-ribosyltransferase and cytotoxic activities greater than 10,000-fold. Reaction of the mutant with iodoacetic acid enhanced enzymic activity 2,500-fold, to a level approximately one-sixth that of wild type toxin, and restored cytotoxicity to a slightly lesser extent. Iodoacetamide did not activate the mutant, and neither iodoacetic acid nor iodoacetamide affected the activity of wild type toxin. These results show that the carboxyl group of Glu-553 is important for ADP-ribosylation activity and imply flexibility in the enzyme-substrate complex in accommodating the slightly longer S-carboxymethylcysteine side chain. This general approach may have applications in protein engineering as well as in studying carboxyl side chain functions in enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W199698718,"The murine B cell lymphoma 70Z/3 is a tumor line that resembles an early B cell. It responds to lipopolysaccharide by synthesizing kappa light chains, resulting in the appearance of surface IgM. We now demonstrate that this effect is triggered by the lipid A domain of lipopolysaccharide since a defined tetraacyl disaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate precursor of mature lipid A, designated lipid IVA (Raetz, C. R. H., Purcell, S., Meyer, M. V., Qureshi, N., and Takayama, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 16080-16088), is fully active in stimulating kappa chain mRNA synthesis. In contrast, the monosaccharide lipid A precursor, lipid X, shows only slight activity; but a large excess of lipid X appears to complete with lipid IVA, partially blocking its effects. Mutants of the 70Z/3 line that are unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide also fail to respond to lipid IVA. The somatic cell system described here, coupled with the use of chemically defined agonists and antagonists, offers a new approach to understanding the early events in lipopolysaccharide/animal cell interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1588296703,"Abstract The activation of delipidated microsomal UDP-glucuronosyltransferase from pig liver (GT2P type of enzyme) was studied as a function of several structural modifications of 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, which is known to be a good activator of the enzyme. The following types of compounds were tested: substitution of H for OH at position 2; substitution of an ether for an acyl link at position 1; variation of the phosphorus-nitrogen or acyl ester-phosphate ester distances; removal of the glycerol backbone; optical isomers; and substitution of phosphoethanolamine for phosphocholine. Although there were variations in the extent to which these compounds activated delipidated enzyme, all the above types of lipids were effective in this regard. By contrast, lipids with a net negative charge did not activate the enzyme. They inhibited it reversibly. Positively charged lipids, even those lacking a phosphate group, were effective activators. These results indicate that GT2P is unlikely to interact with specific chemical groups of its phospholipid milieu. Effective activation appears instead to depend on the physical properties of the lipid environment."
https://openalex.org/W1580821435,"To characterize proteins that bind to the upstream region of the fibroin gene, we used an electrophoretic mobility assay and a DNase I footprinting assay. A crude nuclear extract from the posterior silk glands forms a sequence-specific complex with the upstream region, -234 to -66, which includes a signal for tissue-specific transcriptional enhancement. This specific complex is composed of at least two factors of proteinous nature and the DNA. The composite proteins specifically protect an approximately 13-base pair (-167 to -155) region in a DNase I footprinting assay. This region contains an interesting repeated sequence, AATTTAATTT. Crude nuclear extracts from the middle silk glands and the ovarian tissues, but not a HeLa whole cell extract, also give the band complexes of similar electrophoretic mobility to the one formed in the posterior silk gland extract. However, under a higher EDTA condition, these complexes are more unstable than the one constructed in the posterior silk gland extract. These results suggest a possibility that these proteinous molecules in the complex, although apparently ubiquitous in Bombyx cells, might be specifically modified in the posterior silk gland cells to play an important role in the specific expression of the fibroin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1524910142,"Incubation of carbonic anhydrase II with acrolein results in a rapid, time-dependent loss of all but approximately 3-6% of the original catalytic activity toward CO2 hydration and HCO3- dehydration, with the inactivation rate being first-order in both acrolein and the enzyme. The pH dependence of the inactivation rate constant can be adequately described with a function incorporating a pK alpha of 7.15 and a maximal value for kinact [corrected] of 26.2 M-1 min-1, indicating that at least one of the catalytically essential residues that ionizes at this pH is involved in the modification scheme. The amount of residual CO2 hydratase activity is proportional to the molar excess of acrolein over carbonic anhydrase II with 5 histidyl and 3 lysyl residues being subject to alkylation under conditions where [acrolein] to [carbonic anhydrase II] ratio is greater than 100. Because all lysyl residues were shown previously to be amidinated without detectable loss of activity, it was assumed that the modification of one (or more) of the histidines was primarily responsible for the observed inactivation. The number of modified histidyl residues could be related to residual activity by using the statistical analysis of Tsou (Tsou, C.-L. (1962) Sci. Sin. (Engl. Ed.) 11, 1535-1558) which indicates that one essential histidine reacts approximately four times faster than the other (histidyl) residues. In sharp contrast with the phenomenon observed in connection with CO2 hydration and HCO3- dehydration, acrolein improves the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis and acetaldehyde hydration, with the relative activity increasing by approximately 12 and 34%, respectively. The widely differing effects imparted by the same reagent represent the first step toward differential control of the specificity of carbonic anhydrase II."

https://openalex.org/W1513207870,"Conditions for reductive methylation of amine groups in proteins using formaldehyde and cyanoborohydride can be chosen to modify selectively the active site lysyl residue of aspartate aminotransferase among the 19 lysyl residues in each subunit of this protein. Apoenzyme must be treated, under mildly acidic conditions (pH = 6), at a relatively low molar ratio of formaldehyde to protein (40:1); and, upon reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride, 85% of the formaldehyde is incorporated at Lysine 258 and 15% at the amino-terminal alanyl residue. The modified protein, characterized after tryptic hydrolysis, separation of the peptides by high performance liquid chromatography procedures and subsequent amino acid analysis, shows that lysine 258 is preferentially modified as a dimethylated derivative. Modified apoenzyme can accept and tightly bind added coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate, as measured by circular dichroism procedures. The methylated enzyme is essentially catalytically inactive when measured by standard enzymatic assays. On the other hand, addition of the substrate, glutamate, produces the characteristic absorption spectral shifts for conversion of the active site-bound pyridoxal form of the coenzyme (absorbance at 400 nm) to its pyridoxamine form (absorbance at 330 nm). Such a half-transamination-like process occurs as in native enzyme, albeit at several orders of magnitude lower rate. This event takes place even though the characteristic internal holoenzyme Schiff's base between Lys-258 and aldehyde of bound pyridoxal phosphate does not exist in methylated, reconstituted holoenzyme. It is concluded that this chemically transformed enzyme can undergo a half-transamination reaction with conversion of active site-bound coenzyme from a pyridoxal to a pyridoxamine form, even when overall catalytic turnover transamination cannot be detected."
https://openalex.org/W1484150579,"Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts transformed by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQT-SHE cells) failed to synthesize the pro-alpha 1(I) subunit of type I procollagen but continued to synthesize altered forms of the other subunit, pro-alpha 2(I) (Peterkofsky, B., and Prather, W. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16818-16826). This was unusual, since synthesis of the two subunits generally is coordinately regulated. Present experiments using cell-free translation and hybridization of RNA from normal and transformed Syrian hamster fibroblasts with labeled pro-alpha 1(I) DNA probes show that mRNA for pro-alpha 1(I) is absent from the transformant. In contrast, dot-blot and Southern blot hybridizations of cellular DNAs with pro-alpha 1(I) DNA probes demonstrated that the transformed cells contained pro-alpha 1(I) gene sequences and that the gross structure of the gene was unchanged by transformation. mRNA for the other type I procollagen subunit, pro-alpha 2(I), was present in transformed cells and the major collagenous polypeptide translated from this RNA migrated like the normal pro-alpha 2 subunit during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The translated procollagen chain was cleaved to an alpha 2(I)-sized collagen chain by pepsin at 4 degrees C. These studies provide a molecular basis for the observed collagen phenotype of NQT-SHE cells."

https://openalex.org/W1553217782,"Several major mRNA species of mouse and other mammalian cells occur both as small untranslated ribonucleoprotein particles and as functional molecules associated with ribosomes in polysomes. One of these, that codes for a 21-kDa polypeptide, was analyzed with respect to distribution of sites accessible to RNase T1 in the 5'-noncoding region. This region, which is about 100 nucleotides long, contains several sites that are highly sensitive to the enzyme, as well as many G residues not susceptible to cleavage. The distribution of highly sensitive sites was compared in the active and inactive states of the P21 mRNA present in cytoplasmic extracts by subjecting the extract to limited nuclease digestion followed by separation of partially fragmented polysomes from free messenger ribonucleoprotein particles. The mRNA in polysomes contained two highly sensitive sites, one near the 5' terminus and the other in the middle of the region, next to a sequence potentially capable of Shine-Dalgarno interaction. The untranslated molecules lacked the 5'-proximal site but had several highly accessible sites not present in the active molecules. The initiation AUG showed little accessibility both in polysomes and in messenger ribonucleoproteins. Both forms were quite different from the deproteinized mRNA with respect to distribution of nuclease-sensitive sites. Our results indicate that interaction of the mRNA with cytoplasmic factors strongly affects its conformation in the 5'-noncoding region and that a particular conformation may be important for effective interaction with ribosomal particles during polypeptide chain initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1481143728,"Cyanase is an inducible enzyme in Escherichia coli that catalyzes the reaction of cyanate with bicarbonate resulting in the decomposition of cyanate to ammonia and bicarbonate. In this study, the role of the single sulfhydryl group in each of the eight identical subunits of cyanase was investigated. Tetranitromethane, methyl methanethiosulfonate, N-ethylmaleimide, and Hg2+ all reacted with the sulfhydryl group to give derivatives which had reduced activities and which dissociated reversibly to inactive dimer. Association of inactive dimer to active octamer was facilitated by the presence of azide (cyanate analog) and bicarbonate, increased temperature and enzyme concentration, and presence of phosphate. Nitration of tyrosine residues by tetranitromethane occurred only in the absence of azide and bicarbonate, suggesting that at least some of the tyrosine residues become exposed when octamer dissociates to dimer. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare a mutant enzyme in which serine was substituted for cysteine. The mutant enzyme was catalytically active and had properties very similar to native enzyme, except that it was less stable to treatment with urea and to high temperatures. These results establish that in native cyanase the sulfhydryl group per se is not required for catalytic activity, but it may play a role in stabilizing octameric structure, and that octameric structure is required for catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1608814633,"A set of protein hybrids composed of variable portions of the amino-terminal residues of the yeast phosphate-repressible acid phosphatase (product of PHO5) and an active fragment of bacterial beta-galactosidase has been constructed. When these PHO5-LACZ hybrids are expressed in a yeast strain carrying an intact chromosomal PHO5 gene, they show a size-dependent interference with the secretion of native acid phosphatase. Hybrid proteins containing approximately 50 residues of acid phosphatase do not affect secretion of native acid phosphatase. Hybrids containing greater than 200 residues of acid phosphatase reduce the amount of secreted acid phosphatase more than by 50%. The interference with secretion is specific for acid phosphatase. The hybrids do not affect secretion of invertase, and do not confer a growth-deficient phenotype on yeast. Both the hybrid proteins and acid phosphatase accumulate in non-glycosylated, membrane-bound forms which are sensitive to proteolysis from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The hybrids and accumulated acid phosphatase co-migrate on Percoll density gradients with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, but not with markers of the Golgi or secretory vesicles. These results suggest that PHO5-LACZ hybrid proteins specifically block secretion of native acid phosphatase by interfering with enzyme after targeting but before translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum."
