https://openalex.org/W3192545069,"The spillovers of betacoronaviruses in humans and the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants highlight the need for broad coronavirus countermeasures. We describe five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cross-reacting with the stem helix of multiple betacoronavirus spike glycoproteins isolated from COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Using structural and functional studies, we show that the mAb with the greatest breadth (S2P6) neutralizes pseudotyped viruses from three different subgenera through the inhibition of membrane fusion, and we delineate the molecular basis for its cross-reactivity. S2P6 reduces viral burden in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 through viral neutralization and Fc-mediated effector functions. Stem helix antibodies are rare, oftentimes of narrow specificity, and can acquire neutralization breadth through somatic mutations. These data provide a framework for structure-guided design of pan-betacoronavirus vaccines eliciting broad protection."

Here, we show that the conversion of stem-like into effector-like CTLs involves a major chemotactic reprogramming that includes the upregulation of chemokine receptor CXCR6. This receptor positions effector-like CTLs in a discrete perivascular niche of the tumor stroma that is densely occupied by CCR7+ dendritic cells (DCs) expressing the CXCR6 ligand CXCL16. CCR7+ DCs also express and trans-present the survival cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15). CXCR6 expression and IL-15 trans-presentation are critical for the survival and local expansion of effector-like CTLs in the tumor microenvironment to maximize their anti-tumor activity before progressing to irreversible dysfunction.

Successful clearance of viral infections by the immune system depends on CD8+ T cells that recognize intracellular pathogen-derived antigens. Clonal expansion of naive cells in lymphoid tissues produces short-lived effector cells that eliminate virally infected cells and produce interferon gamma (IFN-γ) to amplify the response, as well as precursors for different subsets of memory cells that persist after the infection has been cleared (Kaech and Cui, 2012Kaech S.M. Cui W. Transcriptional control of effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In contrast, failure to clear viruses leads to chronic infections and persistent, yet hypofunctional cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses characterized by a gradual decline in proliferative capacity, cytokine-secretion, and cytotoxic function of individual cells. This adapted response pattern, often referred to as T cell exhaustion, may serve to avoid immune-pathological damage to host tissues that would result from continued high-level immune activation (Hashimoto et al., 2018Hashimoto M. Kamphorst A.O. Im S.J. Kissick H.T. Pillai R.N. Ramalingam S.S. Araki K. Ahmed R. CD8 T Cell Exhaustion in Chronic Infection and Cancer: Opportunities for Interventions.Annu. Rev.

However, even exhausted CTL responses continue to limit viral replication (Jin et al., 1999Jin X. Bauer D.E. Tuttleton S.E. Lewin S. Gettie A. Blanchard J. Irwin C.E. Safrit J.T. Mittler J. Weinberger L. et al.Dramatic rise in plasma viremia after CD8(+) T cell depletion in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques.J. Exp.

Many features of this equilibrium state between viruses and the immune system are replicated during immune responses against established tumors. Here, CTLs that recognize mutational tumor neoantigens also exert varying levels of immune control but, similar to CTLs in chronic viral infection, adopt a hypofunctional state. Recent studies have revealed the heterogeneity and dynamics of the hypofunctional CTL populations observed in chronic viral infection and cancer (He et al., 2016He R. Hou S. Liu C. Zhang A. Bai Q.

These include stem-like CTLs that express the HMG box transcription factor TCF-1 and the SLAM family member Slamf6/Ly108, possess the capacity for self-renewal, and are found primarily in lymphoid tissues but in smaller numbers also at immunological effector sites such as tumors (Miller et al., 2019Miller B.C.

TCF-1pos CTLs continually give rise to TCF-1neg effector-like cells that acquire cytotoxic function, but also upregulate inhibitory receptors, such as TIM-3, predicted to attenuate their effector activity. TCF-1neg CTLs include cells with a continuum of differentiation states ranging from highly proliferative and functional to irreversibly hypofunctional. Highly proliferative TCF-1neg CTLs referred to as transitory CTLs express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 and mediate antiviral control during chronic viral infection. Terminally differentiated TCF-1neg CTLs, on the other hand, are characterized by expression of CD101 and stable epigenetic repression of effector genes (Hudson et al., 2019Hudson W.H. Gensheimer J.

DCs not only initiate anti-tumor responses in tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs) but also support and regulate T cell functions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Gerhard et al., 2021Gerhard G.M.

Dendritic cells in cancer immunology and immunotherapy.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 7-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Developmental studies have identified two subsets of conventional DCs named cDC1s and cDC2s as well as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) as lineages distinct from monocytes, monocyte-derived DCs, and macrophages (Murphy et al., 2016Murphy T.L. Grajales-Reyes G.E. Wu X. Tussiwand R. Briseño C.G. Iwata A. Kretzer N.M. Durai V. Murphy K.M. Transcriptional Control of Dendritic Cell Development.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34: 93-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). cDC1s are more efficient at cross-presenting tumor cell-derived antigen to CTLs (Broz et al., 2014Broz M.L. Binnewies M. Boldajipour B. Nelson A.E. Pollack J.L. Erle D.J. Barczak A. Rosenblum M.D. Daud A.

Mujal A.M. Pollack J.L. Combes A.J. Hardison E.A. Barry K.C. Tsui J. Ruhland M.K. Kersten K.

We recently identified an intratumoral DC state characterized by co-expression of IL12b, Fascin1, and the chemokine receptor gene CCR7, which we initially classified as cDC1s (Garris et al., 2018Garris C.S. Arlauckas S.P. Kohler R.H. Trefny M.P. Garren S. Piot C. Engblom C. Pfirschke C. Siwicki M.

Reanalysis of these and additional mouse and human data led us to re-classify these cells as a discrete DC state we named DC3 (Gerhard et al., 2021Gerhard G.M. Bill R. Messemaker M. Klein A.M.

Others then reported on similar cell states in mouse and human tumors, to which they referred as LAMP3+ DC (Zhang et al., 2019Zhang Q. He Y. Luo N. Patel S.J. Han Y. Gao R. Modak M. Carotta S.

Li Z. Skrzypczynska K.M. Fang Q. Zhang W. O’Brien S.A. He Y. Wang L. Zhang Q.

The respective roles of cDC1s, cDC2s and DC3s in intratumoral CTL activation and specifically how these cells support the differentiation of stem- to effector-like and to terminally differentiated CTLs requires further study. An unanswered question is how CTLs at various stages of differentiation navigate the TME in order to orchestrate their crosstalk with different DC subsets and ultimately to engage with their malignant target cells. Considering their well-established roles in lymphoid tissues, chemokines and their receptors are likely central orchestrators of this process. Inflammatory chemokine receptors such as CXCR3, CCR5, and CCR4 are generally assumed to be important for the recruitment of blood-borne T cells to tumor tissue, although this has only in some cases been directly demonstrated, e.g., for CXCR3 (Mikucki et al., 2015Mikucki M.E. Fisher D.T. Matsuzaki J. Skitzki J.J. Gaulin N.B. Muhitch J.B. Ku A.W. Frelinger J.G. Odunsi K. Gajewski T.F. et al.Non-redundant requirement for CXCR3 signalling during tumoricidal T-cell trafficking across tumour vascular checkpoints.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7458Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition, CXCR3 guides the local positioning of T cells in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues (Ariotti et al., 2015Ariotti S. Beltman J.B. Borsje R. Hoekstra M.E. Halford W.P. Haanen J.B.A.G. de Boer R.J. Schumacher T.N.M.

CXCR3 chemokine receptor-ligand interactions in the lymph node optimize CD4+ T helper 1 cell differentiation.Immunity. 2012; 37: 1091-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Expression of the CXCR3 ligand CXCL9 specifically by cDC is required for the efficacy of anti-PD-1 cancer immune checkpoint therapy through mechanisms unrelated to T cell trafficking from tdLNs to tumor tissue, hinting at a role for organizing local cDC interactions with tumor-infiltrating CXCR3+ T cells (Chow et al., 2019Chow M.T. Ozga A.J. Servis R.L. Frederick D.T. Lo J.A. Fisher D.E. Freeman G.J. Boland G.M. Luster A.D.

However, the full spectrum of chemokine receptors and their ligands expressed in the TME by both immune and non-immune cells, but in particular by CTL subsets, has not been systematically explored. Here, we generated a comprehensive account of all chemokine and chemokine receptor genes expressed by all cells of the TME in mouse models of immunogenic cancer in order to provide a road map for the systematic exploration of their roles in organizing cellular interactions. We identified CXCR6 as the most highly expressed chemokine receptor in tumor-infiltrating CTLs and DC3s as the cell state most highly expressing its ligand CXCL16. Using multiphoton intravital microscopy (MP-IVM), we found that CXCR6 optimizes the positioning of TCF-1neg CTLs in perivascular clusters of DC3s in the tumor stroma and uncovered its critical role in rescuing the proliferative transitory CTL subset from activation-induced cell death (AICD) through exposure to trans-presented interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokine, which was critical to sustain their population size and anti-tumor function. In order to explore chemokine receptors expressed by tumor-infiltrating CTLs, we used the immunogenic mouse melanoma model D4M.3A-pOVA (Di Pilato et al., 2019Di Pilato M. Kim E.Y. Cadilha B.L.

Carrizosa E. et al.Targeting the CBM complex causes Treg cells to prime tumours for immune checkpoint therapy.Nature. 2019; 570: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Tumor single-cell suspensions were enriched for immune cells and all single-cell transcriptomes annotated to cell states (see STAR Methods). We detected three main cell clusters containing T and natural killer (NK) cell, myeloid cell, and non-immune cell states, as well as three minor clusters classified as pDC, B cell, and mast cell states (Figures 1A and S1A). Comparisons to published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets revealed that T and NK cell states resembled those in MC38 mouse colorectal tumors, and CD8 T cell states resembled those in ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing B16.F10 mouse melanoma and in spleens of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected mice (Figure S1B) (Miller et al., 2019Miller B.C.

The T/NK cell cluster contained an NK cell state (NK), a CD4+ T cell state containing both regulatory and helper T cells (CD4 T R/H), as well as two CD8+ T cell states annotated as effector-like (CD8 T E) and memory-like (CD8 T M). CD8 T E expressed the cytotoxic effector gene Gzmb and Havcr2 (encoding TIM-3), while CD8 T M expressed the memory gene Nsg2 (Best et al., 2013Best J.A. Blair D.A. Knell J. Yang E. Mayya V.

The by far most highly expressed chemokine receptor gene in both CD8 T cell states was Cxcr6, followed by Cx3cr1 in the CD8 T E state, and by Cxcr4, Cxcr3, Ccr7, and lower amounts of Cxcr5 in the CD8 T M state (Figures 1C and 1D; Table S1B). Cxcr6 was also present, but much less abundant, in some NK and CD4 T R/H cell states. When validating gene expression at the protein level by flow cytometry, we used the T cell activation marker PD-1 (Honda et al., 2014Honda T. Egen J.G. Lämmermann T. Kastenmüller W. Torabi-Parizi P.

While TCF-1neg effector-like cells expressed PD-1 almost uniformly, only a fraction of TIM-3– TCF-1pos stem-like CTLs, which gradually declined over time, expressed this receptor (Figures 1E and 1F). When we transferred CD8-depleted mice with congenic, highly purified CD44low CD62Lhi naive CD8+ T cells that require prior activation to enter the TME, all of their tumor-infiltrating progeny, both TCF-1pos and TCF-1neg, expressed PD-1 (Figure 1G), similarly to adoptively transferred clonal populations of TCR transgenic OT-I cells recognizing the tumor cell-expressed SIINFEKL neoepitope (Figure S1F). Hence, PD-1 expression identifies tumor-reactive CTLs. CXCR6 was also the by far most highly expressed chemokine receptor protein on CTLs on day 18 of tumor growth, mirroring our transcriptional analysis (Figures 1H and 1I). Three discrete populations with negative/low, intermediate, and high expression were apparent among PD-1+ stem-like CTLs, while PD-1+ effector-like CTLs uniformly expressed CXCR6 at the highest level. Considering the lineage relationship between TCF-1pos and TCF-1neg cells (Siddiqui et al., 2019Siddiqui I. Schaeuble K. Chennupati V. Fuertes Marraco S.A. Calderon-Copete S. Pais Ferreira D.

In contrast, PD-1– CTLs, both TCF-1pos and TCF-1neg, were either CXCR6-low/negative or -intermediate but rarely high. PD-1+ TCF-1neg CTLs also upregulated CX3CR1, CCR5, and CCR2 but downregulated CXCR3. Generally, inflammatory chemokine receptors were more highly expressed by PD-1+ than PD-1– CTLs, indicating that they were induced or sustained in the TME through TCR activation (Figures 1H and 1I). Again, CXCR3 formed an exception and was most highly expressed by PD-1– TCF-1pos bystander CT"
https://openalex.org/W3190426039,"It is critical to understand how human quiescent long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) sense demand from daily and stress-mediated cues and then transition into bioenergetically active progeny to differentiate and meet these cellular needs. However, the demand-adapted regulatory circuits of these early steps of hematopoiesis are largely unknown. Here we show that lysosomes, sophisticated nutrient-sensing and signaling centers, are regulated dichotomously by transcription factor EB (TFEB) and MYC to balance catabolic and anabolic processes required for activating LT-HSCs and guiding their lineage fate. TFEB-mediated induction of the endolysosomal pathway causes membrane receptor degradation, limiting LT-HSC metabolic and mitogenic activation, promoting quiescence and self-renewal, and governing erythroid-myeloid commitment. In contrast, MYC engages biosynthetic processes while repressing lysosomal catabolism, driving LT-HSC activation. Our study identifies TFEB-mediated control of lysosomal activity as a central regulatory hub for proper and coordinated stem cell fate determination."

This study examines their psychological impact on university students in Asia. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between April and May 2020 in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, India and Indonesia. The Zung’s self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and questions on adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies were used in this study. A total of 3,679 students from the seven countries participated in this study. Overall, 21.9% and 13.7% of the students in this study experienced mild to moderate and severe to extreme levels of anxiety. More than 20% of the students from China and Bangladesh reported severe to extreme level of anxiety compared to below 10% of the students from Indonesia, Malaysia and India. Among the female students, 15.9% experienced severe to extreme level of anxiety compared to 10.6% among the males. Females from Bangladesh, China, Malaysia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia experienced significantly higher levels of anxiety compared to their male counterparts. Acceptance was the most used and Seeking Social Support was the least used coping strategies among the students. There were significant differences in the usage of the four strategies by countries. Stressors are predominantly financial constraints, remote online learning, and uncertainty related to their academic performance, and future career prospects."

In the present article, we investigate how school closures in 2020 influenced the performance of German students in a curriculum-based online learning software for mathematics. We analyzed data from more than 2,500 K-12 students who computed over 124,000 mathematical problem sets before and during the shutdown, and found that students' performance increased during the shutdown of schools in 2020 relative to the year before. Our analyses also revealed that low-achieving students showed greater improvements in performance than high-achieving students, suggesting a narrowing gap in performance between low- and high-achieving students. We conclude that online learning environments may be effective in preventing educational losses associated with current and future shutdowns of schools."
https://openalex.org/W3187219991,"With an aging population suffering from increased prevalence of chronic conditions in the United States (U.S.), a large portion of these patients are on multiple medications. High-risk medications can increase the risk for drug-drug interactions and medication nonadherence. This study aims to describe the prevalence of polypharmacy and high-risk medication prescribing in U.S. physician offices.This was a cross-sectional study of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2009 to 2016. All patients over 65 years old were included. Polypharmacy was categorized as no polypharmacy (< 2 medications), minor polypharmacy (2-3 medications), moderate polypharmacy (4-5 medications), and major polypharmacy (>5 medications). Medications were further categorized into high-risk medication categories (anticholinergics, cardiovascular agents, central nervous system (CNS) medications, pain medications, and other). Comparisons between the degrees of polypharmacy were performed utilizing chi-square or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with JMP Pro 14® (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).Over 2 billion patient visits were included. Overall, Polypharmacy was common (65.1%): minor polypharmacy (16.2%), moderate polypharmacy (12.1%), and major polypharmacy (36.8%). Patients with major polypharmacy were older compared to those with moderate or minor polypharmacy (75 vs. 73 years, respectively) and were most frequently prescribed pain medications (477.3 per 1,000 total visits). NSAIDs were the most frequently prescribed, with 232.4 per 1,000 total visits resulting in one high-risk NSAID prescription, while 21.9 per 1,000 total visits resulted in two or more high-risk NSAIDs.Most patients over 65 years experienced some degree of polypharmacy, with many experiencing major polypharmacy. This indicates an increased need for expanded pharmacist roles through medication therapy management and safety monitoring in this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W3188615111,"To investigate university students' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them.A multi-methods approach was used-online convenience sample surveys and semi-structured interviews-of young adults attending a large Canadian public university. Two survey samples were collected (June 20-July 28, 2020 and September 22-October 17, 2020). Semi-structured interviews were conducted following each survey, interviewing 20 students in each round.In June 77.8% of surveyed students (n = 483) were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine; in September 79.6% were willing (n = 1269). Multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses found that increasing perception of the severity of COVID-19 predicted the likelihood that a respondent was willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine in both surveys. In the latter survey students who indicated they would be encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine if their doctor/pharmacist recommended it were 76 times more likely to be willing to get the vaccine than those who would not be encouraged by medical advice. Interviews revealed concerns about the speed of the vaccine roll out, safety, and efficacy.The majority of university students intend to get the COVID-19 vaccine, but there are nuanced concerns about efficacy and safety that must be taken into account by public health authorities as the vaccine becomes available to this group. Ensuring that family doctors, pharmacists, and other front-line healthcare workers have consistent and clear information regarding the benefits of vaccination will be critical to encouraging uptake among young adults."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of IS patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to non-IS patients. Methods We designed a retrospective cohort study. We included all patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a large multicentre national cohort in Spain, from March 27 th until June 19 th , 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of in-hospital death among IS compared to non-IS patients. Results Among 13 206 included patients, 2 111 (16.0%) were IS. A total of 166 (1.3%) patients had solid organ (SO) transplant, 1081 (8.2%) had SO neoplasia, 332 (2.5%) had hematologic neoplasia, and 570 (4.3%), 183 (1.4%) and 394 (3.0%) were receiving systemic steroids, biological treatments, and immunosuppressors, respectively. Compared to non-IS patients, the aOR (95% CI) for in-hospital death was 1.60 (1.43–1.79) for all IS patients, 1.39 (1.18–1.63) for patients with SO cancer, 2.31 (1.76–3.03) for patients with haematological cancer and 3.12 (2.23–4.36) for patients with SO transplant. The aOR (95% CI) for death for patients who were receiving systemic steroids, biological treatments and immunosuppressors compared to non-IS patients were 2.16 (1.80–2.61), 1.97 (1.33–2.91) and 2.06 (1.64–2.60), respectively. IS patients had a higher odds than non-IS patients of in-hospital acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, myocarditis, thromboembolic disease and multiorgan failure. Conclusions IS patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have a higher odds of in-hospital complications and death compared to non-IS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3189804009,"Introduction Recently, several single center studies have suggested a protective effect of the influenza vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study utilizes a continuously updated Electronic Medical Record (EMR) network to assess the possible benefits of influenza vaccination mitigating critical adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from 56 healthcare organizations (HCOs). Methods The de-identified records of 73,346,583 patients were retrospectively screened. Two cohorts of 37,377 patients, having either received or not received influenza vaccination six months–two weeks prior to SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnosis, were created using Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) and logical observation identifiers names and codes (LOINC) codes. Adverse outcomes within 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were compared between cohorts. Outcomes were assessed with stringent propensity score matching including age, race, ethnicity, gender, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, heart disease, and lifestyle habits such as smoking. Results SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced decreased sepsis (p&lt;0.01, Risk Ratio: 1.361–1.450, 95% CI:1.123–1.699, NNT:286) and stroke (p&lt;0.02, RR: 1.451–1.580, 95% CI:1.075–2.034, NNT:625) across all time points. ICU admissions were lower in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients receiving the influenza vaccine at 30, 90, and 120 days (p&lt;0.03, RR: 1.174–1.200, 95% CI:1.003–1.385, NNT:435), while approaching significance at 60 days (p = 0.0509, RR: 1.156, 95% CI:0.999–1.338). Patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced fewer DVTs 60–120 days after positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (p&lt;0.02, RR:1.41–1.530, 95% CI:1.082–2.076, NNT:1000) and experienced fewer emergency department (ED) visits 90–120 days post SARS-CoV-2-positive diagnosis (p&lt;0.01, RR:1.204–1.580, 95% CI: 1.050–1.476, NNT:176). Conclusion Our analysis outlines the potential protective effect of influenza vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients against adverse outcomes within 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of a positive diagnosis. Significant findings favoring influenza vaccination mitigating the risks of sepsis, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), emergency department (ED) &amp; Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions suggest a potential protective effect that could benefit populations without readily available access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Thus further investigation with future prospective studies is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3192852745,"In the liver, ductal cells rarely proliferate during homeostasis but do so transiently after tissue injury. These cells can be expanded as organoids that recapitulate several of the cell-autonomous mechanisms of regeneration but lack the stromal interactions of the native tissue. Here, using organoid co-cultures that recapitulate the ductal-to-mesenchymal cell architecture of the portal tract, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of mouse periportal mesenchymal cells exerts dual control on proliferation of the epithelium. Ductal cell proliferation is either induced and sustained or, conversely, completely abolished, depending on the number of direct mesenchymal cell contacts, through a mechanism mediated, at least in part, by Notch signaling. Our findings expand the concept of the cellular niche in epithelial tissues, whereby not only soluble factors but also cell-cell contacts are the key regulatory cues involved in the control of cellular behaviors, suggesting a critical role for cell-cell contacts during regeneration."

All the rice flours had different chemical composition, physical characteristic, and techno-functionality. The KMRF, NKRF, and JMRF were classified as a low amylose type (19.56-21.25% dw). All rice flours had low total extractable phenolic content (0.1-0.3 mg GAE/g dw) with some DPPH● scavenging activity (38.87-46.77%). The variations in the bulk density (1.36-1.83 g/cm3), water absorption capacity (0.71-1.17 g/g), solubility (6.93-13.67%), oil absorption capacity (1.39-2.49 g/g), and swelling power (5.71-6.84 g/g) were noticeable. The least gelation concentration ranged from 4.0 to 8.0% where KMRF was easier to form gel than JMRF, and NKRF/CMRF. The foam capacity of the flours was relatively low (1.30-2.60%). The pasting properties differed among rice flours and the lowest pasting temperature was observed in CMRF. Overall, the chemical, physical, functional, and pasting qualities of flours were substantially influenced by rice variety. The findings offered fundamental information on Thai indigenous rice flour that can be used in food preparations for specific uses."

The first-line treatment recommended by WHO is the combination of gentamicin with ampicillin or benzylpenicillin. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are increasingly resistant to previously effective antibiotics.Our goal was to estimate the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteremia and identify risk factors for antibiotic resistance, among newborns with GNB sepsis.At a tertiary hospital in Ethiopia, we enrolled a cohort pregnant women and their newborns, between March and December 2017. Newborns who were followed up until 60 days of life for clinical signs of sepsis. Among the newborns with clinical signs of sepsis, blood samples were cultured; bacterial species were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. We described the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, identified newborn, maternal, and environmental factors associated with multidrug resistance (MDR), and combined resistance to ampicillin and gentamicin (AmpGen), using multivariable regression.Of the 119 newborns with gram-negative bacteremia, 80 (67%) were born preterm and 82 (70%) had early-onset sepsis. The most prevalent gram-negative species were Klebsiella pneumoniae 94 (79%) followed by Escherichia coli 10 (8%). Ampicillin resistance was found in 113 cases (95%), cefotaxime 104 (87%), gentamicin 101 (85%), AmpGen 101 (85%), piperacillin-tazobactam 47 (39%), amikacin 10 (8.4%), and Imipenem 1 (0.8%). Prevalence of MDR was 88% (n = 105). Low birthweight and late-onset sepsis (LOS) were associated with higher risks of AmpGen-resistant infections. All-cause mortality was higher among newborns treated with ineffective antibiotics.There was significant resistance to current first-line antibiotics and cephalosporins. Additional data are needed from primary care and community settings. Amikacin and piperacillin-tazobactam had lower rates of resistance; however, context-specific assessments of their potential adverse effects, their local availability, and cost-effectiveness would be necessary before selecting a new first-line regimen to help guide clinical decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3189082319,"Aims The objective of this study is to analyze how the impact of Diabetes Mellitus [DM] in patients with COVID-19 varies according to altitudinal gradient. Methods We obtained 1,280,806 records from adult patients with COVID-19 and DM to analyze the probability of COVID-19, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, hospitalization, intubation, admission to the Intensive Care Unit [ICU] and case-fatality rates [CFR]. Variables were controlled by age, sex and altitude of residence to calculate adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios. Results Patients with DM had a 21.8% higher prevalence of COVID-19 and an additional 120.2% higher prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia. The adjusted prevalence was also higher for these outcomes as well as for hospitalization, intubation and ICU admission. COVID-19 and pneumonia patients with DM had a 97.0% and 19.4% higher CFR, respectively. With increasing altitudes, the probability of being a confirmed COVID-19 case and the development of pneumonia decreased along CFR for patients with and without DM. However, COVID-19 patients with DM were more likely to require intubation when residing at high altitude. Conclusions The study suggests that patients with DM have a higher probability of being a confirmed COVID-19 case and developing pneumonia. Higher altitude had a protective relationship against SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it may be associated with more severe cases in patients with and without DM. High altitude decreases CFR for all COVID-19 patients. Our work also shows that women are less affected than men regardless of altitude."
https://openalex.org/W3188413950,"Most of our knowledge on reproductive biology of gray whales dates back to scientific research conducted during commercial whaling in the late 1950s and 1960s. The goal of the present study was to provide updated insights on reproductive physiology of gray whales, using progesterone and testosterone as biomarkers. We measured hormone concentrations using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) techniques in blubber biopsies collected from 106 individual whales from March to November over a span of 12 years (2004-2016) between California and Alaska. We found testosterone concentrations in males to increase significantly with age (P = 0.03). Adult males showed significantly elevated testosterone concentrations when sampled in the fall compared to the summer (P = 0.01), likely indicating physiological preparation for mating. We measured testosterone concentrations in females of different age classes, but no statistical differences were found. We found significantly higher progesterone concentrations in pregnant females compared to non-pregnant females and adult males (P< 0.001), indicating progesterone is a valid biomarker for pregnancy in gray whales. Both female and male calves had elevated progesterone concentrations, suggesting maternal transfer via lactation. We fit a mixture of two normal distributions to progesterone data from all non-calf females to identify clusters of high and low progesterone and estimated the probability of being pregnant for whales of unknown reproductive status. With this approach we identified likely pregnant and non-pregnant animals. This study represents an important milestone on reproductive profiles in this population, that can be used to estimate more accurate and precise reproductive parameters to be used for better understanding population dynamics of gray whales."
https://openalex.org/W3189020874,"The habenula (Hb) has been hypothesized to play an essential role in major depressive disorder (MDD) as it is considered to be an important node between fronto-limbic areas and midbrain monoaminergic structures based on animal studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the differences in volume and T1 value of the Hb between patients with MDD and healthy control (HC) subjects. Analysis for the Hb volumes was performed using high-resolution 7-T magnetic resonance (MR) image data from 33 MDD patients and 36 healthy subjects. Two researchers blinded to the clinical data manually delineated the habenular nuclei and Hb volume, and T1 values were calculated based on overlapping voxels. We compared the Hb volume and T1 value between the MDD and HC groups and compared the volume and T1 values between the left and right Hbs in each group. Compared to HC subjects, MDD patients had a smaller right Hb volume; however, there was no significant volume difference in the left Hb between groups. In the MDD group, the right Hb was smaller in volume and lower in T1 value than the left Hb. The present findings suggest a smaller right Hb volume and left-right asymmetry of Hb volume in MDD. Future high-resolution 7-T MR imaging studies with larger sample sizes will be needed to derive a more definitive conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W3187305319,"Conventional chemotherapeutic agents for colorectal cancer (CRC) cause systemic side effects and eventually become less efficacious owing to the development of drug resistance in cancer cells. Therefore, new therapeutic regimens have focused on the use of natural products. The anticancer activity of several parts of Calotropis gigantea has been reported; however, the effects of its stem bark extract on inhibition of cancer cell proliferation have not yet been examined. In this study, the anticancer activity of C . gigantea stem bark extract, both alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), was evaluated. A crude ethanolic extract was prepared from dry, powdered C . gigantea barks using 95% ethanol. This was then partitioned to obtain dichloromethane (CGDCM), ethyl acetate, and water fractions. Quantitative analysis of the constituent secondary metabolites and calotropin was performed. These fractions exhibited cytotoxicity in HCT116 and HT-29 cells, with CGDCM showing the highest potency in both the cell lines. A combination of CGDCM and 5-FU significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect. Moreover, the resistance of normal fibroblast, HFF-1, cells to this combination demonstrated its safety in normal cells. The combination significantly enhanced apoptosis through the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Additionally, the combination reduced adenosine triphosphate production and increased the production of reactive oxygen species, demonstrating the mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis. Our results suggest that CGDCM is a promising anti-cancer agent and may enhance apoptosis induction by 5-FU in the treatment of CRC, while minimizing toxicity toward healthy cells."
https://openalex.org/W3189732827,"Introduction During the 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, limited data from several countries suggested reduced seasonal influenza viruses’ circulation. This was due to community mitigation measures implemented to control the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used sentinel surveillance data to identify changes in the 2020 influenza season compared with previous seasons in Bangladesh. Methods We used hospital-based influenza surveillance (HBIS) data of Bangladesh that are generated year-round and are population-representative severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) data for all age groups from seven public and two private tertiary care level hospitals data from 2016 to 2019. We applied the moving epidemic method (MEM) by using R language (v4.0.3), and MEM web applications (v2.14) on influenza-positive rates of SARI cases collected weekly to estimate an average seasonal influenza curve and establish epidemic thresholds. Results The 2016–2019 average season started on epi week 18 (95% CI: 15–25) and lasted 12.5 weeks (95% CI: 12–14 weeks) until week 30.5. The 2020 influenza season started on epi week 36 and ended at epi week 41, lasting for only five weeks. Therefore, influenza epidemic started 18 weeks later, was 7.5 weeks shorter, and was less intense than the average epidemic of the four previous years. The 2020 influenza season started on the same week when COVID-19 control measures were halted, and 13 weeks after the measures were relaxed. Conclusion Our findings suggest that seasonal influenza circulation in Bangladesh was delayed and less intense in 2020 than in previous years. Community mitigation measures may have contributed to this reduction of seasonal influenza transmission. These findings contribute to a limited but growing body of evidence that influenza seasons were altered globally in 2020."

This study reports the trend and burden of cancer from 1990 to 2017 along with its risk factors in Nepal. Methods This study used the database of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Burden of Diseases on cancer from Nepal to describe the most recent data available (2017) and trends by age, gender, and year from 1990 to 2017. The data are described as incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and percentage change. Results In 2017, the age-standardized cancer incidence and mortality rates were 101.8/100,000 and 86.6/100,000 respectively in Nepal. Cancer contributed to 10% of total deaths and 5.6% of total DALYs in Nepal. The most common cancers were the breast, lung, cervical, stomach and oral cavity cancers. The number of new cancer cases and deaths in Nepal have increased from 1990 to 2017 by 92% and 95% respectively. On the other hand, age-standardized incidence and mortality rates decreased by 5% and 7% respectively. The leading risk factors of cancer were tobacco use, dietary factors, unsafe sex, air pollution, drug use, and physical inactivity. Conclusions This study highlighted the burden of cancer in Nepal, contributing to a significant number of new cancer cases, deaths and DALY. A comprehensive approach including prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, and rehabilitation should be urgently taken to reduce the burden of cancer."

However, due to the imperfection of the credit system and the influence of cyberspace restrictions, P2P network lending faces frequent borrower credit risk crises during the transaction process, with a high proportion of borrowers default. This paper first analyzes the basic development of China’s P2P online lending and the credit risks of borrowers in the industry. Then according to the characteristics of P2P network lending and previous studies, a credit risk assessment indicators system for borrowers in P2P lending is formulated with 29 indicators. Finally, on the basis of the credit risk assessment indicators system constructed in this paper, BP neural network is built based on the BP algorithm, which is trained by the LM algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt), Scaled Conjugate Gradient, and Bayesian Regularization respectively, to complete the credit risk assessment model. By comparing the results of three mentioned training methodologies, the BP neural network trained by the LM algorithm is finally adopted to construct the credit risk assessment model of borrowers in P2P lending, in which the input layer node is 9, the hidden layer node is 11 and output layer node is 1. The model can provide practical guidance for China and other countries’ P2P lending platforms, and therefore to establish and improve an accurate and effective borrower credit risk management system."
https://openalex.org/W3188403016,"This study aims to provide an automatic strabismus screening method for people who live in remote areas with poor medical accessibility.The proposed method first utilizes a pretrained convolutional neural network-based face-detection model and a detector for 68 facial landmarks to extract the eye region for a frontal facial image. Second, Otsu's binarization and the HSV color model are applied to the image to eliminate the influence of eyelashes and canthi. Then, the method samples all of the pixel points on the limbus and applies the least square method to obtain the coordinate of the pupil center. Lastly, we calculated the distances from the pupil center to the medial and lateral canthus to measure the deviation of the positional similarity of two eyes for strabismus screening.We used a total of 60 frontal facial images (30 strabismus images, 30 normal images) to validate the proposed method. The average value of the iris positional similarity of normal images was smaller than one of the strabismus images via the method (p-value<0.001). The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the positional similarity of the normal and strabismus images were 1.073 ± 0.014 and 0.039, as well as 1.924 ± 0.169 and 0.472, respectively.The experimental results of 60 images show that the proposed method is a promising automatic strabismus screening method for people living in remote areas with poor medical accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W3191134229,"The objective of this study was to explore the effects of time, seasons, and total carbon (TC) on Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn) deposition in the surface sediments. This study was performed at the H-02 constructed wetland on the Savannah River Site (Aiken, SC, USA). Covering both warm (April-September) and cool (October-March) seasons, several sediment cores were collected twice a year from the H-02 constructed wetland cells from 2007 to 2013. Total concentrations of Cu and Zn were measured in the sediments. Concentrations of Cu and Zn (mean ± standard deviation) in the surface sediments over 7 years of operation increased from 6.0 ± 2.8 and 14.6 ± 4.5 mg kg -1 to 139.6 ± 87.7 and 279.3 ± 202.9 mg kg -1 dry weight, respectively. The linear regression model explained the behavior and the variability of Cu deposition in the sediments. On the other hand, using the generalized least squares extension with the linear regression model allowed for unequal variance and thus produced a model that explained the variance properly, and as a result, was more successful in explaining the pattern of Zn deposition. Total carbon significantly affected both Cu ( p = 0.047) and Zn ( p &lt; 0.001). Time effect on Cu deposition was statistically significant ( p = 0.013), whereas Zn was significantly affected by the season ( p = 0.009)."
https://openalex.org/W3188108078,"Background Coagulation disorders are common in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), associated with an increased risk of bleeding and death. We aim to investigate coagulation disorders and their outcome implications in critically ill patients with HLH. Methods We prospectively evaluated 47 critically ill patients with HLH (median age of 54 years [42–67]) between April 2015 and December 2018. Coagulation assessments were performed at day 1. Abnormal standard coagulation was defined as prothrombin time (PT) &lt;50% and/or fibrinogen &lt;2g/L. HLH aetiology was mostly ascribed to haematological malignancies (74% of patients). Results Coagulation disorders and severe bleeding events were frequent, occurring in 30 (64%) and 11 (23%) patients respectively. At day 1, median fibrinogen level was 2∙65g/L [1.61–5.66]. Fibrinolytic activity was high as suggested by increased median levels of D-dimers, fibrin monomers, PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor) and tPA (tissue plasminogen activator). Forty-one (91%) patients had a decreased ADAMTS13 activity (A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats, member 13). By multivariable analysis, the occurrence of a severe bleeding (OR 3.215 [1.194–8.653], p = 0∙021) and SOFA score (Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment) at day 1 (OR 1.305 per point [1.146–1.485], p&lt;0∙001) were independently associated with hospital mortality. No early biological marker was associated with severe bleeding. Conclusions Hyperfibrinolysis may be the primary mechanism responsible for hypofibrinogenemia and may also participate in ADAMTS13 degradation. Targeting the plasmin system appears as a promising approach in severe HLH-related coagulation disorders."

In this study, genetic purity, parent-offspring relationship and diversity among the inbred lines were assessed using 92 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A total of 188 maize genotypes, comprising of 26 inbred lines, four doubled haploid (DH) lines and 158 single-cross maize hybrids were investigated in this study using Kompetitive Allele Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (KASP) genotyping assays. The bi-allelic data was analyzed for genetic purity and diversity parameters using GenAlex software. The SNP markers were highly polymorphic and 90% had polymorphic information content (PIC) values of &gt; 0.3. Pairwise genetic distances among the lines ranged from 0.05 to 0.56, indicating a high level of dissimilarity among the inbred lines. A maximum genetic distance of (0.56) was observed between inbred lines CKDHL0089 and CML443 while the lowest (0.05) was between I-42 and I-40. The majority (67%) of the inbred lines studied were genetically pure with residual heterozygosity of &lt;5%, while only 33% had heterozygosity levels of &gt;5%. Inbred lines, which were not pure, require purification through further inbreeding. Cluster analysis partitioned the lines into three distinct genetic clusters with the potential to contribute new beneficial alleles to the maize breeding program. Out of the 68 hybrids (43%) that passed the parent-offspring test, seven hybrids namely; SCHP29, SCHP95, SCHP94, SCHP134, SCHP44, SCHP114 and SCHP126, were selected as potential candidates for further evaluation and release due to their outstanding yield performance."
https://openalex.org/W3189758560,"Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the extracellular deposition of the transport protein transthyretin (TTR) as amyloid fibrils. Despite the progress achieved in recent years, understanding why different TTR residue substitutions lead to different clinical manifestations remains elusive. Here, we studied the molecular basis of disease-causing missense mutations affecting residues R34 and K35. R34G and K35T variants cause vitreous amyloidosis, whereas R34T and K35N mutations result in amyloid polyneuropathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. All variants are more sensitive to pH-induced dissociation and amyloid formation than the wild-type (WT)-TTR counterpart, specifically in the variants deposited in the eyes amyloid formation occurs close to physiological pHs. Chemical denaturation experiments indicate that all the mutants are less stable than WT-TTR, with the vitreous amyloidosis variants, R34G and K35T, being highly destabilized. Sequence-induced stabilization of the dimer-dimer interface with T119M rendered tetramers containing R34G or K35T mutations resistant to pH-induced aggregation. Because R34 and K35 are among the residues more distant to the TTR interface, their impact in this region is therefore theorized to occur at long range. The crystal structures of double mutants, R34G/T119M and K35T/T119M, together with molecular dynamics simulations indicate that their strong destabilizing effect is initiated locally at the BC loop, increasing its flexibility in a mutation-dependent manner. Overall, the present findings help us to understand the sequence-dynamic-structural mechanistic details of TTR amyloid aggregation triggered by R34 and K35 variants and to link the degree of mutation-induced conformational flexibility to protein aggregation propensity."
https://openalex.org/W3189809100,"Ammonia is a cytotoxic molecule generated during normal cellular functions. Dysregulated ammonia metabolism, which is evident in many chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, initiates a hyperammonemic stress response in tissues including skeletal muscle and in myotubes. Perturbations in levels of specific regulatory molecules have been reported, but the global responses to hyperammonemia are unclear. In this study, we used a multiomics approach to vertically integrate unbiased data generated using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, RNA-Seq, and proteomics. We then horizontally integrated these data across different models of hyperammonemia, including myotubes and mouse and human muscle tissues. Changes in chromatin accessibility and/or expression of genes resulted in distinct clusters of temporal molecular changes including transient, persistent, and delayed responses during hyperammonemia in myotubes. Known responses to hyperammonemia, including mitochondrial and oxidative dysfunction, protein homeostasis disruption, and oxidative stress pathway activation, were enriched in our datasets. During hyperammonemia, pathways that impact skeletal muscle structure and function that were consistently enriched were those that contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and senescence. We made several novel observations, including an enrichment in antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 family protein expression, increased calcium flux, and increased protein glycosylation in myotubes and muscle tissue upon hyperammonemia. Critical molecules in these pathways were validated experimentally. Human skeletal muscle from patients with cirrhosis displayed similar responses, establishing translational relevance. These data demonstrate complex molecular interactions during adaptive and maladaptive responses during the cellular stress response to hyperammonemia."
https://openalex.org/W3190987911,"Muscle disuse leads to a rapid decline in muscle mass, with reduced muscle protein synthesis (MPS) considered the primary physiological mechanism. Here, we employed a systems biology approach to uncover molecular networks and key molecular candidates that quantitatively link to the degree of muscle atrophy and/or extent of decline in MPS during short-term disuse in humans. After consuming a bolus dose of deuterium oxide (D2O; 3 mL.kg−1), eight healthy males (22 ± 2 years) underwent 4 days of unilateral lower-limb immobilization. Bilateral muscle biopsies were obtained post-intervention for RNA sequencing and D2O-derived measurement of MPS, with thigh lean mass quantified using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Application of weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 15 distinct gene clusters (“modules”) with an expression profile regulated by disuse and/or quantitatively connected to disuse-induced muscle mass or MPS changes. Module scans for candidate targets established an experimentally tractable set of candidate regulatory molecules (242 hub genes, 31 transcriptional regulators) associated with disuse-induced maladaptation, many themselves potently tied to disuse-induced reductions in muscle mass and/or MPS and, therefore, strong physiologically relevant candidates. Notably, we implicate a putative role for muscle protein breakdown-related molecular networks in impairing MPS during short-term disuse, and further establish DEPTOR (a potent mTOR inhibitor) as a critical mechanistic candidate of disuse driven MPS suppression in humans. Overall, these findings offer a strong benchmark for accelerating mechanistic understanding of short-term muscle disuse atrophy that may help expedite development of therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3161792803,"Objective The Self-Importance of Moral Identity Scale (SMIS) was developed by Aquino and Reeds with the purpose of measuring how people evaluate their private ( Internalization subscale) and public ( Symbolization subscale) moral identity. SMIS has become commonly and broadly used in many studies. The aim of this paper is to validate the Polish version of SMIS by analyzing its structure and relation to similar measures (such as The Moral Self-Concept Scale developed by Stake and The Moral Self-Image Scale created by Jordan, Leliveld and Tenbrunsel), declared past prosocial behaviors and readiness to donate money. Methods The translation-back-translation procedure was used to maintain semantic, idiomatic, and conceptual equivalence of the original scale. Throughout four separate studies the psychometric properties of the Polish version of the scale were assessed: Study 1 ( N = 529) was carried out to derive the factor structure using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and cross-validate it; Study 2 ( N = 602) and Study 3 ( N = 899) were performed to confirm and replicate the structure with the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA); gender-balanced Study 4 ( N = 862) was conducted to assess measurement invariance over gender using multigroup CFA, and to normalize the scale. Validity of the scale was assessed based on each study. Results A stable two-factor structure using 10 items was replicated in four different samples. The results showed that reliability (α) was between 0.71 and 0.81 for Internalization , and 0.76 and 0.81 for Symbolization . Validity was confirmed in terms of the expected pattern of correlations with morality measures and factorial structure. Metric invariance across gender was confirmed with possible exception of factor loadings on two items regarding communication of values. Polish normalization for men and women was constructed. Conclusions Polish validation of SMIS proved to be a structurally consistent and valid measure."
https://openalex.org/W3189048983,"Background As epidemiological data on child mental health in low- and middle-income countries are limited, a large-scale survey was undertaken to estimate the prevalence and amount of child emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) in Nepal as reported by the parents. Methods 3820 schoolchildren aged 6–18 years were selected from 16 districts of the three geographical regions of Nepal, including rural, semi-urban and urban areas. We used the Nepali version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/6-18 years as screening instrument. Comparisons of child problems between genders and between the seven largest castes and ethnic groups were carried out by analysis of variance. Prevalence was computed based on American norms. Results Adjusted prevalence of Total Problems was 18.3% (boys: 19.1%; girls:17.6%). The prevalence of internalizing problems was higher than externalizing problems. The mean scores of Total, Externalizing, and Internalizing problems were 29.7 (SD 25.6), 7.7 (SD 8.0), and 9.1 (SD 8.1), respectively. The Khas Kaami (Dalit) group scored the highest, and the indigenous Tharu group scored the lowest on all scales. In the Mountains and Middle Hills regions, problem scores were higher in the rural areas, whereas in the Tarai region, they were higher in the urban areas. Conclusion The prevalence and magnitude of emotional and behavioral problems in Nepali children were found to be high compared to findings in meta-analyses worldwide. Problem scores varied according to gender, castes /ethnic groups, and living areas. Our findings highlight the need for a stronger focus on child mental problems in a low-and middle-income country like Nepal."

Weight status was classified according to the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs for overweight, obesity, and thinness, and according to mean body mass index (kg/m2).The Norwegian Youth Growth Study, consisting of a nationally representative sample of Norwegian 13-year-olds (n = 1852; 50.7% girls), which is a part of The Norwegian Growth Cohort.Among 13-year-old Norwegians, the prevalence of overweight (including obesity), obesity, and thinness was 15.8%, 2.5%, and 7.3%, respectively. There was little evidence that these had changed from 8 to 13 years. From 8 to 13 years, the odds of obesity was highest in the Northern region of Norway compared to the South-East (odds ratio (OR): 3.78 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 12.65; p = 0.036) and in rural areas (OR: 4.76 (95% CI: 1.52, 14.90; p = 0.027). Over the same age period, girls had a trend towards a higher odds of thinness compared to boys (OR: 1.65 (95% CI: 0.98, 2.78; p = 0.057).In Norway, the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and thinness among 13-year-olds seem to be established by age 8 years. The prevalence of obesity was higher in the North and in rural areas. The results indicate the continued need for early prevention and treatment, and targeted interventions to certain areas."
https://openalex.org/W3187115296,"Cytokinesis, the final step of mitosis, is mediated by an actomyosin contractile ring, the formation of which is temporally and spatially regulated following anaphase onset. Aurora-B is a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, which regulates various processes during mitosis; it is not understood, however, how Aurora-B is involved in cytokinesis. Here, we show that Aurora-B and myosin-IIB form a complex in vivo during telophase. Aurora-B phosphorylates the myosin-IIB rod domain at threonine 1847 (T1847), abrogating the ability of myosin-IIB monomers to form filaments. Furthermore, phosphorylation of myosin-IIB filaments by Aurora-B also promotes filament disassembly. We show that myosin-IIB possessing a phosphomimetic mutation at T1847 was unable to rescue cytokinesis failure caused by myosin-IIB depletion. Cells expressing a phosphoresistant mutation at T1847 had significantly longer intercellular bridges, implying that Aurora-B-mediated phosphorylation of myosin-IIB is important for abscission. We propose that myosin-IIB is a substrate of Aurora-B and reveal a new mechanism of myosin-IIB regulation by Aurora-B in the late stages of mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W3188961883,"Objective Prisoners constitute a high-risk group for suicide, with suicide rates about 5 to 8 times higher than in the general population. The first weeks of imprisonment are a particularly vulnerable time, but there is limited knowledge about the risk factors for either early or late suicide events. Methods Based on a national total sample of prison suicides in Germany between 2005 and 2017, suicides within the first 2 (4 and 8) weeks after reception into prison were matched by age and penalty length with cases that occurred later. Factors that potentially influence the timing of suicide were investigated. Results The study has shown that 16.7% (31.5%) of all 390 suicides in German prisons occurred within the first two weeks (two months) of imprisonment. Factors that facilitate adaptation to the prison environment (e.g. prior prison experience) were negatively associated with early suicide events. Factors that hindered the adaptation process (e.g. withdrawal from illicit drugs) were observed more frequently in early suicide events than in late ones. These factors are active at different times of imprisonment. Conclusion At reception, particular attention should be paid to the following factors associated with early suicide events: widowed marital status, lack of prison experience, and drug dependency."
https://openalex.org/W3190756517,"While the annual incidence of HIV diagnosis in pregnancy in Brazil remains relatively stable, rates of maternal syphilis increased over six-fold in the past decade. We hypothesized that maternal HIV and syphilis are two distinct epidemics. Data on all cases of maternal HIV or syphilis detected in pregnancy between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018 were requested from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. In order to evaluate how the epidemics evolved over the time period, ArcGIS software was used to generate spatiotemporal maps of annual rates of detection of maternal HIV and syphilis in 2010 and 2018. We utilized Euclidean-distance hot spot analysis to identify state-specific clusters in 2010 and 2018. From 2010 to 2018, there were 66,631 cases of maternal HIV, 225,451 cases of maternal syphilis, and 150,414 cases of congenital syphilis in Brazil. The state of Rio Grande do Sul had the highest rate of maternal HIV detection in both 2010 and 2018. Hot spots of maternal HIV were identified in the three most Southern states in both 2010 and 2018 (99% confidence, z-score &gt;2.58, p &lt;0.01). While syphilis incidence &gt;30 per 1,000 live births in 2018 in four states, only the two coastal states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo in Southeastern Brazil were significant hot spots (90% confidence, z-score 1.65–1.95, p &lt;0.10). Contrary to the general assumption, HIV and syphilis epidemics in Brazil are not syndemic in pregnant women. There is a spatial cluster of maternal HIV in the South, while syphilis is increasing throughout the country, more recently on the coast. Focusing on maternal HIV hot spots in the Southern states is insufficient to curtail the maternal and congenital syphilis epidemics throughout the country. New strategies, including ongoing hot spot analysis, are urgently needed to monitor, identify and treat maternal syphilis."

Due to the close contact between humans and their companion animals, especially dogs and cats, there is concern about the potential for zoonotic transmission of this enteric protozoan parasite by infected animals. This study aimed to perform a microscopic and molecular diagnosis of Cryptosporidium spp. in fecal samples from domiciled dogs and cats. One hundred and nineteen fecal samples were processed using sugar centrifugal flotation followed by molecular detection of Cryptosporidium spp. DNA using nested PCR. Subtyping of isolates positive for C . parvum was performed by sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein gene (GP60). Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 7.8% (5/64) and 5.4% (3/55) of the fecal samples from dogs and cats, respectively. Cryptosporidium canis (n = 3) and C . parvum (n = 2) were the main species found in dogs, whereas C . felis (n = 3) was prevalent in cats. Subtype IIaA17G2R2 (potentially zoonotic) was identified in samples positive for C . parvum . Despite the low prevalence of Cryptosporidium observed in the domiciled dogs and cats, the presence of potentially zoonotic C . parvum in dogs evidences a public health concern. Further research is needed to better understand the epidemiology, source, and potential impacts of Cryptosporidium infection in cats and dogs."

The model has been implemented in the Muhuri Irrigation Project (MIP), Bangladesh, where the irrigation systems lead to unjustifiable use of groundwater. This study explores how water can be optimised to increase agricultural production and sustain the local environment in the MIP. Hence, the paper has two objectives—to maximise the net return and minimise the deficit in environmental flow. The study uses a Non-Dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm, NSGA-II, to solve the research problem. Results indicate that crops more profitable to trade should be cultivated. Furthermore, the rainfall has more impact on the net return and environmental flow deficit than water inflow.

https://openalex.org/W3187607387,"Glutamate plays diverse roles in neuronal cells, affecting cell energetics and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These roles are especially vital for neuronal cells, which deal with high amounts of glutamate as a neurotransmitter. Our analysis explored neuronal glutamate implication in cellular energy metabolism and ROS generation, using a kinetic model that simulates electron transport details in respiratory complexes, linked ROS generation and metabolic reactions. The analysis focused on the fact that glutamate attenuates complex II inhibition by oxaloacetate, stimulating the latter’s transformation into aspartate. Such a mechanism of complex II activation by glutamate could cause almost complete reduction of ubiquinone and deficiency of oxidized form (Q), which closes the main stream of electron transport and opens a way to massive ROS generating transfer in complex III from semiquinone radicals to molecular oxygen. In this way, under low workload, glutamate triggers the respiratory chain (RC) into a different steady state characterized by high ROS generation rate. The observed stepwise dependence of ROS generation on glutamate concentration experimentally validated this prediction. However, glutamate’s attenuation of oxaloacetate’s inhibition accelerates electron transport under high workload. Glutamate-oxaloacetate interaction in complex II regulation underlies the observed effects of uncouplers and inhibitors and acceleration of Ca 2+ uptake. Thus, this theoretical analysis uncovered the previously unknown roles of oxaloacetate as a regulator of ROS generation and glutamate as a modifier of this regulation. The model predicted that this mechanism of complex II activation by glutamate might be operative in situ and responsible for excitotoxicity. Spatial-time gradients of synthesized hydrogen peroxide concentration, calculated in the reaction-diffusion model with convection under a non-uniform local approximation of nervous tissue, have shown that overproduction of H 2 O 2 in a cell causes excess of its level in neighbor cells."
https://openalex.org/W3189861159,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has alarming implications for individual and population level mental health. Although the future of COVID-19 is unknown at present, more countries or regions start to ease restrictions. The findings from this study have provided the empirical evidence of prevalence and patterns of mental disorders in Chinese general population before and after easing most COVID-19 restrictions, and information of the factors associated with these patterns. Methods A cross-sectional population-based online survey was carried out from February to March 2020 in the general population across all provinces in China. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was incorporated in the survey. Latent class analyses were performed to investigate the patterns of mental disorders and multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine how individual and regional risk factors can predict mental disorder patterns. Results Four distinctive patterns of mental health were revealed in the general population. After the ease of most COVID-19 restrictions, the prevalence of high risk of mental disorders decreased from 25.8% to 20.9% and prevalence of being high risk of unhappiness and loss of confidence decreased from 10.1% to 8.1%. However, the prevalence of stressed, social dysfunction and unhappy were consistently high before and after easing restrictions. Several regional factors, such as case mortality rate and healthcare resources, were associated with mental health status. Of note, healthcare workers were less likely to have mental disorders, compared to other professionals and students. Conclusions The dynamic management of mental health and psychosocial well-being is as important as that of physical health both before and after the ease of COVID-19 restrictions. Our findings may help in mental health interventions in other countries and regions while easing COVID-19 restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W3189504902,"Megachile rotundata exhibits a facultative prepupal diapause but the cues regulating diapause initiation are not well understood. Possible cues include daylength and temperature. Megachile rotundata females experience changing daylengths over the nesting season that may influence diapause incidence in their offspring through a maternal effect. Juvenile M . rotundata spend their developmental period confined in a nesting cavity, potentially subjected to stressful temperatures that may affect diapause incidence and survival. To estimate the impact of daylength and nest cavity temperature on offspring diapause, we designed a 3D printed box with iButtons that measured nest cavity temperature. We observed nest building throughout the season, monitored nest cavity temperature, and followed offspring through development to measure diapause incidence and mortality. We found that daylength was a cue for diapause, and nest cavity temperature did not influence diapause incidence. Eggs laid during long days had a lower probability of diapause. Siblings tended to have the same diapause status, explaining a lot of the remaining variance in diapause incidence. Some females established nests that contained both diapausing and nondiapausing individuals, which were distributed throughout the nest. Nest cavities reached stressful temperatures, which decreased survival. Mortality was significantly higher in nondiapausing bees and the individuals that were laid first in the nest. In conclusion, we demonstrate a maternal effect for diapause that is mediated by daylength and is independent of nest box temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3191374228,"Multi-omic analyses that integrate many high-dimensional datasets often present significant deficiencies in statistical power and require time consuming computations to execute the analytical methods. We present SuMO-Fil to remedy against these issues which is a pre-processing method for Supervised Multi-Omic Filtering that removes variables or features considered to be irrelevant noise. SuMO-Fil is intended to be performed prior to downstream analyses that detect supervised gene networks in sparse settings. We accomplish this by implementing variable filters based on low similarity across the datasets in conjunction with low similarity with the outcome. This approach can improve accuracy, as well as reduce run times for a variety of computationally expensive downstream analyses. This method has applications in a setting where the downstream analysis may include sparse canonical correlation analysis. Filtering methods specifically for cluster and network analysis are introduced and compared by simulating modular networks with known statistical properties. The SuMO-Fil method performs favorably by eliminating non-network features while maintaining important biological signal under a variety of different signal settings as compared to popular filtering techniques based on low means or low variances. We show that the speed and accuracy of methods such as supervised sparse canonical correlation are increased after using SuMO-Fil, thus greatly improving the scalability of these approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3191445879,"Although quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been suggested to regulate hepatic blood flow, there is no direct evidence that quiescent HSCs display contractile abilities. Here, we developed a new method to quantitatively measure the contraction of single isolated HSCs and evaluated whether endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced contraction of HSCs in a non-activated state. HSCs isolated from mice were seeded on collagen gel containing fluorescent beads. The beads around a single HSC were observed gravitating toward the cell upon contraction. By recording the movement of each bead by fluorescent microscopy, the real-time contraction of HSCs was quantitatively evaluated. ET-1 induced a slow contraction of non-activated HSCs, which was inhibited by the non-muscle myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin, the calmodulin inhibitor W-7, and the ETA receptor antagonist ambrisentan. ET-1-induced contraction was also largely reduced in Ca2+-free conditions, but sustained contraction still remained. The tonic contraction was further diminished by the Rho-kinase inhibitor H-1152. The mRNA expression of P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC), as well as STIM and Orai, constituents of store-operated channels (SOCs), was observed in mouse non-activated HSCs. ET-1-induced contraction was not affected by amlodipine, a VDCC blocker, whereas it was partly reduced by Gd3+ and amiloride, non-selective cation channel blockers. However, neither YM-58483 nor SKF-96365, which inhibit SOCs, had any effects on the contraction. These results suggest that ET-1 leads to Ca2+-influx through cation channels other than SOCs and produces myosin II-mediated contraction of non-activated HSCs via ETA receptors, as well as via mechanisms involving Ca2+-calmodulin and Rho kinase."

These enzymes catalyze the first and branch point reactions of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the bacterium Prevotella nigrescens (PniDAH7PS), respectively. The interactions between these two distinct catalytic domains support functional interreliance within this bifunctional enzyme. The binding of prephenate, the product of CM-catalyzed reaction, to the CM domain is associated with a striking rearrangement of overall protein conformation that alters the interdomain interactions and allosterically inhibits the DAH7PS activity. Here, we have further investigated the complex allosteric communication demonstrated by this bifunctional enzyme. We observed allosteric activation of CM activity in the presence of all DAH7PS substrates. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, we show that changes in overall protein conformations and dynamics are associated with the presence of different DAH7PS substrates and the allosteric inhibitor prephenate. Furthermore, we have identified an extended interhelix loop located in CM domain, loopC320-F333, as a crucial segment for the interdomain structural and catalytic communications. Our results suggest that the dual-function enzyme PniDAH7PS contains a reciprocal allosteric system between the two enzymatic moieties as a result of this bidirectional interdomain communication. This arrangement allows for a complex feedback and feedforward system for control of pathway flux by connecting the initiation and branch point of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W3188262144,"Besides contributing to anabolism, cellular metabolites serve as substrates or cofactors for enzymes and may also have signaling functions. Given these roles, multiple control mechanisms likely ensure fidelity of metabolite-generating enzymes. Acetate-dependent acetyl CoA synthetases (ACS) are de novo sources of acetyl CoA, a building block for fatty acids and a substrate for acetyltransferases. Eukaryotic acetate-dependent acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (Acss2) is predominantly cytosolic, but is also found in the nucleus following oxygen or glucose deprivation, or upon acetate exposure. Acss2-generated acetyl CoA is used in acetylation of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 2 (HIF-2), a stress-responsive transcription factor. Mutation of a putative nuclear localization signal in endogenous Acss2 abrogates HIF-2 acetylation and signaling, but surprisingly also results in reduced Acss2 protein levels due to unmasking of two protein destabilization elements (PDE) in the Acss2 hinge region. In the current study, we identify up to four additional PDE in the Acss2 hinge region and determine that a previously identified PDE, the ABC domain, consists of two functional PDE. We show that the ABC domain and other PDE are likely masked by intramolecular interactions with other domains in the Acss2 hinge region. We also characterize mice with a prematurely truncated Acss2 that exposes a putative ABC domain PDE, which exhibits reduced Acss2 protein stability and impaired HIF-2 signaling. Finally, using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we demonstrate that the reduced stability of select Acss2 mutant proteins is due to a shortened half-life, which is a result of enhanced degradation via a nonproteasome, nonautophagy pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3189160216,"Foam accumulation in swine manure deep-pits has been linked to explosions and flash fires that pose devastating threats to humans and livestock. It is clear that methane accumulation within these pits is the fuel for the fire; it is not understood what microbial drivers cause the accumulation and stabilization of methane. Here, we conducted a 13-month field study to survey the physical, chemical, and biological changes of pit-manure across 46 farms in Iowa. Our results showed that an increased methane production rate was associated with less digestible feed ingredients, suggesting that diet influences the storage pit’s microbiome. Targeted sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA and archaeal mcrA genes was used to identify microbial communities’ role and influence. We found that microbial communities in foaming and non-foaming manure were significantly different, and that the bacterial communities of foaming manure were more stable than those of non-foaming manure. Foaming manure methanogen communities were enriched with uncharacterized methanogens whose presence strongly correlated with high methane production rates. We also observed strong correlations between feed ration, manure characteristics, and the relative abundance of specific taxa, suggesting that manure foaming is linked to microbial community assemblage driven by efficient free long-chain fatty acid degradation by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3189487996,"Objective We aimed 1) to test the applicability of the previously suggested prognostic value of CPET to elderly cardiac rehabilitation patients and 2) to explore the underlying mechanism of the greater improvement in exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption, VO 2 ) after CR in surgical compared to non-surgical cardiac patients. Methods Elderly patients (≥65 years) commencing CR after coronary artery bypass grafting, surgical valve replacement (surgery-group), percutaneous coronary intervention, percutaneous valve replacement or without revascularisation (non-surgery group) were included in the prospective multi-center EU-CaRE study. CPETs were performed at start of CR, end of CR and 1-year-follow-up. Logistic models and receiver operating characteristics were used to determine prognostic values of CPET parameters for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Linear models were performed for change in peak VO 2 (start to follow-up) and parameters accounting for the difference between surgery and non-surgery patients were sought. Results 1421 out of 1633 EU-CaRE patients performed a valid CPET at start of CR (age 73±5.4, 81% male). No CPET parameter further improved the receiver operation characteristics significantly beyond the model with only clinical parameters. The higher improvement in peak VO 2 (25% vs. 7%) in the surgical group disappeared when adjusted for changes in peak tidal volume and haemoglobin. Conclusion CPET did not improve the prediction of MACE in elderly CR patients. The higher improvement of exercise capacity in surgery patients was mainly driven by restoration of haemoglobin levels and improvement in respiratory function after sternotomy.

https://openalex.org/W3191278124,"MACC1 gene is a newly discovered gene and plays an important role in the metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The objective of this study was to investigate whether MACC1 is an independent factor associated with lymphatic metastasis in CRC patients. We analyzed the association between MACC1 expression and lymphatic metastasis in a nested case-control study including 99 cases and 198 matched controls in CRC patients, assessed from August 2001 to March 2015. Cases were defined as lymphatic metastasis and non-lymphatic metastasis according to AJCC TNM stages; for each case, two age-matched control without lymphatic and distant metastasis was randomly selected from the study participants. Demographic, variables about metastasis and MACC1 expression were collected. In multivariate analysis, the OR (95% CI) of MACC1 expression was 1.5 (1.1 to 2.0) in patients with lymphatic metastasis versus non-lymphatic metastasis after adjusting all variables. After adjustment for all variables and age stratification, MACC1 expression was found to be an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis in the middle-aged group (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.1–4.0). A nonlinear relationship between MACC1 expression and 64–75 age group was observed. The probability of metastasis slightly increased with the MACC1 level lower than turning point 1.4. At the same time, the probability of lymphatic metastasis was obviously increased even after adjusting all variables when MACC1 level higher than 1.4 (OR 11.2, 95% CI 1.5–81.5; p = 0.017) in the middle age group. The expression of MACC1 was not associated with lymphatic metastasis in populations younger than 64 or older than 75. The results demonstrates that increased MACC1 level in 64–75 age group might be associated with lymphatic metastasis in CRC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3188465782,"Proteins containing breast cancer type 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal domains play crucial roles in response to and repair of DNA damage. Epithelial cell transforming factor (epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 [ECT2]) is a member of the BRCA1 C-terminal protein family, but it is not known if ECT2 directly contributes to DNA repair. In this study, we report that ECT2 is recruited to DNA lesions in a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-dependent manner. Using co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that ECT2 physically associates with KU70-KU80 and BRCA1, proteins involved in nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination, respectively. ECT2 deficiency impairs the recruitment of KU70 and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites, resulting in defective DNA double-strand break repair, an accumulation of damaged DNA, and hypersensitivity of cells to genotoxic insults. Interestingly, we demonstrated that ECT2 promotes DNA repair and genome integrity largely independently of its canonical guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Together, these results suggest that ECT2 is directly involved in DNA double-strand break repair and is an important genome caretaker."
https://openalex.org/W3188483763,"Background The current antiviral treatments available for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection decrease the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hence, patients with HCV infection who have not received antiviral treatment and have developed HCC may be those who missed timely antiviral treatment for HCV. However, the proportion of patients who missed timely antiviral treatment and its implications are largely unexplored. Methods A nationwide retrospective cohort of 4,592 newly diagnosed HCV-related HCC patients (2013–2017) was identified from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Prior antiviral treatment for HCV was defined as a history of at least one HCV-specific antiviral treatment before HCC diagnosis. The outcome was all-cause mortality. Results Prior antiviral treatment for HCV was identified in 802 (17.4%) patients, and 16%, 16%, 17%, 19%, and 19% of patients received antiviral treatment in the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively ( P = 0.21). During 8,085 person-years of follow-up (median, 1.4; maximum, 5.3 years of follow-up), 1,970 patients died. Mortality rates were lower in patients with prior antiviral treatment (15 deaths/100 person-years) than in those without prior antiviral treatment (27 deaths/100 person-years). The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality on comparing patients who did and did not receive prior antiviral treatment was 0.68 (0.59, 0.79). Conclusion Timely antiviral treatment for HCV was suboptimal at the population level. Prior antiviral treatment for HCV reduced mortality rate in HCV-related HCC patients. Intensive HCV control strategies are needed to reduce the number of patients with HCV infection who miss timely HCV treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3189835716,"Purpose To investigate the impact of large choroidal vessels (LCV) on Choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficit (FD) analyses with swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) Design Prospective, cross-sectional study. Methods Macular 6x6mm SS-OCTA scans were obtained from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) and healthy eyes. Images were captured and processed according to most common standards and analyzed for percentage of flow-deficits (FD%) within four 1x1mm squares at the corners of each image. Choroidal thickness (CT), iris color and refraction error were considered as potential influential factors for LCV visibility. A linear mixed model and logistic regression models were calculated for statistical evaluation. Results Sixty-nine iAMD and 49 age-matched healthy eyes were enrolled. LCV were visible in at least one sector in 52% of iAMD and 47% of healthy eyes. Within the iAMD group FD% were significantly lower in areas containing LCV (p = 0.0029). Increasing CT resulted in an odds ratio decrease of LCV (OR: 0.94, p&lt;0.0001). Below a CT value of ≤118μm LCV could be expected with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 85%. Conclusions LCV can significantly affect CC FD analyses of SS-OCTA images. Their visibility is negatively associated with CT. The impact of LCV should be taken into account when performing CC FD assessments, especially in patients where reduced CT is to be expected and inclusion of affected areas should be considered carefully."
https://openalex.org/W3190500050,"Computational pan-genomics utilizes information from multiple individual genomes in large-scale comparative analysis. Genetic variation between case-controls, ethnic groups, or species can be discovered thoroughly using pan-genomes of such subpopulations. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data volumes are growing rapidly, making genomic data compression and indexing methods very important. Despite current space-efficient repetitive sequence compression and indexing methods, the deployed compression methods are often sequential, computationally time-consuming, and do not provide efficient sequence alignment performance on vast collections of genomes such as pan-genomes. For performing rapid analytics with the ever-growing genomics data, data compression and indexing methods have to exploit distributed and parallel computing more efficiently. Instead of strict genome data compression methods, we will focus on the efficient construction of a compressed index for pan-genomes. Compressed hybrid-index enables fast sequence alignments to several genomes at once while shrinking the index size significantly compared to traditional indexes. We propose a scalable distributed compressed hybrid-indexing method for large genomic data sets enabling pan-genome-based sequence search and read alignment capabilities. We show the scalability of our tool, DHPGIndex, by executing experiments in a distributed Apache Spark-based computing cluster comprising 448 cores distributed over 26 nodes. The experiments have been performed both with human and bacterial genomes. DHPGIndex built a BLAST index for n = 250 human pan-genome with an 870:1 compression ratio (CR) in 342 minutes and a Bowtie2 index with 157:1 CR in 397 minutes. For n = 1,000 human pan-genome, the BLAST index was built in 1520 minutes with 532:1 CR and the Bowtie2 index in 1938 minutes with 76:1 CR. Bowtie2 aligned 14.6 GB of paired-end reads to the compressed (n = 1,000) index in 31.7 minutes on a single node. Compressing n = 13,375,031 (488 GB) GenBank database to BLAST index resulted in CR of 62:1 in 575 minutes. BLASTing 189,864 Crispr-Cas9 gRNA target sequences (23 MB in total) to the compressed index of human pan-genome (n = 1,000) finished in 45 minutes on a single node. 30 MB mixed bacterial sequences were (n = 599) were blasted to the compressed index of 488 GB GenBank database (n = 13,375,031) in 26 minutes on 25 nodes. 78 MB mixed sequences (n = 4,167) were blasted to the compressed index of 18 GB E. coli sequence database (n = 745,409) in 5.4 minutes on a single node."
https://openalex.org/W3189572745,"Thermal variables are crucial drivers of biological processes in lakes and ponds. In the current context of climate change, determining which factors better constrain their variation within lake districts become of paramount importance for understanding species distribution and their conservation. In this study, we describe the regional and short-term interannual variability in surface water temperature of high mountain lakes and ponds of the Pyrenees. And, we use mixed regression models to identify key environmental factors and to infer mean and maximum summer temperature, accumulated degree-days, diel temperature ranges and three-days’ oscillation. The study is based on 59 lake-temperature series measured from 2001 to 2014. We found that altitude was the primary explicative factor for accumulated degree-days and mean and maximum temperature. In contrast, lake area showed the most relevant effect on the diel temperature range and temperature oscillations, although diel temperature range was also found to decline with altitude. Furthermore, the morphology of the catchment significantly affected accumulated degree-days and maximum and mean water temperatures. The statistical models developed here were applied to upscale spatially the current thermic conditions across the whole set of lakes and ponds of the Pyrenees."
