https://openalex.org/W2035250926,"The subventricular zone of the postnatal forebrain produces mainly glia, although it supports limited neurogenesis. To determine whether the subventricular zone is positionally specified, the phenotype and destination of the progeny of subventricular zone cells along the anterior-posterior axis of the lateral ventricles were analyzed. A retroviral lineage tracer containing the E. coli reporter gene lacZ was injected into different parts of the subventricular zone of neonatal rat pups, and at various times thereafter, the expression of beta-galactosidase was detected histochemically or immunohistochemically in the descendants of infected cells. A discrete region of the anterior part of the subventricular zone (SVZa) generated an immense number of neurons that differentiated into granule cells and periglomerular cells of the olfactory bulb-the two major types of interneurons. Thus, the SVZa appears to constitute a specialized source of neuronal progenitor cells. To reach the olfactory bulb, neurons arising in the SVZa migrate several millimeters along a highly restricted route. Guidance cues must be involved to prohibit widespread dispersion of these migrating neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2005913521,"Receptors for the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate include metabotropic (G protein-coupled) and ionotropic (glutamate-gated ion channel) types. These receptors have large, presumably extracellular, amino-terminal domains. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques indicate that the metabotropic receptor extracellular domain is similar to bacterial periplasmic amino acid binding proteins. A structural model built using the observed similarity predicts a ligand-binding site, and mutants with conservative amino acid substitutions at this site are shown to have reduced ligand affinity. The metabotropic receptor extracellular domain is a member of a family of structural domains linked to a variety of receptor types, including ionotropic glutamate receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1569412890,"This study addresses the basis for regional microvascular susceptibility to bacterial toxins implicated in hemolytic uremic syndrome. The results indicate a relationship between the degree of Shiga toxin sensitivity of human endothelial cells from different sources and the amount of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) glycosphingolipid receptor for Shiga toxin expressed by these cells. Cell viability and protein synthesis of renal endothelial cells were reduced to 50% by 1 pM Shiga toxin, while umbilical vein cells were not affected by > 1 nM toxin. Similarly, basal levels of Gb3 were approximately 50 times higher in renal endothelial cells than in the umbilical endothelial cells. Pre-exposure of umbilical endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha or bacterial lipopolysaccharide increased Gb3 content 4-6-fold coincident with increases in sensitivity to cytotoxic and protein synthesis inhibitory effects of Shiga toxin. Lipopolysaccharide induction of both Gb3 and sensitivity to Shiga toxin cytotoxic action in umbilical endothelial cells was dependent on the structure of lipopolysaccharide. Neither tumor necrosis factor-alpha nor lipopolysaccharide altered the Shiga toxin sensitivity or the Gb3 content of renal endothelial cells. These data indicate that differential endothelial expression of glycolipid receptors for Shiga toxins may be responsible for localized involvement of the kidney in hemolytic uremic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1600880529,"GRO alpha, a protein structurally related to interleukin-8 (IL-8) and originally described as a melanoma growth stimulatory factor, possesses potent neutrophil-stimulating activity. Recently, two closely related genes, gro beta and gro gamma, were identified. In the present work, the three GRO proteins were chemically synthesized, and their biological activities on human neutrophils and other leukocytes were compared. GRO alpha, GRO beta, and GRO gamma, like IL-8, induced chemotaxis, shape change, a rise in intracellular free calcium levels, exocytosis, and the respiratory burst in neutrophils. The GRO proteins were also active toward basophils as shown by chemotaxis and intracellular calcium concentration changes. The order of potency in neutrophils and basophils was IL-8 > GRO alpha > or = GRO gamma > GRO beta. Of the two IL-8 receptors expressed on human neutrophils, one binds GRO alpha with high and the other with low affinity. Competition binding experiments using radiolabeled IL-8 and GRO alpha revealed the same characteristics for GRO beta and GRO gamma. Similarly, cross-desensitization, as assessed by the stimulus-dependent changes in intracellular calcium concentration, indicated that all three GRO proteins interact with common receptors. From these results, it can be concluded that GRO alpha, GRO beta, and GRO gamma have the same pattern of activity toward human granulocytes and that the differences in amino acid sequence among these proteins have only minor effects on biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W81970610,"Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) accumulation in activated human neutrophils is increased as much as 10-fold above the mM concentrations present in normal neutrophils. Internal concentrations as high as 14 mM are achieved when external vitamin is at physiologic concentration. The mechanism is by oxidation of external vitamin to dehydroascorbic acid, preferential transmembrane translocation of dehydroascorbic acid, and intracellular reduction to ascorbic acid within minutes. These data indicate that vitamin C accumulation is enhanced in activated human neutrophils and that human neutrophils utilize and recycle oxidized external vitamin C under physiologic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1976455693,"An understanding of K+ channel structure is a critical step in developing an appreciation of the function and regulation of these proteins. We have begun a biochemical analysis of the early steps in K+ channel formation following translation into endoplasmic reticulum membranes. In our experiments, a series of K+ channel subunit protein deletions were constructed and then tested for posttranslational processing and assembly. We find that all deletions containing the S1 domain are inserted into the membrane. The loop between S1 and S2 is glycosylated; thus, this segment is topologically extracellular. Translated subunit proteins mix in the membrane, then assemble into tetramers. This subunit assembly is critically driven by a conserved, self-tetramerizing sequence in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region, which we have named the tetramerization 1 domain."
https://openalex.org/W1644456199,"Follistatin (FS), an activin-binding protein, is a monomer derived from two polypeptide core sequences of 315 (FS-315) and 288 (FS-288) amino acids originated from alternatively spliced mRNA. To define the structural heterogeneity of native FS, we purified six molecular forms of FS from porcine ovaries. Protein chemical analysis revealed that the structural differences among the six isoforms were caused by truncation of the carboxyl-terminal region and/or the presence of carbohydrate chains, resulting in the formation of FS-315, FS-288, and FS composed of 303 amino acids (FS-303) in various forms of glycosylation on the two potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites. The majority of FS isolated from porcine ovaries was FS-303, which may have been derived from FS-315 by proteolytic cleavage of the 12 COOH-terminal amino acids. All six molecular species have almost the same activin binding activity (Kd = 540-680 pM). By contrast, the COOH-terminal truncated form, FS-288, showed much higher affinity for the rat granulosa cell surface than FS-303, whereas FS-315 had no affinity. FS-288 bound to heparan sulfate-Sepharose CL-4B, but FS-315 did not, suggesting that the truncated forms of FS bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell. COS cells transfected with the FS-288 DNA expressed the FS-288 protein, which adhered to the cell surface, but cells transfected with the FS-315 DNA secreted the expressed protein into the medium, which did not bind to the cell surface. In rat anterior pituitary culture, FS-288 (ED50 = 2 ng/ml) was more potent in suppressing follicle-stimulating hormone release than FS-303 (ED50 = 10 ng/ml) and FS-315 (ED50 = 20 ng/ml). These results suggest that cell-associated FS traps activin more tightly in the matrix, thereby more effectively blocking the activity of activin on heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the cell surface and that cell-associated FS plays an important role in controlling the various actions of activin in a paracrine or autocrine manner."
https://openalex.org/W1604834760,"A cDNA has been isolated from human hippocampus that appears to encode a novel Na(+)-dependent, Cl(-)-independent, neutral amino acid transporter. The putative protein, designated SATT, is 529 amino acids long and exhibits significant amino acid sequence identity (39-44%) with mammalian L-glutamate transporters. Expression of SATT cDNA in HeLa cells induced stereospecific uptake of L-serine, L-alanine, and L-threonine that was not inhibited by excess (3 mM) 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid, a specific substrate for the System A amino acid transporter. SATT expression in HeLa cells did not induce the transport of radiolabeled L-cysteine, L-glutamate, or related dicarboxylates. Northern blot hybridization revealed high levels of SATT mRNA in human skeletal muscle, pancreas, and brain, intermediate levels in heart, and low levels in liver, placenta, lung, and kidney. SATT transport characteristics are similar to the Na(+)-dependent neutral amino acid transport activity designated System ASC, but important differences are noted. These include: 1) SATT's apparent low expression in ASC-containing tissues such as liver or placenta; 2) the lack of mutual inhibition between serine and cysteine; and 3) the lack of trans-stimulation. SATT may represent one of multiple activities that exhibit System ASC-like transport characteristics in diverse tissues and cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1555987236,"Antitrypsin Siiyama is a rare example of the deficiency variants of antitrypsin that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocyte. The common example is Z antitrypsin, which has a mutation (Glu342-->Lys) at the junction of the head of the fifth strand of the A sheet and the base of the reactive center loop. It was previously shown that Z antitrypsin spontaneously polymerizes due to the insertion of the reactive center loop of one molecule into the A sheet of a second. The mutation in antitrypsin Siiyama (Ser53-->Phe) affects a residue that provides a ridge for the sliding movement that opens the A sheet, and it had been predicted that this would result in the same type of loop-sheet polymerization observed with the Z variant. We confirm this here and show that virtually all the plasma antitrypsin in a homozygote for the Siiyama variant was polymerized due to non-covalent bonding with a loss of accessibility of the reactive center loop. The common basis of the polymerization of Z and Siiyama antitrypsin is supported by identical findings on electron microscopy. Taken together these results confirm that loop-sheet polymerization is a general mechanism and as such is likely to be responsible for the intracellular inclusions associated with liver pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1516505350,"Mechanisms for increased levels of quinolinic acid (QUIN) following systemic immune stimulation were investigated. In gerbils, systemic administration of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) increased plasma and cerebrospinal fluid QUIN levels, while plasma kynurenic acid levels were decreased and cerebrospinal fluid kynurenic acid levels were unchanged. PWM also increased the QUIN concentrations of brain and systemic tissues. In slices of spleen, lung, liver, duodenum, and kidney, PWM caused marked increases in [13C6]QUIN formation from L-[13C6]tryptophan (but not from [13C6]anthranilic acid). PWM also increased QUIN excretion in the urine and enhanced the formation and excretion of [13C6]QUIN following an intraperitoneal injection of L-[13C6]tryptophan. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity was increased in the brain, kidney, lung, spleen, and duodenum while hepatic L-tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity was reduced, data consistent with in vitro L-kynurenine formation from L-tryptophan. Kynurenine-3-hydroxylase activity was increased in the duodenum, lung, and spleen, but not in the brain, kidney, or liver. Kynureninase activity was increased in the brain, lung, and duodenum, but not in the spleen, kidney, or liver. 3-Hydroxyanthranilate-3,4-dioxygenase activity was unchanged in the brain, lung, and liver. No change in kynurenine aminotransferase activity was observed in the brain or lung, while liver kynurenine aminotransferase activity was reduced. We conclude that increased activities of kynurenine pathway enzymes in various tissues following systemic immune stimulation, in conjunction with macrophage infiltration of the affected tissue, provide a mechanism to account for increased concentrations of QUIN."
https://openalex.org/W1592626944,"Retinal arrestin (S-antigen) inactivates the phototransduction cascade by binding to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin and thereby arresting coupling to the G protein transducin. beta-Arrestin (beta arr), a ubiquitous arrestin homolog, acts analogously to desensitize the beta 2-adrenergic receptor by disrupting Gs receptor interaction. In an attempt to identify additional arrestins which might regulate the multitude of G protein-coupled receptors, we have isolated two bovine brain cDNAs which encode polypeptide variants of an arrestin homolog which we have designated arrestin3 (arr3). The open reading frames of these two cDNAs are identical except that the long form, arr3L, contains an 11-amino-acid insert between residues 361 and 362. Arr3 is more closely related to bovine beta arr (78% identity) than to bovine visual arrestin (56% identity). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA and immunoblotting of lysates with an arr3-specific antibody suggest that the short form, arr3S, is the major form of arr3 in all bovine tissues and that it is most abundant in the spleen. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction amplification of beta arr mRNA indicates that in several tissues (lung, liver, spleen, and pituitary), the major form of beta arr lacks 8 amino acids which are present in brain beta arr. Immunoblotting with an antibody which recognizes beta arr and arr3 with equal sensitivity demonstrates that beta arr (either the long or the short polypeptide) is the major arrestin in all (non-photoreceptor bearing) tissues examined. These observations suggest that in some tissues, as many as four arrestin homolog variants may play a role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1490575297,"The extracellular production of singlet oxygen (O2(1 delta g)) by stimulated macrophages was measured using a modification of our quantitative method initially developed to measure the intracellular production of O2(1 delta g) by neutrophils (Steinbeck, M. J., Khan, A. U., and Karnovsky, M. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13425-13433). Glass coverslips were coated with the specific chemical trap for O2(1 delta g), 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) and perylene, which is an internal standard, in a methylene chloride solution containing 0.3 mg/ml polystyrene. On evaporation, the polystyrene formed an even coating of DPA and perylene over the surface of a glass coverslip (PDP film). Unstimulated macrophages or macrophages stimulated with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) were then added to the PDP film in a darkened room and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Both unstimulated and stimulated cells adhered to the PDP film in approximately equivalent numbers. Only stimulated cells produced measurable amounts of O2(1 delta g) in a dose-dependent response to either PMA or fMLP. The production of O2(1 delta g) by macrophages stimulated with PMA was maximal in response to 25 ng, 17.8 +/- 1.3 nmol of O2(1 delta g)/approximately 1.00 x 10(6) cells. The maximal response for fMLP was at a concentration of 1 microM, 18.4 +/- 1.0 nmol of O2(1 delta g)/approximately 1.00 x 10(6) cells. The specific detection of O2(1 delta g) by this method was confirmed by thermally releasing O2(1 delta g) from the DPA-O2(1 delta g) reaction product, DPA-endoperoxide, regenerating the original DPA compound. Production of O2(1 delta g) by the stimulated cells was inhibited 80-89% by the addition of 60-120 micrograms of superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and ground state molecular oxygen or 79-84% with the addition of 2 mM histidine, an avid quencher of O2(1 delta g). Neither of these additions interfered with adhesion of the cells to the PDP film. The ability of superoxide dismutase to inhibit the production of O2(1 delta g) suggested that O2(1 delta g) was produced via a superoxide-dependent route. The ability of an oxidase to produce O2(1 delta g) secondary to superoxide production was substantiated further using a xanthine oxidase-acetaldehyde system. Purified xanthine oxidase produced both superoxide and O2(1 delta g), and their production was inhibited by the addition of superoxide dismutase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2045426666,"We tested the hypothesis that action potentials originate in apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. Layer V somata were voltage clamped in thin slices of rat motor cortex. Fibers synapsing in unclamped regions far out on the apical dendrite caused small, slow synaptic currents, as recorded at the soma, and sometimes elicited complex, multicomponent current spikes, beginning with a small first spike. Hyperpolarization, or tetrodotoxin applied to basal dendrites and soma, blocked the later spike components without affecting the synaptic current and the first component, which was a synaptically triggered Na+ spike in the apical dendrite. Similar spikes followed voltage steps or direct stimulation. We conclude that Na+ action potentials are initiated in the apical dendrite in response to synaptic input."
https://openalex.org/W2059171611,"We have defined, in the neuroendocrine cell line PC12, the catecholamine- and acetylcholine-storing organelles in the context of the biogenesis of secretory granules and synaptic-like microvesicles (SLMVs). SLMVs were found to originate directly from early endosomes. Both early endosomes and SLMVs exhibited uptake and storage of biosynthetic acetylcholine. Surprisingly, however, despite the presence of a reserpine-sensitive vesicular amine transporter in early endosomes, SLMVs lacked detectable uptake and storage of catecholamines. This was confined to two populations of mature secretory granules, referred to as small and large mature secretory granules, which both derived from immature secretory granules. Our result show that PC12 cells lack small dense core vesicles, i.e., the catecholamine-storing, but secretory protein-lacking, vesicles found in sympathetic neurons and imply that the biogenesis of these vesicles requires the expression of a distinct type of vesicular amine transporter and/or a change in endosomal protein sorting."
https://openalex.org/W1582944414,"A cDNA clone for the complete coding sequence for alpha-1,3(6)-mannosylglycoprotein beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GlcNAc-T V, EC 2.4.1.155) was isolated and expressed in COS-7 cells. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction were synthesized based on the amino acid sequence of three tryptic peptides isolated from affinity-purified GlcNAc-T V. Polymerase chain reaction amplimers were isolated from rat and mouse mRNA. A cDNA-encoding full-length enzyme was isolated from a rat 1 cell (EJ-ras-transformed) library and sequenced. Transient expression of this clone in COS-7 cells, followed by enzymatic activity assays, demonstrated that this cDNA sequence encodes GlcNAc-T V. Northern analysis of rat kidney mRNA revealed a single band corresponding to a length of about 7 kilobases. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clone demonstrated an open reading frame that encoded a type II membrane protein of 740 amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1505625682,"The putative matrix metalloproteinase mouse stromelysin-3 was expressed from Escherichia coli and from a mouse myeloma cell line. In the former case a single major protein of 58-kDa was detectable by immunoblotting, but no proteolytic activity could be elicited by zymography or trypsin or organomercurial treatment as would be expected for a typical matrix metalloproteinase. In the latter case immunodetectable proteins of 55-58 and 27-28-kDa were produced. The effect of trypsin or organomercurial treatment of the 55-58-kDa forms was to generate a 51-kDa form and lower molecular mass fragments. Upon zymographic analysis only the 27-28-kDa forms showed caseinolytic activity. N-terminal sequencing and immunoblotting analysis with antibodies specific to distinct domains of stromelysin-3 indicated that the 27-28-Da stromelysin-3 forms had lost the predicted propeptide and the majority of the C-terminal domain. The purified 28-kDa form of stromelysin-3 could weakly degrade a number of extracellular matrix proteins and was inhibited by TIMP. However, the evidence that mature full-length stromelysin-3 is a metalloproteinase could not be substantiated and the precise role of this protein in vivo remains to be elucidated. By partial analogy with interstitial collagenase, one hypothesis is that stromelysin-3 with an intact C-terminal domain has specific properties for an as yet undefined substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1553079447,"Most macromolecules at the cell surface of parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania, including the major surface glycoproteins and a complex lipophosphoglycan (LPG), are attached to the plasma membrane via glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Free glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs) which are not linked to protein or phosphoglycan have also been found. In this study, we show that L. mexicana promastigotes synthesize two distinct GIPL lineages, comprising at least 10 glycolipid species. These structures were characterized using a combination of gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, methylation linkage analysis, and chemical and exoglycosidase sequencing. The major lineage contains GIPLs with the glycan structures Man alpha 1-3Man alpha 1-4GlcN (iM2), Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-4GlcN (iM3), and Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-4GlcN (iM4), which are linked to alkylacyl-PI containing predominantly C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids and C18:0 alkyl chains (referred to as the hybrid type GIPLs). A proportion of the iM3 and iM4 species (32 and 4%, respectively) are substituted with an ethanolamine-phosphate residue. The location of this residue on the core glucosamine residue was inferred from the results of methylation analyses and alpha-mannosidase digestion. The minor GIPL lineage contains GIPLs with the same glycan sequences as the glycolipid anchor of LPG (referred to as the type-2 GIPLs). The alkylacyl-PI or lyso-alkyl-PI lipid moieties of these GIPLs differ from those of the hybrid type GIPLs and from the main pool of alkylacyl-PI in containing significant levels of C24:0 and C26:0 alkyl chains. The most polar of these GIPLs, LPGp, has the properties expected of a biosynthetic precursor to the LPG, having the structure, [formula: see text] Finally, the GPI anchors of the major promastigote proteins were found to contain the glycan sequence Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcN, and an alkylacyl-PI lipid moiety which was highly enriched for C24:0 or C26:0 alkyl chains. These data suggest that L. mexicana promastigotes contain three distinct pathways of GPI biosynthesis. The possibility that the distinct alkyl chain compositions of the different GPI glycolipids reflects the subcellular compartmentalization of different GPI biosynthetic pathways is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1990041014,"The 43 kd postsynaptic protein (43K) plays a key role in the aggregation of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. By transiently coexpressing 43K and a single AChR subunit (α, β, γ, or δ) in the quail fibroblast cell line, QT-6, we show that 43K interacts with each subunit to form cell surface clusters in which 43K and receptor subunit are precisely colocalized. Although the level of cell surface expression of single subunits is much lower than that of fully assembled receptor, the clustering of both single subunits and fully assembled AChR occurs efficiently. In addition, 43K-induced clustering is specific for AChR subunits. From these results, we conclude that each pentameric AChR has five potential sites for interacting with 43K during cluster formation."
https://openalex.org/W1552410847,"The TATA-binding proteins (TBP) from both human and Drosophila have been shown to exist in various distinct multiprotein complexes that are required, respectively, for transcription by all three RNA polymerases. In contrast, in vitro biochemical analyses have suggested that yeast TBP exists as a monomeric 27-kDa protein free in solution. We have examined the oligomerization state of yeast TBP and report here that yeast TBP, like human and Drosophila TBPs, is also stably associated with other proteins in vitro. Using anti-TBP antibodies we have immunopurified yeast TBP and associated factors (TBP-associated factors or TAFs). When this fraction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polypeptides of approximate relative molecular size ranging from 170 to 60 kDa are prominently represented. Immunoblot analysis revealed that one of these TAFs, TAF70, corresponds to BRF1/TDS4/PCF4, a subunit of transcription factor (TF) IIIB. Furthermore, this highly purified TAF fraction can reconstitute polymerase III transcription when supplemented with purified RNA polymerase III and TFIIIC. Our data indicate that our TAF fraction contains TFIIIB transcription factor activity and that all the subunits of yeast TFIIIB are stably complexed with TBP."
https://openalex.org/W1612075644,"Human cytosolic thymidine kinase, subunit molecular mass about 24 kDa, is a tetramer in the presence of ATP but a dimer in the presence of thymidine or without substrates. The pure, substrate-free enzyme showed complex, non-hyperbolic thymidine substrate kinetics with an apparent Km of 15 microM. Incubation with ATP at 4 degrees C induced a time-dependent transition to an enzyme form with hyperbolic kinetics and a 20-fold lower Km value for thymidine (0.7 microM) but the same maximal velocity as for cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1) without ATP. Removal of the ATP by carboxymethyl chromatography reestablished the non-hyperbolic kinetics with the low affinity for thymidine (Km(app) = 12 microM), and this enzyme form could be reversed once more by ATP incubation to the high affinity enzyme form. Similar shifts could not be induced by thymidine. The activating effect of ATP depended on the concentration of enzyme protein in a linear manner. These results indicate that ATP is a positive effector of cytosolic thymidine kinase, controlling a kinetically slow transition between two molecular forms of the enzyme. A hypothetical reaction mechanism is presented to explain the complex kinetic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1825036608,"Recent analyses of the assembly of thin filaments containing altered forms of troponin (or no troponin) suggested that the strongly cooperative nature of troponin-tropomyosin binding to actin might be primarily caused by indirect interactions involving the actin lattice, rather than by direct contacts between neighboring troponin-tropomyosin molecules. To test this hypothesis, thin filament assembly was examined using either cardiac tropomyosin digested with carboxypeptidase A (cbpTm) or a tropomyosin with defective function at both amino and carboxyl termini (unacetylated cbpTm). Compared to intact troponin-tropomyosin, both troponin-cbpTm and troponin-unacetylated cbpTm had much weaker binding to actin; however, cooperative interactions were only slightly reduced. These data support the implication that the primary source of the cooperativity involves troponin-tropomyosin-promoted conformational changes within the actin polymer. Surprisingly, the effects of tropomyosin amino- and carboxyl-terminal structural defects on troponin-tropomyosin binding to actin were not additive. In the presence of troponin, tropomyosin molecules with either defect had the same diminution in actin affinity as molecules with both defects. Finally, the Ca2+ sensitivity of troponin-tropomyosin binding to actin was increased by alteration of either end of tropomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W2069439268,"Color vision is dependent upon the expression of spectrally distinct forms of rhodopsin in different photoreceptor cells. To identify the structural features of rhodopsin that regulate spectral sensitivity and absorption in vivo, we have constructed a series of chimeric Drosophila rhodopsin molecules, derived from a blue- and a violet-sensitive rhodopsin, and used P element-mediated germline transformation to generate transgenic flies that express the modified pigments in the R1-R6 photoreceptor cells of the compound eye. Our analysis of these animals indicates that multiple regions of the opsin protein are involved in regulating rhodopsin spectral sensitivity and that the native and photoactivated forms of rhodopsin can be tuned independently of each other. These results demonstrate the feasibility of designing receptor molecules with specifically modified activated states."
https://openalex.org/W1508821840,"Collagenase dispersed rat liver hepatocytes release Mg2+ when stimulated with norepinephrine or accumulate Mg2+ when stimulated with vasopressin, respectively. Mg2+ fluxes in either direction account for a net loss or gain of approximately 10% of total cell magnesium and are rapidly reversible. Both stimulated Mg2+ efflux and Mg2+ influx require physiological concentration of extracellular NaCl and Ca2+. In the absence of extracellular Na+, Mg2+ efflux, but not influx, can be observed in the presence of extracellular Cl-. Under these conditions, the efflux is inhibited by the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger inhibitor 4,4‘-dinitrostilbene-2,2‘-disulfonic acid. In hepatocytes, Mg2+ influx, but not efflux, is completely inhibited by thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase. Several lines of evidence, such as measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ or of cytosolic Ca2+ buffering, indicate that the effect of thapsigargin in inhibiting Mg2+ influx could not be explained by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Instead, the inhibition of hepatocyte Mg2+ influx was found to be the result of the depletion of the Ca2+ stored within the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2162855810,"M-current is widespread in the nervous system. It stabilizes cell excitability, and its suppression by muscarinic receptor activation underlies slow synaptic transmission in sympathetic neurons. Suppression of M-current was one of the first examples of neuromodulation of a potassium current, but the mechanism is not understood. Single-channel recording was used to study this issue. An M-channel with two conductance states, which exhibited appropriate voltage-dependent kinetics with two modes of gating, has been resolved. Mode 1 comprises short open time, low open probability events, and mode 2 openings represent long open time, high open probability behavior. Muscarine decreased M-channel activity by selectively reducing mode 2 M-channel gating through a diffusible second messenger. It is suggested that control of modal gating may be a widespread mechanism for neuromodulation."
https://openalex.org/W1973590474,"We investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating exocytosis in patch-clamped melanotrophs by measuring the membrane capacitance. Ca2+-dependent exocytosis could be induced by membrane depolarization or by including solutions containing 2 μM free Ca2+ in the patch pipette. Caz+-dependent exocytosis was inhibited by GDPβS, suggesting involvement of a GTP-binding protein. The hydrolysis-resistant GTP analogs, GTPγS and GppNHp, were able to stimulate exocytosis at low free Ca2+ concentrations. The stimulatory response to GTPγS was abolished by both GDPβS and GTP. The latter suggests that a sustained activation of a GTP-binding protein is necessary for exocytosis. This behavior is similar to the stimulation of exocytosis by guanine nucleotides in mast cells and other nonexcitable cells and suggests a common regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1573428956,"The outer membrane protein FadL (product of the fadL gene) of Escherichia coli is required for the specific binding and transport of exogenous long-chain fatty acids prior to metabolic utilization. The carboxyl end of FadL has been proposed to play a crucial role by facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids. In an attempt to define specific amino acid residues within carboxyl region of FadL essential for activity, a series of deletion and point mutations within the 3' end of the fadL+ gene have been constructed and characterized. These fadL mutants were classified into three categories based on functional properties attributable to the altered FadL proteins: (i) those that had essentially wild-type levels of long-chain fatty acid binding and transport, (ii) those that had wild-type levels of long-chain fatty acid binding but were defective in transport, and (iii) those that were defective for both long-chain fatty acid binding and transport. These findings demonstrate that amino acid residues Phe448, Pro428, Val410, and Ser397 are required for optimal levels of long-chain fatty acid transport and that amino acid residues Pro428 and Val410 are essential for long-chain fatty acid binding."
https://openalex.org/W1491281884,"Abstract A cDNA library was constructed from the venom glands of the Brazilian armed spider, Phoneutria nigriventer, and a clone coding for Tx1, a lethal toxin, was identified and sequenced. The sequence data derived from this cDNA clone combined with the previously determined amino acid sequence predict that Tx1 is initially synthesized as a preprotoxin. Four segments (comprising the signal sequence, a short, 15-amino acid, glutamate-rich sequence, the functional toxin, and 2 glycine residues) can be distinguished. The structure of the preprotoxin and the proposed processing steps required to form the mature Tx1 toxin show similarities with the synthesis and processing of omega-agatoxin IA."
https://openalex.org/W1680087199,"Vaults are large cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles found in nearly all eukaryotic cells. Dictyostelium vaults contain two major proteins, MVP alpha (94.2 kDa) and MVP beta (approximately 92 kDa). Using an anti-rat vault antibody, we screened a Dictyostelium cDNA expression library and isolated a 2.8-kilobase pair clone that contained a single full-length reading frame. The identity of the clone was established by the presence of a predicted 20-amino acid sequence identical to that found in a peptide sequenced from purified MVP alpha. We have disrupted the single copy gene using homologous recombination and have demonstrated a loss of MVP alpha. Although the cells still produce MVP beta, they do not contain characteristic vault particles, suggesting that MVP alpha is required for normal vault structure. These cells should be a valuable tool for elucidating the function of vaults."

Miyazawa, T., and Yokoyama, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3268-3277). Upon chemical modification of the 3 Cys residues of T. thermophilus MetRS with sodium p-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulfonate, one Zn2+ ion was released from one subunit of the molecule, as monitored with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys and His residues in the Zn(2+)-binding sequence reduced the aminoacylation activity; the kcat value was markedly decreased, and the Km values for L-methionine and tRNAf(Met) were increased. Similarly, Cys modification released two Zn2+ ions from T. thermophilus and Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases and E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase, which have Zn(2+)-binding motifs, and impaired their activities. By contrast, three other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that lack Zn(2+)-binding motif neither released Zn2+ ion nor lost their activities upon Cys modification. These results indicate that the Zn(2+)-binding sequences are important for catalysis and recognition in the aminoacylation reactions of a subgroup of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases."

https://openalex.org/W1607356500,"Respiration in mitochondria and photosynthesis in chloroplasts varied with the osmotic stretch of the membrane such that these processes were uniformly inhibited at higher osmolalities. A systematic evaluation of segmental electron transport in these intact particles showed that no individual complex exhibited osmotic sensitivity, whereas osmotic sensitivity appeared wherever the assay involved crossing over the corresponding quinone in the electron transport chain. The evidence was consistent with the rate-limiting step in electron transport being the availability of voids for quinone migration rather than any of the components of electron transport chain per se. Evidence based on quinone reconstitution in mitochondria depleted of quinone by acetone treatment clearly distinguished the kinetic control in the hypotonic domain and diffusive control via availability of voids in the hypertonic domain. Influence as well as the presence of voids was further confirmed in quinone-depleted mitochondria reconstituted with quinone as well as cholesterol. Decrease in lateral diffusion of the fluorescent probe, 12-(9-anthroyl)stearic acid, on osmotic compression of the bilayer is consistent with a change in void size distribution on osmotic compression of the bilayer. A direct correlation between succinate cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity and diffusivity of fluorescent probe 12-(9-anthroyl)stearic acid confirmed the availability of voids as the rate-limiting step in electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W1672796625,"Protoporphyrin-protoheme hybrid hemoglobins (Hb), in which the protohemes (Fe) in either the alpha- or beta-subunits were substituted with protoporphyrins IX (PP) alpha(PP)2 beta(Fe)2 and alpha(Fe)2 beta(PP)2 have been prepared. The structural and functional properties of these hybrid Hbs were investigated by measuring oxygen equilibrium curves and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The equilibrium constants of the first ligand, K1, observed for alpha(PP)2 beta(Fe)2 were much smaller than K1 values of HbA. The effects of pH and inositol hexaphosphate on K1 were substantially diminished. On the other hand, K1 values of alpha(Fe)2 beta(PP)2 were similar to those of HbA, including the pH and inositol hexaphosphate effects. The deoxy forms of alpha(PP)2 beta(Fe)2 and alpha(Fe)2 beta(PP)2 showed exchangeable proton resonances at 11 and 14 parts/million arising from the hydrogen bonds at the alpha 1 beta 2 contact in a deoxy-like structure. In the liganded form, these signals were dependent upon solution conditions. As K1 became larger, the reduction in the intensity of these signals was observed for both liganded forms. The resonance position of E11 Val originating from the beta subunits of alpha(PP)2 beta(Fe-CO)2 also varied in accordance with K1. We compare properties of PP-Fe hybrids with those of Co-Fe and Ni-Fe hybrids and conclude that the first oxygen binding to the beta heme may be linked to the metal-proximal His interaction in the alpha subunits. However, the first oxygen binding to the alpha heme is linked minimally to the metal-proximal His interaction in the beta subunits but may be correlated instead to the position of E11 Val relative to the porphyrin plane in the beta subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1802484108,"A stable, non-peptide inhibitor of the protease from type 1 human immunodeficiency virus has been developed, and the stereochemistry of binding defined through crystallographic three-dimensional structure determination. The initial compound, haloperidol, was discovered through computational screening of the Cambridge Structural Database using a shape complementarity algorithm. The subsequent modification is a non-peptidic lateral lead, which belongs to a family of compounds with well characterized pharmacological properties. This thioketal derivative of haloperidol and a halide counterion are bound within the enzyme active site in a mode distinct from the observed for peptide-based inhibitors. A variant of the protease cocrystallized with this inhibitor shows binding in the manner predicted during the initial computer-based search. The structures provide the context for subsequent synthetic modifications of the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1541903924,"Location of the type V collagen-binding domain within bovine thrombospondin (TSP) was investigated by using fragments of reduced and alkylated TSP. A fragment of relative molecular mass (19 kDa) was isolated, which inhibited binding of 125I-TSP to type V collagen in a solid-phase binding assay. A direct binding assay using the 125I-labeled fragment confirmed that the fragment actually bound to collagen. The fragment retained specificity for the native structure of type V collagen like the intact TSP molecule. Its binding to the collagen, however, was not inhibited by Ca2+ in contrast to intact TSP. Amino acid sequence analysis of the 19-kDa fragment suggested that this fragment corresponded to Val333-Lys412, a part of the stalklike region in the human TSP primary structure. It was found that the fragment also bound well to heparin in a specific and saturable manner and, furthermore, binding to type V collagen was inhibited by soluble heparin. Removal of the N-linked sugar chain from this fragment resulted in a 14-kDa fragment. The deglycosylated fragment retained the ability to bind to type V collagen as well as heparin. These results suggest that a type V collagen-binding site is present in the 80-residue portion of bovine TSP (Val333-Lys412) and is likely to be identical or lie very close to a heparin-binding site, which exists in the type I repeat structure."
https://openalex.org/W1607389505,"The availability of soluble forms of T-cell antigen receptors (sTCR) should be of great use in the detailed characterization of their interactions with ligands, for the generation of anti-TCR monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and for the eventual determination of their three-dimensional structures by x-ray crystallography. Here, we show that efficient secretion of nonchimeric disulfide-linked human gamma delta TCR could be achieved by simply introducing translational termination codons upstream from the sequences encoding TCR chain transmembrane regions. This recombinant protein appeared to be correctly folded, as judged by its reactivity with a panel of anti-gamma and anti-delta mAbs, and proved to be a powerful immunogen, allowing generation of mAb that are able to recognize both soluble- and membrane-bound gamma delta TCR. While variable and constant domains of gamma delta sTCR seem to be folded into compact conformations, the extreme sensitivity of its interchain disulfide bridge to digestion with papain suggests that sTCR C-terminal portions are in a more extended configuration than the corresponding region in immunoglobulins. Finally, the gamma delta heterodimer remains stable even after removal of the interchain disulfide link, suggesting the existence of strong noncovalent forces holding the two chains together."
https://openalex.org/W1665210332,"The hepatocyte has an organic anion transport system that recognizes compounds such as bilirubin and sulfobromophthalein. These anions circulate bound tightly to albumin from which they are extracted rapidly by hepatocytes by an electroneutral process that requires extracellular inorganic anions such as Cl- for activity. Transport activity is reduced by depletion of intracellular ATP, but whether ATP interacts directly with this transporter is not known. In this study, the influence of extracellular ATP on the hepatocyte organic anion transport mechanism has been characterized. In the presence of 2.5 mM Ca2+ and 2 mM Mg2+, initial uptake of [35S]sulfobromophthalein was reduced by 50% at 1 mM ATP. In the absence of divalent cations sensitivity to ATP was 10-fold greater. Other nucleotides including UTP, CTP, GTP, ADP, AMP, and AMP-PCP (adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate) were inactive. Decreased transport activity was rapidly reversible, was non-competitive with respect to ATP, did not require ATP hydrolysis, and did not correlate with P2y purinergic receptor activity. Differential activity of ATP on sulfobromophthalein transport in the presence and absence of divalent cations was not due to ecto-ATPase activity but rather to alteration in [ATP4-]. Although an ATP4- receptor in macrophages mediates increased cellular permeability, reduced organic anion permeability is seen in hepatocytes. This effect is not seen in the hepatoma cell line HepG2. Modulation of activity of the organic anion transporter by extracellular ATP may have important pathophysiological consequences in conditions resulting in liver cell injury."

https://openalex.org/W1516650118,"Recently, Bora et al. (Bora, P. S., Bora, N. S., Wu, X., and Lange, L. G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16774-16777) reported the cloning and expression of a human fatty acid ethyl ester synthase III (FAEES-III) cDNA that has only four amino acid substitutions compared with human glutathione S-transferase (GST) GSTP1-1, and, when expressed in MCF-7 cells, the protein has both FAEES and GST activities. By site-directed mutagenesis of a GSTP1 cDNA, we have constructed a clone that encodes the FAEES-III protein described by Bora et al. (1991). The recombinant FAEES-III protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and has been shown to be devoid of FAEES and GST activities. The recombinant FAEES-III protein does not bind to a glutathione agarose affinity matrix, presumably because two of the substituted amino acids, Trp-39-->Cys and Gln-52-->Glu, are thought to contribute to the GST glutathione binding site. One of the base substitutions in the FAEES-III cDNA encodes an extra SacI site not found in the GSTPI cDNA. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of human genomic DNA has identified the GSTPI gene, but no DNA from the proposed FAEES gene with a diagnostic SacI site has been detected. Evaluation of the hybridization pattern of HindIII genomic restriction fragments has identified fragments that contain the GSTPI gene and a pseudogene (Board et al. 1992), and there do not appear to be any hybridizing fragments that could contain the FAEES-III gene. Our results do not provide any evidence in support of a relationship between FAEES-III and GST, and the cDNA reported by Bora et al. (1991) may have resulted from a cloning artifact."
https://openalex.org/W1501329784,"The ability of halothane to stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) was examined in turkey erythrocyte membranes prepared from [3H]inositol-labeled turkey erythrocytes by measuring [3H]inositol phosphate formation ([3H]InsP) in the presence and absence of G-protein activation. In the presence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) (GTP gamma S), halothane (0.5-10 mM) caused a dose-dependent activation of PLC. The EC50 value for halothane-induced PLC activation was 2.8 +/- 0.3 mM. Halothane (0.1-30 mM) had no effect on PLC activity in the absence of G-protein activation and did not affect Ca(2+)-dependent PLC activity. The activation of PLC by GTP gamma S occurred after an initial lag period of 60 s which was followed by a linear increase in [3H]InsP. Halothane dose-dependently decreased the lag period for GTP gamma S-induced PLC activation (minimal value 15 s) and increased the rate of [3H]InsP formation at all time points following this lag. As a result, halothane shifted the EC50 value for GTP gamma S-induced PLC activation to the left (4-fold) and increased its maximal response. Halothane also caused a dose-dependent activation of PLC in the presence of AlF4-. Half-maximal stimulation of AlF4(-)-activated PLC occurred with an EC50 value of 2.9 +/- 0.4 mM halothane, which is similar to the halothane dose giving half-maximal stimulation of PLC in the presence of GTP gamma S. At low doses (0.1-0.3 mM) halothane inhibited both isoproterenol- and adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (ADP beta S)-induced [3H]InsP formation, whereas at higher concentrations it stimulated PLC independent of the presence of these agonists. At concentrations chosen to reflect their different membrane/buffer partition coefficients, both hexanol (5 mM) and benzyl alcohol (20 mM) fluidized turkey erythrocyte membranes to the same degree as halothane (5 mM). However, these agents had no effect on GTP gamma S- or AlF(4-)-induced PLC activity, indicating that halothane-induced PLC activation was not secondary to changes in bulk lipid fluidity properties. Halothane also stimulated [3H]inositol bisphosphate and [3H]inositol trisphosphate formation in intact erythrocytes. These data demonstrate that the anesthetic halothane can stimulate G-protein-dependent PLC activity and modify the responsiveness of this signaling system to activation by receptor-linked agonists."

https://openalex.org/W1482772262,"D-Aspartic acid was used as a specific substrate to evaluate the effects of dipolar amino acids on the high affinity anionic amino acid transport system X-AG in rabbit jejunal brush-border membrane vesicles. At pH 6, increasing L-phenylalanine concentrations caused a saturable activation of 0.05 mM D-aspartic acid uptake (Ka = 2.4 mM), and a saturating concentration of effector increased the Vmax of transport (2.6-fold) without any significant effect on the Km. At pH 8, however, a complex activation/inhibition curve was obtained with increasing L-phenylalanine concentrations, and a saturating concentration of effector increased both the Vmax (1.5-fold) and Km (2.1-fold) for transport. Increasing concentrations of L-valine, L-isoleucine, L-methionine, and L-threonine also showed complex activation/inhibition curves of D-aspartic acid uptake at both pH 6 and 8. The maximum level of activation, the plateau reached at saturating concentrations, and the concentration of effector producing either maximum activation or inhibition were, however, different at these two pH values. By using an optimum concentration of 10 mM L-valine at pH 6, the absence of trans-activation and of further activation by a cis-gradient of effector could be demonstrated. These results suggest that two allosteric sites directly accessible from the external medium are responsible for the heterotropic activation of intestinal system X-AG by dipolar amino acids and that, under physiological conditions, such effects might compensate for the lack of specificity of the neutral brush-border system."
https://openalex.org/W1480777598,"When the enzyme rhodanese was partially digested by immobilized trypsin, it retained greater than 50% of its original activity although less than 10% of the undigested enzyme remained. The predominant daughter species were two 31-kDa polypeptides whose amino termini corresponded to either residue 44 or 45 of the enzyme's sequence. Following digestion, charged species were isolated by ion exchange chromatography. Denaturing electrophoresis revealed that a 4-kDa peptide remained associated with the 31-kDa fragment. This 4-kDa peptide appears to correspond to the amino-terminal 45 residues of rhodanese. Further proteolysis gave a 2.5-kDa peptide that dissociated under non-denaturing conditions without apparent change in migration of the 31-kDa fragment on SDS gels. Refolding of undigested, urea-denatured rhodanese restored much of its activity. Similar treatment of rhodanese following limited tryptic digestion resulted in no regain of activity. Refolding of a mixture of intact and digested rhodanese resulted in regain of activity appropriate for the amount of intact rhodanese in the sample, indicating that clipped rhodanese does not inhibit refolding of intact rhodanese. It is concluded that portions of the amino terminus of rhodanese are important in the enzyme's folding, but are not essential for the enzyme's sulfurtransferase activity."

At pH values near neutrality, complete modification of the N-terminal valine residues of alpha- and beta-globin chains can be accomplished with a high degree of specificity. These groups react at a much more rapid rate than a slower reacting set of functional groups. Modification of hemoglobin with citrate alters the oxygen affinity of the protein. Although the p50 is not changed, the cooperative nature of oxygen binding is greatly decreased. Hemoglobin S modified with citrate is more soluble than unmodified hemoglobin S. The time taken for deoxygenated hemoglobin S to come out of solution in concentrated phosphate solutions is increased by citrate modification."
