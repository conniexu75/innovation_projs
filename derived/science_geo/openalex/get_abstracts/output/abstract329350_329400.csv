https://openalex.org/W1507372749,"Alaska's Good Friday earthquake of 27 March 1964 was accompanied by vertical tectonic deformation over an area of 170,000 to 200,000 square kilometers in south-central Alaska. The deformation included two major northeast-trending zones of uplift and subsidence situated between the Aleutian Trench and the Aleutian Volcanic Arc; together they are 700 to 800 kilometers long and from 150 to 250 kilometers wide. The seaward zone is one in which uplift of as much as 10 meters on land and 15 meters on the sea floor has occurred as a result of both crustal warping and local faulting. Submarine uplift within this zone generated a train of seismic sea waves with half-wave amplitudes of more than 7 meters along the coast near the source. The adjacent zone to the northwest is one of subsidence that averages about 1 meter and attains a measured maximum of 2.3 meters. A second zone of slight uplift may exist along all or part of the Aleutian and Alaska ranges northwest of the zone of subsidence."

https://openalex.org/W2015881738,"Hamster cells of the BHK-21 line are transformable by Rous sarcoma virus (Schmidt-Ruppin strain). The transformed cells form colonies in agar suspension culture, grow on glass in disarray, and initiate tumors in hamsters and chickens, but extracts do not induce tumors in chickens. Chickens bearing tumors develop neutralizing antibody against the virus. Transformed cell clones give rise to ""revertants"" which form colonies on glass with cells oriented parallel to each other like the original uninfected cells. These revertants do not grow in agar or initiate chicken tumors, and they regain the original low transplantability of untransformed cells in hamsters."
https://openalex.org/W2052570577,Carbonate mineral particles suspended in surface seawater in tropical and subtropical areas do not interact measurably with the water. Identical complex mineral assemblages occur in waters in various states of saturation. Drastic alterations of temperature and pH in the laboratory do not affect the composition of the suspended carbonates. It appears that the mineral grains are protected from the water by resistant organic coatings.
https://openalex.org/W2073294683,"In groups of house mice (Mus musculus) an experimentally imposed sequence of experience led to the establishment of male territories in suitably designed observation pens. This sequence consisted of familiarization with the area followed by combat with and social dominance over another male who was then removed, and a final step in which defeat on the home ground of a similarly experienced male was coupled with victory over the latter on familiar ground."
https://openalex.org/W2051747894,"Substitution of indoleacetic acid plus gibberellic acid for Pisum shoot apices restored apical dominance more effectively than indoleacetic acid alone. Studies of translocation, in which carbon-14-labeled indoleacetic acid was used (as determined by paper chromatography and scintillation counting) revealed that gibberellic acid caused more indoleacetic acid to be present and effective far from the site of application."
https://openalex.org/W2024297956,Six weanling male rats were fed a diet containing 90 percent opaque-2 maize for 28 days. The average gain in weight was 97 grams. In control rats fed on a standard hybrid maize the average gain was 27 grams. This confirms results of a previous feeding test on rats and demonstrates the superior quality of the proteins in opaque-2 mutant endosperm.
https://openalex.org/W2005616035,"Carbon-rich rocks more than 2.7 billion years old, from the Soudan Iron Formation of northeastern Minnesota, contain pyrite balls in which are found microstructures of possible biologic origin. The C(13)/C(12) and S(34)/S(32) ratios and minor element composition of this rock are consistent with such an interpretation. Hydrocarbons of presumed vital origin are also present, although it is not certain that they are endemic to the rock."
https://openalex.org/W2090501522,"Inactive four-ribosome polyribosomes, insensitive to ribonuclease, have the form of tight symmetrical squares and appear in feather cells during the early and intermediate periods of development. When, on the 13th day of incubation, the inactive polyribosomes become sensitive to ribonuclease and can then synthesize protein, the squares open up so that the four-ribosome polysomes are strung out in the configuration characteristic of functioning polysomes."

https://openalex.org/W2072413919,"Oysters exposed to laboratory cultures of the fish-killing dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium breve, are toxic when fed to chicks. The ecological significance of this result is interpreted in relation to the scarcity of well-documented reports of shellfish poisoning in higher animals from those areas of the Gulf of Mexico in which G. breve ""blooms"" occur."
https://openalex.org/W2037999633,"Two gamma globulin isoantigens in pigs have been identified by hemagglutination-inhibition tests. Two codominant autosomal alleles, Gl(a) and Gl(b), determine three phenotypes, Gl(a+b-), Gl(a+b+), and Gl(a-b+)."
https://openalex.org/W2077492106,"Extirpation of either the parathyroids or the thyroid in rats acutely impaired their ability to counteract hypercalcemia induced by exogenous parathormone. Thyroidectomy had the greater effect, and in rats subjected to both parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy the calcium-lowering mechanism was not further impaired, which suggests that the parathyroids secrete a humoral factor that releases calcium-lowering thyrocalcitonin from the thyroid. This hypothesis reconciles previous conflicting reports."
https://openalex.org/W1970687631,Adrenal tumor cells in culture gradually develop a requirement for glutamine and serum albumin in order to produce steroids in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone. Glutamine acts simply as a precursor for a protein or proteins whose synthesis is required for the response to the hormone. Albumin apparently binds steroid hormone products that otherwise would inhibit further biosynthesis of steroids.

https://openalex.org/W2004817865,Disk-shaped ice crystals grow out from the surface of polycrystalline ice in undercooled water. The rupture of the neck of the attached disk is a means of multiplying the number of viable crystals in the surrounding undercooled water. This is a source of frazil ice in streams and a source of new crystals in metal castings which are grain-refined by stirring.
https://openalex.org/W2029373364,"An analysis of data obtained at a variety of frequencies since 1957 has confirmed Bigg's observation that the satellite Io appears to control the emission of decametric radio energy by Jupiter. The correlation is stronger when intensity, rather than simple probability, is included in the analysis. There is also evidence of a similar influence by the satellites Europa and Ganymede."
https://openalex.org/W2095408754,A considerable variety of bacteria and similar microorganisms are present as preserved remains in pyrite samples of Pennsylvanian age obtained from the coal measures of southeastern Ohio. The types observed are similar to the present-day microflora found in stagnant pools of low oxygen and nutrient content.
https://openalex.org/W2155133204,"Long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides were measured in the stone phase and in a mechanically separated metallic nodule from a fragment of the Bondoc mesosiderite. Activity levels of the various radionuclides in both phases, along with results of mass-spectrometric measurements of rare-gas isotopes in the stone phase, indicate that heavy shielding was the chief cause of the low specific activities observed."

https://openalex.org/W2021160874,Subjecting 4-day-old chick embryos to a yolk-sac perfusion medium lacking tyrosine resulted in arrest of retinal pigmentation and in degeneration of the neural retina. Phenylaldnine was ineffective in replacing tyrosine. Possibly retinal tyrosinase played a part in initiating the degenerative changes.
https://openalex.org/W2035203545,"Eye movements of 20 male students were photographed continuously throughout the course of their learning verbal paired-associates. As learning progressed, proportionately less and less time was spent scanning the response when the stimulus and response were presented together. These findings are interpreted as supporting a two-stage theory of verbal learning."

https://openalex.org/W2055306111,"The latent period of constriction in the owl is only half that in the human, and the latent period of dilatation is about equal to that in the human. Similarly, the rise time of constriction in the owl is much faster than that in the human. The owl system has the characteristics of a low-band-pass filter. The owl's frequency response is over an octave lower than that of the human, but its phase lags are shorter."
https://openalex.org/W1964176241,Velacumantus australis is a common Australian snail which harbors several larval trematodes. Many populations have a small proportion of banded shells. Analysis of three samples from a coastal lake shows that banded snails are less likely to harbor larval trematodes than unbanded snails.
https://openalex.org/W1999902330,"The apparent activity of the second component of human complement was enhanced by treatment of the purified protein with iodoacetamide. By contrast, treatment with iodoacetic acid or p-chloromercuribenzoate led to inactivation. Treatment with iodoacetamide prevented the effect of p-chloromercuribenzoate and vice versa. Enhanced activity was partly due to increased stability of the otherwise labile intermediate complex consisting of erythrocytes, antibody, and the first, second, and fourth components of complement."
https://openalex.org/W2010041050,"Temperature control of various cryogenic liquids in the range from their boiling points to near or below their freezing points has been achieved by injecting a noncondensing gas, helium. The process is more easily accomplished than the usual vapor-pumping technique and is applicable in the range from 15 degrees to 300 degrees K. Interesting ice formations were observed in liquid argon."

https://openalex.org/W2056373118,"As hurricane ""Hilda"" crossed the Gulf of Mexico the dominant period of the microseisms shifted from about 8 to 5 seconds as the eye reached water about 150 to 200 meters deep. The conversion of wind energy to microseismic energy is most efficient in water depths from 20 to 200 meters. There is no evidence that two periods, one twice the other, are present."
https://openalex.org/W2041778036,"Human cells altered by infection with the ""lipovirus,"" a transmissible cytopathic agent, are highly resistant to ionizing radiation. Whereas about 500 roentgens will inhibit cell multiplication in normal cells, more than 500,000 roentgens are required to produce a similar effect in the altered cells. This gross change in cellular radiosensitivity may provide a useful system for studying in vitro the mechanisms of inhibition of cell division by radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2052923213,Metastable nitrogen molecules are produced by collision with xenon atoms excited with 1470-Å radiation. The photolytically excited species were detected by measuring the rate at which electrons were ejected from a gold surface. Hydrogen was shown to be more efficient than helium in quenching the photo-excited xenon atoms.
https://openalex.org/W1965399320,"Evidence that the fallout of iodine-131 in the Midwest during May 1962 originated in Nevada is provided by data on air trajectories, radioactivity in milk, and other findings. Selective escape of radioiodine from vented explosions, and the rapid transfer of iodine from the lower atmosphere to the biosphere, place, significance on even minor releases of radioactive fission products from subsurface nuclear explosions."
https://openalex.org/W2112758271,"The simplicity of the institutional grants program, the government's recognition of institutional autonomy, and the flexibility with which the funds may be used have naturally gratified administrators of colleges and universities. Presidents and deans have had an opportunity to use the grants to foster programs they think deserve more financial support. They have been able to ease some of the strain caused by tight travel and library budgets, furnish equipment that would persuade a promising Ph.D. to accept an appointment or keep a valued professor from accepting a position elsewhere, or speed the establishment of a computing center to serve the entire institution."

https://openalex.org/W2058627957,"1. Herein has been described and illustrated a belt paper kymograph, electrically driven, and provided with a three speed gear shift. 2. By the use of this gear shift the operator may instantaneously change the speed of his paper from intermediate to high speed which is four times faster or to low speed which is four times slower. 3. By the arrangement of gears here shown no clutch or clutch lever is needed, and the operator may readily alter the speed by the use of either hand. 4. Although this gear box may appear somewhat complicated and difficult to construct it was built by junior and senior college students in mechanical engineering."
