https://openalex.org/W2004098528,"Amyloid fibrils commonly exhibit multiple distinct morphologies in electron microscope and atomic force microscope images, often within a single image field. By using electron microscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on fibrils formed by the 40-residue β-amyloid peptide of Alzheimer's disease (Aβ 1–40 ), we show that different fibril morphologies have different underlying molecular structures, that the predominant structure can be controlled by subtle variations in fibril growth conditions, and that both morphology and molecular structure are self-propagating when fibrils grow from preformed seeds. Different Aβ 1–40 fibril morphologies also have significantly different toxicities in neuronal cell cultures. These results have implications for the mechanism of amyloid formation, the phenomenon of strains in prion diseases, the role of amyloid fibrils in amyloid diseases, and the development of amyloid-based nano-materials."

Here, we identify a myeloid-derived mucosal DC in mice, which populates the entire lamina propria of the small intestine. Lamina propria DCs were found to depend on the chemokine receptor CX 3 CR1 to form transepithelial dendrites, which enable the cells to directly sample luminal antigens. CX 3 CR1 was also found to control the clearance of entero-invasive pathogens by DCs. Thus, CX 3 CR1-dependent processes, which control host interactions of specialized DCs with commensal and pathogenic bacteria, may regulate immunological tolerance and inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2072669480,"Upon cytokine treatment, members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine and serine sites within the carboxyl-terminal region in cells. We show that in response to cytokine treatment, Stat3 is also acetylated on a single lysine residue, Lys685. Histone acetyltransferase p300-mediated Stat3 acetylation on Lys685 was reversible by type I histone deacetylase (HDAC). Use of a prostate cancer cell line (PC3) that lacks Stat3 and PC3 cells expressing wild-type Stat3 or a Stat3 mutant containing a Lys685-to-Arg substitution revealed that Lys685 acetylation was critical for Stat3 to form stable dimers required for cytokine-stimulated DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, to enhance transcription of cell growth-related genes, and to promote cell cycle progression in response to treatment with oncostatin M."
https://openalex.org/W1985834536,"SIRT3 is one of the seven mammalian sirtuin homologs of the yeast Sir2 gene, which mediates the effect of caloric restriction on life span extension in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. Because adipose tissue is essential in energy homeostasis and also plays a role in life span determination, we decided to investigate the function of sirtuin members in fat. We report here that murine SIRT3 is expressed in brown adipose tissue and is localized on the mitochondria inner membrane. Caloric restriction activates SIRT3 expression in both white and brown adipose. Additionally, cold exposure up-regulates SIRT3 expression in brown fat, whereas elevated climate temperature reduces the expression. Enforced expression of SIRT3 in the HIB1B brown adipocytes enhances the expression of the uncoupling protein PGC-1α, UCP1, and a series of mitochondria-related genes. Both ADP-ribosyltransferase and deacetylase activities of SIRT3 are required for this action. Furthermore, the SIRT3 deacetylase mutant exhibits a dominant negative effect by inhibiting UCP1 expression. This inhibitive effect can be abolished by the coexpression of PGC-1α, indicating a major role of PGC-1α in the SIRT3 action. In addition, SIRT3 stimulates CREB phosphorylation, which reportedly activates PGC-1α promoter directly. Functionally, sustained expression of SIRT3 decreases membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production while increasing cellular respiration. Finally, SIRT3, along with genes related to mitochondrial function, is down-regulated in the brown adipose tissue of several genetically obese mice. In summary, our results demonstrate that SIRT3 activates mitochondria functions and plays an important role in adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose.

Sir2 and related members of the sirtuin gene family are highly conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1.Dutnall R.N. Pillus L. Cell. 2001; 105: 161-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The yeast Sir2 encodes a nuclear protein that is localized mainly in nucleoli and telomeric foci (2.Gotta M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Renauld H. Laroche T. Kennedy B.K. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3243-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In yeast, Sir2 maintains the silencing of the heterochromatin at the mating-type loci (3.Rine J. Herskowitz I. Genetics. 1987; 116: 9-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), telomeres (4.Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Gottschling D.E.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sir2 is also involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (6.Tsukamoto Y. Kato J. Ikeda H. Nature. 1997; 388: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), cell cycle progression through anaphase, the meiotic chromosome segregation checkpoint (7.San-Segundo P.A. Roeder G.S. Mol.

Vu L. Nomura M. Cell. 2004; 117: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Most importantly, though, Sir2 mediates the effect of caloric restriction on life span extension (9.Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). An increased dosage of the Sir2 gene prolongs life span in yeast (10.Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L.

Blocking NAD synthesis in yeast abolishes the life span extension of caloric restriction (17.Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). On the other hand, resveratrol, a natural compound present in grapes and wine, has recently been shown as an activator of sirtuins to lengthen life span in yeast (18.Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A.

Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). There are seven mammalian Sir2 homologs (20.Frye R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), all of which maintain the catalytic core domain of Sir2. NAD-dependent deacetylase activity has been demonstrated for mammalian SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 proteins. The presence of NAD-dependent ADP-ribosylase and protein deacetylase activities of sirtuin proteins suggests that they may function as sensors of metabolic or oxidative states of cells and regulate cellular functions accordingly. Mammalian SIRT1, which resides in the nucleus, is the most closely related to yeast Sir2. SIRT1 binds and deacetylates p53 (21.Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W.

Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In contrast, SIRT1-deficient cells are p53-hyperacetylated and have elevated p53-dependent apoptosis, whereas SIRT1 knock-out mice exhibit developmental defects (28.Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). SIRT1 also suppresses muscle differentiation in response to the redox state (29.Fulco M. Schiltz R.L. Iezzi S. King M.T. Zhao P. Kashiwaya Y. Hoffman E. Veech R.L. Sartorelli V. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 51-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). SIRT2, on the other hand, is a cytoplasmic protein, which colocalizes with microtubules and deacetylates α-tubulins (30.North B.J. Marshall B.L. Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 437-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). SIRT2 abundance increases during mitosis, suggesting that the protein plays a role in cell cycle regulation (31.Dryden S.C. Nahhas F.A. Nowak J.E. Goustin A.S. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 23: 3173-3185Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Unlike SIRT2, human SIRT3 is a mitochondria protein, with its N-terminal 25 amino acid residues responsible for its mitochondrial localization (32.Onyango P. Celic I. McCaffery J.M. Boeke J.D. Feinberg A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13653-13658Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 33.Schwer B. North B.J. Frye R.A. Ott M. Verdin E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Synthesized as an enzymatically inactive protein, human SIRT3 is activated by matrix-processing peptidase (33.Schwer B. North B.J. Frye R.A. Ott M. Verdin E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Compared with human SIRT3, however, murine SIRT3 lacks the N-terminal 142 amino acid residues necessary for the mitochondria localization for the human version. Nevertheless, the murine SIRT3 was shown to maintain a paranuclear localization, consistent with a mitochondrial distribution pattern (34.Yang Y.H. Chen Y.H. Zhang C.Y. Nimmakayalu M.A. Ward D.C. Weissman S. Genomics. 2000; 69: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar to yeast Sir2, mammalian sirtuin genes may also mediate caloric restriction effects on metabolism. It has been reported recently that calorie restriction induces SIRT1 expression in fat and other tissues to promote mammalian cell survival (35.Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). SIRT1 also suppresses adipocyte differentiation and activates fat mobilization (36.Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). In agreement with this line of reasoning, mice lacking the insulin receptor in their adipose tissues live longer (37.Bluher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Because adipose tissue, an essential player in energy homeostasis, responds to caloric restriction (38.Barzilai N. Gabriely I. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 903S-906SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to focus our investigation on sirtuin function in the mammalian adipose tissue. Adipose tissue not only plays a part in energy storage, but it is also a critical endocrine organ, producing hormones such as leptin and adiponectin. There are two types of adipose, white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue. White adipocytes store energy as triglycerides in large lipid droplets and mobilize the lipid in support of the energy need of the body. Brown adipocytes are morphologically different from white adipocytes as they harbor abundant mitochondria and store lipid in multilocular lipid droplets. The physiological role of brown adipose tissue also differs from that of white adipose tissue as it serves primarily to dissipate energy in the form of heat.

Because UCP1 induces proton leakage, it generates heat instead of ATP. As a result, UCP1 knock-out mice exhibit cold sensitivity (39.Enerback S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), whereas transgenic mice, which express UCP1 in their white adipose tissues, resist obesity (40.Kopecky J. Clarke G. Enerback S. Spiegelman B. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2914-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigate the expression of mouse sirtuin family members in adipose tissue. We then focus our studies on SIRT3, which displays a high expression in brown fat but maintains a low level in white fat. Moreover, the expression of SIRT3 in brown adipose tissue responds to the changes of environmental temperature and dietary restriction. Additionally, we determined that murine SIRT3 proteins localize in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and the expression of SIRT3 correlates with the expressions of genes related to mitochondrial function, including UCP1, through the activation of PGC-1α. SIRT3 also influences mitochondrial function by reducing membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and by increasing oxygen consumption. Animals and Caloric Restriction—C57BL/6 male mice were used for the experiments. For caloric restriction, starting from 8 weeks of age, mice were caged singly. The ad libitum mice were fed NIH-31 standard feed (Harlan Teklad) ad libitum, whereas the caloric restricted mice were fed with NIH-31/NIA fortified diet (Harlan Teklad) with a daily food allotment at 90% of the amount eaten by the ad libitum mice at the 1st week, then 70% at the 2nd and 3rd weeks. From the 4th week, daily food allotment was kept at 60% for the caloric restricted mice. Three months after the onset of caloric restriction, tissues were harvested to examine SIRT3 gene expression by Northern blot analysis. Cell Culture and Antibodies—HIB1B preadipocytes and NIH3T3 and BOSC23 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. For HIB1B differentiation, at confluence, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone), supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), and 1 nm triiodothyronine (Sigma) for 3 days. They were then refed every 2 days with 10% cosmic calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing only insulin and triiodothyronine at the concentrations mentioned above. On the 8th day of differentiation, cells were stimulated with 1 μm isoproterenol (Sigma) for 6 h prior to harvest. The antibodies used for Western blot analysis included anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, BD Pharmingen), and anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (clone 20E8-C12, Molecular Probes). Anti-CREB antibody and anti-phosphor-CREB (Ser-133) antibody were from Cell Signaling. Plasmid Construction—The murine SIRT3 cDNA in the pSport-CMV vector was obtained from Open Biosystem. It was excised with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pBabe-puro to generate pBabe-mSIRT3. For the construction of mSIRT3-FLAG, full-length mSIRT3 with a FLAG-tagged C terminus was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-GCAGTGGGTGGTCATG-3′ and 5′-ATTACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCTCTGTCCTGTCCATCCAG-3′. The PCR fragment was cloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then excised out with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into pCDNA3.1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed based on a reported method (41.Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Amino acid residue Gly-11(G11A) or Asn-87 (N87A) of SIRT3 was replaced by Ala to disrupt the ADP-ribosyltransferase or the deacetylase activities, respectively. The primers for these two mutants are CATCAGCACACCCAGTGCCATCCCGGACTTCAGATCC (G11A) and GCGGCTCTATACACAGGCAATCGACGGGCTTGAGA (N87A). The SIRT3 mutants were confirmed by sequencing and subcloned into the pBabe-puro vector (42.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar). Retroviral Infection—For retroviral infection, pBabe-puro or pBabehygro constructs were used to transfect BOSC23 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Two days after transfection, supernatants containing viral particles were harvested and used to infect HIB1B cells. The cells were then selected by 4 μg/ml puromycin or 200 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 μg of RNA was separated through 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in 20× SSC. The membrane was hybridized overnight at 65 °C with a probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (MP Biomedicals) by random primed DNA labeling (Promega). The autoradiography was obtained by a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Confocal Microscopy—The mSIRT3-FLAG construct was used to transfect NIH3T3 cells, grown on coverslips, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) reagent. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated for 45 min with 100 nm MitoTracker Orange (Molecular Probes) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. Cells on coverslips were rinsed in PBS and then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and PBS for 30 min. After blocking with 10% goat serum, cells were incubated with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (1:500, Sigma) and then with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted and observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview). Preparation of Mitochondria Fractions—NIH3T3 cells, transfected with mSIRT3-FLAG, were harvested in an isotonic mitochondrial buffer (MB) (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin), and then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton) on ice. The suspension was centrifuged at 400 × g on a microcentrifuge (ThermoForma) at 4 °C. This procedure was repeated twice, and supernatants from each step were combined and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondria were fractionated further by either alkaline or digitonin treatment. For digitonin treatment, 100 μg of purified mitochondria was dissolved in 100 μl of digitonin solution (1.2 mg/ml). After a 25-min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to generate mitoplasts, which consist of the inner membranes and the mitochondria matrix. The supernatant included the intermembranous space fraction and outer membrane. For alkaline treatment, mitochondrial pellets were washed and resuspended in freshly prepared 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5. The suspension was then incubated at 0 °C for 30 min. Mitochondrial membranes and supernatant fractions were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Trichloracetate precipitation was used to concentrate the proteins in the supernatant. The pellet and the concentrated proteins were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting. Measurement of Respiration in Whole Cells—Oxygen consumption of HIB1B fibroblasts was measured by using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Each sample was analyzed by incubating 2 × 106 cells with PBS solution in a magnetically stirred chamber, thermostated to 37 °C. After recording the basal respiration, 500 nm cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added to the chamber to measure the maximum respiration, and 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin was added to determine the uncoupled respiration. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)—The fluorescent probe 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes) was used to measure the Δψm of HIB1B cells. Briefly, 1 × 106 HIB1B cells were harvested by trypsinization. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml JC-1 at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were then washed in PBS, and 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample by flow cytometry, using Moflo Cell Sorter (DakoCytomation). Data were presented as a ratio of relative red to green (aggregate to monomer) fluorescence intensity values. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Measurement of ROS—The ROS level was measured by using the probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) (Sigma), which is intracellularly esterified and becomes a fluorescent product, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, when oxidized (43.Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Rosenkranz A.R. Schmaldienst S. Stuhlmeier K.M. Chen W. Knapp W. Zlabinger G.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 156: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). HIB1B cells were trypsinized and washed once in PBS. Then the cells were incubated with 10 μm DCFHDA for 10 min at 37 °C. 10,000 cells of each sample were then analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Mammalian Sirtuins Are Expressed in Adipose Tissue—We first examined the expression pattern of seven mouse sirtuin members in various mouse tissues by Northern blot analysis. All seven mammalian sirtuin members are expressed in adipose tissues as well as a broad range of other tissues (Fig. 1A). Although SIRT2, SIRT4, and SIRT6 reside in both the white and brown adipose at comparable levels, SIRT1 and SIRT7 maintain a higher expression in white fat, whereas SIRT3 and SIRT5 are preferentially expressed in brown adipose versus white adipose. SIRT4, SIRT6, and SIRT7 display multiple mRNA species, probably because of alternative splicing. SIRT3 Expression in Adipose Is Responsive to Caloric Restriction and Environmental Temperature—Among all of the sirtuin members, SIRT3 exhibits an interesting expression pattern with a high expression in the brown adipose versus white adipose. It was known that Sir2 gene mediates caloric restriction in yeast and worms (9.Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 17.Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that mammalian SIRT1 is activated by caloric restriction in white fat, liver, brain, and kidney (35.Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to determine whether SIRT3 expression in adipose tissue is altered by caloric restriction. The SIRT3 mRNA level in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue is up-regulated by 3 months of caloric restriction (Fig. 1B). Because rodent brown adipose is responsible for cold-stimulated nonshivering thermogenesis, we also examined whether SIRT3 expression is regulated by cold exposure. As shown in Fig. 1C, the RNA levels of both SIRT3 and UCP1 exhibit a similar pattern of increase in brown adipose during a 12-h period of cold exposure. When we subject mice to a thermoneutral temperature at 27.5 °C for 16 h, we found that SIRT3 expression was down-regulated compared with the mice kept at room temperature of 23 °C (Fig. 1D). This result raised the possibility that SIRT3 may play a role in regulating adaptive thermogenesis. Murine SIRT3 Protein Is Localized on the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane—The human SIRT3 protein was shown to be located in the mitochondrial matrix (32.Onyango P. Celic I. McCaffery J.M. Boeke J.D. Feinberg A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13653-13658Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 33.Schwer B. North B.J. Frye R.A. Ott M. Verdin E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal 25 amino acid residues are critical for its mitochondrial localization (33.Schwer B. North B.J. Frye R.A. Ott M. Verdin E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Because mouse SIRT3 lacks the N-terminal 142 amino acid residues of human SIRT3, the mitochondrial localization of mouse SIRT3 is in question. To determine the subcellular distribution of mouse SIRT3, it was expressed in a C-terminal FLAG-tagged form in the NIH3T3 cells by transient transfection. The mSIRT3-FLAG protein was detected by immunofluorescence and was observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope. As shown in Fig. 2A, the subcellular distribution of FLAG-tagged mouse SIRT3 protein shares a distribution pattern similar to that of the mitochondria stained by the MitoTracker dye. This finding indicates that the majority of mouse SIRT3 proteins are situated in the mitochondria. To define more precisely the exact localization of mouse SIRT3 in the mitochondria, mitochondria from NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with mSIRT3-FLAG were isolated and incubated with digitonin, which ruptures the mitochondria outer membrane and releases soluble proteins from the intermembranous space. Immunoblotting against the interstitial protein cytochrome c, which appeared in the supernatant fraction, was used to confirm the rupture of the outer membrane by digitonin (Fig. 2B, left panel). The inner membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) remained in the mitoplast fraction, unaffected by the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The mouse SIRT3 proteins were detected in the mitoplast fraction, indicating that mouse SIRT3 resides on either the inner mitochondrial membrane or in the mitochondria matrix. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we treated mitochondria with sodium carbonate under an alkaline condition. Under this treatment, soluble and intermembranous proteins were released into the supernatant after ultracentrifugation, whereas membranes with integral membrane proteins sedimented into a pellet. The murine SIRT3 proteins were found in the pellet (Fig. 2B, right panel), indicating that it associates with the inner membrane. Taken together, we concluded that murine SIRT3 proteins localize on the mitochondria inner membrane. Constitutive Expression of SIRT3 Promotes the Expression of Mitochondria-related Genes—To investigate the role that SIRT3 plays in brown adipocytes, we constitutively expressed mouse SIRT2 and SIRT3 in the HIB1B brown preadipocyte cell line using a retroviral system (42.Pear W.S.

We investigated the circumstances under which CD8(+) T cells specific for pancreatic beta-islet antigens induce disease in mice expressing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein (GP) as a transgene under the control of the rat insulin promoter. In contrast to infection with LCMV, immunization with LCMV-GP derived peptide did not induce autoimmune diabetes despite large numbers of autoreactive cytotoxic T cells. Only subsequent treatment with Toll-like receptor ligands elicited overt autoimmune disease. This difference was critically regulated by the peripheral target organ itself, which upregulated class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in response to systemic Toll-like receptor-triggered interferon-alpha production. These data identify the 'inflammatory status' of the target organ as a separate and limiting factor determining the development of autoimmune disease."

Our continuous remote tracking of 22 adult gray-headed albatrosses for over 30 bird-years reveals three distinct strategies: (i) Stay in breeding home range; (ii) make return migrations to a specific area of the southwest Indian Ocean; and (iii) make one or more global circumnavigations (the fastest in just 46 days). The consistencies in patterns, routes, and timings offer the first hope of identifying areas of critical habitat for nonbreeding albatrosses, wherein appropriate management of longline fisheries might alleviate the plight of the world's most threatened family of birds."

Like other members of the tumor necrosis factor family of cytokines, TRAIL is a type II transmembrane protein with an extracellular carboxyl terminus that mediates trimerization and receptor binding (3Pitti R.M.

In addition, an antibody against one of the receptors of TRAIL (DR5) potently induces apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinomas in vitro and in vivo, but not in normal human hepatocytes, thereby suggesting an additional therapeutic strategy to activate TRAIL apoptotic signaling (8Ichikawa K.

Although the mechanisms underlying the differential sensitivity of cancer and normal cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis are poorly understood, the potential tumor selectivity of TRAIL distinguishes it from many other cancer therapies.TRAIL-induced apoptosis is mediated by the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which is composed of the TRAIL death receptors (DR4 and DR5), Fas-associated death domain (FADD), and the apical procaspases-8 and -10 (2LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Trimeric TRAIL binds to its death domain-containing DR4 and DR5 receptors, which leads to the recruitment of FADD and procaspases-8 and -10 to ligand-bound death receptors, thereby triggering the proteolytic activation of these apical caspases (9Kischkel F.C.

Importantly, the mitochondrial amplification of caspase activation is required for apoptosis induction by TRAIL in some cancer cells, designated type II cells, but not in others (type I cells) (19Burns T.F.

However, the molecular mechanisms of TRAIL resistance in the vast majority of cancers have not yet been delineated.Here we report that the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin is a novel inhibitor of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer. αB-crystallin is 1 of 10 mammalian members of the conserved small heat shock protein family, which also includes Hsp27 (27Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Like other small heat shock proteins, αB-crystallin is a molecular chaperone that is induced by a variety of stress stimuli and confers a cytoprotective effect by suppressing aggregation of denatured proteins (28Horwitz J.

In addition, αB-crystallin is constitutively expressed, often at high levels, in diverse human cancers, including gliomas and breast, prostate, and renal cell carcinomas (30Aoyama A. Steiger R.H.

Within cells, αB-crystallin assembles into large ∼500-kDa homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes (along with Hsp27) (27Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Importantly, the assembly of αB-crystallin into these large complexes is negatively regulated by stress-induced phosphorylation on serine residues 19, 45, and 59, and the dissociated complexes have diminished chaperone activity (35Ito H.

Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that αB-crystallin inhibits apoptosis induced by various stimuli, including DNA-damaging agents and growth factor deprivation, by disrupting the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 (37Kamradt M.C.

Here we demonstrate that TRAIL resistance in a panel of human cancer cell lines is tightly linked to the expression of αB-crystallin (but not other heat shock proteins or apoptosis-regulating proteins) and that αB-crystallin inhibits TRAIL-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. We also show that selective inhibition of αB-crystallin expression by plasmid-based RNA interference (RNAi) sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that αB-crystallin is a novel negative regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis and that targeted inhibition of this small heat shock protein sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—Breast carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen).

A single clone was isolated and grown to log phase, at which time 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression. After cell growth for an additional 2 h, bacteria were lysed, and the His-tagged protein was purified under native conditions using the QIAexpress system (Qiagen).

The lysate was then incubated on ice for 30 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet cellular debris. Next, the lysate was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The lysate-nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mixture was then loaded onto a column and washed twice (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)), and His-tagged TRAIL was eluted in 250 mm imidizole. After elution, fractions that contained high concentrations of purified TRAIL (as determined by SDS-PAGE and a protein assay; Bio-Rad) were pooled and stored in aliquots containing 10% glycerol at –80 °C.Induction and Analysis of Apoptosis—All apoptosis assays were performed with TRAIL produced as detailed in the preceding paragraph, except for the transient transfection experiments. In these experiments, transiently transfected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TRAIL (Calbiochem) for 30 min. After treatment, transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence (control vector) or indirect immunofluorescence (FLAG-tagged plasmids) with FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) as detailed previously (41Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K.J. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Apoptotic nuclei (fragmented or condensed) were scored by staining with 10 μg/ml Hoescht 33258 as described previously (37Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 41Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K.J. Cryns V.L. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For apoptosis assays with parental or stably transfected cancer cells, apoptosis was scored by nuclear morphology (as described above) on the entire cell population. For xenograft tumors, apoptotic nuclei were detected in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by terminal dUTP deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, TMR Red; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed at least three times; 200 or more cells were scored in each experiment. The statistical significance of results was determined by a two-tailed, paired Student's t test.Cell Proliferation Assay—The in vitro growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably expressing vector, WT αB-crystallin (clones A5 and D1), or mutant 3XSE αB-crystallin (clones A2 and A3) was measured using the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)-based assay. 3000 cells in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were plated in each well of a 96-well plate. Cells were maintained at 37 °C for 0, 1, 2, or 3 days, at which time 20 μl of the CellTiter96® Aqueous One Solution were added to each well. The plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and absorbance was read using a Molecular Devices microplate reader (490 nm). Cell number was expressed as the mean percentage of viable cells present at each time point normalized to t = 0 ± S.E. (n = 3; each performed in triplicate).Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (39Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: αB-crystallin, Hsp27, Hsp70, FLIP, DR4, DR5, and DcR2 (Stressgen); tubulin and FLAG (Sigma); caspase-3, caspase-8, HspB2/MKBP, Bax, and Bcl-xL (BD Transduction Laboratories); and FADD and cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen). To examine the proteolytic processing of caspases, lysates were immunoblotted with a caspase-9 polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemical), a caspase-8 mAb (kindly provided by Marcus E. Peter, University of Chicago), or a caspase-3 mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories).Caspase-3-like Activity Assays—Caspase-3-like activity was measured by release of AFC from a synthetic fluorogenic substrate (DEVD-AFC) according to the manufacturer's instructions (ICN Biomedicals, Enzymes Systems Products) using a fluorometric microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 505 nm, respectively.RNAi—pRNAi was constructed using methods similar to those described for the construction of pSUPER (42Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). Briefly, the H1 RNA promoter was generated by PCR using human genomic DNA and the primers 5′-CCATGGAATTCGAACGCTGACGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAAGCTTAGATCTGTGGTCTCATACAGAACTTATAAGATTCCC-3′ (antisense). The product was then digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into the pBSKII cloning vector (Stratagene). The final plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing. pRNAi-αB-crystallin was constructed by annealing the following 64-bp oligonucleotides: 5′-gatccccGGACAGGTTCTCTGTCAACttcaagagaGTTGACAGAGAACCTGTCCtttttggaaa-3′ and 5′-agcttttccaaaaaGGACAGGTTCTCTGTCAACtctcttgaaGTTGACAGAGAACCTGTCCggg-3′ (the 19-nucleotide αB-crystallin-specific target sequences are indicated in capital letters). The annealed oligonucleotides were then ligated into the BglII and HindIII cloning sites of pRNAi. pRNAi-αB-crystallin generates a hairpin RNA structure that is cleaved to form the 19-bp specific small interfering RNA sequence to αB-crystallin, 216-GGACAGGTTCTCTGTCAAC-234. The final product was verified by DNA sequencing.To determine the efficiency of pRNAi-αB-crystallin in silencing αB-crystallin expression, MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pEGFP-N1 and 0.8 μg of pRNAi-αB-crystallin or pRNAi vector using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h, at which time cells were trypsinized and sorted for GFP expression by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. GFP-positive cells were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. For apoptosis assays, MDA-MB 435 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-N1 and pRNAi-αB-crystallin or pRNAi vector as described above. 48 h later, cells were treated for 6 h with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) or 2.5 μg/ml TRAIL, and GFP-positive cells were scored for apoptosis by nuclear morphology as indicated above.Breast Cancer Xenograft Studies—Female 4–5-week-old athymic nude mice were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. To determine the effects of αB-crystallin on xenograft tumor growth, 2.5 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing vector, WT, or mutant 3XSE αB-crystallin were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and implanted subcutaneously into both mammary fat pads (n = 5 mice/group). Tumor size was measured weekly using Vernier calipers. Tumor volume was calculated by the following equation: tumor volume (mm3) = [(length × width2)] × π /6. To examine the effect of αB-crystallin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in vivo, 1-mm3 blocks of MDA-MB-231 tumors stably expressing vector or WT αB-crystallin were transplanted subcutaneously into the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice. 3 weeks after tumor implantation, nude mice were treated with TRAIL (10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal) for 2 weeks. Apoptosis was scored in xenograft tumors by TUNEL assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit, TMR Red; Roche Applied Science) as described under “Induction and Analysis of Apoptosis.” All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern University.RESULTSαB-crystallin Expression Correlates with Resistance to TRAIL-induced Caspase-3 Activation and Apoptosis—A panel of estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7 and T47D) and estrogen receptor-negative (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-468) human breast carcinoma cell lines was treated with 0–5 μg/ml TRAIL for 24 h, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by nuclear morphology. MDA-MB-231 cells were exquisitely sensitive to TRAIL: >50% of cells were apoptotic after treatment with the lowest concentration of TRAIL tested (200 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the other four breast cancer cell lines were resistant to TRAIL: <30% of cells were apoptotic when treated with the highest dose (5 μg/ml) of TRAIL (Fig. 1A). In an effort to delineate the mechanism(s) underlying the differential sensitivity of these breast carcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we examined these cells for the expression of various DISC components (Fig. 1B, left panel) and apoptosis-regulating proteins (Fig. 1B, right panels). Importantly, each of the DISC components and Bcl-2 family members examined was expressed in all of these cells. Intriguingly, MDA-MB-231 cells (which were sensitive to TRAIL) completely lacked the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin, whereas MDA-MB-435 cells (which had intermediate resistance to TRAIL; Fig. 1A) expressed low levels of αB-crystallin, and the three highly TRAIL-resistant cell lines (MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and T47D) expressed high levels of αB-crystallin. Unlike αB-crystallin, Hsp27 and Hsp70 were expressed in all of these breast cancer cells, thereby underscoring the specificity of this observation. A similar correlation between αB-crystallin expression and TRAIL resistance was noted in human malignant glioma cell lines (Fig. 1C). Gliomas that lacked αB-crystallin (LG11 and D54MG) were sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, whereas gliomas with low (U87MG and A172) or high levels (U251MG and U373MG) of αB-crystallin expression were partly or completely resistant to TRAIL, respectively. Indeed, a survey of additional human cancer cell lines (carcinomas of the breast, lung, kidney, and pancreas) revealed that 9 of 10 cancer cell lines that expressed αB-crystallin were resistant to TRAIL (data not shown). These findings indicate that αB-crystallin expression is tightly linked to TRAIL resistance in diverse human cancer cell lines.Because we have previously demonstrated that αB-crystallin inhibits apoptosis by disrupting the activation of caspase-3 (37Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 38Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Sam S. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38731-38736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we reasoned that if αB-crystallin were responsible for the observed TRAIL resistance, then TRAIL-ind"
https://openalex.org/W2086413921,"Organogenesis begins with specification of a progenitor cell population, the size of which provides a foundation for the organ's final dimensions. Here, we present a new mechanism for regulating the number of progenitor cells by limiting their density within a competent region. We demonstrate that retinoic acid signaling restricts cardiac specification in the zebrafish embryo. Reduction of retinoic acid signaling causes formation of an excess of cardiomyocytes, via fate transformations that increase cardiac progenitor density within a multipotential zone. Thus, retinoic acid signaling creates a balance between cardiac and noncardiac identities, thereby refining the dimensions of the cardiac progenitor pool."
https://openalex.org/W1985647060,"Genetic studies have elucidated mechanisms that regulate aging, but there has been little progress in identifying drugs that delay aging. Here, we report that ethosuximide, trimethadione, and 3,3-diethyl-2-pyrrolidinone increase mean and maximum life-span of Caenorhabditis elegans and delay age-related declines of physiological processes, indicating that these compounds retard the aging process. These compounds, two of which are approved for human use, are anticonvulsants that modulate neural activity. These compounds also regulated neuromuscular activity in nematodes. These findings suggest that the life-span–extending activity of these compounds is related to the anticonvulsant activity and implicate neural activity in the regulation of aging."
https://openalex.org/W2075277027,"Taxanes are powerful chemotherapy agents that target the microtubule cytoskeleton, leading to mitotic arrest and cell death; however, their clinical efficacy has been hampered due to the development of drug resistance. Therefore, other proteins involved in spindle assembly are being examined as potential targets for anticancer therapy. The mitotic kinesin, Eg5 is critical for proper spindle assembly; as such, inhibition of Eg5 leads to mitotic arrest making it a potential anticancer target. We wanted to validate Eg5 as a therapeutic target and determine if Eg5 inhibitors retain activity in Taxol-resistant cells. Using affinity chromatography we first show that the compound HR22C16 is an Eg5 inhibitor and does not interact with other microtubule motor proteins tested. Furthermore, HR22C16 along with its analogs, inhibit cell survival in both Taxol-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells with at least 15-fold greater efficacy than monastrol, the first generation Eg5 inhibitor. Further analysis with HR22C16-A1, the most potent HR22C16 analog, showed that it retains efficacy in PgP-overexpressing cells, suggesting that it is not a PgP substrate. We further show that HR22C16-A1 induces cell death following mitotic arrest via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, the combination of HR22C16-A1 with Taxol results in an antagonistic antiproliferative and antimitotic effect, possibly due to the abrogation of Taxol-induced mitotic spindles by HR22C16-A1.

Taxanes represent one of the most successful classes of anticancer drugs and have validated microtubules as excellent chemotherapeutic targets (1Jordan M.A. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2002; 2: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, taxanes bind microtubules directly leading to a potent suppression of microtubule dynamics, increased microtubule stabilization, and interphase microtubule bundling; consequently, cells undergo robust mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptotic cell death (2Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar, 3Wilson L. Panda D. Jordan M.A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Despite their clinical success against several solid tumors including ovarian, breast, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancers (4Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 353-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), acquired drug resistance has hindered their clinical efficacy (5Orr G.A. Verdier-Pinard P. McDaid H. Horwitz S.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7280-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Extensive preclinical studies have shown that taxane resistance is primarily caused by overexpression of the drug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (PgP) 1The abbreviations used are: PgP, P-glycoprotein; THF, tetrahydrofuran; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CI, combination index; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand.1The abbreviations used are: PgP, P-glycoprotein; THF, tetrahydrofuran; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CI, combination index; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand.

Horwitz S. Wilson L. Jordan M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11737-11742Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, there is an urgent need to identify small molecule inhibitors that overcome taxane resistance. Because antimitotics have been so effective in clinical oncology, other proteins involved in the mitotic machinery represent desirable targets for anticancer therapy.One such target is the microtubule-associated protein, Eg5 (9Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Garrett S. Kapoor T.M. Curr.

Le Guellec R. Kress M. Philippe M. Le Guellec K. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This mitotic kinesin contains an N-terminal motor domain, which generates force along the microtubule, moving Eg5 to the microtubule plus end. During interphase in most epithelial cells, the plus ends of microtubules are oriented toward the plasma membrane while the minus ends are facing the nucleus. Upon entry into mitosis, microtubule plus ends reorient toward the chromosomes, while the minus ends are anchored at the spindle poles, forming a bipolar spindle. The homotetrameric structure of Eg5 has its motor domains arranged at two ends of a dumbbell such that it can bind and push apart spindle microtubules and generate an outward-directed force pushing spindle poles apart (13Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, Eg5 is critical for proper spindle formation during mitosis and therefore has become an attractive therapeutic target for rapidly dividing cancer cells.The first small molecule inhibitor of Eg5 was identified in a phenotype-based screen and has been termed monastrol, because of the formation of monoastral spindles (16Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Schreiber S.L. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Monastrol induces mitotic arrest without affecting interphase microtubules, and has been a useful tool for dissecting the mechanisms underlying spindle assembly (14Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar); however, its clinical potential is limited because of its weak Eg5 inhibitory activity (IC50, 14 μm; Ref. 16Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Schreiber S.L. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Recently, second generation Eg5 inhibitors have been discovered in drug screens. One such compound, CK0106023, is a specific allosteric inhibitor of Eg5 and possesses antitumor activity in an ovarian cancer xenograft (17Sakowicz R. Finer J.T. Beraud C. Crompton A. Lewis E. Fritsch A. Lee Y. Mak J. Moody R. Turincio R. Chabala J.C. Gonzales P. Roth S. Weitman S. Wood K.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3276-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Another Eg5 inhibitor, HR22C16 was discovered in a microscopy-based forward chemical genetics screen of ∼16,000 compounds (18Hotha S. Yarrow J.C. Yang J.G. Garrett S. Renduchintala K.V. Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This compound has antimitotic activity and inhibits the Eg5 motor function in vitro with an IC50 of 800 ± 10 nm. Moreover, a variety of HR22C16 analogs with increased potency have also been developed.Since HR22C16 and its analogs target Eg5 but not interphase microtubules, we wanted to assess their efficacy in Taxol-resistant and -sensitive human ovarian carcinoma cells. Our laboratory has established a model of Taxol resistance comprised of the 1A9 Taxol-sensitive human ovarian carcinoma cell line and its Taxol-resistant derivative line, 1A9/PTX10. Taxol resistance in this model is caused by an acquired tubulin mutation at the Taxol binding site and results in a 25-fold resistance to Taxol as compared with the parental 1A9 cells (7Giannakakou P.

Ye K. Panda D. Giannakakou P. Joshi H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39777-39785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Our results show that HR22C16 and its analogs, inhibit cell survival in both Taxol-sensitive and Taxol-resistant ovarian cancer cells, which either have PgP overexpression or acquired β-tubulin mutations. Furthermore, mechanistic evaluation of the most potent HR22C16 analog, HR22C16-A1 (termed A1), revealed that it induces apoptotic cell death via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, the combination of A1 with Taxol results in an antagonistic effect on cell death and mitotic arrest, indicating that the combination of an Eg5 inhibitor with Taxol may not be of therapeutic use. In summary, we have identified a small molecule inhibitor of Eg5 with promising anticancer activity that retains the ability to induce cell death in cases where taxanes fail.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. All lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The PTX10 Taxol-resistant cells were derived from 1A9 ovarian carcinoma cells as previously described (7Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.K. Zhan Z. Buters J.T. Fojo T. Poruchynsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17118-17125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar).Drug Compounds—Taxol was obtained from Calbiochem (580555), aliquoted to 10 μm in Me2SO and stored at 4 °C. Monastrol was obtained from AgScientific (M116) aliquoted to 10 mm in Me2SO and stored at -20 °C. HR22C16, A1, and other analogs were previously synthesized and stored as described in Hotha et al. (18Hotha S. Yarrow J.C. Yang J.G. Garrett S. Renduchintala K.V. Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).Preparation of HR22C16 Matrix for Affinity Chromatography—5.1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) in 2-propyl alcohol was precipitated using a tabletop clinical centrifuge. The 2-propyl alcohol was carefully removed, and 8 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added. The THF was removed after pelleting the resin again and fresh THF was added. 51.2 mg of the HR22C16-amine in 200 μl of Me2SO and 25 μl of pyridine were added. After 4 h of incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixture was pelleted, and THF was removed. Fresh 2-propyl alcohol (10 ml) and 200 μl of TBSTX (14Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) were added to the resin and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.Affinity Chromatography—Cytostatic factor-arrested Xenopus extracts were prepared as described (20Desai A. Murray A. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 385-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Extracts were then diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 11 mm MgCl2, 10 mg/ml LPC, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm ATP, 7.5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and spun for 1 h and 40 min at 52,000 rpm in a Ti70 rotor. Clarified extracts were then repeatedly passed over a column of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) for 2 h. Either 200 μm of the HR22C16-amine or 0.1% Me2SO was then added to the clarified extract and it was repeatedly passed over the HR22C16 matrix for an additional 3 h. The flow-through was saved for Western blot analysis. The HR22C16 beads were then washed with 25 column volumes of wash buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and followed by 25 column volumes of wash buffer with 1 m KCl. Beads from the column were then added to SDS loading buffer and processed for Western blot analysis. Antibodies used were obtained as follows: pan-kinesin (gift from Dr. Timothy J. Mitchison; anti-Eg5 (as described in Ref. 9Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); Kin1: KCM1 (gift from Dr. C. Walczak); Kin 2: KLP1 (generated in the laboratory); Dyn1: p150glued dynactin and Dyn2: p50 dynamitin (BD Transduction Laboratories).Cell Survival Assays and Combination Index—The sulforhodamine B (SRB) cytotoxicity assays were adapted from Skehan et al. (21Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8731) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated in triplicate on 96 well plates (2500 cells/well), and the next day 1:3 serial dilutions of the drug were made and added to the cells. Cells were incubated with drug for 72 h, after which cells were fixed for 1 h with 50% cold trichloroacetic acid. Plates were washed five times in water, air-dried, then stained with 0.4% SRB for 30 min. Plates were then washed four times in 1% acetic acid, air-dried, and bound SRB was dissolved in 10 mm unbuffered Tris base (pH 10.5). Plates were read in a microplate reader by measuring A564. The percent survival was then calculated based upon the absorbance values relative to untreated samples. The combination index method described in Ref. 24Chou T.C. Chou T.C. Rideout D.C. Synergism and Antagonism in Chemotherapy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 61-102Google Scholar was employed to determine the interaction between A1 and Taxol, and the data were analyzed using Calcusyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Briefly, the interaction of the two drugs was determined by calculating the CI as a function of the fraction affected (100 percent cell survival). A CI value of >1 is antagonism, = 1 is additivity, and <1 is synergy. Each CI value represents the mean of a least three independent experiments, whereby each data point was performed in triplicate.Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described (22Mabjeesh N.J. Escuin D. LaVallee T.M. Pribluda V.S. Swartz G.M. Johnson M.S. Willard M.T. Zhong H. Simons J.W. Giannakakou P. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 363-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). For tubulin staining an anti-α-tubulin antibody was used (Chemicon International, MAB1864; 1:500 dilution) and as a secondary antibody an Alexa 563-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG from Molecular Probes was used. Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta (Thornwood, NY) confocal microscope using either a ×63 (N.A. 1.4) or ×100 (N.A. 1.4) Apochromat objective. Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 510 software and processed in Adobe Photoshop 7.0.Flow Cytometry—For cell cycle analysis, cells were grown in 6-well plates and treated the next day. They were then scraped from plates using a rubber policeman, centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and 1 ml of propidium iodide buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide and Nonidet P-40 (0.6%) was used to resuspend cells. Cell were incubated in this buffer for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, passed through a filter to remove cell clumps, and read in a BD Biosciences flow cytometer.Western Blotting—1A9 ovarian carcinoma cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated the next day. Cells were lysed in TNES buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and supernatants were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (BCA assay was used to determine protein concentration). Protein was transferred (100 V for 1 h) and blotted with antibodies against PARP p85 (Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase-8 (Cell Signaling), and actin (Cell Signaling).Live Cell Imaging—MCF-7 cells stably transfected with GFP:tubulin (kind gift of Dr. Mary Ann Jordan) were imaged using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview spinning disc microscope mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope. A ×63 or ×100 Plan-Apochromat (N.A. = 1.4) was used to image cells, and the microscope was enclosed in a heating chamber (at 37 °C) and heated plate holder (at 37 °C) perfused with 5% CO2. Single image planes were acquired every 4 min with 2X2 binning and exposure times ranging from 300–600 ms.RESULTSHR22C16 Interacts with Eg5 but Not Other Microtubule-based Motor Proteins—The cell permeable small molecule inhibitor of cell division, HR22C16, was identified using a forward chemical genetic screen as previously described (18Hotha S. Yarrow J.C. Yang J.G. Garrett S. Renduchintala K.V. Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using in vitro assays it was previously shown that HR22C16 inhibits the mitotic kinesin, Eg5 with an IC50 of 800 ± 10 nm; however, it is not known if this compound binds and inhibits Eg5 specifically or if it also binds other microtubule motor proteins. Based on SAR (structure activity relationship) analysis (18Hotha S. Yarrow J.C. Yang J.G. Garrett S. Renduchintala K.V. Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we designed a strategy to link HR22C16 to a solid-support compatible with affinity chromatography. HR22C16 was linked via an introduced terminal amine to Affi-Gel 10 resin (Fig. 1A). To assess whether HR22C16-beads bind Eg5, we incubated these beads with vertebrate cell-free extracts in the presence or absence of soluble HR22C16-amine. As shown in Fig. 1B, Eg5 was present in the bead-bound fractions confirming that Eg5 did indeed interact with the HR22C16 beads. Furthermore Western blot analysis of the flow-through (Fig. 1C) indicated that incubation with HR22C16 beads depleted Eg5 from the extract. The bulk of both the Eg5 binding and depletion was prevented when extracts were preincubated with 200 μm soluble HR22C16-amine, indicating these observations were in fact caused by Eg5 interaction with the small molecule, rather than nonspecific absorption by the beads. In contrast, when we examined a number of other microtubule-based motors important for cell division by Western blotting, they were neither significantly depleted by HR22C16 beads nor was there any effect on their relative protein levels in the flow-through in the presence or absence of soluble HR22C16 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that HR22C16 binds to Eg5 and does not interact with other motor proteins that play key roles in cell division.HR22C16 and Its Analogs Have Antiproliferative Activity Against Both Taxol-resistant and -sensitive Cancer Cell Lines— Taxanes are one the most effective classes of anticancer agents with activity against a broad range of solid tumors; however, their clinical success has been limited because of acquired drug resistance (5Orr G.A. Verdier-Pinard P. McDaid H. Horwitz S.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7280-7295Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has established a model of Taxol resistance consisting of the parental Taxol-sensitive 1A9 human ovarian carcinoma cells and their Taxol-resistant counterparts, PTX10 and PTX22 cell lines. These cells are ∼25-fold resistant to Taxol because of acquired mutations in the Taxol binding site (7Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.K. Zhan Z. Buters J.T. Fojo T. Poruchynsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17118-17125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To test the efficacy of the Eg5 inhibitors, HR22C16 and two of its analogs (A1 and E1) (18Hotha S. Yarrow J.C. Yang J.G. Garrett S. Renduchintala K.V. Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in these Taxol-resistant cell lines, we performed 72-h antiproliferative assays. Our results (Table I) show that all Eg5 inhibitors tested, including the first generation Eg5 inhibitor monastrol, are active against the Taxol-resistant cell lines, with relative resistance values ranging from 1.8–3.2-fold, in contrast to 21-fold resistance to Taxol. Furthermore, we show that the HR22C16 analog, A1, was the most effective antiproliferative agent, having an IC50 of 0.8 ± 0.1 μm and 2.3 ± 0.3 μm in 1A9 cells and PTX10 cells, respectively. These IC50 values are ∼30-fold lower than monastrol (62 ± 5.6 μm in 1A9 and 57 ± 5.6 μm in PTX10) and ∼3-fold lower than HR22C16. Overall, these results demonstrate that Eg5 inhibitors effectively inhibit cell growth in both Taxol-resistant and Taxol-sensitive cancer cells.Table IRelative resistance of Taxol-resistant cells to Eg5 inhibitors1A9PTX10PTX22Relative resistanceHR22C162.5 ± 0.3 μm8.0 ± 0.4 μm7.7 ± 0.6 μm3.2 (3.1)A10.8 ± 0.1 μm2.3 ± 0.3 μm2.2 ± 0.3 μm2.8 (2.8)E12.5 ± 0.4 μm7.3 ± 0.5 μm8.1 ± 0.7 μm2.9 (3.2)Monastrol31 ± 2.4 μm62 ± 5.6 μm57 ± 6.1 μm2.0 (1.8)Taxol1.1 ± 0.2 nM23 ± 2.3 nM24 ± 2.9 nM20.9 (22) Open table in a new tab We next wanted to test if the most potent Eg5 inhibitor, A1, was also effective in cells that are resistant to Taxol because of overexpression of the drug efflux pump, PgP. Thus we used the ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780-AD10 (derived from 1A9 cells), which overexpresses PgP and is resistant to Taxol treatment (23Safrit J.T. Berek J.S. Bonavida B. Gynecol Oncol. 1993; 48: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our results (Table II) show that A1 retains its activity against the A2780-AD10 cells, displaying only a 2.4-fold relative resistance as compared with the parental 1A9 cells. In contrast, Taxol loses activity by at least 750-fold against the PgP-overexpressing A2780-AD10 cells. Furthermore, the mitotic index of A2780-AD10 cells following overnight treatment with 1 μm A1 was 62 ± 6.9%, whereas Taxol had no effect (mitotic index 3 ± 0.5%). This result demonstrates Eg5 inhibitors are effective in PgP-overexpressing cells suggesting that A1 is not a PgP substrate, and A1 activity is unaffected by taxane resistance caused by PgP overexpression.Table IIRelative resistance and mitotic index of the PgP- overexpressing cell line, A2780-AD10, treated with Taxol or A11A9A2780-AD10Relative resistanceMitotic index of A2780-AD10%Taxol1.2 ± 0.3 nM> 900 nM>7503 ± 0.5A11.25 ± 0.25 μm2.95 ± 0.65 μm2.462 ± 6.9 Open table in a new tab The Antiproliferative Activity of A1 Is Caused By Mitotic Arrest Followed by Apoptotic Cell Death—To confirm that the enhanced antiproliferative activity of A1 was reflected in its antimitotic activity, we quantitated the number of cells displaying monoastral spindles at various doses of both A1 and monastrol. We observed that 0.75 μm A1 resulted in ∼10% of cells with monopolar spindles and that this effect was dose-dependent up until 10 μm, where nearly 85% of all cells had monopolar spindles (Fig. 2A). In comparison, 7.0 μm monastrol was necessary to produce only 5% of all cells having monopolar spindles, and it took 25 μm monastrol to give nearly 70% of all cells having monopolar spindles. Thus, A1 has greater antimitotic and antiproliferative activity compared with monastrol. These results show a tight correlation between the antimitotic and the cytotoxic effects of the Eg5 inhibitors. Since the HR22C16 analog, A1, displayed the most potent antiproliferative activity among all Eg5 inhibitors used here, we continued our mechanistic studies using this compound.Fig. 2A1 treatment (1 μm) induces mitotic arrest and cell death in Taxol-sensitive (1A9) and -resistant (PTX10) ovarian cancer cells.

D, percentage of monoastral spindles induced by A1 or Taxol in 1A9 and PTX10 cells following a 16 h treatment with the different drug concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To precisely characterize the mechanism by which A1 induces cell death in Taxol-sensitive and -resistant 1A9 and PTX10 cells we first analyzed A1 effects on interphase and mitotic microtubules by confocal microscopy. As expected, untreated mitotic cells displayed normal bipolar metaphase spindles, with chromosomes aligned along the metaphase plate (Fig. 2B). In contrast, treatment of 1A9 and PTX10 cells with 1 μm A1 (∼IC50 from 72 h antiproliferative assay) for 16 h resulted in the formation of monopolar spindles that were accompanied by a ring of chromosomes (Fig. 2B) This phenotype is indicative of Eg5 inhibition since cells are unable to form a normal bipolar spindle when Eg5 is non-functional. Furthermore, there were no detectable effects on interphase microtubules in both 1A9 and PTX10 cells (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with the fact that Eg5 functions only in spindle assembly. Similar results were observed in PTX22 cells (data not shown).Our data shown in Table I demonstrate that A1 is equally effective against both 1A9 and PTX10 cells. We wanted to extend these observations to determine if A1 had similar Eg5 inhibitory activity in 1A9 and PTX10 cells, by quantitating the number of monopolar spindles produced in both cell lines at a range of doses. As shown in Fig. 2D, A1 induced a similar number of monopolar spindles in 1A9 and PTX10 cells at all concentrations tested. Thus, A1 is equally effective at inducing mitotic arrest in Taxol-resistant and -sensitive cell lines, suggesting that it is an effective antimitotic inhibitor in both cell lines. In contrast, Taxol was only effective in inducing aberrant mitotic spindles in 1A9 cells but lost efficacy in PTX10 cells, consistent with the Taxol-resistant phenotype of these cells.To further examine the effects of A1 on mitotic arrest and apoptosis we employed live cell confocal imaging, which provides high spatiotemporal resolution of dynamic events. We imaged MCF-7 breast cancer cells stably expressing GFP-tubulin to observe microtubule spindle formation and cell division in untreated or A1-treated (1 μm) cells. In untreated cells, microtubules formed a normal bipolar spindle, underwent anaphase, and cytokinesis within minutes upon entry in mitosis (see Supplemental Movie 1). In contrast, A1-treated cells were unable to form a bipolar spindle, and microtubules formed a monoastral configuration (n = 5). Specifically, a representative experiment (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Movie 2) shows two cells that were imaged 1 h after 1 μm A1 treatment. The cell on the left already has an A1-induced monopolar spindle and apoptosis is initiated at t = 100 and continues through t = 320 min (arrows indicating membrane blebbing). The cell on the right is imaged at interphase (t = 0) and begins to form a microtubule aster at t = 8 min. By t = 24 min the nuclear envelope has broken down, indicating chromosome condensation, (nucleus = N) and a monopolar spindle is observed. However, unlike control cells a bipolar spindle cannot be formed because of Eg5 inhibition by A1, and the monopolar configuration remains throughout the time lapse (t = 320 min).Fig. 3Time course analysis of A1 treatment (1 μm) on microtubule spindle formation and apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2094714357,"Fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4) is an integral membrane protein expressed in the plasma and internal membranes of the small intestine and adipocyte as well as in the brain, kidney, liver, skin, and heart. FATP4 has been hypothesized to be bifunctional, exhibiting both fatty acid transport and acyl-CoA synthetase activities that work in concert to mediate fatty acid influx across biological membranes. To determine whether FATP4 is an acyl-CoA synthetase, the murine protein was engineered to contain a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag, expressed in COS1 cells via adenovirus-mediated infection and purified to near homogeneity using α-FLAG affinity chromatography. Kinetic analysis of the enzyme was carried out for long chain (palmitic acid, C16:0) and very long chain (lignoceric acid, C24:0) fatty acids as well as for ATP and CoA. FATP4 exhibited substrate specificity for C16:0 and C24:0 fatty acids with a Vmax/Km (C16:0)/Vmax/Km (C24:0) of 1.5. Like purified FATP1, FATP4 was insensitive to inhibition by triacsin C but was sensitive to feedback inhibition by acyl-CoA. Although purified FATP4 exhibited high levels of palmitoyl-CoA and lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activity, extracts from the skin and intestine of FATP4 null mice exhibited reduced esterification for C24:0, but not C16:0 or C18:1, suggesting that in vivo, defects in very long chain fatty acid uptake may underlie the skin disorder phenotype of null mice.

Studies in multiple tissue types, including cardiomyocytes and adipocytes (1Luiken J.J. Schaap F.G. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. van der Vusse G.J. Bonen A. Glatz J.F. Lipids. 1999; 34: S169-S175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), support the hypothesis that fatty acid transport occurs by a saturable, protein-mediated mechanism, and several candidate proteins responsible for fatty acid uptake have been identified. These include the fatty acid-binding protein from the plasma membrane (FABPPM) 1The abbreviations used are: FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; FAT/CD36, fatty acid translocase/CD36 antigen; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; C12E8, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether.1The abbreviations used are: FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; FATP, fatty acid transport protein; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; FAT/CD36, fatty acid translocase/CD36 antigen; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; C12E8, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether. and the fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), as well as the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) family of molecules (reviewed in Ref. 2Frohnert B.I. Bernlohr D.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, FATP isoforms 1-6 have been identified based on sequence similarities and have distinct tissue-specific distributions of expression (3Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). When expressed into cultured cells, FATP1 increases fatty acid import and stimulates triacylglycerol synthesis (4Hatch G.M. Smith A.J. Xu F.Y. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that the FATP homologue in yeast (Fat1p) is required for fatty acid uptake (5Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in cells with compromised de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. In yeast, Fat1p functions in concert with acyl-CoA synthetases (Faa1p and/or Faa4p) to mediate fatty acid influx (6Faergeman N.J. Black P.N. Zhao X.D. Knudsen J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol.

Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated that purified FATP1 possesses intrinsic acyl-CoA synthetase activity directed to both long and very long chain fatty acids (8Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Watkins and colleagues (9Pei Z. Fraisl P. Berger J. Jia Z. Forss-Petter S. Watkins P.A. J. Biol.

These results suggest that the acyl-CoA synthetase and transport functions of FATPs might be separable functions. Indeed, Black and colleagues (10Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have identified yeast FAT1 mutants that are deficient in either transport or acyl-CoA synthetase activity or both. However, the S250A mutant of murine FATP1, as well as multiple yeast FAT1 mutants lacking acyl-CoA synthetase, activity exhibits greatly diminished fatty acid influx, supporting the hypothesis that fatty acid uptake into cells is linked, at least in part, to their esterification with coenzyme A in a process termed vectoral acylation (11Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M.

The importance of FATP4 in fatty acid utilization has been illustrated through the use of ablated mice, which display extreme phenotypes linked to skin biology. FATP4 loss of function due to either a spontaneous transposon insertion in exon 3 or to targeted disruption of exon 3 results in mice with a phenotype reminiscent of restrictive dermopathy (13Moulson C.L.

These animals die shortly after birth and have tight, wrinkle-free skin and disrupted skin barrier function. There may be additional phenotypes linked to fat absorption in the intestine (15Gimeno R.E. Hirsch D.J. Punreddy S. Sun Y. Ortegon A.M. Wu H. Daniels T. Stricker-Krongrad A. Lodish H.F. Stahl A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49512-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but these have not been examined in detail. Moreover, polymorphisms in the human FATP4 locus have been linked to the development of insulin resistance, suggesting that this protein may be a major contributor to lipid uptake in the adipocyte as well (16Gertow K. Pietilainen K.H. Yki-Jarvinen H. Kaprio J. Rissanen A. Eriksson P. Hamsten A. Fisher R.M. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1118-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Gertow K. Bellanda M.

The objective of the study was to determine whether FATP4 is an acyl-CoA synthetase, to assess the substrate specificity and intrinsic catalytic efficacy of the purified protein, and to compare those properties to FATP1 in order to determine whether fatty acid transport proteins have similar or discretely definable catalytic properties. To that end, murine FATP4 was engineered to contain a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag, expressed in COS1 cells, and purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Herein we present data characterizing FATP4 as a high velocity enzyme with specificity for long and very long chain fatty acids as well as the acyl-CoA synthetase activity of tissues from wild type and FATP4 ablated mice, suggesting that in vivo, the transport and/or acyl-CoA synthetase activity for very long chain fatty acids is critical for FATP4 function. Reagents—[3H]Palmitic acid and [3H]lignoceric acid were obtained from American Radiochemicals Company. All non-labeled fatty acid was obtained from NuChek Prep, Inc. (Elysian, MN). Triacsin C was obtained from Biomol. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma. Dr. Paul Watkins (Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD) kindly provided the anti-FATP4 antibody. Generation of FATP4 Recombinant Adenovirus and Expression in COS1 Cells—A recombinant adenovirus expressing both green fluorescent protein and murine FATP4 was constructed by recombination in Escherichia coli using the methods described by He et al. (18He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was recombined into pADEasy in E. coli BJ5183 cells recreating the replication-deficient adenovirus genome. Linear constructs of the recombinant adenovirus were transfected (Lipofectamine, Invitrogen) into 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) to allow packaging and amplification of the adenovirus. Large scale adenovirus preparations from 20 10-cm plates of infected cells were propagated until ∼50% of the cells lysed. The cells and media were collected, and the remaining cells lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles. The medium was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cellular debris, and the supernatant containing virus particles was recovered and frozen in aliquots at -70 °C. For protein expression, COS1 cells were plated in 10-cm plates and grown to ∼80% confluence at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For infection, the effective concentration of infectious adenoviral particles was experimentally determined by monitoring green fluorescent protein expression and COS1 cell viability at 72 h postinfection. Adenovirus particles that yielded ∼90-100% infection were delivered in 8 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum per plate. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, cells were harvested by centrifugation, immediately frozen, and stored at -70 °C. Affinity Purification of Recombinant FATP4 Protein—COS1 cells expressing FATP4-Flag were thawed in buffer A (150 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 150 mm NaCl), subjected to five freeze/thaw cycles, and solubilized with 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) for 4 h at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was separated from debris by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and recovered, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%. For purification of recombinant FATP4-Flag, α-FLAG matrix beads (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A were incubated with the protein extract for 6 h, washed, and eluted with FLAG peptide in buffer A containing 0.1% DDM. Eluates were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at -70 °C until use. To determine the amount of purified protein, samples were precipitated (19Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal.

Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase Assays—Samples were assayed for acyl-CoA synthetase activity by the conversion of [3H]palmitate or [3H]lignocerate to their CoA derivatives by a method modified from Nagamatsu et al.

All kinetic studies reported used 0.5-2 μg of purified FATP4 for 2 min at pH 7.5 and 30 mm NaCl in 250 μl of a buffer containing 20 μm fatty acid delivered bound to α-cyclodextrin, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm CoA, and 200 μm dithiothreitol. The addition of enzyme purified in the presence of 0.1% DDM resulted in a final concentration of 0.02% DDM in all standard assays. Reactions were terminated with the addition of 1.25 ml of isopropenol:heptane:H2SO4 (40:10:1, v/v/v), 0.5 ml of H2O, and 0.75 ml of heptane to facilitate organic phase separation. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with 0.75 ml of heptane to remove unreacted fatty acids, and radioactivity was determined by liquid phase scintillation counting. The enzyme activity was stable in the elution buffer, and activity was retained for 2 months without significant loss of activity when stored at -70 °C. Stability of Purified FATP4 in DDM-Detergent Micelles—Purified FATP4 was thawed on ice, maintained at either 4 or 37 °C for various lengths of time, and then assayed for acyl-CoA synthetase activity at 37 °C with [3H]lignoceric acid. The zero time point represents assayed activity immediately after thawing. Competition Studies—Because of the unavailability of commercially radiolabeled fatty acids, the fatty acid substrate specificity of the purified FATP4 was determined indirectly by a competitive enzymatic inhibition by the addition of unlabeled fatty acids at a constant concentration of 15 μm in the reaction in addition to either [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]lignoceric acid. A selectivity series for fatty preference was generated by determining the fraction of acyl-CoA synthetase activity at 1/2 [S]max. Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity in Murine Tissues—Tissues from FATP4 null mice (11Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Bennett N.E. Schaffer J.E. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 285-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (intestine, liver, lung, brain, and skin) were excised from killed newborn mice, weighed, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were ground to a fine homogenate in a glass homogenizer in a total volume of 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture P 8340 (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. All mouse procedures were in compliance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committees and in accordance with governmental guidelines. Previous studies in crude extracts from cells over-expressing FATP4 have suggested that the protein is an acyl-CoA synthetase (21Coe N.R. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To determine whether FATP4 exhibits intrinsic fatty acid CoA synthetase activity and to kinetically assess the properties of such a reaction, murine FATP4 was purified and studied. To facilitate purification, FATP4 was C-terminally tagged with a FLAG epitope and over-expressed in COS1 cells by a recombinant adenoviral infection method. To obtain FATP4 protein in a highly purified form that retains biological activity, membranes were extracted with a variety of different detergents, and solubilized protein and acyl-CoA synthetase activity were compared. Fig. 1A shows the immunoblotting analysis of the membranes extracted with different detergents. Extraction of membranes with 1% DDM solubilized FATP4 from COS1 to the greatest extent in comparison with the other detergents tested. The degree of FATP4 solubilization obtained for each detergent was generally proportional to the acyl-CoA synthetase activity (Fig. 1B) with the exception of C12E8. Although the extractable activity obtained with C12E8 was high, the amount of enzyme obtained was relatively low; as such, DDM was chosen for further analyses. Purification involved detergent extraction of FATP4 from the membrane with 1% DDM and chromatography through α-FLAG-agarose resin. Fig. 1C presents the SDS-PAGE analysis of pooled elution fractions collected during a typical FATP4 purification, along with the corresponding immunoblotting analysis with α-FATP4 antibody. The purified FATP4 migrated as a single band on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and was judged to be at least ∼80% pure by silver staining. The level of murine FATP4 enrichment obtained from the α-FLAG column purification was ∼2000-fold as assessed by comparison of the specific activity of the crude cell fraction with the eluted fraction (Table I).Table IFATP4 purification profileStepVolumeProteinSpecific activityPurificationmlmg/mlnmol/min/mg-foldCrude extract3.7515.80.34 ± 0.011Detergent-soluble3.7510.30.6 ± 0.11.8α-FLAG elution5.00.005723 ± 682125 Open table in a new tab Previous studies on FATP1 have demonstrated that Triton X-100 has an inhibitory effect on its acyl-CoA synthetase activity (8Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), presumably due to sequestration of the substrates into detergent micelles. To determine whether FATP4 acyl-CoA synthetase activity was sensitive to DDM, purified enzyme was assayed with increasing concentrations detergent. FATP4 acyl-CoA synthetase activity was sensitive to DDM in the reaction buffer, with both C16:0 and C24:0 acyl-CoA synthetase activity decreasing with increasing DDM concentration (Fig. 2A). The activity of FATP4 was found to be relatively insensitive to DDM below 0.03% DDM; as such, a final concentration of 0.02% DDM was adopted for all assays. To test the stability of purified FATP4 in DDM-detergent micelles, purified FATP4 was thawed on ice, maintained at either 4 or 37 °C for various times, and then assayed for acyl-CoA synthetase activity (Fig. 2B). Purified FATP4 in DDM micelles retained activity at 4 °C for up to 1 h but lost activity quickly when maintained at 37 °C. The FATP4 acyl-CoA synthetase activity was optimized with respect to several standard reaction parameters using palmitate as the substrate (Fig. 3), although some studies were also conducted with lignocerate (results not shown). Previous studies using FATP1 (8Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) had shown that the enzymatic parameters for esterification of C16:0 fatty acid are the same for C24:0 fatty acid. As shown in Fig. 3, the activity, as well as time of reaction, was proportional to the amount of enzyme added to the reaction (Fig. 3A) (Fig. 3B). In addition, the pH sensitivity of the reaction was evaluated (Fig. 3C), as was the influence of ionic strength (Fig. 3D). The purified FATP4 has broad pH dependence with 7.0-8.5 being generally optimal, and enzymatic activity was sensitive to the NaCl concentration when varied from 30 to 500 mm. Synthetase activity was modestly activated at lower ionic strength and then was inhibited at a salt concentration in excess of 300 mm. The fatty acid esterification properties of purified FATP4 were measured for two model lipid substrates as well as for CoA and ATP. The apparent Km values of the purified enzyme were determined for palmitic acid (C16:0), lignoceric acid (C24: 0), ATP, and CoA at 37 °C (Fig. 4). FATP4 demonstrated high affinity toward its substrates and co-substrates, exhibiting a Km of 13 μm for C16:0, 4.8 μm for C24:0, 1.4 mm for ATP, and 47 μm for CoA (Table II). It should be stressed that because these studies were done in the presence of detergent, using lipid delivered via α-cyclodextrin-mediated solubilization, the free unbound concentration of fatty acids could not be determined, and the Km values reported for each fatty acid represent apparent values assuming all lipid was available to the enzyme. Since the solubility of lignoceric acid and palmitic acid vary greatly, this assumption is likely to be incorrect, but it represents an experimentally tractable method for analyzing the data and comparing one enzyme with another. The maximal specific activity of ∼4300 nmol/min/mg was measured for C16:0 and ∼1050 nmol/min/mg for C24:0, which were 40- and 5-fold greater, respectively, than those measured for purified FATP1 (8Hall A.M.

Open table in a new tab Because a large number of different fatty acids are not commercially available in radiolabeled form, the fatty acid substrate specificity of the purified FATP4 was determined indirectly by a competitive enzymatic inhibition by the addition of unlabeled fatty acids in the reaction in addition to either [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]lignoceric acid (Fig. 5). Esterification of labeled lignoceric acid was inhibited only slightly by the addition of two 15 μm long chain fatty acids, C16:0 and C20:4. In contrast, the conversion of [3H]palmitate to palmitoyl-CoA was decreased by the addition of very long chain fatty acids with the rank order of C24:0 = C20:0 > C16:0. As with the other kinetic analysis, because of the differing solubilities of the various competing fatty acids, true Ki values could not be determined, and a simple selectivity series is presented. As such, these results suggest that the true Km value for lignoceric acid is quite low and that the enzyme is much more specific for very long chain than for long chain fatty acid. Reports of the cellular concentration of long chain acyl-CoA esters vary between 5 and 160 μm (5Faergeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine whether FATP4 is regulated by feedback inhibition, increasing concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA were titrated into the standard reaction conditions (Fig. 6A), and the activity of was FATP4 evaluated. At a concentration of 10 μm palmitoyl-CoA, the FATP4 acyl-CoA synthetase reaction was inhibited by ∼35%, whereas 100 μm inhibited the reaction by more than 90% for both C16:0 and C24:0. Triacsin C has been reported to be a potent competitive inhibitor of ACSL1 and ACSL4 (22Kim J.H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) but does not inhibit FATP1 (8Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To test whether triacsin C inhibits purified FATP4, various concentrations were added to the standard reaction mixture (Fig. 6B), and the conversion of C16:0 and C24:0 to their CoA derivatives was evaluated. Surprisingly, triacsin C had no effect on FATP4 acyl-CoA synthetase activity toward C24:0 esterification but inhibited C16:0 esterification in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of ∼30 μm. Troglitazone inhibition of CoA synthetase activity paralleled the result with triacsin C; C24:0 esterification was unaffected by concentrations up to 50 μm and inhibited C16:0 conversion with an IC50 of ∼20 μm (Fig. 6C). These results are consistent with the proposal that FATP4 is more specific for very long chain fatty acid esterification than for long chain esterification. The phenotype of FATP4 null mice suggests defects in lipid uptake and/or metabolism. To evaluate the relevance of the FATP4 acyl-CoA synthetase activity to the phenotype of the null mice, the esterification of a variety of long chain and very long chain fatty acid was evaluated in extracts from FATP4 null mice (Fig. 7). Although the C16:0 esterification activity of purified FATP4 exceeded that for C24:0, there were no statistically significant changes in palmitic or oleic acid esterification measured in any tissue. This is likely due to the presence of other acyl-CoA synthetases capable of C16:0 esterification in the crude extract. In contrast, esterification of C24:0 was significantly decreased in the intestine, brain, and skin samples from the FATP4 null mice when compared with wild type littermates but was identical in the liver and lung samples, where additional FATP family members are expressed (3Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the in vitro characterization of FATP4 activity and strongly suggest that in vivo the loss of FATP4-mediated very long chain fatty acid uptake and/or esterification may underlie the null phenotype. The FATP family of proteins was originally identified by its ability to facilitate fatty acid uptake using a fluorescent fatty acid internalization assay (23Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mammalian FATP family members have been shown to catalyze fatty acid uptake using a variety of assays in multiple systems including evaluation in stable cell lines, transient transfection into 293, COS, or CHO cells, and complementation of deletions in the yeast orthologue (3Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 4Hatch G.M. Smith A.J. Xu F.Y. Hall A.M. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Dirusso C.C. Connell E.J. Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Hansen J.K. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the purified FATP1 is an acyl-CoA synthetase and, based on work from the yeast system, has been postulated to function in a process termed vectoral acylation. Vectoral acylation links CoA-dependent esterification of fatty acids to their influx, thereby trapping the internalized lipid, preventing its diffusion or transport from the cell. It is unclear whether FATPs facilitate both transbilayer movement of fatty acids and esterification or simply the esterification of a fatty acid that has diffused across the membrane. In yeast, Fat1p functions in concert with Faa1 and/or Faa4p to facilitate fatty acid uptake. However, yeast FAT1 mutants have been identified with separable transport and esterification activity, suggesting that the mammalian FATP family, if functioning similarly, may also be bifunctional (10Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This hypothesis does not exclude the participation of other proteins such as CD36, which may function as a fatty acid receptor presenting a high local concentration of fatty acid at the plasma membrane, or ACSL1, another acyl-CoA synthetase, which collectively may work in concert with FATP. Vectoral acylation, therefore, is a functional parallel to the glucose transport-hexokinase system in sugar import. The objective of our present study was to evaluate the enzymatic properties of FATP4 and to set the stage for future analysis of the protein in facilitating transbilayer movement. Molecular and genetic analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has indicated that vectoral acylation is mediated by some combination of Fat1p and either Faa1p or Faa4p. Since both FAT1 and the FAA genes encode acyl-CoA synthetases, it is not clear what the biochemical role of each protein may be or if one enzyme (FAA genes) is specific for one class of fatty acid (long chain fatty acid) while another (FAT1) is more specific for very long chain fatty acid. Alternatively, Fat1p may catalyze transbilayer movement of the fatty acid, whereas Faap forms may catalyzes CoA-dependent esterification. It will be interesting in the future to compare the biochemical properties of the purified yeast Fat1p with yeast Faa proteins and the mammalian FATP family members or to assess their acyl-CoA synthetase activity and specificity. The mammalian system is less well defined, and although FATP1 and ACSL1 have been co-localized to some regions of the plasma membrane, biochemical evidence demonstrating their association under physiological conditions has not been forthcoming. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the catalytic properties of the FATP4 acyl-CoA synthetase reaction. Here we demonstrate that in vitro purified FATP4 has a robust acyl-CoA synthetase activity with moderate specificity for long chain fatty acids over very long chain fatty acids. FATP4 is a high velocity enzyme comparable with ACSL1, the traditional enzyme believed to esterify fatty acids broadly in cells. FATP4 prefers long chain fatty acid to very long chain fatty acids, although care must be taken to consider that this conclusion is based on kinetic evaluations that consider all of the substrates available to the enzyme. Given the differences in chemical solubility between C16:0 and C24:0, the ability to make absolute statements is tenuous at best. The kinetic properties of purified FATP4 protein are interesting when compared with those exhibited by ACSL1 purified similarly. Purified His-tagged ACSL1 demonstrated the expected high affinities toward C16:0, ATP, and CoA, with Km values of 33, 320, and 6.4 μm respectively (Table II). Interestingly, ACSL1 also utilized very long chain fatty acids (C24:0) with a Km of 18 μm. The maximal velocity of ACSL1 for C16:0 was about 3200 nmol/min/mg but was greatly reduced for C24:0 to 240 nmol/min/mg. Consistent with the reduced velocity for very long chain fatty acids, ACSL1 was 10-fold more active toward C16:0 than C24:0, as demonstrated by Vmax/Km values of 100 and 13, respectively. In contrast, FATP4 exhibited higher activity toward C16:0 and increased specificity for C16:0 (Vmax/Km of 330) over C24:0 (Vmax/Km of 220). For very long chain fatty acids, FATP4 was ∼5-fold more active than ACSL1, whereas the enzymes had comparable long chain fatty acid esterification activity. In general FATP4 is a more robust acyl-CoA synthetase than ACSL1. The availability of purified FATP4 (this work) and FATP1 (8Hall A.M. Smith A.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43008-43013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) allows a future biochemical analysis of FATP proteins in facilitating transbilayer movement independently of esterification. FATP4 demonstrates a preference for C16:0 over C24:0 in these in vitro studies. However, a number of experimental observations suggest that C24:0 may be the preferred substrate for FATP4 in vitro and in vivo. First, two fatty acid analogs, triacsin C and troglitazone, were effective inhibitors of C16:0, but not C24:0, esterification. Second, in competition studies, lignoceric acid could compete for C16:0 conversion; however, C16:0 did not inhibit C24:0 esterification. Finally, tissues from FATP4 null animals were only defective for C24:0 esterification, whereas C16:0 or C18:1 conversion was unaltered. Although the apparent Km values for C16:0 and C24:0 were essentially identical, these observations suggest that the actual Km value for C24:0 is much lower that that of C16:0. A comparative analysis of the two purified FATP proteins revealed significant differences between the enzymes. FATP4 is a high velocity acyl-CoA synthetase with preference for C24:0 over C16:0. Additionally, the FATP4 reaction is sensitive to a number of potential inhibitors including the product palmitoyl-CoA, and two fatty acid analogs, triacsin C and troglitazone. On the other hand, FATP1 is a comparatively low velocity enzyme with broad specificity for fatty acids of 16-24 carbons. The FATP1 reaction is insensitive to triacsin C and troglitazone but is subject to product inhibition. The relative abundance and cellular locations of FATP1 and FATP4 in adipocytes are not known. However, if both enzymes are located on the plasma membrane, based upon the relative velocities of the two enzymes, FATP4 may be the major contributor to vectoral acylation. This may explain the lack of effects on adipose tissue lipid metabolism observed in FATP1 null mice, where the major metabolic effect is centered in muscle (25Kim J.K. Gimeno R.E. Higashimori T. Kim H.J. Choi H. Punreddy S. Mozell R.L. Tan G. Stricker-Krongrad A. Hirsch D.J. Fillmore J.J. Liu Z.X. Dong J. Cline G. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Tissue extracts of the intestine, brain, and skin from FATP4 null mice exhibit reduced esterification for C24:0, but not C16:0 or C18:1, suggesting that in vivo the very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity of FATP4 contributes to the skin disorder phenotype of null mice. This conclusion is supported by lipid composition analysis of the FATP4 null mice. The epidermis of the FATP4 -/- mice had a reduced molar content of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesteryl ester but increased ceramide compared with wild type littermates. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the ceramide species demonstrated that the null mice had a significantly lower portion of very long chain fatty acids (C26:0 and C26:0-OH) and an increased proportion of fatty acids with less than 26 carbons. This shift to shorter chain fatty acids was also observed for phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine. The lack of effects in other tissues is likely because of the expression of other acyl-CoA synthetases, including FATP isoforms, in those cell types. In sum, these results demonstrate that FATP4 exhibits intrinsic acyl-CoA synthetase activity and is a high velocity enzyme relative to FATP1 and ACSL1. For long chain fatty acids, the FATP4 enzyme exhibits a Vmax/Km similar to ACSL1. This may suggest that ACS family members could functionally compensate for disruptions of FATP for some but not all lipid substrates. However, striking evidence from FATP4 null mice (14Herrmann T. van der Hoeven F. Grone H.J. Stewart A.F. Langbein L. Kaiser I. Liebisch G. Gosch I. Buchkremer F. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Stremmel W. J.

It is caused by mutations in the Golgi GDP-fucose transporter, resulting in a reduction of fucosylated antigens on the cell surface. A recent study using fibroblasts from LADII/CDGIIc patients suggested that although terminal fucosylation of N-glycans is reduced severely, protein O-fucosylation is generally unaffected (Sturla, L., Rampal, R., Haltiwanger, R. S., Fruscione, F., Etzioni, A., and Tonetti, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 26727–26733). A potential explanation for this phenomenon is that enzymes adding O-fucose to proteins localize to cell organelles other than the Golgi apparatus. In this study, we investigated the subcellular localization of protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (O-FucT-1), which is responsible for adding O-fucose to epidermal growth factor-like repeats. Our analysis reveals that, unlike all other known fucosyltransferases, O-FucT-1 is a soluble protein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, it appears that O-FucT-1 is retained in the ER by a KDEL-like sequence at its C terminus. Our results also suggest that enzymatic addition of O-fucose to proteins occurs in the ER, suggesting that a novel, ER-localized GDP-fucose transporter may exist. The fact that O-FucT-1 recognizes properly folded epidermal growth factor-like repeats, together with this unique localization, suggests that it may play a role in quality control.

Fucose is a common component of many N-linked and O-linked glycans found in glycoproteins in metazoans (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). It is involved in a variety of critical physiological processes, such as selectin-mediated leukocyte-endothelial adhesion (2Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), ABO blood type antigen determination (3Lowe J.B. Baillieres Clin.

Fucose modification is catalyzed by fucosyltransferases, all of which require GDP-fucose as the donor substrate and a glycan or protein as the acceptor substrate. Currently known fucosyltransferases in mammals can be classified into four groups based on the specific linkages formed and the substrates to which fucose is added (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B.

The first group includes the α2-fucosyltransferases that modify the terminal Gal moiety of lactosamine structures with α1,2-linked fucose (FUT1, -2). The second group is the α3/4-fucosyltransferases that add fucose in α1,3/4 linkage to the GlcNAc moiety of lactosamine structures (FUT3–7 and -9). α6 fucosyltransferase, which adds fucose in α1,6 linkage to the first GlcNAc of the N-glycan core, is the unique member of the third group (FUT8). Finally, the fourth group consists of protein O-fucosyltransferases 1 and 2 (O-FucT-1 1The abbreviations used are: O-FucT-1, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1; β4GalT, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; LADII/CDGIIc, leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II/congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIc; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TSRs, thrombospondin type 1 repeats; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F. and O-FucT-2), the most recent additions to the fucosyltransferase family. Sequence alignment reveals that the protein O-fucosyltransferases share a common ancestry with both α2- and α6-fucosyltransferases (6Martinez-Duncker I. Mollicone R. Candelier J.J. Breton C. Oriol R. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 1C-5CCrossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, O-FucT-1 and O-FucT-2 share several biochemical properties that distinguish them from other known fucosyltransferases (7Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W.

For instance, both enzymes catalyze the addition of fucose directly to a serine or threonine in proteins instead of to another sugar. For both enzymes, the modified serine or threonine occurs in the context of a cysteine knot motif, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats for O-FucT-1, and thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) for O-FucT-2. EGF repeats are defined by the presence of six conserved cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds in a specific pattern, C1–C3, C2–C4, C5–C6 (10Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The O-fucose modifies a serine or threonine adjacent to the third conserved cysteine within the consensus sequence C2X4–5(S/T)C3 (11Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). O-FucT-1 has been shown to add O-fucose to EGF-like repeats from a variety of proteins including the Notch receptor (12Haltiwanger R.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Reduction or elimination of O-FucT-1 levels using gene ablation in mice or interfering RNA or mutants in Drosophila suggests that O-FucT-1 is essential for Notch signaling (13Shi S. Stanley P. Proc.

In vitro binding studies suggest that the O-fucose plays an essential role in ligand binding, offering a potential explanation for the essential nature of O-FucT-1 (16Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). TSRs also contain six conserved cysteines forming three disulfide bonds in a distinct pattern, C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C4 (17Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although a consensus sequence for O-fucose in TSRs has been proposed (WX5C1X2/3S/TC2X2G) (18Gonzalez de Peredo A. Klein D. Macek B. Hess D. Peter-Katalinic J. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 11-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), little is known about the functional importance of this modification. The biological significance of fucosylation in humans has been made clear by studies of a rare autosomal recessive human disease called LADII (leukocyte adhesion deficiency)/CDGIIc (congenital disorder of glycosylation), which is characterized by leukocyte adhesion deficiency as well as severe neurological and developmental abnormalities (19Etzioni A.

The molecular defect in LADII/CDGIIc has been identified as mutations in the Golgi GDP-fucose transporter, resulting in decreased GDP-fucose levels in the Golgi lumen and, hence, reduction of fucosylated antigens on the cell surface (20Sturla L.

Because Notch signaling is critical to numerous developmental processes in mammals, we had speculated that the neurologic and developmental symptoms of LADII/CDGIIc patients might be linked to impaired Notch signaling because of insufficient GDP-fucose in the Golgi lumen (24Moloney D.J.

A recent study using fibroblasts from LADII/CDGIIc patients suggested that although terminal fucosylation of N-glycans is reduced severely, protein O-fucosylation is generally unaffected (26Sturla L. Rampal R. Haltiwanger R.S. Fruscione F. Etzioni A. Tonetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These authors (26Sturla L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) proposed two potential explanations for this surprising result. One possibility is that O-fucosyltransferases have higher affinity for GDP-fucose than those adding terminal fucose to N-glycans. Alternatively, it is possible that O-fucosyltransferases localize to subcellular compartments other than the Golgi apparatus with a different GDP-fucose transporter. Although O-FucT-1 has been proposed as a Golgi resident protein (9Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40338-40345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), no experimental evidence has been put forward to support this idea. Here we have examined the subcellular localization of O-FucT-1 protein and the EGF O-fucosylation reaction. Surprisingly, we found that O-FucT-1 is a soluble protein localized to the ER. Moreover, O-FucT-1 appears to catalyze the O-fucosylation reaction in the ER rather than in the Golgi apparatus. Materials—COS1 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Fractions from sucrose gradients of microsomes derived from rat liver were a kind gift from Drs. Michael Jadot (Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix) and Peter Lobel (Rutgers University). The procedures for preparation of the sucrose gradients were described previously (27Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Plasmid Construction—Constructs used for expressing human O-FucT-1 with or without the RDEF sequence were prepared as follows. For pSecTag-HIS6-O-FucT-1, sequences encoding the human O-FucT-1 amino acids 23–388 were amplified by PCR with 5′-primer (5′-CCCAAGCTTCCCATCATCATCATCATCATCCCGCGGGCTCCTGGGACCCG-3′, includes sequences encoding the His6 tag and a Hind III restriction site) and 3′-primer (5′-CGGGGGCCCTTAGAACTCGTCCCGCAGCTTAGG-3′, includes sequences encoding a stop codon and an ApaI site). For pSecTag-HIS6-O-FucT-1ΔRDEF, sequences encoding the O-FucT-1 amino acids 23–384 were amplified by PCR with the same 5′-primer but with the 3′-primer (5′-CGGGGGCCCTTACAGCTTAGGGGGCCTGTCCATG-3′, includes stop codon and ApaI site). The amplified fragments were then subcloned into the pSecTag2c expression vector (Invitrogen) between the Hind III and ApaI sites in-frame with the sequence encoding the signal peptide. All constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. Preparation of Soluble and Membrane Fractions from COS1 Cells— COS1 cells were grown to confluence, collected by scraping, and washed three times with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). The washed cells were resuspended in 1 ml of TBS with the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and sonicated using a probe sonicator (5 × 10-s bursts on ice) to homogenize the cells. The homogenate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was removed, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The pellet (membrane fraction) was solubilized with an equivalent volume of TBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and the protease inhibitor mixture. Immunofluorescent Staining—COS1 cells growing on coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection (24 h), cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then stained with mixtures of the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-His6 antibody (1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-calreticulin (1:500) (Stressgen); rabbit anti-His6 (1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-GM130 (1:100) (BD Biosciences). Alexa fluor 488- and 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at 1:100. Fluorescent images were collected using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Analysis of O-Fucosylation on Mouse Notch1 EGF29 –36 —Preparation of the plasmid encoding the EGF repeats 29–36 from mouse Notch1 with C-terminal Myc-His6 tags (pSecTag-EGF29–36), transfection, and metabolic radiolabeling with [3H]fucose is described elsewhere (11Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After transfection (24 h), COS1 cells were metabolically radiolabeled for another 24 h. The media were removed and stored. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing the protease inhibitor mixture. EGF29–36 was purified from the cell lysates by immunoprecipitation using a rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Abcam) and protein A-Sepharose, whereas EGF29–36 in the media was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described previously (11Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PNGase F digestion was performed on all the samples as described previously (24Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and endoglycosidase H (Roche Applied Science) digestion was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol. Western blots and fluorography were then performed as described (24Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence of COS1 cells expressing EGF29–36 was performed as described under Immunofluorescent Staining. Other Methods—β4GalT assays and O-fucosyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (9Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40338-40345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Endogenous O-FucT-1 Appears to Be a Soluble Protein in the ER—In the original report of O-FucT-1 purification, the enzyme was purified from a detergent-free extract of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (8Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein was performed, and the sequence was used to generate probes to isolate the gene encoding O-FucT-1 from a human heart cDNA library (9Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40338-40345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the predicted sequence of the human and mouse enzymes began ∼20 residues N-terminal to the sequence derived from the CHO cell enzyme (Fig. 1A). Originally, we believed that this region encoded a short cytoplasmic domain and a transmembrane sequence, typical of the type II membrane structure found in all known mammalian Golgi glycosyltransferases (29Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Proteolytic loss of such sequences during purification has been reported previously (30Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Re-examination of the N-terminal sequence from mouse and human O-FucT-1 using SMART (smart.emblheidelberg.de/) or other sequence analysis tools suggests that the previously predicted transmembrane sequence is actually a cleavable signal peptide (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the sequenced N terminus of purified O-FucT-1 begins at approximately the predicted cleavage site for the signal peptide (Fig. 1A). To confirm that O-FucT-1 is a soluble protein, COS1 cells were lysed by sonication, and the activity of O-FucT-1 was assayed in high speed supernatant and pellet fractions. The majority of O-FucT-1 activity was found in the supernatant (Fig. 1B). As a control, we also compared the enzyme activity of a known membrane-bound protein, β4GalT, and found the majority of its activity in the pellet fraction (Fig. 1B). These results strongly suggest that endogenous O-FucT-1 is a soluble protein. All known fucosyltransferases responsible for terminal fucose modification in N-linked glycans are believed to be localized to the Golgi, consistent with the localization of the GDP-fucose transporter (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 31Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 32Sousa V.L. Brito C. Costa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1675: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Milland J.

However, the subcellular localization of O-FucT-1 is still unclear. Interestingly, N-glycans in purified O-FucT-1 from CHO cells are mostly high mannose-type oligosaccharide chains, suggesting that this enzyme may be localized in either the ER or the cis-Golgi region (8Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the localization of endogenous O-FucT-1 by subcellular fractionation of rat liver. Rat liver microsomes were fractionated on a sucrose gradient and assayed for O-FucT-1 activity as well as markers for the ER (glucose-6-phosphatase) and the Golgi (β4GalT). The majority of the O-FucT-1 activity co-fractionates with the ER marker (glucose-6-phosphatase) but not with the Golgi marker (β4GalT1) (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that endogenous O-FucT-1 localizes to the ER. O-FucT-1 Homologues Have a C-terminal KDEL-like Sequence Retaining the Protein in the ER—Comparison of C-terminal amino acids residues from mouse, human, and Drosophila O-FucT-1 reveals the presence of KDEL-like ER retention/retrieval motifs in all three homologues (Fig. 2A) (34Murshid A. Presley J.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We generated the expression plasmids pSecTag-HIS6-O-FucT-1 and pSecTag-HIS6-O-FucT-1ΔRDEF, which encode N-terminal His6-tagged human O-FucT-1 with or without the KDEL-like motif, RDEF (Fig. 2B). These two plasmids as well as the empty pSecTag plasmid were transiently transfected into COS1 cells. Western blot analysis of the media and lysate from the transfected cells using the anti-His6 tag antibody revealed that the O-FucT-1 with the RDEF motif is largely retained in the cells, whereas the O-FucT-1 without the RDEF motif is largely secreted to the media (Fig. 2C). To preclude the possibility that the observed difference in secretion was due to some effect on protein folding by the RDEF sequence, we performed activity assays on the lysates of cells expressing O-FucT-1 and the media of cells expressing O-FucT-1ΔRDEF. Both HIS6-O-FucT-1 and HIS6-O-FucT-1ΔRDEF are active, indicating that O-FucT-1 is folded correctly and active despite the presence or absence of the RDEF motif (Fig. 2C). We then carried out immunofluorescent staining to determine the specific subcellular localization of HIS6-O-FucT-1 and HIS6-O-FucT-1ΔRDEF in COS1 cells. The two expression plasmids were transiently transfected into COS1 cells on coverslips followed by staining using the anti-His6 tag antibody along with either the ER marker anti-calreticulin antibody or the cis-Golgi marker anti-GM130 antibody. The HIS6-O-FucT-1 displays a perinuclear and reticular distribution characteristic of the ER, co-localizing with calreticulin but not with GM130 (Fig. 3, A–F). In contrast, deletion of RDEF results in a dramatic redistribution of cell-associated O-FucT-1 including loss of co-localization with the calreticulin (Fig. 3, G–I) and partial localization with the GM130 (Fig. 3, J–L). The redistribution caused by deletion of the RDEF motif was even more dramatically observed in the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 2C, demonstrating that the majority of HIS6-O-FucT-1ΔRDEF is secreted. Taken together, the results suggest that the C-terminal KDEL-like sequence functions as an ER retention/retrieval signal for O-FucT-1. Addition of O-Fucose to Proteins Appears to Occur in the ER—Because GDP-fucose transporter activity has only been reported in Golgi fractions (31Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), the localization of O-FucT-1 to the ER raised the question of where the addition of O-fucose to proteins occurs. To examine the subcellular site of O-fucosylation we used a previously reported plasmid encoding the EGF repeats 29–36 from mouse Notch1, with C-terminal Myc and His6 tags, that is secreted to the media (11Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We chose this fragment because it has two predicted N-glycan sites as well as five predicted O-fucose sites (Fig. 4A), and we have previously characterized its O-fucosylation (11Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although EGF29–36 is secreted to the media, some of the protein can also be isolated from cell lysates. Immunostaining of COS1 cells transiently transfected with the EGF29–36 plasmid demonstrated that cell-associated EGF29–36 co-localizes with the ER marker calreticulin but not with the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig. 4, B–G). This indicates that the vast majority of EGF29–36 within cells is in the ER. Control experiments demonstrated that more than 90% of the cell-associated EGF29–36 could be extracted from the cells using a radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (data not shown). To examine O-fucosylation of EGF29–36, we metabolically radiolabeled COS1 cells expressing EGF29–36 with [3H]fucose. Media and cells were separated, and EGF29–36 was purified from both (see “Experimental Procedures”). Samples were digested with endoglycosidase H and PNGase F to evaluate the processing state of the attached N-glycans. Western blot and fluorographic analysis demonstrated that EGF29–36 retained in the cells is sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, whereas secreted EGF29–36 is resistant (Fig. 4H, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). This is consistent with the immunofluorescent staining data (Fig. 4, B–D) suggesting that cell-associated EGF29–36 is ER-localized. Surprisingly, the protein from the cells is still modified with [3H]fucose following endoglycosidase H digestion, suggesting that the ER form of the protein is modified with O-fucose (Fig. 4H, lane 2). EGF29–36 from both cells and media was sensitive to PNGase F digestion as expected. Digestion of EGF29–36 from media with PNGase F showed a significant reduction in the amount of [3H]fucose associated with the protein (Fig. 4H, compare lane 7 with lane 8) suggesting the presence of fucose in N-glycans being released by PNGase F. This is consistent with the fucosylation of N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus, which is well known (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 31Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 32Sousa V.L. Brito C. Costa J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1675: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Milland J. Taylor S.G. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12012-12018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, comparison of the stoichiometry of fucosylation after removal of the N-glycans with PNGase F (compare lane 4 with lane 8, Fig. 4H) shows similar levels of [3H]fucose incorporated (based on fluorography) into similar amounts of protein (based on the Western blot). Because the vast majority of the cell-associated EGF29–36 is in the ER (based on immunofluorescence, Fig. 4, B–D, and endoglycosidase H sensitivity, Fig. 4H, lanes 1 and 2), these results strongly suggest that O-fucosylation occurs in the ER. The recent studies on fucosylation in LADII/CDGIIc patients raised the intriguing question of how fucosylation of N-glycans could be almost completely eliminated whereas O-fucosylation remained unaffected (26Sturla L. Rampal R. Haltiwanger R.S. Fruscione F. Etzioni A. Tonetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together with the previous report that O-FucT-1 bears N-glycans sensitive to endoglycosidase H (consistent with an ER or cis-Golgi localization) these results motivated us to examine the localization of O-FucT-1 in more detail. Using subcellular fractionation, we found that endogenous O-FucT-1 is a soluble protein localized in the ER. We next showed that the C-terminal KDEL-like motif (RDEF) of O-FucT-1 is responsible for retaining the protein in the ER. Immunofluorescent staining clearly demonstrated that expressed O-FucT-1 with the RDEF motif co-localizes with the ER marker calreticulin. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some O-FucT-1 might localize within the Golgi, the amount appears to be relatively insignificant. Removal of the RDEF domain causes a dramatic change in O-FucT-1 localization. The majority of O-FucT-1ΔRDEF is secreted, and the small amount still associated with cells no longer co-localizes with calreticulin. These results strongly suggest that RDEF functions as an ER retention/retrieval signal. We next addressed where O-FucT-1 catalyzes the O-fucosylation reaction. It is reasonable to speculate that the reaction occurs in the same compartment as the bulk of the enzyme, but this is in conflict with the fact that GDP-fucose transporter activity has historically been associated with the Golgi apparatus (31Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining of COS1 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding mouse Notch1 EGF29–36 revealed that the vast majority of cell-associated EGF29–36 is localized to the ER. The N-glycans in this protein were sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion, consistent with the ER localization. Surprisingly, this protein was also modified with O-fucose. Similar levels of fucosylation in EGF29–36 from cells (ER-localized) and from the media indicated that O-fucosylation occurs in the ER. It is possible that EGF29–36 could be O-fucosylated in the cis-Golgi and cycle back to the ER. This possibility would require that the bulk of EGF29–36 localized to the ER have already cycled through the cis-Golgi. Because EGF29–36 is being secreted and the net flow of the protein is through the Golgi, we think that this possibility is unlikely. Thus, we conclude that O-FucT-1 catalyzes the O-fucosylation reaction in the ER in contrast to all other known forms of fucosylation, which occur in trans-Golgi or the trans-Golgi network (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). GDP-fucose is the donor substrate for all known fucosyltransferases, including O-FucT-1 (1Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). GDP-fucose is synthesized in the cytoplasm and is known to be transported into the Golgi lumen by a GDP-fucose transporter (31Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In order for O-FucT-1 to catalyze O-fucosylation in the ER lumen, some mechanism must exist that facilitates transport of GDP-fucose from the Golgi apparatus or cytoplasm. The studies on LADII/CDGIIc fibroblasts suggest that the Golgi of cells from these patients have insufficient GDP-fucose to account for a mechanism involving retrograde transport of GDP-fucose from the Golgi to the ER (14Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This would suggest that there is an unidentified GDP-fucose transporter localized in the ER. Historically, transporter assays using vesicles isolated from the ER or the Golgi have been used to demonstrate the presence of nucleotide sugar transporters (31Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). GDP-fucose transporter activity has been detected in Golgi-derived vesicles, but no evidence of transporter activity in ER-derived vesicles has been reported. Our results predict that such a transporter may exist. Nonetheless, further work is necessary to evaluate whether GDP-fucose enters the ER through a novel transporter or a retrograde transport system. The C-terminal KDEL-like sequence, RDEF, of human O-FucT-1 functions as an ER retention/retrieval signal. Similar sequences are found at the C terminus of all known homologues of O-FucT-1 (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Aside from mammalian O-FucT-1, Drosophila O-FucT-1 has also been shown to localize to the ER. 3T. Okajima and K. D. Irvine, personal communication. Interestingly, deletion of the C terminus of O-FucT-1 in Drosophila causes a lethal phenotype, demonstrating the biological importance of ER retention/retrieval (16Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the ER localization appears to be critical to the function of O-FucT-1. These results raise the question of why O-FucT-1 localizes to the ER. O-FucT-1 is known to recognize and fucosylate properly folded EGF repeats (8Wang Y. Spellman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8112-8118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, O-FucT-1 has the ability to distinguish between folded and unfolded EGF repeats. This observation, together with the ER localization of O-FucT-1, indicates that O-fucosylation may serve as a quality control signal in the ER. Several possible models exist. For instance unknown escort proteins may recognize O-fucose and facilitate the transportation from the ER to the Golgi in a fashion analogous to recognition of N-glycans by ERGIC53 (34Murshid A. Presley J.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a retention protein may recognize and trap proteins with unfucosylated EGF repeats in the ER. In either case, ER localization of O-FucT-1 would be essential. Another possibility is that the O-fucose could prevent the undesired aggregation of proteins containing EGF repeats, facilitating the exit of such proteins from the ER to the Golgi. Obviously, further experiments are required to better understand the unique localization of this enzyme. It is not yet clear to what extent a folding defect contributes to the embryonic lethality observed in O-FucT-1 knock-outs or mutants (13Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 14Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 15Sasamura T.

Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4785-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, these findings do not alter the fact that the O-fucose modification is required for fringe-mediated modulation of Notch function (4Haltiwanger R.S. Lowe J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 491-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 5Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) or for the suggested role O-fucose plays in receptor-ligand binding (16Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although O-fucosylation of TSRs was not examined here, the studies on fibroblasts from LADII/CDGIIc patients suggest that O-fucosylation of TSRs is also unaffected. We have recently identified the gene encoding O-FucT-2, the enzyme responsible for addition of O-fucose to TSRs.2 Because the O-fucose level in TSRs from LADII/CDGIIc fibroblasts appears to be unaffected, it is likely that O-FucT-2 also localizes to the ER. Studies to examine this possibility are in progress. We thank Drs. Peter Lobel and Michael Jadot for their generous provision of sucrose gradient fractions of rat liver microsomes. We also thank Kelvin Luther and Malgosia Skowron for assistance in generating constructs and Drs. Pamela Stanley, Ken Irvine, and members of the Haltiwanger laboratory for helpful discussions."

Although FMDV vaccines are available, political and technical problems associated with their use are driving a renewed search for alternative methods of disease control. The viral RNA genome is translated as a single polypeptide precursor that must be cleaved into functional proteins by virally encoded proteases. 10 of the 13 cleavages are performed by the highly conserved 3C protease (3Cpro), making the enzyme an attractive target for antiviral drugs. We have developed a soluble, recombinant form of FMDV 3Cpro, determined the crystal structure to 1.9-Å resolution, and analyzed the cleavage specificity of the enzyme. The structure indicates that FMDV 3Cpro adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold and possesses a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad in a similar conformation to the Ser-His-Asp triad conserved in almost all serine proteases. This observation suggests that the dyad-based mechanisms proposed for this class of cysteine proteases need to be reassessed. Peptide cleavage assays revealed that the recognition sequence spans at least four residues either side of the scissile bond (P4–P4′) and that FMDV 3Cpro discriminates only weakly in favor of P1-Gln over P1-Glu, in contrast to other 3Cpro enzymes that strongly favor P1-Gln. The relaxed specificity may be due to the unexpected absence in FMDV 3Cpro of an extended β-ribbon that folds over the substrate binding cleft in other picornavirus 3Cpro structures. Collectively, these results establish a valuable framework for the development of FMDV 3Cpro inhibitors.

Foot-and-mouth disease, a highly contagious viral disease of cattle, sheep, pigs, and other cloven-hoofed animals has recently caused devastating epidemics around the globe, affecting Uruguay, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom (1Sutmoller P. Barteling S.S. Olascoaga R.C. Sumption K.J. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 2Knowles N.J. Samuel A.R. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The UK epidemic of 2001 inflicted an economic toll of £20 billion and was only controlled by destroying over 5 million animals. Although FMDV 1The abbreviations used are: FMDV, foot-and-mouth disease virus; PV, poliovirus; HRV, human rhinovirus; HAV, hepatitis A virus; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: FMDV, foot-and-mouth disease virus; PV, poliovirus; HRV, human rhinovirus; HAV, hepatitis A virus; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. vaccines are available, their use in disease control is compromised by the difficulty in distinguishing vaccinated from infected animals, which currently acts as an impediment to the resumption of international livestock trade (1Sutmoller P. Barteling S.S. Olascoaga R.C. Sumption K.J. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The use of vaccines is also hampered by the existence of seven distinct serotypes and multiple subtypes of the virus; vaccine stocks must therefore be constantly updated to protect against the circulating strains most likely to give rise to new outbreaks (3Doel T.R. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Moreover, at least 3–4 days are required following vaccination for a protective response to develop, during which time outbreaks may gain a wider foothold (1Sutmoller P. Barteling S.S. Olascoaga R.C. Sumption K.J. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 3Doel T.R. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In view of these problems, which are exacerbated by the emergent threat that the virus may be used as a bioterrorism agent (1Sutmoller P. Barteling S.S. Olascoaga R.C. Sumption K.J. Virus Res. 2003; 91: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4Grubman M.J. Baxt B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 17: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), additional measures for disease control are required. One promising strategy is to develop drugs to inhibit viral enzymes, such as proteases, that are necessary for replication and propagation of the disease, an approach that has been adopted with some success for human immunodeficiency virus (5Wlodawer A. Vondrasek J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) and is now being applied to a number of other viral targets (6Anand K. Ziebuhr J.

In the case of FMDV, such antiviral drugs could be deployed as soon as an outbreak is detected and thereby provide a potent adjunct to vaccines for faster control of incipient epidemics.FMDV, a picornavirus related to poliovirus (PV), human rhinovirus (HRV), and hepatitis A virus (HAV), possesses a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome containing one open reading frame that is translated as a polypeptide precursor. The cleavage of this polypeptide into the functional proteins required for viral replication is performed by virally encoded proteases. The most important of these is the conserved 3C protease (3Cpro), which in FMDV performs 10 of the 13 cleavages (4Grubman M.J. Baxt B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 17: 465-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar); this enzyme is therefore an appealing target for antiviral drugs.Structural studies on HAV, HRV, and PV 3Cpro enzymes have established that these belong to an unusual family of cysteine proteases that have an overall fold similar to chymotrypsin (8Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 9Matthews D.A. Smith W.W. Ferre R.A. Condon B. Budahazi G. Sisson W. Villafranca J.E.

Biol. 1997; 273: 1032-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). They invariably possess a conserved Cys-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad at the active site, which is similar to the Ser-His-Asp triad found in the vast majority of serine proteases. In serine proteases, the His residue serves to prime the Ser side chain for nucleophilic attack on the scissile bond by abstracting a proton; the role of the Asp is to provide electrostatic stabilization of the resulting positive charge on the His (11Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). To date, however, the structures of picornaviral 3C enzymes indicate that their active sites deviate in significant details from the canonical Ser-His-Asp configuration, leading to suggestions that they also differ mechanistically. In HAV 3Cpro, the catalytic Asp is found to be directed away from the active site and is proposed not to play a significant role in catalysis; its function is possibly replaced by a tyrosine residue that is suggested to be negatively charged (8Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 12Bergmann E.M. Mosimann S.C. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2436-2448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HRV and PV 3C proteases, which are very similar to one another, the position normally occupied by the catalytic Asp is taken by Glu (9Matthews D.A. Smith W.W. Ferre R.A. Condon B. Budahazi G.

Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). These unexpected features have generated new hypotheses regarding the catalytic mechanism of picornaviral 3C proteases that have yet to be fully resolved (8Allaire M. Chernaia M.M.

In order to shed further light on the possible catalytic mechanism of chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteases and to establish a molecular framework for anti-FMDV drug design, we have developed a soluble, recombinant form of FMDV 3Cpro, determined the crystal structure, and analyzed its proteolytic specificity.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Purification and Crystallization—FMDV 3Cpro strain A1061 was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli from a pET-28 vector modified to add a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced in B834(DE3) E. coli grown in minimal medium supplemented with essential nutrients and selenomethionine (Molecular Dimensions). The expressed protein was purified on TALON resin (BD Biosciences), digested overnight with thrombin, reapplied to the TALON resin to remove the cleaved tag, and further purified by gel filtration on a Hi Load 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Peak fractions were concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The purified protein contains residues 1–207 of the 213 amino acids of wild-type 3Cpro; it has an additional Gly at the N terminus remaining from the thrombin cleavage and one additional His at the C terminus. In addition it contains mutations C95K and C142S, which were designed via homology modeling to enhance solubility. Incorporation of these mutations into a 3B-3C fusion construct (17Li W. Ross-Smith N. Proud C.G. Belsham G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) had no effect on 3Cpro-mediated removal of the 3B peptides upon expression in E. coli (data not shown). The mutation C163A was also made to eliminate the activity of the active site nucleophile. Crystals were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion over a 100-μl reservoir upon mixing 2 μl of protein with 0.5 μl of 10% (v/v) Anapoe-X-405 and 2.5 μl of a reservoir solution prepared by mixing 75 μl of 1.5 m sodium citrate, pH 6.5, with 25 μl 0.5 m ammonium phosphate.Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement—Crystals (typically 250 × 250 × 80 μm) were transferred to a 60/40 (v/v) mix of reservoir solution and saturated sucrose and frozen in a stream of N2 gas at 100 K immediately prior to data collection. Multiwavelength x-ray diffraction data to 1.9 Å collected from crystals of SeMet-labeled protein were processed and scaled using the CCP4 program suite (18Project Collaborative Computer Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the R3 space group and have two molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Table I). Since the crystals exhibited hemihedral twinning (19Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) with a twinning fraction of around 0.2, the diffraction intensities were detwinned using DETWIN. Initial selenium sites were located from data collected at peak and remote wavelengths using SHELXD and SHELXE (20Debreczeni J.E. Bunkoczi G. Girmann B. Sheldrick G.M. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and refined with SHARP (21Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect.

Main P. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) to improve the phases. An initial model encompassing about 75% of the polypeptide was built automatically using ARP/wARP (23Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), completed manually in O, and refined using CNS (Table I). The two independent molecules of 3Cpro in the asymmetric unit are very similar (root mean square deviation in Cα positions = 0.4 Å); in each chain, electron density is visible starting from residue 7 and ending at residue 205, although loops A142–146, B142–146, and B76–81 are also missing due to disorder.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsParametersValuesDiffraction data and phasingSpace groupR3a (Å)141.59c (Å)43.68Wavelength (Å)λpeak = 0.9792λremote = 0.8856Diffraction data and phasingResolution range (Å)35.3 to 1.926.8 to 1.9Independent reflections2572725640MultiplicityaValues for the outermost resolution shell (2.0 to 1.9 Å) are given in parentheses9.5 (9.1)3.1 (3.1)Completeness (%)100 (100)99.6 (99.9)I/σI21.9 (3.1)12.5 (2.2)Rmerge (%)bRmerge = 100xΣhΣi|Ihj–Ih|/ΣhΣiIhj, where Ih represents the weighted mean intensity of the symmetry-related reflections Ihj7.5 (64.4)5.0 (37.1)RCullis (iso, acentric; %)0.48RCullis (ano, acentric; %)0.660.89Phasing power (iso, acentric)1.78Phasing power (ano, acentric)1.660.73Figure of merit (obs)0.49Figure of merit (DM)0.80Model refinementNonhydrogen atoms/waters2829/98RmodelcRmodel = 100xΣh|Fo–Fc|/ΣhFo, where Fo and Fc represent the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively/RfreedRfree is the Rmodel calculated using a randomly selected 5% sample of reflection data omitted from the refinement (%)21.7/24.6Root mean square deviation from ideal bond length (Å)0.006Root mean square deviation from ideal angles (degrees)1.31Ramachandran plot, favored/additional (%)92.2/7.8Average B-factor (Å2)35.5Protein Data Bank code2bhga Values for the outermost resolution shell (2.0 to 1.9 Å) are given in parenthesesb Rmerge = 100xΣhΣi|Ihj–Ih|/ΣhΣiIhj, where Ih represents the weighted mean intensity of the symmetry-related reflections Ihjc Rmodel = 100xΣh|Fo–Fc|/ΣhFo, where Fo and Fc represent the observed and calculated structure factors, respectivelyd Rfree is the Rmodel calculated using a randomly selected 5% sample of reflection data omitted from the refinement Open table in a new tab Peptide Cleavage Assays—Soluble single (C95K) and double (C95K/C142S) cysteine mutant proteases for peptide cleavage assays were generated in a construct that generates a Δ3B1–3B2–3B3–3C fusion protein, which contains 3Cpro fused to the three upstream 3B peptides found in the FMDV polyprotein (though 3B1 is truncated at its N terminus) (17Li W. Ross-Smith N. Proud C.G. Belsham G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Upon expression in E. coli, the 3Cpro cleaved itself from the 3B peptides and was purified in a single step to >95% homogeneity using TALON resin via its noncleavable C-terminal polyhistidine tag. Fresh preparations of the single mutant 3Cpro exhibited significantly higher specific activity, but the loss of enzyme activity under assay conditions and a propensity for aggregation made it difficult to obtain reproducible results. The additional C142S substitution in the B2-C2 loop of the double mutant is absolutely required to obtain a soluble and stable enzyme for cleavage assays. Although this mutation may lie close to the substrate binding site (Fig. 1A), there were no significant differences in peptide cleavage specificity compared with the single mutant (data not shown).Peptide substrates were synthesized on an Advanced ChemTech Apex 396 multiple peptide synthesizer using a standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/tert-butyl peptide synthesis strategy (24Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1989Google Scholar) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate activation and purified to >96% homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC using a Delta-Pak C18 Cartridge (15 μm; 25 × 100 mm). The identity of the peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry.Samples of peptide (50 μm) were incubated with the 3Cpro enzyme at 37 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.01 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The extent of reaction was determined following HPLC analysis of the mixture by integration of the peaks representing the starting and product peptides. The identity of the product peptides was verified by MS analysis and/or comparison with HPLC traces of peptide standards. In all cases where cleavage occurred, this was found to be at the expected P1/P1′ junction. For the alanine-scanning experiments, reactions were quenched after a 4-h incubation by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 2.5% (w/v). Relative hydrolysis rates were calculated from the data assuming that the hydrolysis followed apparent first order kinetics.RESULTSCrystallization and Structure Determination—Recombinant FMDV 3Cpro (strain A1061) may be highly expressed in E. coli (17Li W. Ross-Smith N. Proud C.G. Belsham G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Belsham G.J. McInerney G.M. Ross-Smith N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but we found that the native protein precipitates relatively rapidly following purification. Storage at 5–10 mg/ml over a period of days led to the formation of a proteinaceous skin over the top of the solution, which makes this form incompatible with crystallization studies. Extensive mutagenesis trials of amino acids predicted to be surface-exposed (on the basis of modeling using HAV 3Cpro, the nearest homologue of the known structure (8Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)) were performed in an effort to enhance protein solubility. Dynamic light scattering analysis of the aggregation properties of the resulting mutant enzymes, coupled with activity assays, eventually yielded a soluble, active variant. 2Birtley, J. R., and Curry, S. (2005) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D., in press. In this mutated FMDV 3Cpro, two solvent-exposed cysteine residues (C95K and C142S) have been replaced, and the C terminus has been trimmed by six residues (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). For crystallization, the active site nucleophile was also replaced to eliminate proteolytic activity (C163A). The refined structure, solved to 1.9-Å resolution by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion, has an Rfree = 24.6% and good stereochemistry (Table I).Structure of FMDV 3Cpro and Comparison with Other Proteases—FMDV 3Cpro adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold, which typically consists of two β-barrel domains, each composed of a pair of four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets that pack together to form a shallow peptide binding cleft (Fig. 1A). According to the naming convention adopted for these proteases, strands B and E within each domain usually contribute to both sheets. Although the other picornaviral 3C proteases (8Allaire M.

Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Peters 3rd, H.K. Kapust R.B. Li M. Wlodawer A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol.

In particular, the B2 strand does not extend to participate in the E2-F2-C2-B2 β-sheet found in the C-terminal β-barrel of other 3Cpro structures (Fig. 1A); instead, this segment of polypeptide (residues 137–139) is separated from the C2 strand and pairs up with the residues preceding the A2 strand (residues 107–109) to form a small β-sheet (A′2–B′2) that is not observed in the HAV, HRV, or PV 3C proteases or in other common chymotrypsin-like proteases (Fig. 1, A–C). A major corollary of this rearrangement of the β-sheet is that the extended β-ribbon formed by the B2-C2 loop in other picornaviral 3C proteases (and in some serine proteases, such as α-lytic protease (27Fujinaga M. Delbaere L.T. Brayer G.D. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 479-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)), which has an important role in recognizing the P2–P4 region of peptide substrates (16Matthews D.A. Dragovich P.S. Webber S.E. Fuhrman S.A. Patick A.K. Zalman L.S. Hendrickson T.F. Love R.A. Prins T.J. Marakovits J.T. Zhou R. Tikhe J. Ford C.E. Meador J.W. Ferre R.A. Brown E.L. Binford S.L. Brothers M.A. DeLisle D.M. Worland S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11000-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), is absent in FMDV 3Cpro. Although the central region of this loop (residues 142–146) is missing in the electron density map, presumably due to disorder, the paths adopted by the visible termini and the short length of the disordered portion clearly preclude formation of a β-ribbon feature in the free enzyme structure (Fig. 1D) and suggest that it projects away from the active site. The 3C-like protease TEVpro also lacks the extended B2-C2 β-ribbon, but this feature is effectively substituted by a β-ribbon derived from a C-terminal extension that is not present in bona fide picornavirus 3C proteases (26Phan J. Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Peters 3rd, H.K. Kapust R.B. Li M. Wlodawer A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50564-50572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The E1-F1 loop in FMDV 3Cpro assumes a highly extended conformation that is directed away from the active site. Thus, as a result of the conformations adopted by the B′2-C2 and E1-F1 loops, the active site and substrate binding cleft in FMDV 3Cpro are more solvent-exposed than the corresponding features in most other chymotrypsin-like proteases. The A1-B1, C1-D1, and A2-B2 loops in FMDV 3Cpro also differ significantly from the conformations observed in other picornaviral 3C proteases (Fig. 1E), and although they project away from the active site, they may contribute to substrate specificity.The determination of the crystal structure of HAV 3Cpro unexpectedly revealed that residue Asp84, which was predicted to form the catalytic triad along with His44 and Cys172, is actually redirected away from the active site by a salt bridge interaction with the side chain of Lys202 (8Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Tyr143, which points toward the catalytic His in this enzyme was proposed to compensate for this unusual arrangement by providing sufficient electrostatic stabilization to activate the charge relay system (8Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 14Bergmann E.M. Cherney M.M. McKendrick J. Frormann S. Luo C. Malcolm B.A. Vederas J.C. James M.N. Virology. 1999; 265: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and, based on homology modeling, it was recently proposed that FMDV 3Cpro would operate a similar system (28van Rensburg H. Haydon D. Joubert F. Bastos A. Heath L. Nel L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 289: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the sequence alignment based on the structure reported here shows that neither Tyr143 nor Lys202 from HAV 3Cpro is conserved in the FMDV enzyme (Fig. 3). Instead, Asp84 in the crystal structure of FMDV 3Cpro makes a hydrogen bond interaction with His46 of the catalytic triad, and the enzyme therefore has a Cys-His-Asp triad that is very similar in configuration to the equivalent triad in the 3C-like TEVpro (26Phan J. Zdanov A. Evdokimov A.G. Tropea J.E. Peters 3rd, H.K. Kapust R.B. Li M. Wlodawer A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50564-50572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and to the Ser-His-Asp triad found in the vast majority of serine proteases (11Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This similarity extends to encompass the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser182 in FMDV 3Cpro (Ser214 in chymotrypsin), which is positioned to stabilize the conformation of the side chain of the triad residue Asp84, an interaction that is conserved in many chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (11Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this Ser residue is replaced by Val192 in HAV 3Cpro; loss of this interaction may therefore contribute to the reorientation of the catalytic Asp84 in that enzyme.Fig. 2Comparison of the active sites of 3C proteases shows that the catalytic triad found in FMDV 3Cpro most closely resembles that found in the serine protease chymotrypsin. To aid the comparison, the Cys163 side chain has been restored in the FMDV 3Cpro structure by modeling (since this is Ala in the crystal structure). Although the hydrogen-bonding geometry between Cys163 and His46 is nonideal, this may be due to small perturbations in the triad configuration resulting from the mutation to the smaller Ala side chain in the FMDV 3Cpro structure.

https://openalex.org/W2087514755,"Recently, we demonstrated that the control of mitochondrial redox balance and oxidative damage is one of the primary functions of mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDPm). Because cysteine residue(s) in IDPm are susceptible to inactivation by a number of thiol-modifying reagents, we hypothesized that IDPm is likely a target for regulation by an oxidative mechanism, specifically glutathionylation. Oxidized glutathione led to enzyme inactivation with simultaneous formation of a mixed disulfide between glutathione and the cysteine residue(s) in IDPm, which was detected by immunoblotting with anti-GSH IgG. The inactivated IDPm was reactivated enzymatically by glutaredoxin2 in the presence of GSH, indicating that the inactivated form of IDPm is a glutathionyl mixed disulfide. Mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis further confirmed that glutathionylation occurs to a Cys269 of IDPm. The glutathionylated IDPm appeared to be significantly less susceptible than native protein to peptide fragmentation by reactive oxygen species and proteolytic digestion, suggesting that glutathionylation plays a protective role presumably through the structural alterations. HEK293 cells and intact respiring mitochondria treated with oxidants inducing GSH oxidation such as H2O2 or diamide showed a decrease in IDPm activity and the accumulation of glutathionylated enzyme. Using immunoprecipitation with anti-IDPm IgG and immunoblotting with anti-GSH IgG, we were also able to purify and positively identify glutathionylated IDPm from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice, a model for Parkinson's disease. The results of the current study indicate that IDPm activity appears to be modulated through enzymatic glutathionylation and deglutathionylation during oxidative stress."

This conclusion has been reached from the studies of the effect of TMAO on proteins in the pH range 6.0–8.0. In this pH range TMAO is almost neutral (zwitterionic form), for it has a pKa of 4.66 ± 0.10. We have asked the question of whether the effect of TMAO on protein stability is pH-dependent. To answer this question we have carried out thermal denaturation studies of lysozyme, ribonuclease-A, and apo-α-lactalbumin in the presence of various TMAO concentrations at different pH values above and below the pKa of TMAO. The main conclusion of this study is that near room temperature TMAO destabilizes proteins at pH values below its pKa, whereas it stabilizes proteins at pH values above its pKa. This conclusion was reached by determining the Tm (midpoint of denaturation), ΔHm (denaturational enthalpy change at Tm), ΔCp (constant pressure heat capacity change), and ΔGD° (denaturational Gibbs energy change at 25 °C) of proteins in the presence of different TMAO concentrations.

Many organisms are known to accumulate low molecular weight organic molecules (osmolytes) in their tissues in response to harsh environmental stresses. These osmolytes are generally categorized into three groups, namely amino acids and their derivatives, polyhydric alcohols, and methylamines (1Welch W.J. Brown C.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Molecules of the first two groups are “compatible osmolytes,” which means that cells accumulate these osmolytes to high concentrations without significantly perturbing protein functions under physiological conditions (1Welch W.J.

Thus, this compound can exist in zwitterionic and positively charged forms, depending on the pH of the medium. Although TMAO-facilitated stabilization of proteins has been studied at length (8Yancey P.H. Somero G.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 11Lin T.Y.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), these studies were carried out in the pH range 6.0–8.0 in which TMAO is almost neutral. To date, no studies have been carried out at pH values below the pKa of TMAO, where the osmolyte exists predominantly in the positively charged form. Thus, it is not known what the effect of the positively charged TMAO on protein stability is. To answer this question we have investigated the effects of both positively charged and neutral forms of TMAO on the thermal denaturation of three model proteins, namely, pancreatic RNase A, hen egg white lysozyme, and bovine apo-α-lactalbumin (α-LA) in the pH range 2.0–7.0. In this article we report for the first time that the positively charged form of TMAO destabilizes all proteins. Commercial lyophilized preparations of RNase A (type III-A), hen egg white lysozyme, and bovine α-lactalbumin were purchased from Sigma. Guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) was the ultrapure sample from Schwarz/Mann. TMAO was obtained from Sigma. These and other chemicals, which were of analytical grade, were used without further purification. RNase A, lysozyme, and holo-α-lactalbumin solutions were dialyzed extensively against 0.1 m KCl, pH 7.0. α-LA was prepared by adding 4 mm EGTA to the solution of holoprotein (with Ca2+ bound). Protein stock solutions were filtered using 0.45-μm Millipore filter paper. All three proteins gave a single band during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentration of the protein was determined experimentally using molar absorption coefficient (m–1 cm–1) values of 9800 at 277.5 nm for RNase A (28Bigelow C.C. C. R. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg. 1960; 31: 305-324PubMed Google Scholar), 39,000 at 280 nm for lysozyme (29Hamaguchi K. Kurono A. J. Biochem. 1968; 54: 111-122Google Scholar), and 29,210 at 280 nm for α-LA (30Sugai S. Yashiko H. Nita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 328: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The concentration of GdmCl stock solution was determined by refractive index measurements (31Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). All solutions for optical measurements were prepared in the desired degassed buffer containing 0.1 m KCl. For various pH ranges, the buffers used were 0.05 m glycine hydrochloride buffer (pH range 2.0–3.5), 0.05 m citrate buffer (pH 4.0–4.5) and 0.05 m cacodylic acid buffer (pH range 5.0–7.0). The pH of the protein solutions changes upon the addition of TMAO; hence, the required pH was adjusted by adding either HCl or NaOH. Because the change in pH may also occur upon heating or upon the addition of GdmCl, the pH of the solution was therefore measured after the denaturation experiment. It has been observed that the change in pH is not significant. Thermal denaturation studies were carried out in a Jasco V-560 UV/visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-type temperature controller (ETC-505T) at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. This scan rate was found to provide adequate time for equilibration. Each sample was heated from 20 to 85 °C. The change in absorbance with increasing temperature was followed at 287 nm for RNase A, 300 nm for lysozyme, and 295 nm for α-LA. About 650 data points of each transition curve were collected. After denaturation, the sample was immediately cooled down to measure reversibility of the reaction. All solution blanks showed negligible change in absorbance with temperature and were, therefore, neglected during the data analysis. The raw absorbance data were converted into a molar absorption co-efficient (m–1 cm–1) at a given wavelength λ. Each heat-induced transition curve was analyzed for Tm (midpoint of denaturation) and ΔHm (denaturational enthalpy change at Tm) using a non-linear least squares method according to the relation shown in Equation 1, y(T)=yN(T)+yD(T)exp[−ΔHm/R(1/T−1/Tm)]1+exp[−ΔHm/R(1/T−1/Tm)](Eq. 1) where y(T) is the optical property at temperature T (kelvin), yN(T) and yN(D) are the optical properties of the native and denatured protein molecules at T (kelvin), respectively, and R is the gas constant. In the analysis of the transition curve, it was assumed that a parabolic function describes the dependence of the optical properties of the native and denatured protein molecules (i.e. yN(T) = aN + bNT + cNT2 and yD(T) = aD + bDT + cDT2, where aN, bN, cN, aD, bD, and cD are temperature-independent coefficients) (32Sinha A. Yadav S. Ahmad R. Ahmad F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A plot of ΔHm versus Tm at each concentration of TMAO gave the value of ΔCp, the constant pressure heat capacity change. As shown in Equation 2, ΔGD(T)=ΔHm(T−mTTm)−ΔCP[(Tm−T)+Tln(TTm)](Eq. 2) using values of Tm, ΔHm, and ΔCp the value of ΔGD at any temperature T, ΔGD(T), was estimated with the help of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. Heat-induced denaturations of lysozyme, RNase A, and α-LA were measured by near-UV difference spectral measurements. For each protein, measurements were performed in triplicate at each pH and each [TMAO], the molar concentration of TMAO. This osmolyte has pKa values in the range 4.56–4.75 (11Lin T.Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12695-12701Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 26Youxing Q. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5837-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the pH range chosen was to have TMAO in positively charged and neutral states. The selected [TMAO] range was such as to have minimal to maximal effects on the thermal stability of proteins, keeping in view its solubility in solution as well as its tendency to precipitate proteins at higher temperatures. To see whether the stabilizing/destabilizing effect of TMAO depends on the physicochemical properties of proteins, we had chosen three proteins of different pI and hydrophobicity values, namely lysozyme, RNase A, and α-LA; pI and hydrophobicity (kcal mol–1) values, respectively, are 10.7 and 890 for lysozyme, 9.5 and 780 for RNase A, and 5 and 1050 for α-LA. Isothermal (25 °C) far- and near-UV spectra of lysozyme, RNase A, and α-LA were measured at least three times in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier-type temperature controller (PTC-348-WI). All solution blanks showed negligible change in ellipticity in the entire wavelength range and were, therefore, neglected during the data analysis. The raw CD data were converted into mean residue ellipticity (deg cm2 dmol–1) at the entire wavelength using the relation shown in Equation 3, [θ]λ=θλM0/10lc(Eq. 3) where θλ is the observed ellipticity (millidegrees) at the wavelength λ, Mo is the mean residue weight of the protein, c is the protein concentration (mg/cm3), and l is the pathlength (centimeters). Heat-induced denaturation curves of proteins in the presence of different TMAO concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1 m) at five different pH values were measured by following the changes in Δϵ300 of lysozyme, Δϵ287 of RNase A, and Δϵ295 of α-LA as a function of temperature. Denaturation of each protein was reversible at the all pH values in the entire range of [TMAO]. It was observed that for each protein an increase in [TMAO] raised the Tm if pH was ≥5 and reduced Tm if pH was <5. Panels A and B of Figs. 1, 2, 3 show representative denaturation curves of lysozyme, RNase A, and α-LA, respectively. Each denaturation curve of a protein at a given [TMAO] and pH was analyzed for Tm and ΔHm using a nonlinear least squares method that involves fitting the entire (Δϵ, T) data of the transition curve to Equation 1 with all eight free parameters (aN, bN, cN, aD, bD, cN, Tm, and ΔHm). The only exception was that in the analysis of the transition curves of α-LA in the presence and absence of TMAO at pH 4.0, the least squares method involved fitting the entire (Δϵ295, T) data according to Equation 1 with fixed values of aN, bN, and cN, for it has been observed that the temperature-dependence of yN is independent of pH and [TMAO]. Table I shows values of Tm and ΔHm of all three proteins in the presence and absence of TMAO at different pH values. It should be noted that in the case of lysozyme we could not obtain complete denaturation curves in the measurable temperature range at the pH values 6.0 and 5.0 (see Δϵ300 versus temperature plot in the inset of Fig. 1A). To bring down thermal denaturation in the measurable temperature range, measurements were carried out in the presence of 2 m GdmCl at these pH values. To correct for the effect of GdmCl on Tm and ΔHm, we also measured thermal denaturation curves of lysozyme at three more concentrations, namely 1.5, 3, and 3.5 m GdmCl at pH values of 6.0 and 5.0 (transition curves not shown). These transition curves were analyzed for Tm and ΔHm according to Equation 1. At a given pH, the plots of ΔHm versus [GdmCl] and Tm versus [GdmCl], which were found to be linear, were used to get values of Tm and ΔHm in the absence of GdmCl (see Fig. 4). The Tm and ΔHm values of lysozyme evaluated in this manner at pH values 6.0 and 5.0 are given in Table I.Fig. 2Representative thermal denaturation profiles of RNase A in the presence of different concentrations of TMAO at pH 7.0 and pH 2.0.

The solid line at each pH value shows the best fit of the total 12 points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To estimate the ΔCp of a protein, ΔHm values are determined at a number of Tm values by varying the solvent condition, and the slope of the straight line of the ΔHm versus Tm plot is used to evaluate ΔCp (i.e. ΔCp = (δΔHm/δTm)p) (33Becktel W.J. Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). However, it is seen in Table I that at a given pH the variation in ΔHm of proteins with a change in [TMAO] is not significant, for the mean error from the triplicate measurements of ΔHm at the given pH and [TMAO] is in the range 2–5%. The only exceptions were the results of α-LA at pH values of 7.0 and 4.0. This is the reason for estimating ΔCp of the protein in the presence of a given [TMAO] using (ΔHm, Tm) data obtained at different pH values. For a protein at a given [TMAO], all 15 (ΔHm, Tm) values obtained from triplicate measurements at all five pH values were used to construct the ΔHm versus Tm plot. Representative ΔHm versus Tm plots of α-LA in the absence and presence of 1 m TMAO are shown in Fig. 5. Such plots were analyzed for ΔCp, and Table I shows values of the ΔCp of proteins at different TMAO concentrations. It should be noted that a “plus/minus” (±) with each ΔCp in Table I is the fit error (S.D.). At a constant pH and osmolyte concentration, ΔGD°, the value of ΔGD at 25 °C, was estimated using Equation 2 with known values of ΔHm, Tm, and ΔCp. However, this estimation requires a large extrapolation. Hence, a large error may be associated with ΔGD° determination due to errors in the estimations of ΔHm, Tm, and ΔCp. We have used Becktel and Schellman's procedure (33Becktel W.J. Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) to determine the maximum and minimum errors associated with the ΔGD° determination in a given solvent condition. Because there were three independent measurements of ΔHm and Tm of a protein at the given pH and [TMAO], we obtained six values of ΔGD° (three maximum and three minimum values). All of these six values were used to determine the average ΔGD° and the mean error. It was observed that the mean error associated with the ΔGD° estimation was in the range 5–9% for all proteins. The average values of ΔGD° are given in Table I. Fig. 6 shows plots of lnKD° (= –ΔGD°/RT) versus lna (a is the activity coefficient of TMAO estimated using activity coefficient data reported by Lin and Timasheff) (11Lin T.Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12695-12701Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).

Because these conformational transition curves were used for the estimation of different thermodynamic quantities, a few comments are therefore necessary. Analysis of thermal denaturation curves according to Equation 1 assumes that the transition between the native and denatured states is a two-state process. This is indeed true for these proteins in the absence of TMAO (34Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 35Pfeil W. Sadowski M.L. Studia Biophys. 1985; 109: 163-170Google Scholar). However, no calorimetric data are available for these proteins in the presence of TMAO. To check whether the two-state assumption is also valid in the presence of TMAO, thermal denaturation curves were measured by following changes in the [θ]222 of each protein in the presence of 0.5 and 1 m TMAO at different pH values (e.g. see insets in Figs. 1, 2, 3). These transition curves were analyzed for ΔHm and Tm according to Equation 1, and these values of thermodynamic quantities were compared with those obtained from difference absorption measurements given in Table I. It has been observed that both measurements gave, within the experimental error range, identical values of Tm and ΔHm. This comparison suggests that heat-induced denaturation of proteins in the presence of TMAO is a two-state process. To compare a thermodynamic quantity of a protein in the presence of TMAO with that in its absence, it is necessary to show that the structural characteristics of the two end states, i.e. the N and D states of heat denaturations of lysozyme, RNase A, and α-LA, are not affected on the addition of TMAO. It is seen in Fig. 7 that the far- and near-UV CD spectra of both native and denatured proteins in the absence and presence of TMAO are, within the experimental error range, identical. Furthermore, it has been observed that the near-UV absorption spectra of the two end states of proteins were also unperturbed in the presence of TMAO (e.g. see Figs. 1, 2, 3). These observations on the native proteins are consistent with the x-ray results showing that the native structure of proteins is unperturbed by TMAO (7Ratnaparkhi G.S. Varadarajan R. J. Biol.

The synthesis of hydrophobic membrane proteins in a hydrophilic environment bears the high risk of the formation of unproductive protein aggregates. This problem is typically avoided by a strict coupling of synthesis and membrane integration. In the cytosol of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, signal recognition particles recognize ribosomes that synthesize hydrophobic polypeptides and target them onto membrane-embedded translocation complexes (1.Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 2.Koch H.G. Moser M. Muller M. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Over the last years several factors were identified that are required to integrate proteins into the inner membrane of bacteria. The major component in this reaction is the Sec machinery that presumably serves as the entry gate for most inner membrane proteins (for an overview see Refs. 4.Pugsley A.P. Francetic O. Driessen A.J. de Lorenzo V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5.Fekkes P. Driessen A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 91: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To integrate proteins into the lipid bilayer, the Sec translocase cooperates with a further component, called YidC (for review see Refs. 4.Pugsley A.P. Francetic O. Driessen A.J. de Lorenzo V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7.Kuhn A. Stuart R. Henry R. Dalbey R.E.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this case, YidC might function as a chaperone that helps membrane proteins to adopt their appropriate three-dimensional folds and to assemble into protein complexes (9.Nagamori S. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Some membrane proteins, however, do not require the Sec translocase but rather are directly inserted by YidC (10.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 11.Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Functional reconstitution experiments with purified YidC confirmed the potential of YidC to function as an “integrase” that catalyzes the insertion of certain membrane proteins into lipid bilayers independently of further components (12.Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. Van Den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13.van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In vivo, the bacterial signal recognition particle may play a role in membrane targeting of some YidC substrates thereby promoting the co-translational insertion of nascent polypeptides (14.van Bloois E. Jan Haan G. de Gier J.W. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15.Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Park S.K. Phillips G.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A close proximity of YidC and the bacterial ribosome during protein insertion is indeed indicated by cross-linking experiments that reveal the contact to YidC of very short nascent chains that emerge from the peptide exit tunnel of the ribosomes only by a few residues (17.de Gier J.W. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A direct physical interaction of bacterial ribosomes and YidC was, however, not shown so far. The protein insertion machinery of mitochondria derived from the bacterial system but was considerably adapted to meet the needs of the organelle during evolution (for review see Ref. 18.Herrmann J.M. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 74-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mitochondria of higher eukaryotes like fungi and animals lost both the Sec machinery and signal recognition particles (19.Glick B.S. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1-2Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A homologue of the bacterial YidC protein plays a pivotal role in the integration of both mitochondrially and nuclear encoded inner membrane proteins in mitochondria. This mitochondrial protein, which is called Oxa1, is ubiquitously present in mitochondria. The Oxa1 protein of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the first member of the conserved Oxa1/YidC protein family (20.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slominski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21.Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By sequence similarity, Oxa1 homologues were identified in the inner membrane of bacteria (called YidC proteins) and in the inner envelope and thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts (Alb3 and ARTEMIS). Oxa1 is required for the insertion of mitochondrial translation products into the inner membrane. In yeast, eight proteins are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, seven of which are highly hydrophobic membrane proteins: cytochrome b of the bc1 complex; Cox1, Cox2, and Cox3 of the cytochrome oxidase; and Atp6, Atp8, and Atp9 of the F0F1-ATPase. Oxa1 catalyzes the integration of these proteins into the inner membrane, and as a consequence Oxa1 deletion strains are deficient of cytochrome oxidase, and the activities of both other enzymatic complexes are strongly diminished (22.Altamura N. Capitanio N. Bonnefoy N. Papa S. Dujardin G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although most of these proteins still insert into the membrane (although at considerably reduced rates (23.Hell K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)) the membrane integration of Cox2 strictly depends on Oxa1 function (24.Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25.He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This protein contains two transmembrane segments, and, following synthesis both termini are exported into the intermembrane space. The intermembrane space domains of Cox2 are highly charged, and especially the C-terminal one is of considerable length, which might explain why Cox2 strictly requires Oxa1 for its topogenesis. Cox2 is synthesized in the matrix with an N-terminal extension, which is proteolytically removed by the intermembrane space peptidase Imp1. Because translocation of the N terminus is a prerequisite for the processing in the intermembrane space, translocation-deficient strains like Oxa1 mutants accumulate Cox2 in its precursor form. Mitochondria lack signal recognition particles, and the co-translational insertion of the hydrophobic translation products is achieved by an alternative mechanism: the mitochondrial Oxa1 protein exposes a C-terminal α-helical stretch of about 100 residues into the matrix that functions as ribosome-binding domain (26.Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27.Jia L. Dienhart M. Schramp M. McCauley M. Hell K. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6438-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This domain attaches in close proximity to the polypeptide exit tunnel to the mitochondrial ribosome (27.Jia L. Dienhart M. Schramp M. McCauley M. Hell K. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6438-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28.Sharma M.R. Koc E.C. Datta P.P. Booth T.M. Spremulli L.L. Agrawal R.K. Cell. 2003; 115: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and thereby ensures intimate contact of the emerging nascent chain to the membrane-embedded core domain of Oxa1. Because the mitochondrial genome almost exclusively encodes hydrophobic membrane proteins, a signal recognition particle that differentiates between hydrophilic and hydrophobic nascent chains might have become dispensable during evolution. The second group of Oxa1 substrates is nuclear encoded inner membrane proteins that are inserted into the inner membrane following their complete import from the cytosol into the matrix (26.Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 29.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition to Oxa1, mitochondria of plants, fungi, and animals contain a second member of the Oxa1/YidC protein family, which was called Cox18/Oxa2. This protein lacks the C-terminal ribosome-binding domain of Oxa1 and plays a specific role for the biogenesis of the cytochrome oxidase complex (30.Saracco S.A. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1122-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31.Souza R.L. Green-Willms N.S. Fox T.D. Tzagoloff A. Nobrega F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14898-14902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32.Funes S. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The molecular function of Oxa2 in this process is, however, not clear. In this study, we followed a genetic complementation approach to explore the functional similarities and differences between the bacterial YidC protein and its mitochondrial homologues Oxa1 and Cox18/Oxa2. We found that YidC can functionally replace both mitochondrial homologues. However, to achieve complementation of oxa1 mutants, the C-terminal ribosome-binding domain of Oxa1 had to be appended to YidC to allow coupling of YidC to the mitochondrial translation machinery. On the contrary, for functional replacement of Cox18 the attachment of the ribosome-binding domain was not required but rather abolished the ability of YidC to complement. From this we conclude that during evolution of mitochondria, the YidC gene was duplicated to generate two functionally different descendants: Oxa1, which primarily functions as a protein insertase, and Cox18/Oxa2, which is specialized to fulfill its function post-translationally. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—All strains used in this study were isogenic to the wild type strain W303-1A. For generation of the oxa1 and cox18 deletion mutants, the entire coding regions of the OXA1 and COX18 genes, respectively, were replaced by HIS3 cassettes (29.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For expression of mitochondria-targeted YidC, the sequence encoding the promoter and the N-terminal 119 amino acid residues was amplified by PCR using the primers GS01 (5′-GGGCTCGAGGCATCGGACATTTTCCCG-3′) and GS02 (5′-GGGCGCGGCCGCCTCCAAGACGTGTTG-3′) and cloned into the XhoI/NotI sites of pRS426 (33.Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Into the NotI and SacI sites of the resulting plasmid the sequence encoding the conserved domain of YidC was inserted; the sequence was amplified by PCR using the primers GS03 (5′-GGGGCGGCCGCATGGATCCATAGCTTTGTG-3′) and GS04 (5′-GGGGAGCTCCTGACCGCCCTTATTTTAGCG-3′). For expression of mtYidC-RBD, 1The abbreviations used are: RBD, ribosome-binding domain; wt, wild type. the sequence encoding mtYidC was amplified using the primers GS01 and MP38 (5′-CCCTCTAGAGGATTTTTTCTTCTCGCGGC-3′), digested with XhoI and XbaI, and subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequence encoding the ribosome-binding domain of Oxa1 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA using the primers MP39 (5′-GGGTCTAGACTACAGACAATGATTTTGAGAAAC-3′) and MP40 (5′-CCCGAGCTCTCATTTTTTGTTATTAATGAA-3′), digested with XbaI and SacI, and cloned into the pBluescript construct. Then the mtYidC-RBD insert was released by digestion with XhoI and SacI and cloned into pRS426. For construction of overexpression plasmids, the mtYidC and mtYidC-RBD coding regions were cloned into pYX142 expression vector (Novagen, La Jolla, CA) under control of the strong TPI1 promoter. Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in lactate medium, YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) supplemented with 2% galactose, or minimal medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml adenine, histidine, and tryptophan, and 30 μg/ml of leucine and lysine (34.Sherman F.

Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (35.Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products in Vivo—Cells were grown in minimal medium containing 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% raffinose and supplemented with appropriate amino acids, adenine or uracil as required (34.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1986Google Scholar). The labeling reaction was performed essentially as described (36.Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 429-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): a cell suspension of an optical density (A578) of 1.0 was treated with cycloheximide (150 μg/ml) to block the synthesis of nuclear encoded proteins. After incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, 5 μl of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml) were added. The samples were incubated under agitation at 30 °C for 30 min. The labeling was stopped by the addition of 1 mm unlabeled methionine and 12 μg/ml puromycin. Aliquots equivalent to an optical density of 0.5 were taken 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after the reaction was stopped. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed twice in water, and lysed in the presence of 235 mm NaOH, 130 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were incubated 10 min at 0 °C. The proteins were then precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products in Isolated Mitochondria (in Organello)—Translation products were labeled in mitochondria as described previously (35.Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar, 36.Westermann B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 429-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (40 μg protein) were incubated in translation buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 159 mm KCl, 15 mm KH2PO4, 13 mm MgSO4, 0.15 mg/ml of all amino acids except methionine, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 5 mm phosphoenol-pyruvate, 3 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.6 units of pyruvate kinase and 10 μCi of [35S]methionine. Typically, samples were incubated for 30 min at 24 °C, and labeling was stopped by the addition of 25 mm unlabeled methionine. The samples were further incubated for 5 min to complete synthesis, and mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation, washed in 1 ml of 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes/HCl, pH 7.4, and lysed in 25 μl of sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8). Samples were shaken at 4 °C for 10 min prior to loading on the gel. Protein Import into Isolated Mitochondria—Precursor proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and imported into isolated mitochondria essentially as described previously (29.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system containing 2.5 mm malate, 2.5 mm succinate, 1 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase was added during the import reaction to generate a highly energized state of the mitochondria. Non-imported precursor protein was removed by incubation with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. The protease was inactivated by the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Chemical Cross-linking—Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were carried out essentially as described (37.Herrmann J.M. Westermann B. Neupert W. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 217-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial gene products were radiolabeled in isolated mitochondria in a translation buffer with bovine serum albumin omitted and Tris/HCl replaced by Hepes/KOH to prevent quenching by the amino group-specific cross-linking reagents. Stock solutions (24 mm) of the cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted 1/100 into the labeling reaction. To mock-treated samples was added an equal concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide. Following cross-linking, 25 mm glycine and cold methionine were added to quench unreacted cross-linkers. Immunoprecipitation and Co-immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, mitochondria were lysed in 25 μl of 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, cleared by centrifugation at 10 min at 16,000 × g, and diluted in 40 volumes of 0.1% Triton X-100, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. For co-immunoprecipitation reactions, the SDS buffer was omitted and the mitochondria were lysed directly in Triton buffer. After a clarifying spin for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, the extract was added to 2 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 4–6 μl of rabbit antisera. After incubation of 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. Mitochondrial Subfractionation—For hypotonic swelling to selectively rupture the outer membrane, mitochondria were incubated in the presence of 60 mm sorbitol for 30 min on ice. Efficient swelling was monitored by Western blotting using antibodies against epitopes of the matrix and the intermembrane space. Ribosomal pellet fractions were essentially isolated as described (26.Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (200 μg) were washed in 80 mm KCl, 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and lysed in 2 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After a clarifying spin for 15 min at 30,000 × g at 2 °C, the extract was split. One-half was directly loaded onto a cushion of 1.6 m sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 6 h at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C in a SW60 rotor (Beckman). Proteins of the supernatant and of the second half were precipitated by the addition of 12% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins of the ribosomal pellet fraction were directly dissolved in lysis buffer. Miscellaneous—Enzymatic measurements of respiratory chain complexes were performed essentially as described before (38.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and Bacterial Members of the Oxa1/YidC Protein Family Differ in Their C Termini—Members of the Oxa1/YidC protein family are characterized by moderately conserved hydrophobic core domains each comprising five transmembrane spans (Fig. 1A). The core domains of bacterial and mitochondrial homologues are flanked by non-related regions. In particular, YidC proteins of bacteria typically contain an additional transmembrane domain at the very N terminus that plays a role in targeting of YidC to the inner membrane (39.Urbanus M.L. Froderberg L. Drew D. Bjork P. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12718-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 40.Jiang F. Yi L.

Mitochondrial Oxa1 proteins lack this transmembrane span. The N terminus of Oxa1 represents a mitochondrial targeting signal that directs this nuclear gene product to mitochondria and that is proteolytically removed following import (41.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, Oxa1 proteins consistently contain C-terminal extensions that protrude into the matrix and function as ribosome-binding domains (26.Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27.Jia L. Dienhart M. Schramp M. McCauley M. Hell K. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6438-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These domains are absent in the bacterial homologues (Fig. 1B). Despite the significant similarity in the secondary structure and topology of YidC and Oxa1 proteins (cf.Fig. 1C), the primary sequences even of the core domains display only a few invariant amino acid residues, and the similarity among bacterial and mitochondrial members ranges only between 15 and 20%. The Bacterial YidC Protein Can Be Targeted to the Inner Membrane of Mitochondria—To test whether, despite their limited sequence identity, YidC and Oxa1 proteins are functionally conserved, we followed a genetic complementation approach in the yeast S. cerevisiae. To this end, we constructed a chimeric protein of the mitochondrial targeting domain of Oxa1 fused to the hydrophobic core domain of YidC, which we named mitochondria-targeted YidC or mtYidC (Fig. 2A). In addition, we generated a second variant to which the ribosome-binding domain of Oxa1 was appended (mtYidC-RBD). The core domain of YidC is significantly more hydrophobic than that of Oxa1. Because highly hydrophobic sequences in preproteins can interfere with their import competence (42.Claros M.G. Perea J. Shu Y.M. Samatey F.A. Popot J.L. Jacq C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) we first tested whether these constructs can be imported into mitochondria. We synthesized mtYidC-RBD in the presence of [35S]methionine in reticulocyte lysate and incubated the radiolabeled protein with isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2B). During the incubation, the precursor form of mtYidC-RBD (Fig. 2B, pre) was converted into a proteolytically matured species (Fig. 2B, m). This processed form was inaccessible to added protease indicating its complete translocation across the outer membrane. When the outer membrane of the mitochondria was ruptured prior to the protease treatment, two prominent fragments of mtYidC-RBD of apparent masses of about 19 and 10 kDa were generated (Fig. 2B, black arrowheads). These masses matched the masses expected for the properly inserted mtYidC-RBD protein (Fig. 2B, model). The larger fragment could be isolated by immunoprecipitation with a C-terminal Oxa1 antibody verifying that the ribosome-binding domain of the construct was indeed correctly localized to the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, YidC can be imported into mitochondria despite its significant hydrophobicity. Next we constructed plasmids for expression of mtYidC and mtYidC-RBD under control of the yeast OXA1 promoter. These plasmids were transformed into a yeast mutant lacking the endogenous OXA1 gene. Then we isolated mitochondria from these strains and assessed the steady state levels of the mitochondria-targeted YidC proteins by Western blotting using antibodies raised against the N terminus of Oxa1 (Fig. 2C). The mature Oxa1 protein has a calculated mass of 40 kDa but migrates at 36 kDa (41.Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This form was absent in the mtYidC and mtYidC-RBD mutant in which proteins of about 30 and 40 kDa, respectively, were detected with the N-terminal Oxa1 antibody. These molecular masses approximately match the expected molecular masses of mtYidC and mtYidC-RBD, which are 32 and 43 kDa, respectively. The steady state levels of both mutant forms were somewhat lower than that of endogenous Oxa1. YidC Requires an Additional Ribosome-binding Domain to Complement an oxa1 Deletion Mutant—To assess whether the fusion proteins can take over the function of yeast Oxa1, we tested the ability of the strains to grow on the non-fermentable carbon source glycerol (Fig. 3A). In contrast to wild type cells, oxa1 deletion strains are unable to grow under these conditions because of their lack of a functional respiratory chain (Fig. 3A, first and second rows). This respiration-negative phenotype was not reversed upon expression of mtYidC, and hence the bacterial YidC protein was unable to take over the function of Oxa1. This observed inability of mtYidC to complement the Oxa1-deficient strain was not caused by the lower amounts of mtYidC compared with Oxa1 because overexpression of mtYidC did likewise not suppress the respiration-deficient phenotype of OXA1 deletion mutants (data not shown). Notably, the addition of the ribosome-binding domain of Oxa1 onto the mtYidC protein partially restored the growth on glycerol. We conclude that YidC is able to take over the function of Oxa1 in protein insertion but only when equipped with the C terminus of Oxa1. This complementation of oxa1 deletion mutants by mtYidC-RBD is further supported by the enzyme activities of the respiratory chain complexes found in the various strains (Fig. 3B). The deletion of OXA1 severely reduces the activities of the bc1 complex and th"

Envenomation by arachnids of the genus Loxosceles (brown spider), endemic to temperate and tropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Europe, leads to local dermonecrosis and also to serious systemic toxicity. Three principal Loxosceles species of medical importance are encountered in Brazil (Loxosceles laeta, Loxosceles intermedia, Loxosceles gaucho), and more than 2,000 cases of envenomation by L. intermedia alone are reported each year. In the United States, six Loxosceles species (including Loxosceles reclusa, brown recluse) are responsible for numerous incidents (1.Futrell J.M. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1992; 304: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). L. laeta, possibly the most toxic and dangerous of all the species, is widely distributed and is encountered as far north as Canada (2.Nelson J. Can. Med. Assoc.

J. 1988; 138: 792Google Scholar) and is endemic primarily in South and Central America.The site of envenomation, which initially causes only minor discomfort, begins as an expanding area of erythema and edema. A centrally located necrotic ulcer often forms 8–24 h after envenomation (4.Atkins J.A. Wingo C.W. Sodeman W.A. Flynn J.E. Am. J. Trop. Med.

Extensive tissue destruction follows, with the ulcer taking many months to heal, and in extreme cases requires debridement or skin grafting. The lesions are remarkable considering that Loxosceles spiders inject only a few tenths of a microliter of venom containing no more than 30 μg of protein.Mild systemic effects induced by envenomation, such as fever, malaise, pruritus, and exanthema are common, whereas intravascular hemolysis and coagulation, sometimes accompanied by thrombocytopenia and renal failure, occur in ∼16% of the victims (1.Futrell J.M.

Although systemic loxoscelism is less common than the cutaneous form, it is the main cause of death associated with Loxosceles envenomation.

The crystal structure of SMase I (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; E.C. 3.1.4.12), one of the sphingomyelinase D isoforms from L. laeta venom (determined at 1.75 Å), provides a structural basis for understanding the role of the metal ion binding and the acid-base catalytic mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSphingomyelinase Expression—L. laeta SMase I (GenBank™ accession number AY093599) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a fusion protein composed of the mature SMase with an N-terminal extension containing a His6 tag (15.Fernandes-Pedrosa M.F. Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Gonçalves-de-Andrade R.M. van den Berg C.W. Ramos C.R. Ho P.L. Tambourgi D.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recombinant SMase I was purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysates on a Ni(II)-chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant protein was eluted (elution buffer: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.8 m imidazole) at >95% purity and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl). Dynamic light-scattering experiments carried out in the above buffer at 293 K (DynaPro 801-Protein Solutions) indicated that the protein was monomeric in solution.Crystallization, Heavy Atom Derivative, and Data Collection—Initial crystals of L. laeta SMase I were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in which 2-μl drops containing 1 μl of the protein solution (5 mg ml–1 in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) were equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 8 mm Hepes and 0.9 m trisodium citrate (pH 7.5) (31.Zela S.P. Fernandes-Pedrosa M.F. Murakami M.T. De Andrade S.A. Arni R.K. Tambourgi D.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1112-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Subsequently, crystals obtained from 2.7 m ammonium sulfate (pH 5.6) were easier to reproduce and were used for structure determination. Cryo-conditions included the addition of 20% (w/v) glycerol to the reservoir solution. The native crystals belong to the space group P65 with cell parameters of a = b = 139.82 Å and c = 113.46 Å, and the asymmetric unit contains four molecules with a solvent content of 52% (VM = 2.6 Å3 Da–1). The iodine derivative for the “quick cryo-soaking” method was prepared by soaking a single crystal in the cryo-solution, which additionally contained 0.5 m iodine chloride, for 20 min. Diffraction intensities for the native crystal were measured by a MARCCD detector at the protein crystallography beam line at the Brazilian National Synchrotron Light Source (LNLS, Campinas, Brazil), and the derivative diffraction data were collected using x-rays generated by a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode source equipped with Osmic confocal mirrors. Diffraction intensities were measured using a MAR 345 imaging plate detector. Data were scaled and reduced using DENZO/SCALEPACK (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The structure was determined at 1.95 Å using the single isomorphous replacement anomalous dispersion method, and the anomalous differences were used to locate 41 iodine sites with the SHELXD program (35.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) by integrated-direct and Patterson methods. These heavy atom positions were used without further refinement to estimate phases that were subsequently extended to 1.75-Å resolution applying the sphere of influence algorithm as incorporated in the SHELXE program (35.Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), and the electron density was improved by solvent flattening with SOLOMON (36.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence based on the L. laeta SMase I gene (GenBank™ accession number AAM21154) was utilized for automatic model building into the 1.75-Å resolution electron density map with the ARP/wARP program (37.Perrakis A. Morris R.J.H. Lamzin V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar), which was able to trace 97% of the molecule. The refinement was initiated at a 2.0-Å resolution with an R-factor of 22.2% (Rfree = 26.4%). Initial cycles of refinement involved translation, libration, and screw rotation, a restrained and overall B-factor refinement that was carried out by REFMAC5 (38.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar) with the inclusion of non-crystallographic restraints. After each cycle of refinement, the model was inspected and manually adjusted to correspond to the computed σA-weighted (2Fo – Fc)- and (Fo – Fc)-type electron density maps using the program TURBO FRODO (Biographics, Marseille, France). In the later cycles, the non-crystallographic restraints were relaxed, and individual isotropic B-factors were refined. Solvent water molecules were added manually at the position of positive peaks (>3σ) in the difference Fourier maps, taking into consideration hydrogen bonding potential. In the final cycles of refinement, additional density was observed in the difference electron density maps, which was attributed to the presence of Mg2+, sulfate ions, and Hepes molecules.RESULTSThe refinement of the structure of SMase I from L. laeta converged to a crystallographic residual of 18.6% (Rfree = 22.5% for 5% of the data) for all data between 30.0 and 1.75 Å (no σ or intensity cutoff; 99.5% data completeness). The residual electron density that was observed was attributed to the presence of a Mg2+ ion based on the temperature factor (B-factor = 7.5 Å2) and coordination (Figs. 1 and 2A). Because the concentration of the phosphate in the dialysis buffer (10 mm) was lower than the sulfate concentration (2.6 m) used in crystallization, the tetrahedrally shaped residual density observed in close proximity to the Mg2+ binding site was considered to represent an SO4– ion (Fig. 2A). Although hydrolytic activity is Mg2+-dependent and this site is surrounded by highly conserved amino acids, it is considered to represent the active site, and the SO4– ion likely mimics the binding of the phosphate group of the substrate.Fig. 2A, stereo view of the amino acids and hydrogen bonding in the catalytic and metal ion binding (green sphere) sites; the electron density (blue) in the 2Fo – Fc map is contoured at 2.0σ.

An analysis of the stereochemistry (PROCHECK) (39.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) of the final model indicates that the main-chain dihedral angles for all residues are located in the permitted regions of the Ramachandran diagram and that the root mean square deviations from ideal values are distributed within the expected ranges for a well refined structure (Table I).The fundamental structural unit of SMase I is formed by a distorted triose phosphate isomerase or (α/β)8 barrel (surface area = 11,254 Å2) with the insertion of additional β-strands and α-helices (Figs. 1 and 3). The N and C termini flank one side of the barrel, and the N terminus leads directly to the first β-strand, whereas the C terminus contains a short helix (8′) and a β-strand (H′) and caps the torus of the barrel (Figs. 1 and 3). The asymmetric unit contains four molecules and can be considered to be made up of two dimers. The monomers forming the dimer are related by a 2-fold axis of rotation perpendicular to the barrel (Fig. 4) and results in 3402 Å2 (or 33%) of the surface area of each monomer being buried. Dimerization is likely an artifact of the crystal packing interactions, because the dynamic light-scattering experiments indicate that the protein is monomeric in solution.Fig. 3Topology schematic of L. laeta SMase I.

In eukaryotes, the Rad52 group of proteins dictates the repair of DSBs by the error-free process of homologous recombination (HR). A critical step in eukaryotic HR is the formation of the initial Rad51-single-stranded DNA presynaptic nucleoprotein filament. This presynaptic filament participates in a homology search process that leads to the formation of a DNA joint molecule and recombinational repair of the DSB. Recently, we showed that the Rad54 protein functions as a mediator of Rad51 binding to single-stranded DNA, and here, we find that this activity does not require ATP hydrolysis. We also identify a novel Rad54-dependent chromatin remodeling event that occurs in vivo during the DNA strand invasion step of HR. This ATP-dependent remodeling activity of Rad54 appears to control subsequent steps in the HR process.

Double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand breaks; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin IP; MNase, microccocal nuclease; SIE, strand invasion/extension. are a common form of DNA damage, resulting from a variety of environmental insults including ionizing radiation and chemical attack. The most common cause of DSBs is internal reactive oxygen species, accounting for thousands of breaks per cell per day. The inability to repair these breaks leads to genomic instability. Misrepair of these breaks can result in deletions, insertions, and translocations. In higher eukaryotes, improper DSB repair can lead to tumorigenesis. It is therefore of vital importance that cells repair these breaks accurately and faithfully. Several pathways have evolved for the repair of DSBs. In yeast, the predominant pathway is thought to be homologous recombination (1Kim P.M. Paffett K.S. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Nickoloff J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Pāques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homologous recombination (HR) provides an “error-free” method for repairing DSBs as it utilizes homologous DNA sequences as a template to repair the lesion with no loss of genetic information. The genes in the RAD52 epistasis group, required for HR, are highly conserved from yeast to man (2Pāques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cromie G.A. Connelly J.C. Leach D.R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1163-1174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of this molecular pathway. Studies in yeast have suggested a sequence of molecular events that occur following the formation of a DSB (2Pāques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Haber J.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 561-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Nucleolytic end processing leads to resection of the 5′ ends of DNA that flank the break, generating long stretches of 3′ single-stranded DNA. Rad51p binds the single-stranded DNA, forming right-handed helical nucleoprotein filaments. In vitro, Rad52p (6Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), Rad54p (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and a Rad55p/Rad57p heterodimer (8Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) mediate this early step by overcoming the inhibitory effects of the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RPA. In vivo, these same Rad proteins are also required for optimal recruitment of Rad51p to DNA surrounding a single DSB in yeast (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The Rad51-nucleoprotein filament is believed to search the genome for homologous sequences, resulting in the formation of a heteroduplex “joint molecule” (10Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Joint molecule formation is followed by extension of the incoming strand by DNA polymerases and branch migration. The end result is the repair of the DSB without loss of genetic information (2Pāques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rad54p is a member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of DNA-stimulated ATPases (11Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and like Swi2/Snf2, Rad54p shows ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity in vitro (12Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 13Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct.

Rad54p also binds to both single-stranded DNA (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and Rad51p (15Clever B. Interthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Golub E.I. Kovalenko O.V. Gupta R.C. Ward D.C. Radding C.M.

Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and these latter two activities are believed to play key roles in the stimulation of Rad51-single-stranded DNA nucleoprotein filament formation. In vitro, this mediator activity of Rad54 is optimal at substoichiometric ratios of Rad54p to Rad51p (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), although in other types of in vitro assays, Rad54p functions best at stoichiometric levels (18Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8447-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14029-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These in vitro studies raise the question of whether Rad54p might be a stoichiometric component of the extended Rad51 nucleoprotein filament in vivo. In vitro, the ATPase activity of Rad54 is required to promote homologous DNA pairing between a Rad51-nucleoprotein filament and a double-stranded DNA or chromatin donor (12Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast harboring mutant alleles of RAD54 that disrupt the ATPase domain exhibit sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (15Clever B. Interthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and defects in intrachromosomal recombination (21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ATPase-defective RAD54 alleles have little effect on interchromosomal recombination. This suggests that Rad54p may have several functions in vivo and that some, but not all, require a functioning ATPase domain. In this study, we use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to assess the composition of the presynaptic nucleoprotein filament in vivo and to investigate the role of the Rad54 ATPase activity. We find that the ATPase activity of Rad54 is dispensable for early steps in HR but, in contrast, the ATPase activity of Rad54 is required for a chromatin remodeling step that occurs during strand invasion. Plasmids and Strains—The 2-μm plasmid containing the RAD54 gene plus 400 bp of upstream genomic DNA was a kind gift of Hannah Klein (New York University). A 3.2-kb NotI-SalI fragment containing the RAD54 genomic sequences was excised and cloned into the NotI-SalI sites in pRS406. The codon for lysine 341 was mutagenized to arginine by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). The site-specific mutation was verified by sequencing. The mutant and wild-type plasmids were linearized with NcoI and transformed into rad54Δ strains that either contained (CY1166) or lacked (CY916) silent mating type loci. All other strains used here were described previously (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Polyclonal Rad51 and Rad52 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For ChIP against Rad54p and Rad55p, the proteins were tagged at their carboxyl termini with 13 copies of the c-Myc epitope as described previously (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ChIP assays were performed as described previously (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with modification as follows. After adsorption to protein A-Sepharose, crosslinked antigens were eluted in 250 μl of 2× proteinase K buffer (2× proteinase K buffer is 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH = 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) by shaking at 65 °C for 10 min. Beads were pelleted by pulse centrifugation, and the supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of water. Proteinase K (100 mg) was added, and samples were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h followed by 65 °C overnight. Lithium chloride (400 mm final) was added, and samples were extracted once with phenol:chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (24:1). Samples were then precipitated with 20 μg of glycogen and 1 ml of 100% ethanol. Radioactive semiquantitative PCR was performed and analyzed as described previously (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Multiplex PCR reactions containing only the break-proximal (18 bp) and break-distal (900 bp) primers (see Fig. 1a) failed to amplify the expected 882-bp product even when the extension times were increased to 2 min (not shown), indicating that the DNA from the two MAT regions immunoprecipitate independently. Microccocal Nuclease and Southern Blotting—For microccocal nuclease (MNase) assays, 50-ml cultures were grown in YEP + raffinose to mid-log phase and induced with galactose as described above for ChIP assays. Parallel uninduced cultures served as negative controls. Cultures were cross-linked with formaldehyde, and extracts were prepared as for ChIP. Extracts were not sonicated but were instead treated with various amounts of MNase for 15 min at 37 °C. For optimal MNase digestion, magnesium chloride (20 mm final) and calcium chloride (2 mm final) were added to the extracts. Each 50-ml culture represented one MNase digestion reaction. These reactions were quenched with 1% SDS and 5 mm EDTA and then treated with 500 mg of proteinase K at 42° for 2 h and then at 65° for 5 h to reverse the cross-links. DNA was extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (24:1) and then precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. Dried DNA was dissolved in 400 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4/1 mm EDTA with 300 mg RNase-A, incubated at 37° for 1 h, extracted once with phenol:chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol and once with chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol, and then precipitated again with sodium acetate and ethanol. DNA was dissolved in water and digested with HindIII (New England Biolabs) in the appropriate buffer overnight at 37 °C. After precipitation, DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of water and electrophoresed on 1.3% agarose, 1× Tris-borate-EDTA gels. Southern blotting was carried out as described (22Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). The probe was made by PCR with genomic DNA as a template and primers (5′ to 3′): GCAAAGCTTACTTCATTTATTAG and CTTATTGTGCTTTGTTGGGTG. The location of this probe is illustrated below (see Fig. 5a). The PCR product was gel-purified (Qiagen) and labeled by the random primer method (Roche Applied Science). For analysis of HO cleavage at HML, 25-ml cultures were grown in YEP + raffinose and induced as described above. Formaldehyde fixation was omitted. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and suspended in 200 μl of genomic DNA buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH = 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and 200 μl of phenol: chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (25:24:1) with 250 μl of zirconium beads (Biospec Products). Cells were lysed by shaking on a multivortexer for 10 min after which 200 μl of TE was added. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was extracted with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. DNA was treated with 30 mg of RNase-A for 5 min at 37° and then precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol. Dried DNA was dissolved in water and digested overnight with either HindIII or BamHI (NEB). The DNA was precipitated, and Southern blotting was performed as described above. Previously, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses to monitor the recruitment of Rad proteins to a single, HO-induced DSB at the yeast MAT locus (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although our studies focused on recruitment events immediately proximal to the DSB, Haber and colleagues (9Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Rad51p is cross-linked over several kilobases of DNA surrounding the DSB in yeast. To determine whether Rad54p and the other members of the RAD52 group are part of this extended nucleoprotein filament, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses were performed for Rad51p, Rad52p, Rad54p, and Rad55p using DNA primer sets that monitor recruitment events both proximal to (18–257 bp) and distal from (600–900 bp) an HO-induced DSB (Fig. 1a). We also included primers to the PHO5 locus as a control in the multiplex PCR analysis. Consistent with previous studies (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we observe rapid recruitment of Rad51p to DNA both proximal to and distal from the induced DSB (Fig. 1, b and c). Likewise, we find that Rad52p and Rad55p are also recruited to both regions, consistent with their association with the entire Rad51p nucleoprotein filament (Fig. 1, b and c). In contrast, Rad54p is only cross-linked to DNA proximal to the DSB (Fig. 1, b and c). Identical results are found in ChIP time courses that are extended to 8 h (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that Rad54p is not a stoichiometric component of a Rad51-nucleoprotein filament in vivo, and furthermore, the data indicate that Rad54p may only associate with the 3′ end of the presynaptic complex. Previously, we showed that Rad52p, Rad55p, and Rad54p are all mediators of Rad51p recruitment to DNA proximal to an HO-induced DSB in vivo (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Given that Rad54p is only associated with this same proximal region, we tested whether the mediator activity of Rad54 is restricted to the 3′ end of the presynaptic filament. As we showed previously, deletion of RAD54 causes a 6-fold decrease in recruitment of Rad51p to DNA proximal to the HO-induced DSB (Fig. 2, a and b). However, cross-linking of Rad51p at the distal region (600–900 bp) is reduced less than 2-fold in the rad54 deletion strain. Likewise, binding of Rad51p to a medial region (250–535 bp, Fig. 2b) is reduced only 3-fold in the absence of Rad54p. In contrast, deletion of the RAD52 gene leads to a complete absence of Rad51p recruitment throughout the entire region tested (Fig. 2b). Thus, these data distinguish the mediator activities of Rad54p and Rad52p, and they indicate that the Rad54p mediator activity is most crucial in the same region where Rad54p itself binds, at the extreme 3′ end of the presynaptic filament. Based on analogy to prokaryotic homologous recombination (4Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the Rad51p presynaptic filament is believed to search for homologous sequences until it is able to form an unstable paranemic joint in which homologous sequences are aligned, but the DNA strands are not topologically intertwined. This unstable joint is subsequently extended to the 3′ end of the Rad51p filament, forming a stable plectonemic DNA joint. Previously, we showed that RAD54 is required for cross-linking of Rad51p to homologous donor sequences, and at that time, we concluded that Rad54p might play a role in the homology search process (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, this analysis only monitored binding of Rad51p to donor sequences that are homologous to the extreme 3′ end of the incoming presynaptic filament (Fig. 3; HML proximal), a region that we have now shown is devoid of Rad51p in a rad54 deletion strain. Thus, it is possible that an unstable paranemic joint might be formed in the absence of RAD54, given the high levels of Rad51p that are bound to the distal end of the presynaptic filament. Fig. 3b shows a representative Rad51p ChIP analysis in strains harboring a galactose-inducible HO gene that also contain the homologous donor sequences, HML and HMR. PCR analysis of Rad51p immunoprecipitates included primer sets for the PHO5 control locus, the MAT locus, and the HML homologous donor locus. For HML, two sets of primer pairs were used: 1) a proximal HML set that detects synapsis of the 3′ end of the incoming filament and 2) a distal HML set that detects synapsis of the medial region of the presynaptic filament (Figs. 2b and 3a). As we observed previously (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), Rad51p is detected at the MAT locus (Fig. 3b) and at the proximal HML donor site in the wild-type strain (not shown). However, detection of Rad51p in the distal region of HML was not observed even in the wild-type strain unless we dramatically decreased the amount of sonication during the ChIP procedure (Fig. 3, b and c). Importantly, decreasing the extent of sonication had little impact on the immunoprecipitation efficiency of MAT sequences in the wild-type strain. In the rad54 deletion strain, Rad51p was not detectable at the proximal HML region (not shown), confirming our previous results (7Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, Rad51p was seen bound to the downstream HML region in the rad54 deletion strain when sonication cycles were decreased (Fig. 3, b and c). Thus, these data indicate that RAD54 is not required for a successful homology search, but rather, that the absence of Rad54p leads to the formation of an unstable DNA joint that may only be paranemic in nature. A similar conclusion has been made by Sugawara et al. (9Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Rad54 is unique among those proteins known to mediate the binding of Rad51p to single-stranded DNA as Rad54 is a potent DNA-stimulated ATPase. Several roles have been proposed for the ATPase activity of Rad54, including ATP-dependent DNA duplex separation during strand invasion (19Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1175-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), as well as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling during the homology search or DNA strand invasion (12Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 25Peterson C.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To identify ATP-dependent role(s) for Rad54p during HR, we created isogenic yeast strains that express wild-type Rad54p or an ATPase-defective version of Rad54, rad54K341R. Similar to previous studies (1Kim P.M. Paffett K.S. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Nickoloff J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2727-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Clever B. Interthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), both the rad54 deletion strain and the strain that expresses the ATPase-defective version, rad54K341R, are hypersensitive to the DNA-damaging agent, methyl methanesulfonate (data not shown). ChIP analyses were performed to monitor Rad51p recruitment in the isogenic RAD54, rad54K341R, and rad54 deletion strains. In the isogenic strain set that lacks homologous donors, Rad51p was detected at both the MAT proximal and the MAT distal regions in the RAD54 strain, but binding was only detected at the distal region in the rad54 deletion strain (Fig. 4a). When the rad54K341R allele was expressed, Rad51p recruitment to the proximal region was restored. Thus, this role for Rad54p in facilitating Rad51p recruitment does not require an intact ATPase domain. Furthermore, in a similar isogenic strain set that harbors homologous donors, both Rad54p and Rad54K341R supported binding of Rad51p to the HML proximal region, even under normal sonication conditions (Fig. 4b). Thus, the ATPase-defective version of Rad54p is able to rescue full synapsis at the HML donor. However, only strains harboring wild-type Rad54p were able to extend the DNA joint and generate a strand invasion/extension (SIE) product (Fig. 4c). These data demonstrate that Rad54p has at least two functions during recombinational DNA repair: 1) a presynaptic activity that helps recruit Rad51p to single-stranded DNA and is independent of ATP hydrolysis and 2) a subsequent activity, dependent on an intact ATPase domain, which is required for extension of the incoming strand by DNA polymerases. Yeast (12Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 13Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (26Alexiadis V. Lusser A. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27824-27829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) Rad54p are able to use the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to enhance the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA in vitro. Furthermore, Rad54p is required for Rad51-dependent strand invasion in vitro on nucleosomal donors (12Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In vivo, Rad54p may hydrolyze ATP to remodel nucleosomes during the formation of stable recombination joints. Indeed, a positioned nucleosome occludes the HO recognition site at the HML donor locus (27Weiss K. Simpson R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5392-5403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this nucleosome may represent a barrier to DNA strand invasion or subsequent strand extension. To test for possible in vivo chromatin remodeling activity of Rad54p, MNase digestion of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was used to probe for changes in nucleosome positions at HML during strand invasion. However, we were not able to detect significant changes in the MNase digestion pattern even in the wild-type RAD54 strain (data not shown). The exception was the appearance of a hypersensitive site that mapped to the HO recognition site at HMLα. Surprisingly, this DNA cleavage is due to the HO endonuclease. The cleavage is observed in the absence of MNase addition but requires galactose induction of HO (Fig. 5b, compare lanes 1 and 5 with galactose with lanes 4 and 8, respectively, without galactose). Increasing the duration of galactose induction leads to greater amounts of cleavage at this site (data not shown). Detection of this cleavage product does not require extended periods of HO expression as a 30-min pulse of galactose, followed by glucose repression, still leads to 10–15% cleavage of HMLα. To investigate whether the HO recognition site at HML becomes accessible as a consequence of DNA strand invasion, we performed the analysis in the isogenic RAD54, rad54K341A, and rad54 deletion strains. Strikingly, the HO cleavage at HML does not occur in the rad54 deletion strain or in the strain that expresses the ATPase-defective version, rad54K341A (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1 and 5 with lanes 2 and 6). Thus, these data indicate that accessibility of the HO site at HML requires a successful strand invasion event, and it is not due simply to overexpression of HO. Furthermore, since successful homology search and synapsis occur in the rad54K341R mutant (Fig. 4b), the induced accessibility at the HML HO site reflects a subsequent RAD54-dependent step. Accessibility may be a direct consequence of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity of Rad54p, or alternatively, it may require a later step in HR, such as DNA polymerase-dependent extension of the incoming DNA. To directly address a possible involvement of DNA polymerase activity in the enhanced accessibility of HML donor chromatin, we treated yeast with hydroxyurea for several hours to deplete nucleotide pools, block DNA polymerase activity, and arrest cells in early S phase. Galactose was then added to the arrested cells to induce the formation of the DSB at MAT. As shown in Fig. 5c, hydroxyurea treatment has no effect on the efficiency of DSB formation at the MAT locus, but hydroxyurea did abolish the formation of a 30-bp strand invasion/extension product at HML. Notably, hydroxyurea treatment had only a minor effect (∼30% decrease) on the HO cleavage at HML (Fig. 5d). Thus, the increased accessibility of HML chromatin does not require extension of the DNA strand by DNA polymerases, but the enhanced accessibility to HO appears to reflect a RAD54-dependent step that occurs after completion of a successful homology search. These data are consistent with a model in which the nucleosome that is positioned over the HO cleavage site inhibits the formation of the completely intertwined DNA joint, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by Rad54p overcomes this barrier, facilitating the formation of a stable DNA joint that can be extended by DNA polymerases. We have previously demonstrated that Rad54p has chromatin remodeling activity in vitro (12Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here, we present the first evidence that Rad54 protein remodels chromatin in vivo. In this case, Rad54p requires an intact ATPase domain to remodel at least one nucleosome positioned over the HO cleavage site at the HML donor locus. In vitro, the ATP-dependent remodeling activity of Rad54p leads to enhanced accessibility of nucleosomal sites to restriction enzymes, but it does not appear to lead to dramatic changes in the positioning of nucleosomes within array substrates (12Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Likewise, in vivo, we were unable to detect significant changes in nucleosome positioning by MNase analysis during the early stages of strand invasion, even when chromatin states were fixed with formaldehyde. Thus, the data are consistent with the idea that ATP-dependent remodeling by Rad54 may lead to enhanced accessibility of nucleosomal DNA without large scale nucleosome movements. Previous studies have suggested that Rad54p has both ATP-dependent and -independent functions in vivo (1Kim P.M. Paffett K.S. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Nickoloff J.A.

The presynaptic activity of Rad54p does not require an intact ATPase domain, and consequently, a sonication-sensitive DNA joint is formed at a donor locus in the presence of an ATPase-defective version of Rad54p. The ATP-dependent activity of Rad54p appears to comprise, at least in part, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling function that facilitates the formation of a stable DNA joint that can be acted on by DNA polymerases. Whether there exist additional ATP-dependent steps for Rad54p remains to be investigated. The dual functionality of Rad54p may have evolved as genomes became larger and more highly condensed chromatin structures began to interfere with HR. A mutation that disrupts the ATPase domain of human RAD54 is found in some tumors (29Smirnova M. Van Komen S. Sung P. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24081-24088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling by Rad54 may play a key role in maintaining genome integrity among all eukaryotes.

Rather, tgm silencing is dependent on the ability to cluster the dispersed tRNA genes in or near the nucleolus, constituting a form of three-dimensional gene control. Chromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing has been extensively studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: at the two silent mating type loci, near telomeres, and in the single cluster of tandemly repeated rRNA genes (1Huang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1465-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting these silencing forms affect chromatin structure by altering histone modifications and remodeling. Unlike other eukaryotes, S. cerevisiae appears to lack RNA-mediated forms of silencing (2Grewal S.I.S. Moazed D. Science. 2003; 301: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Actively transcribed tRNA genes can suppress transcription of nearby genes by RNA polymerase II (pol II) 1The abbreviations used are: pol II, polymerase II; tgm, tRNA gene-mediated. in yeast (3Kinsey P.T.

Genome Res. 2003; 13: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or tRNA gene-mediated (tgm) silencing (6Kendall A. Hull M.W. Bertrand E. Good P.D. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

It is dependent on transcription of the tRNA gene, since mutations in the pol III promoters and conditional mutations in RNA polymerase III (pol III) alleviate tgm silencing. The degree to which this effect suppresses nearby pol II transcription varies depending the pol II promoter (6Kendall A. Hull M.W. Bertrand E. Good P.D. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unlike other silencing elements, tRNA genes are scattered throughout the genome in large numbers and could potentially influence neighboring genes, although pol II promoters are underrepresented near tRNA genes (5Bolton E.C. Boeke J.D. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Notable exceptions to this are the Ty retrotransposons (5Bolton E.C. Boeke J.D.

The mechanism of tgm silencing is unknown, but genetic and cytological data suggest that it might be linked to spatial organization of the tRNA genes in the nucleus. The early pre-tRNA processing pathway and most tRNA genes associate with the nucleolus in yeast (9Bertrand E. Houser-Scott F. Kendall A. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Thompson M. Haeusler R.A. Good P.D. Engelke D.R.

To explore the mechanism of tgm silencing we have examined its relationship to other silencing forms and its dependence on nucleolar localization. Yeast Strains and Genetic Manipulations—The strains used for screening gene deletions is BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 GAL4 GAL80) and its derivatives, ResGen Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA). Deletions affecting tgm silencing were confirmed by PCR. Growth on selective media was performed by standard methods except that the G418 concentration in kanamycin selections was doubled (11Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4169) Google Scholar). Identification of Silencing Suppressors—The deleted gene strains with plasmid pSUP4o (4Hull M.W. Erickson J. Johnston M. Engelke D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were plated on four different synthetic (S) media for 4–28 days with either dextrose (D) or galactose and raffinose (GR) as carbon sources: SD-ura, SD-ura-his, SGR-ura, SGR-ura-his. No strains grew on SD-ura-his, as expected (data not shown). Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization—The position of the RNAs and the tRNALeu (CAA) gene family in the gene deletion strains was detected by in situ hybridization of fluorescent oligonucleotides as described (9Bertrand E. Houser-Scott F. Kendall A. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10Thompson M. Haeusler R.A. Good P.D. Engelke D.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1399-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We tested specific gene deletions that might have influenced the process for a variety of reasons. Each deletion strain contained a plasmid (4Hull M.W. Erickson J. Johnston M. Engelke D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in which an active SUP4 tRNA gene normally suppresses transcription of a neighboring HIS3 coding region from an artificial GAL1 promoter (Fig. 1). Cells are unable to grow in the absence of histidine unless the gene deletion mutations alleviates tgm silencing (6Kendall A. Hull M.W. Bertrand E. Good P.D. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The tested gene deletions affect several processes that might affect silencing behavior near tRNA genes. The deletions that do not affect tgm silencing are listed in Table I (see the on-line supplemental data for detailed rationale). None of the gene deletions that affect other forms of transcriptional silencing, histone modification, or chromatin remodeling have any effect on tgm silencing. Because the tRNA genes are nucleolar, it is particularly interesting that several gene deletions that affect Sir2p-dependent and Sir2p-independent rRNA gene cluster silencing (e.g. RPA34, RIF1, SET1, SIR2, SNF2) (12Bryk M.

Open table in a new tab A number of gene deletions affecting nuclear morphology, cytoskeleton, and nucleoskeleton were tested to ask whether general defects in nuclear or cellular architecture might affect tgm silencing. This question was of particular interest because tRNA gene localization appears to be important for nearby silencing to occur (see below). None of these tested gene deletions relieved tgm silencing. The remaining category in Table I contains non-essential genes that affect rRNA biosynthesis and transport in the nucleus. These were tested because the one gene we previously identified as affecting tgm silencing was CBF5, which encodes a nucleolar rRNA processing enzyme, rRNA pseudouridine synthase (6Kendall A. Hull M.W. Bertrand E. Good P.D. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Lafontaine D.L.J. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). None of the other deletions affecting rRNA processing and transport had any effect on tgm silencing (Table I). It is possible that the cbf5 allele identified in our previous selections has a specific disruptive effect not mimicked by other deletions of rRNA processing components. In contrast, four gene deletions that interfered with rRNA gene transcription alleviated tgm silencing (Fig. 1 and Table II). Two non-essential subunits of pol I, Rpa12p (15Nogi Y. Yano R. Dodd J. Carles C. Nomora N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and Rpa49p (16Liljelund P. Mariotte S. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9302-9305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and two subunits of the rRNA gene transcription factors, Rrn10p (17Keys D.A. Lee B.S. Dodd J.A. Nguyen T.T. Vu L. Fantino E. Burson L.M. Nogi Y. Nomura M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and Uaf30p (18Siddiqi I.N. Dodd J.A. Vu L. Eliason K. Oakes M.L. Keener J. Moore R. Young M.K. Nomura M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4512-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), gave positive results. Although deletions of these genes cause slow growth, the cells retain recognizable nucleoli (Fig. 2), unlike what would be expected from loss of essential pol I subunits (19Oakes M. Sidiqqi I. Vu L. Aris J. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8559-8569Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, deletions of two other non-essential pol I subunits, rpa14 and rpa34, do not alleviate tgm silencing even though the slow growth of the strains suggests a partial defect in pol I transcription. It is not clear why this would be true, but it presumably reflects differences in the subunit functions. However, since deletion of four of the six non-essential components of the pol I transcription machinery release tgm silencing, we conclude that some aspect of the early rRNA biosynthetic pathway directly or indirectly influences silencing near tRNA genes.Table IIMutations that affect tgm silencing and ribosomal RNA biosynthesisGene nameFunctionsΔrpa12Subunit of RNA polymerase I, nucleolar localizationΔrpa49Subunit of RNA polymerase I, nucleolar localizationΔrrn10Component of the upstream activation factor complex, activation of RNA pol I; null mutant shows defective RNA pol I transcription and defective RNA pol II silencing at the rRNA gene locusΔuaf30Component of the upstream activation factor complex, nucleolar localization, activation of RNA pol I; null mutant shows defect of RNA pol II transcription silencing at the rRNA gene locuscbf5-1rRNA pseudouridine synthase, nucleolar protein found in H/ACA snoRNP complexes; it was previously shown that cbf5-1 disorganizes pre-tRNA location and mildly disorders nucleolus (Ref. 6Kendall A.

A. 2000; 97: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab It is possible that tgm silencing might depend on nucleolar integrity, since a cbf5-1 mutation that releases tgm silencing also slightly disorders the nucleolus (6Kendall A. Hull M.W. Bertrand E. Good P.D. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13108-13113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the tRNA genes are largely nucleolar (10Thompson M. Haeusler R.A. Good P.D. Engelke D.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1399-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the mutations that alleviated tgm silencing also lost the nucleolar localization of tRNA genes (Fig. 2). The positions of the 10 dispersed tRNALeu(CAA) genes family were determined in several strains where genes affecting ribosomal RNA biosynthesis were deleted. Fluorescent oligonucleotide probes were also used to assess the position of the intron-containing, nuclear pre-tRNAs, which have previously been found to be primarily nucleolar (9Bertrand E. Houser-Scott F. Kendall A. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These methods will detect the pre-tRNA transcripts even when distributed throughout the nucleus, but visualization of the tRNA genes depends on clustering of the ten genes (10Thompson M. Haeusler R.A. Good P.D. Engelke D.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1399-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), since the signal per gene is very low. In the wild type and Δsir2, Δrpa14 and Δrpa34 control strains, the tRNALeu(CAA) gene family and its pre-tRNA transcripts primarily co-localize with the nucleolus. However, in strains with compromised tgm silencing the nucleolar localization was lost. This included strains with deleted pol I subunits (Δrpa12 and Δrpa49) and missing rRNA gene transcription factors (Δrrn10 and Δuaf30). In these strains the pre-tRNA transcript signal becomes more dispersed in the nucleoplasm, and the tRNA gene signal becomes indistinguishable from background fluorescence, the expected result if the genes become dispersed in the nucleus (10Thompson M. Haeusler R.A. Good P.D. Engelke D.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1399-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the effect of these mutations on tgm silencing might be through compromising the spatial organization of tRNA gene loci. Spatial positioning of tRNA genes in yeast might be primarily driven by a need to organize the beginning of the tRNA biogenesis pathway, but this does not preclude the possibility that eukaryotic nuclei have developed ways of using the transcriptional side effects of this arrangement. The results presented here support the hypothesis that negative transcriptional regulation near tRNA genes requires subnuclear DNA localization, although it might also require additional mechanisms. Subnuclear positioning of silenced regions appears to be the rule, rather than exception. Telomeres and silent mating type loci in yeast are associated with the nuclear periphery (20Heun P. Laroche T. Shimada K. Furrer P. Gasser S.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2181-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 21Gasser S.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1412-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and the ribosomal RNA gene clusters form their own dense, subnuclear structures (nucleoli). Nucleolar localization might have the side effect of antagonizing pol II transcription for multiple reasons, including scarcity of pol II and appropriate transcription factors or exposure to an unknown antagonist at these locations. The variability in the degree to which tgm silencing is effective on different pol II promoters might then reflect the acquired ability of some pol II promoters to gather factors and pol II or avoid the antagonist(s). For example the Ty retrotransposon promoters, most of which are juxtaposed to tRNA genes, might have activation mechanisms specifically adapted to this environment. In this regard it is interesting that one Ty retrotransposon class, Ty5, inserts preferentially at telomeres and silent mating type loci instead of tRNA genes (24Zou S. Wright D.A. Voytas D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unlike other pol II transcription units, the Ty5 can be expressed in the silencing environment of telomeres, suggesting that the insertion preference of Ty for these silenced loci is accompanied by a mechanism to overcome those forms of silencing. It is not clear to what extent these transcriptional effects near tRNA genes will be applicable near pol III transcription units in vertebrates. There is scarce information on which tRNA genes are active in vertebrate development (25Hipskind R.A. Clarkson S.G. Cell. 1983; 34: 881-890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and vertebrates often have large numbers (∼106) of duplicated pol III transcription units (small interspersed DNA elements, or SINEs) (26Deininger P.L. Batzer M.A. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to be able to correlate the activity of these pol III elements with the activity of nearby pol II transcription and their spatial organization. We thank Thomas E.

We have shown previously that transcriptional activation by PBX·HOX is augmented by either protein kinase A (PKA) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). To examine the contribution of MEIS proteins to this response, we used the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to show that MEIS1 in addition to PBX1, HOXA1, and HOXB1 was recruited to a known PBX·HOX target, the Hoxb1 autoregulatory element following Hoxb1 transcriptional activation in P19 cells. Subsequent to TSA treatment, MEIS1 recruitment lagged behind that of HOX and PBX partners. MEIS1A also enhanced the transcriptional activation of a reporter construct bearing the Hoxb1 autoregulatory element after treatment with TSA. The MEIS1 homeodomain and protein-protein interaction with PBX contributed to this activity. We further mapped TSA-responsive and CREB-binding protein-dependent PKA-responsive transactivation domains to the MEIS1A and MEIS1B C termini. Fine mutation of the 56-residue MEIS1A C terminus revealed four discrete regions required for transcriptional activation function. All of the mutations impairing the response to TSA likewise reduced activation by PKA, implying a common mechanistic basis. C-terminal deletion of MEIS1 impaired transactivation without disrupting DNA binding or complex formation with HOX and PBX. Despite sequence similarity to MEIS and a shared ability to form heteromeric complexes with PBX and HOX partners, the PREP1 C terminus does not respond to TSA or PKA.

Meis1 and its fly homolog homothorax (hth) encode homeoproteins of the three-amino acid loop extension class and therefore are related to the vertebrate pre-B cell transformation (Pbx) genes and their fly homolog extradenticle (exd) (4Bürglin T.R.

These heterodimeric and trimeric complexes modulate the functional specificity of HOX proteins, perhaps by increasing DNA binding affinity and selectivity (16Azpiazu N. Morata G.

Consistent with this observation, MEIS family proteins cooperate with PBX and HOX for hind brain patterning in Xenopus and zebrafish (10Waskiewicz A.J. Rikhof H.A. Hernandez R.E. Moens C.B.

Sagerstrom C.G. Development. 2001; 128: 1299-1312PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in both of these vertebrates as well as in Drosophila suggest a transcriptional activation function for MEIS/HTH (38Vlachakis N. Choe S.K. Sagerstrom C.G.

Development. 2001; 128: 3405-3413PubMed Google Scholar), but activation domains have not been mapped. The Hoxb1 ARE is a PBX·HOX target that directs expression in rhombomere (r) 4 of the developing hind brain (41Pöpperl H. Bienz M. Studer M. Chan S.-K. Aparacio S. Brenner S. Mann R. Krumlauf R.

Krumlauf R. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20506-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although only the PBX·HOX sites are required for r4 enhancer function. The Hoxb1 ARE drives the expression of a lacZ reporter in P19 cells induced to differentiate down the neural pathway by aggregation in the presence of retinoic acid (RA) (46Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, P19 cell monolayers fail to activate the ARE following RA treatment, despite the presence of Hox, Pbx, and Meis products. By contrast, the HDAC inhibitor TSA induces ARE-driven transgene expression in monolayers, consistent with evidence implicating PBX in HDAC recruitment (46Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 47Asahara H. Dutta S. Kao H.Y. Evans R.M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8219-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, both TSA and PKA strongly activate expression through PBX·HOX binding sites in HEK293 cells. Again this can be explained in part by the inhibition of PBX-associated HDACs but also increased association of the HOXD4 transcriptional activation domain with CBP, a coactivator with histone acetyltransferase activity (46Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we focused on two of the homeoproteins predicted to act through PBX·HOX-response elements. Here, we investigate the contribution of a third partner, MEIS1, to transcriptional regulation by MEIS·PBX·HOX heterotrimers through the Hoxb1 ARE, both at the endogenous locus in P19 cells and with transfected reporters. We correlate transcriptional activation of Hoxb1 with histone acetylation and MEIS1, PBX1, and HOX recruitment to the ARE and map TSA- and PKA-responsive transcriptional activation domains in the MEIS1A and MEIS1B C termini. In addition, we present evidence suggesting that differences in their C termini distinguish the functions of MEIS and PREP family proteins. Plasmids Construction—Expression vectors for HOXA1, MEIS1A, MEIS1A (N51S), PBX1A, and PBX1A-(Δ1–89) have been described previously (28Shanmugam K. Green N.C. Rambaldi I. Saragovi H.U.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The entire coding region of MEIS1B and PREP1 were subcloned into the pCS2+ vector. pML, pML(2xPBX·MEIS), and pML5xUAS are luciferase reporters driven by adenovirus major late promoter alone, two copies of PBX·MEIS (TGATTGACAG) binding sites, or five copies of GAL4 binding sites, respectively (48Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 49Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Featherstone M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pMLHoxb1ARE was constructed by subcloning the 150-bp ARE of Hoxb1 gene into HindIII-XhoI sites of pML. GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL-DBD) fusion proteins were generated by subcloning corresponding coding sequences into pGal-O45 (49Rambaldi I. Kovacs E.N. Featherstone M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as described below. A SmaI-SmaI fragment and a SmaI-EcoRV fragment encoding murine MEIS1A residues 1–231 and 232–390 were cloned into pGal-O45 to produce GAL-MEIS1A-(1–231) and GAL-MEIS1A-(232–390). To construct GAL-MEIS1A-(232–272), GAL-MEIS1A-(272–390), GAL-MEIS1A-(335–390), GAL-MEIS1A-(335–372), GAL-MEIS1A-(372–390), GAL-MEIS1B-(335–465), and GAL-MEIS1B-(372–465), corresponding DNA fragments were amplified by PCR and cloned 3′ to the GAL-DBD coding region. An EcoRI-XhoI fragment from pBKShPREP1 was used to construct GAL-PREP1-(316–465). Coding sequences for MEIS1A-(1–334) and MEIS1A-(1–371) were amplified by PCR using pfu polymerase and cloned into pCS2+. Protein expression was verified by Western blot using a rabbit polyclonal anti-MEIS1 antibody (26Huang H. Paliouras M. Rambaldi I. Lasko P. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3636-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for CBP, PKA catalytic domain, and E1A have been described previously (46Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against murine MEIS1 (26Huang H. Paliouras M. Rambaldi I. Lasko P. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3636-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and HOXB1 were raised by immunization with fusion proteins consisting of maltose-binding protein fused to residues 1–34 of MEIS1 and residues 14–161 of HOXB1. Affinity purification was performed over a column presenting covalently bound GST that was fused to the same MEIS1 or HOXB1 residues (50Huang H. Rambaldi I. Daniels E. Featherstone M. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 227: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The anti-HOXA1 (sc-17146) and anti-PBX1 (sc-889) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RT-PCR and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—P19 cells were plated at 105 cells/ml and aggregated in the presence of 0.3 μm RA or cultured overnight in monolayer and treated with 200 nm TSA for indicated times. For RT-PCR, first strand cDNAs were generated by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using total RNA from P19 cells. ChIP assays were performed according to the protocol from Upstate Biotechnology and as described previously (51Rastegar M. Kobrossy L. Nagy Kovacs E. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 24: 8090-8103Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (10752800, Roche Applied Science). Chromatinized DNA was cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.2-ml SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and sonicated to reduce the chromatin DNA length from 200 bp to 1 kb. The lysates were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with sperm DNA-protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. Following incubation with 5 μg of anti-acetyl (K9,K14)-H3 (O63599, Upstate Biotechnology), 20 μg of anti-MEIS1, anti-HOXA1, or anti-HOXB1, or 10 μg of anti-PBX1 antibodies, immune complexes were immobilized by sperm DNA-protein A-agarose beads. After extensive washing and elution with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3, cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl. The released DNA was phenol-chloroform-purified, and the Hoxb1 ARE and gapdh sequences were detected by real-time PCR and agarose gel visualization. 5% (by volume) of the immunoprecipitated material was used as a template for real-time PCR by using a SYBR Green Taq ReadyMix kit for quantitative PCR from Sigma with a Roche LightCycler. The ChIP primers for gapdh are 5′-AACGACCCCTTCATTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCACGACATACTCAGCAC-3′ (reverse). The Hoxb1 ARE primers are 5′-CTCTGGTCCCTTCTTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCCAGAGTTTGGCAGTC-3′ (reverse). The RT-PCR primers for gapdh are the same as those for ChIP Meis1: 5′-ACAACCTCGCCTGTGATTGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTACTGATGCGAGTGCAGA-3′ (reverse). Cell Culture and Luciferase Assay—HEK293 and P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). A total of 5–10 μg of DNA containing 1–3 μg of luciferase reporter construct and 0.5–1 μg of expression vector were transfected into HEK293 cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. A cotransfected lacZ reporter was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously by Phelan et al. (48Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis— HEK293 and P19 cells were harvested and lysed in EBC lysis buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) followed by brief sonication. Whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and antibodies against MEIS1, ACTIN (Sigma), and GAL-DBD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to detect the presence of the corresponding proteins. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro Transcription-Translation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HOXA1, PBX1A, MEIS1A, and MEIS1A-(1–371) were generated with an Sp6 TnT coupled in vitro transcription-translation kit (Promega). Reactions containing [35S]methionine were performed in parallel to verify translational efficiency. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (48Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled DNA probes containing PBX·MEIS (5′-TCACCATGATTGACAGGCGACTGCTCGG-3′) or MEIS·PBX·HOX (5′-AGCTTGGAGCTGTCAGGGGGCTAAGATTGATCGCC-3′) binding sites (Fig. 4C) were used. MEIS Proteins Contribute to the TSA Responsiveness of the Hoxb1 ARE through the Homeodomain and by Interaction with PBX—To assess the contribution of MEIS1 to the TSA responsiveness of PBX·HOX complexes, we examined the activity of a luciferase reporter driven by the Hoxb1 ARE in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, upper panel). The Hoxb1 ARE is only weakly TSA-responsive 24 h following drug treatment (Fig. 1, lane 1). However, as noted previously (46Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), cotransfection with expression vectors for HOXA1 and PBX1A (lane 2) or an N-terminally truncated PBX1A (lane 3) greatly increases TSA responsiveness, an effect dependent on PBX·HOX binding sites. Importantly, wild-type MEIS1A also increased the TSA response (lane 4), whereas the DNA-binding impaired MEIS1A(N51S) was inactive (lane 5). Coexpression of MEIS1A with HOXA1 and PBX1A provoked a synergistic increase in TSA responsiveness (lane 6), an effect abrogated either by mutation of the MEIS1A HD (lanes 7 and 9) or an N-terminal deletion of PBX1A that abolishes MEIS recruitment (lanes 8 and 9). Together, these results strongly suggest that MEIS1A does indeed contribute to the TSA responsiveness of PBX·HOX complexes. Induction of Hoxb1 Correlates with MEIS1 Recruitment to the ARE—The potentiation of the TSA response by MEIS1A could be caused by drug-induced recruitment to the Hoxb1 ARE or, non-exclusively, the function of a MEIS1A TSA-responsive transcriptional activation domain. To assess whether TSA can augment the amount of MEIS1A in the cell and at the Hoxb1 ARE, we performed RT-PCR, Western, and ChIP analyses on endogenous Meis1a products in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. We have previously shown that both RA and TSA induce the production of HOXB1 and the activity of the Hoxb1 ARE in P19 cells (46Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), whereas Hoxb1 and Meis genes are known positive RA targets (7Oulad-Abdelghani M. Chazaud C. Bouillet P. Sapin V. Chambon P.

Science. 1994; 265: 1728-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). By contrast, the PBX protein family is positively regulated by RA at the post-transcriptional level (54Knoepfler P.S. Kamps M.P. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, the levels of Hoxb1 and Meis1 transcripts were increased 24 h following RA or TSA treatment (Fig. 2A). However, these increases were not reflected by the levels of MEIS1 protein (Fig. 2B). A short 1-h exposure to TSA increased the level of Hoxb1 message but not that of Meis1 (Fig. 2A). The above results show that induction of Hoxb1 under these conditions cannot be accounted for by increased MEIS1 protein. Therefore, ChIP assays were performed to determine whether MEIS1, PBX1, HOXA1, and HOXB1 are recruited to the Hoxb1 ARE in response to RA and TSA. A 24-h exposure of P19 cells to RA or TSA did, in fact, promote MEIS1, PBX1, HOXA1, and HOXB1 recruitment to the Hoxb1 ARE (Fig. 2, C–E). MEIS1 is not recruited at 1 h of TSA treatment, a time at which Hoxb1 transcripts have already been induced, and may be explained by an early nonspecific effect of TSA on chromatin opening. To correlate Hoxb1 activation and MEIS1 recruitment with changes to chromatin, we examined the effect of TSA and RA on histone H3 diacetylation at the Hoxb1 ARE. TSA induced a rapid (1 h) acetylation of histone H3 that was maintained at 24 h. A more striking RA-induced H3 diacetylation at 24 h was also clearly evident (Fig. 2C). Thus, although MEIS1 recruitment to the ARE cannot account for the initial activation of Hoxb1 at 1 h of TSA treatment, it does correlate with long term gene expression at 24 h of RA and TSA treatment. The MEIS1A C Terminus Is a TSA- and PKA-responsive Transcriptional Activation Domain—MEIS recruitment could facilitate PBX·HOX transcriptional activity at the level of DNA binding affinity and/or selectivity. Non-exclusively, MEIS could recruit additional coactivators in response to cell signaling. Consistent with this possibility, two recent studies (39Dibner C. Elias S. Frank D. Development. 2001; 128: 3415-3426PubMed Google Scholar, 40Inbal A. Halachmi N. Dibner C. Frank D. Salzberg A. Development. 2001; 128: 3405-3413PubMed Google Scholar) reveal a transactivation function of HTH and XMeis3. To identify putative transcriptional activation domains, different regions of MEIS1A were fused to the GAL-DBD and the transcriptional activity of fusion proteins was analyzed on pML5xUAS, a luciferase reporter driven by five copies of the GAL4 binding site. As shown in Fig. 3A, the MEIS1A C terminus displayed a strong transcriptional activation function in TSA-treated HEK293 cells. Further deletions mapped the functional region to residues 335–390 located C-terminal to the HD. Comparable expression levels of the different GAL-DBD fusion proteins were verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). PKA controls numerous transcriptional regulatory events, in part via CREB and CBP (55Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K.

We have previously shown that the transactivation function of PBX·HOXD4 complexes is greatly enhanced by PKA signaling and that this is due to increased association of CBP with the HOXD4 proline-rich activation domain (46Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine whether MEIS1 makes additional contributions to the PKA responsiveness of PBX·HOX complexes, we tested whether domains of MEIS1A could confer the PKA response on the GAL-DBD. As it did for TSA, the MEIS1A C terminus responded strongly to PKA signaling (Fig. 3C). Coexpression of E1A reduced the PKA-induced activity, implicating a CBP-dependent mechanism. However, simple overexpression of CBP did not significantly induce transcriptional activation by the MEIS1A C terminus (Fig. 3C).

Prostate cancer, the most common noncutaneous malignant transformation in American men (1Jemal A. Tiwari R.C. Murray T. Ghafoor A. Samuels A. Ward E. Feuer E.J. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J.

Griffiths K. Semin. Surg. Oncol. 2000; 18: 52-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The hormonal therapies cause only a temporary shrinkage in tumor mass, and the cancer invariably reappears in the form of androgen-insensitive (AI) disease. Despite decades of intense basic and clinical research, to date there is no cure for AI prostate cancer.Accumulating evidence suggests that the AR itself is involved in the transition of prostate cancer from androgen-dependent to AI (4Zegarra-Moro O.L. Schmidt L.J. Huang H. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1008-1013PubMed Google Scholar). AI prostate tumors express AR-regulated genes, including human kallikrein 2 and 3 (5So A. Goldenberg L. Gleave M.E. Can. J. Urol. 2003; 10: 2040-2050PubMed Google Scholar), also known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), suggesting that the AR is activated in these tumors despite the continued presence of the hormonal therapies. In vitro, the AR can be activated by factors other than androgens (6Culig Z. Hobisch A. Hittmair A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Zhang J. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Prostate. 1997; 32: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), and in animal models increased AR expression was reported to be the only change associated with progression to hormone refractory disease (8Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R. Rosenfeld M.G. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). In humans, the AR is overexpressed in up to one-third of AI prostate carcinomas, suggesting that it could respond to low serum levels of androgens (9Visakorpi T. Hyytinen E. Koivisto P. Tanner M. Keinanen R. Palmberg C. Palotie A. Tammela T. Isola J. Kallioniemi O.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Also, AI lesions exhibit frequent mutations in the AR that may allow it to be activated by other androgens or even anti-androgens (10Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Hence, AR is a focal point in progression of the prostate cancer to advanced stage. However, the mechanisms regulating AR activation in the presence of low androgen concentrations and their significance to the progression to AI disease remain unclear.Transition of the prostate cancer to the AI stage is associated with increased expression of plasma membrane-localized G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (11Daaka Y. Science's STKE. 2004; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;stke.2162004re2)PubMed Google Scholar), which mediate cellular responses to a diverse array of extracellular molecules, including lipid and peptide growth factors (12Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Human prostate cancer biopsies show elevated expression of the GPCRs for endothelin (13Nelson J. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), bradykinin (14Taub J.S. Guo R. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Madden J.F. Daaka Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2037-2041PubMed Google Scholar), and lysophosphatidic acid, 2R. Guo and Y. Daaka, unpublished results.2R. Guo and Y. Daaka, unpublished results. compared with benign specimens. The cancerous prostate also expresses elevated levels of GPCR ligands, including endothelin-1, follicle-stimulating hormone, and several neuropeptides (11Daaka Y. Science's STKE. 2004; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;stke.2162004re2)PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nelson J. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev.

Thus, prostate tumors express elevated levels of GPCRs as well as their ligands, suggesting these receptors are “on” and, therefore, may contribute to progression of the disease. The GPCRs transduce their signals primarily via activation of heterotrimeric G proteins to produce Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits. The G proteins are divided into four groups: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12. Gs and Gi regulate mainly adenylyl cyclases that produce cAMP, Gq regulates phospholipases that control intracellular Ca2+ levels, and G12 regulates low molecular weight GTPase Rho and other effectors. The Gβγ subunits regulate activity of many effectors, including phospholipase C and serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (11Daaka Y. Science's STKE. 2004; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;stke.2162004re2)PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2037-2041PubMed Google Scholar), induces mitogenic signaling and growth of AI prostate cancer cells. In animal models, the expression of a Gβγ subunit inhibitor peptide attenuates prostate tumor growth (19Bookout A.L. Finney A.E. Guo R. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37569-37573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we tested the hypothesis that G proteins exert their mitogenic signals in prostate cancer cells by activating the AR. We found that activation of Gs activates the AR and reduces the concentration of androgen necessary for maximal activation of the AR. Our data demonstrate that AR can be fully activated in the presence of castrate levels of androgen if Gαs is activated. These results predict failure of hormonal therapies in cancer patients in which the Gs signaling axis is activated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The mammalian expression plasmids were kindly provided as follows: probasin-luciferase reporter, Z. Culig (University of Innsbruck); ARR2-luciferase reporter, R. Matusik (Vanderbilt University); SV40-Renilla luciferase reporter, H. Matsunami (Duke University); constitutively activated Gα, R. T. Premont (Duke University) and the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (Sayre, PA); phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D and FLAG epitope-tagged vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), R. J. Lefkowitz (Duke University); and wild type and mutated (S650A) AR, M. J. Weber (University of Virginia). FLAG-tagged Gαs-ct was generated by PCR amplification of a 310-bp fragment that encodes amino acids 303–410 of human Gαs and was cloned into EcoRI-XhoI sites in pcDNA3.1 vector. The 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and isoproterenol (ISO) were purchased from Sigma. The synthetic androgen R1881 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and the anti-androgen bicalutamide was the generous gift of Astra Zeneca (Wilmington, DE). The androgens DHT and R1881 were used interchangeably throughout the study and gave similar results in all assays used. Antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-AR, BioGenex (San Ramon, CA); anti-PSA, Dako (Carpinteria, CA); anti-Gαs, Calbiochem; M2 anti-FLAG, Sigma; anti-enolase, NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA); anti-actin, Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); and anti-mouse IgG-CY3, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA).Cell Culture—Androgen-dependent LNCaP cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1.26 g/liter glucose. The androgen-dependent LAPC4 cells were generously provided by C. L. Sawyers (University of California).Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transfected at 70% confluence using DMRIE-C (Invitrogen). Transfections were carried out with cDNAs encoding the probasin or ARR2 luciferase (1 μg) and SV40-Renilla luciferase (10 ng) together with empty vector or the indicated gene of interest using a total of 6 μg of DNA/plate. At the end of transfection, cells were equally divided into 6-well plates and allowed to attach. The culture medium was replaced after 24 h with starvation medium (phenol red-free RPMI 1640 containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5), and identical cell populations, in duplicate, were stimulated with androgen, ISO, or vehicle for additional 24–48 h. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega; Madison, WI) and were normalized by the Renilla activities and protein concentrations of the samples. Results are presented as -fold increase over base line by dividing the relative luciferase activity of the treated cells over the value obtained for unstimulated cells. cAMP Assay—Accumulation of cAMP was determined using the direct cyclic AMP assay kit (Correlate-EIA™ kit) from Assay Designs, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, LNCaP cells (106 cells/well in 24-well plates) were stimulated with ISO (10 μm) or testosterone (1 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C and lysed using 0.1 n HCl, and lysates were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assay was performed in duplicate and repeated three times.Western Blot Analysis—Appropriately treated cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm Na3V04, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (14Taub J.S.

Cancer. 2002; 102: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Immunostaining—Cells on glass coverslips were labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-AR antibodies at a dilution of 1:200, washed with PBS, and then mounted and inspected under a Zeiss AxioVision 3.1 fluorescence microscope (14Taub J.S. Guo R. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Madden J.F. Daaka Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2037-2041PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bookout A.L. Finney A.E. Guo R. Peppel K. Koch W.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol.

Science's STKE. 2004; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;stke.2162004re2)PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that G proteins are capable of being mitogenic via activation of the AR. We examined the effects of G proteins on AR activation using androgen receptor response element (ARE)-regulated luciferase reporters and constitutively activated Gα subunits (Gαq Q209L, Gαz Q205L, Gαi-1 Q204L, Gα12 Q231L, Gα13 Q226L, or Gαs Q227L) in LNCaP cells that endogenously express the AR. Cells were incubated in phenol red-free culture medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped serum (starvation medium), and reporter activity was determined after overnight stimulation with DHT (10 nm). Expression of activated Gαq and Gαs, but not Gαz, Gαi-1, Gα12, or Gα13, resulted in an increase in basal AR activity (Fig. 1A). On average, expression of constitutively active Gαq and Gαs induced 4- and 10-fold increases in AR activity, respectively. We observed that treatment with DHT promoted about 20-fold increase in reporter activity, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1A). The transient expression of activated Gαs, Gαq, Gαi-1, Gα12, or Gα13 did not significantly impact the androgen-mediated increases in AR activity, whereas the expression of activated Gαz reduced AR activation by roughly 30% (Fig. 1A).Stimulation of Endogenous β2-Adrenergic Receptor (β2-AR) Activates the AR—Because its effect was the greatest, we focused our attention on Gs, which becomes activated in response to stimulation of a number of GPCRs (11Daaka Y. Science's STKE. 2004; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;stke.2162004re2)PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar). Gene expression analysis of GPCR signaling pathways using GEArray filters revealed that LNCaP cells express about 100-fold more of the Gs-coupled β2-AR than β1-AR (data not shown). Therefore, we used the β2-AR as a model Gs-coupled receptor to test the hypothesis that receptor-mediated activation of Gs can activate the AR. Stimulation with ISO induced the dose-dependent increase in ARE-regulated reporter activity (Fig. 1B). Maximal response was achieved at an ISO concentration of 10-6m with an EC50 of 10-7m. The ISO-stimulated AR activation is mediated by β2-AR, because the addition of propranolol, a β2-AR antagonist, abrogated the ligand-mediated increase in activated AR (data not shown). Maximal induction of reporter activity by ISO was roughly 40–50% of that achieved by androgen (Fig. 1B), implying an important physiologic function for β2-AR in the activation of AR. The increase in ARE-luciferase reporter activity was dependent on AR, because treatment of cells with the AR antagonist bicalutamide attenuated the ISO- and DHT-mediated effects. Interestingly, treatment of cells with ISO enhanced activity of the AR partial antagonist hydroxyflutamide; a combination of ISO and hydroxyflutamide activated AR more than either reagent alone (data not shown).To further validate the finding of ISO-induced activation of the AR, we used two additional assays: nuclear expression of endogenous AR and expression of the ARE-regulated PSA protein. In the inactive state, AR forms complex with heat shock proteins and is mostly sequestered in the cytoplasm (20Kokontis J.M. Liao S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 219-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the AR is stabilized in the nucleus. We determined the effect of ISO treatment on subcellular localization of endogenous AR in LNCaP cells using immunofluorescence and observed that treatment with ISO induced time-dependent nuclear import of the AR (Fig. 1C). Once in the nucleus, active AR binds AREs in promoter and enhancer regions of specific genes to control their transcription (20Kokontis J.M. Liao S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 219-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We examined whether ISO treatment could induce expression of the ARE-regulated PSA gene product using Western blot analysis. ISO, like DHT, induced a time-dependent increase in PSA expression (Fig. 1D). To demonstrate that these responses are not restricted to the LNCaP cells, we used another androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line, LAPC4 (21Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Stimulation with ISO induced the activation of ARE-regulated reporter in these cells as well (data not shown), affirming the generality of the response.Synergy between Gs and Androgen to Activate the AR—Prostate cancer patients undergoing endocrine ablative therapy have reduced but not eliminated circulating androgens, since the adrenal glands can still produce androgens that bind to and activate the AR (22Geller J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether expression of activated Gαs influences the androgen-induced activation of the AR. Mock-transfected LNCaP and LNCaP cells transiently expressing activated Gαs were treated with increasing concentrations of DHT, and ARE-regulated reporter activity was determined. DHT promoted the concentration-dependent increase in AR reporter activity with an EC50 of 10-9m (Fig. 2A), and maximal response was achieved at a DHT concentration of 10-8m. Importantly, expression of activated Gαs resulted in increased basal AR transcriptional activity as well as reducing the DHT concentration required to achieve the maximal (10-9m) response (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Synergy between activated Gs and androgen to activate AR. A, Gαs Q227L increases the efficacy of androgen-regulated activation of AR. Cells were cotransfected with firefly and Renilla luciferase genes driven by probasin and SV40 promoter, respectively, alone or together with Gαs Q227L.

Cells were exposed to fixed concentrations of DHT (10-10 or 10-11m) that only minimally activate the AR (see Fig. 2A). As expected from the studies described above, ISO alone could induce the dose-dependent increase in reporter activity (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, in the presence of 10-10m DHT, ISO treatment activated the AR to similar levels as those achieved by saturating concentrations of androgen. Together, these data demonstrate that simulation of endogenous β2-AR-Gs signaling cooperates with castrate levels of androgen to maximally activate the AR.Expression of activated Gαs (Fig. 1A) as well as stimulation of β2-AR (Fig. 2B) promotes the activation of the AR. To establish a role for Gs in the β2-AR-mediated activation of the AR, we employed a peptide inhibitor of receptor-mediated Gs signaling, Gαs-ct (23Feldman D.S. Zamah A.M. Pierce K.L. Miller W.E. Kelly F. Rapacciuolo A. Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28631-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Expression of the Gαs-ct peptide (Fig. 2C) obliterated the ISO-mediated activation of the AR (Fig. 2D). Remarkably, the expression of Gαs-ct peptide also significantly impacted the direct activation of AR by androgen (Fig. 2D). These data demonstrate involvement of Gs in the β2-AR-mediated activation of AR and suggest that some low level of Gs signaling is permissive for androgen-mediated activation of the AR as well.cAMP Regulates AR Activation—Stimulation of the β2-AR induces the Gs-mediated activation of the AR. The best studied signaling pathway engaged by activated β2-AR involves the Gs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclases that synthesize cAMP. Stimulation of the LNCaP cells with ISO induced the robust accumulation of intracellular cAMP, and, unexpectedly, treatment with androgen also promoted the modest but significant accumulation of cAMP (Table I). To implicate cAMP in the signaling pathway from activated β2-AR to AR, we examined the effect of the cAMP-degrading enzyme PDE on AR activation. Ectopic expression of the PDE4D isoform (24Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E. McLean A.J. Conti M. Houslay M.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) almost completely suppressed the ISO-induced activation of the AR (Fig. 3A). The expression of PDE4D also significantly attenuated the androgen-mediated activation of the AR (Fig. 3A), again arguing for a permissive role for cAMP in the androgen-mediated activation of the AR. Together with the studies described above, these data establish the existence of a β2-AR → Gαs → cAMP → AR signaling pathway.Table IAgonist-induced cAMP accumulation in LNCaP cellsConditionscAMP productionBasal0.396 ± 0.092 nmISO (10 μm)16.153 ± 1.584 nmTestosterone (1 μm)0.975 ± 0.216 nm Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Mechanisms of ISO-regulated transactivation of AR.

Cells were transfected with a gene encoding FLAG-VASP, pretreated with the indicated concentration of H89 for 30 min, and stimulated with ISO (10 μm) for 5 min. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. C and D, H89 inhibits the ISO- and DHT-regulated transactivation of AR. Cells were pretreated with the indicated concentration of H89 for 30 min prior to stimulation with increasing concentrations of ISO or DHT. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of the normalized luciferase activities obtained from five independent experiments performed in duplicate. E, H89 inhibits the ISO- and R1881-mediated expression of endogenous PSA protein. LNCaP cells were pretreated with H89 (30 μm) for 30 min prior to daily stimulation with ISO (10 μm) or R1881 (5 nm) for 2 days. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-PSA antibody (upper panel). The filter was stripped of IgG and reblotted with anti-actin antibody (lower panel) to show the equal protein loading in each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Modulations in cellular levels of cAMP control activity of several target proteins, including protein kinase A (PKA), Rap exchange factor activated by cAMP (Epac), and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. The most widely studied of these target proteins is PKA; hence, we tested the ability of ISO to activate PKA in LNCaP cells by measuring the phosphorylation state of VASP, a known substrate of PKA (25Krause M. Dent E.W. Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Gertler F.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 541-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In the absence of β2-AR stimulation, VASP is unphosphorylated but becomes phosphorylated in response to stimulation with ISO (Fig. 3B). Next, we tested whether PKA plays a role in the activation of the AR. First, we determined the optimal concentration of the specific PKA inhibitor isoquinoline H89 (26Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) needed to block PKA activation in the LNCaP cells. Pretreatment with H89 resulted in the dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylated VASP following stimulation with ISO (Fig. 3B) with essentially complete inhibition of PKA activation at an H89 concentration of 30 μm. A similar treatment of the LNCaP cells with H89 resulted in the dose-dependent reduction of ISO-induced activation of the AR (Fig. 3C). The treatment with androgen also promoted the modest phosphorylation of VASP (data not shown), and H89 inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the androgen-mediated activation of the AR (Fig. 3D). These results are consistent with data showing that inhibition of PKA activity with the peptide PKI attenuates the androgen-induced activation of AR in monkey kidney CV1 cells (27Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Brinkmann A.O. Endocr. Res. 1996; 22: 197-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).To further confirm a role for PKA in the Gs-mediated AR activation, we tested the effect of H89 on agonist-stimulated expression of endogenous PSA protein. LNCaP cells were pretreated with H89 (30 μm) followed by stimulation with ISO or R1881. We observed that exposure to H89 attenuated both ISO- and R1881-induced expression of PSA (Fig. 3E). Together, these data demonstrate that PKA regulates both the transactivation of AR by ISO and the activation of AR by androgens.The AR is a phosphoprotein, and reversible phosphorylation of AR is required for its activity (28Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19900-19909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). A recent study showing treatment of cells with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin promotes phosphorylation of the AR on residue Ser650 led to the conclusion that PKA phosphorylates AR only on Ser650 to regulate its activity (29Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol.

To assess whether this event could account for our observations of PKA-dependent activation of the AR, we examined ability of the AR S650A mutant to be transcriptionally active.

Despite these similarities, targeted disruption of the HIF-α genes in mice results in distinctly different phenotypes demonstrating nonredundancy of function, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report on the novel and specific interaction of HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, with the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) using immunoprecipitation, mammalian two-hybrid, and in vitro protein interaction assays.

Aerobic organisms are critically dependent upon the supply of oxygen for fundamental processes such as energy production. Consequently, oxygen deprivation represents a serious cellular stress, which is a major modulator of gene expression. Central to this response in both adult and embryonic organisms are the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, HIF-1α 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE, hypoxia-response element; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; TAD, transactivation domain; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DBD, DNA-binding domain; En, embryonic day n; IKK, IκB kinase complex; NRP, NEMO-related protein; C-TAD, C-terminal TAD. and HIF-2α, members of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim transcription factor family. Under normoxic conditions, the HIF-α proteins are rapidly degraded and transcriptionally repressed. During hypoxia, stabilized HIF-α proteins migrate into the nucleus and heterodimerize with the obligate basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim partner protein, the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator ARNT (also called HIF-1β). The heterodimer then binds hypoxic response elements (HREs) within the regulatory regions of a variety of target genes to up-regulate their expression (1.Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). These genes typically function to both increase oxygen supply to tissues and facilitate metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1α and HIF-2α possess 48% amino acid sequence similarity, overlapping expression patterns, and a common requirement for ARNT to bind DNA and up-regulate expression of a largely shared group of target genes. In addition, the activity of both proteins is controlled through hydroxylation of key proline and asparagine residues in the conserved oxygen-dependent degradation domain and transactivation domain (TAD), respectively, regulating protein stability and transactivation potential (2.Jaakkola P.

However, despite these similarities, HIF-1α- and HIF-2α-deficient mice manifest distinct phenotypes and hence have nonredundant functions. HIF-1α-deficient mice display defective vasculature and mesenchymal cell death (5.Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y.

Marck B.T. Matsumoto A.M. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Bennett M.J. Garcia J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Concomitant with these phenotypes, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating different responses between the HIF-α proteins in relation to cellular localization, hypoxic responsiveness, and target gene expression (12.Park S.K.

In an effort to further understand differential HIF-α regulation, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using as bait a C-terminal portion of HIF-2α, which represents the region of greatest sequence divergence between the HIF-α proteins (mHIF-2α residues 565–820). The NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO, also called IKK-γ and IKK complex-associated protein-1) was identified as a HIF-2α-interacting protein. Mammalian two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the interaction of NEMO is specific for HIF-2α and not HIF-1α. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this physical interaction has a functional effect, specifically increasing the normoxic activity of HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with a model by which NEMO aids CBP/p300 recruitment to HIF-2α.

Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Key experiments were repeated with human HIF-2α, excised AseI/XbaI from HIF2α-pcDNA3 (Dr. R. Bruick, University of Texas), and cloned into pEF-IRES-puro by NdeI/SpeI. 4×NFκB RE-luciferase was a gift from Dr. A. Bert (Institute for Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia). mHIF-2α(565–820)-pDBLeu, used for yeast two-hybrid screening, was generated by inserting a HIF-2α PCR product into pDBLeu (Invitrogen) by SpeI/NotI. hHIF-1α(597–775) and mHIF-2α(565–820) were cloned into pET-32a (Novagen) for in vitro translation by NcoI/NotI digestion of a HIF-1α PCR product or HIF2α-pDBLeu, respectively, into similarly digested pET-32a. hHIF-1α(597–775) and hHIF-1α(597–824) PCR products and mHIF-2α(565–820)-pDBLeu and mHIF-2α(565–870)-pD-BLeu were cut with NheI/NotI and inserted into similarly digested pEF-bos-GalDBD. pEF-hHIF-1α (597–775)-GalDBD-bos was digested NdeI/NotI for cloning of this HIF-1α insert into similarly digested pEF-bos-VP16. mHIF-2α(565–820) was fused with VP16 by SpeI/NotI HIF-2α excision from pDBLeu and insertion into NheI/NotI-digested pEF-bos-VP16. NEMO was cloned into the pEF-6Myc-bos and pEF-GalDBD-bos expression vectors by SalI/NotI from pPC86 (Invitrogen cDNA library). To generate pEF-6Myc-bos, a 6-Myc tag was amplified by PCR and cloned KpnI/SalI into pEF-bos (17.Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). NEMO N- and C-terminal deletion mutants and NEMO(1–358) were PCR-amplified and cloned into pEF-bos-GalDBD and pEF-GST-IRES-puro, respectively, by NdeI/NotI digestion. pEF-GST-IRES-puro itself was generated by the XhoI/MluI insertion of GST from pGEX-3T (Amersham Biosciences) into pEF-IRES-puro. NEMO was cloned in the reverse direction to generate an antisense construct by SalI/XbaI digestion of pEF-bos-6Myc-NEMO and NheI/XhoI of pEF-IRES-puro (18.Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C.

NRP (Johan Peranen, University of Helsinki) was amplified by PCR and ligated into pEF-bos-GalDBD by SalI/NotI. The p300-VP16 expression vector was a gift from George Muscat (University of Queensland). pEF-bos-VP16 and pEF-bos-GalDBD plasmids were generated by inserting the oligonucleotide TCGAGAGCCCCACCCCGGGTACCGACTGGAATCATGCTAGCGGATCCGCGGCCGCTAAGTAAGT into SalI/XbaI-digested GalO and pNL-VP16, then excising the multiple cloning site and either VP16-AD or GalDBD with BglII/XbaI, and inserting into BamHI/XbaI-digested pEF-bos (17.Goldman L.A.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening of 1.5 × 106 transformants from a E10.5 whole mouse cDNA library (Invitrogen) was performed using the Proquest Matchmaker two-hybrid system (Invitrogen). Initial selection was performed on -Leu/-Trp/-His + 30 mm 3-aminotriazole plates, prior to more stringent analysis with the two additional reporters. Cell Culture and Reporter Assays—HEK 293T and Jurkat cells were routinely grown at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) or RPMI (Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections into 40–60% confluent 293Ts or 2 × 105 Jurkat cells/well (24 well tray format) were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amounts of DNA transfected are given within the figure legends. The total amount of DNA transfected into each well was normalized with the addition of appropriate empty vector (pEF-IRES-puro or pEF-BOS). Luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reagent assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using RLTK-luciferase as a transfection control. GST Pull-downs, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting— Preparation of whole cell extracts were performed as previously described (19.Whitelaw M. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2504-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). 35S-labeled proteins were generated using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instruction. In pull-down assays, 200 μg of total protein (whole cell extracts) was incubated with 50 μl of 50% glutathione-agarose (Scientifix) and bound at 4°C for 1 h in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Resin was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline with centrifuging after each wash (1,000 rpm/1 min/4°C) and eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. α-ARNT immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 2C) was performed as previously described, using 250 μg of total protein and an anti-ARNT polyclonal rabbit serum raised against residues 1–140 of human ARNT (20.Woods S.L. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10236-10243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). α-NEMO immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 2D) was performed as above, using 400 μg of hypotonic extract, prepared by suspension in hypotonic extract buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), freezing at -80°C, thawing on ice and incubation with 420 mm NaCl (30 min/4°C), and centrifugation to obtain solubilized protein. Western blots were performed by separating proteins by SDS-PAGE, transferring to nitrocellulose, and detecting using α-Myc 9E10 mouse monoclonal, α-GalDBD (Santa Cruz), α-NEMO (Santa Cruz), or a rabbit α-HIF-2α (inoculated with HIF-2α(565–820)) polyclonal serum and visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO) or a protein-A horseradish peroxidase conjugate (ICN) for NEMO immunoprecipitation. Identification of NEMO as a HIF-2α-interacting Protein—To identify novel HIF-2α-interacting proteins, amino acids 565–820 of mouse HIF-2α fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DBD) were used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse E10.5 cDNA library. This region of HIF-2α represents the area of greatest amino acid sequence divergence between the HIF-α proteins (Fig. 1A). The screening of 1.5 × 106 separate transformants yielded 33 clones positive for each of the Ura, LacZ, and His reporter genes. Among these, full-length NEMO was identified as a candidate-interacting protein. NEMO is required for NF-κB activation by virtually all known stimuli, acting as a nonenzymatic molecular scaffold to assemble the IKK complex containing both IKK-α and IKK-β kinases (21.Yamaoka S.

This complex is then able to phosphorylate and initiate the ubiquitylation and degradation of the inhibitory IκB proteins in response to NF-κB-activating stimuli. It is postulated NEMO may have additional scaffolding roles, binding upstream NF-κB activators and recruiting them to the IKK complex. To confirm the HIF-2α/NEMO interaction in a mammalian system, two-hybrid assays were performed in HEK 293T cells after switching the identity of the fusion partners relative to the yeast system (Fig. 1B). Results demonstrate both HIF-2α(565–820)-VP16 and full-length HIF-2α interact with Gal4DBD-NEMO under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Strikingly, mammalian two-hybrid assays indicate that NEMO does not interact with the corresponding region of HIF-1α(597–775) and interacts only very weakly with full-length protein. NRP, or FIP2, is a Golgi-associated, cytokine-inducible protein with 53% amino acid similarity to NEMO (29.Li Y. Kang J. Horwitz M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30.Schwamborn K. Weil R. Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22780-22789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the NEMO/HIF-2α interaction, NRP-GalDBD fusions were also analyzed by mammalian two-hybrid assay. The results demonstrate that the interaction between HIF-2α and NEMO is specific because NRP does not interact with HIF-2α (Fig. 1C). The interaction of HIF-2α and NEMO within cells was confirmed using GST pull-down experiments with protein extracts from cells expressing Myc-tagged NEMO and HIF-2α-GST fusion proteins. Using glutathione-agarose, HIF-2α (565–820)-GST, but not GST itself, effectively pulled down full-length Myc-tagged NEMO (Fig. 2A, upper right panel). An unrelated Myc-tagged protein, mouse adiponectin receptor 1, was included as a control and was not pulled down by either HIF-2α(565–820)-GST or GST alone. The specific pull-down of NEMO-Myc, but not adiponectin receptor-Myc, by HIF-2α(565–820)-GST is not due to differences in expression levels of Myc-tagged proteins (Fig. 2A, upper left panel) or the level of HIF-2α-GST bound to glutathione-agarose between samples (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). To further characterize this interaction, pull-down experiments were performed using in vitro transcribed/translated HIF-α protein and mammalian cell extracts containing GST-NEMO. As anticipated, HIF-2α(565–820) was pulled down strongly by NEMO(1–358)-GST relative to GST alone, whereas NEMO(1–358)-GST did not efficiently pull-down the equivalent region of HIF-1α (Fig. 2B, middle panel). In this experiment, HIF-1α was translated less efficiently than HIF-2α; however, an overexposure of the autoradiogram demonstrates that the very low levels of HIF-1α pulled down by GST is nonspecific and not enhanced by NEMO (Fig. 2B, right panel). Furthermore, in multiple other experiments with varying levels of in vitro transcribed and translated HIF-1α, only very low levels of nonspecific binding were ever observed. This parallels Fig. 1 in that NEMO specifically associates with HIF-2α but not HIF-1α. ARNT immunoprecipitation was also able to co-precipitate full-length Myc-tagged NEMO when co-transfected with HIF-2α but not HIF-1α (Fig. 2C). This not only provides further evidence for the interaction of NEMO and HIF-2α in vivo but also suggests the possibility of NEMO being present within transcriptionally active HIF-2α/ARNT heterodimeric complexes. Significantly, the overexpression of NEMO did not significantly affect the ability of ARNT to immunoprecipitate HIF-α. Finally, these experiments were all performed using overexpressed proteins. Therefore, it was critical to demonstrate the interaction between endogenous HIF-2α and NEMO. Because normoxic HIF-2α was not detectable in any cell line tested, includingmouseembryonicfibroblasts(12.Park S.K. Dadak A.M. Haase V.H. Fontana L. Giaccia A.J. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4959-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar),weutilizeddipyridyl-treated HepG2 cells, which expressed considerable amounts of HIF-2α protein. The mammalian two-hybrid assays have previously demonstrated that the HIF-2α/NEMO interaction can occur equally well in hypoxic or normoxic conditions (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitation experiments using α-NEMO antibodies clearly show that endogenous HIF-2α co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous NEMO, and this is specific because the use of a nonspecific antibody has no effect (Fig. 2D). In this experiment, immunoprecipitated NEMO and HIF-2α ran slightly higher in size to that observed in protein extracts, presumably because of the abundance of protein within immunoprecipitated samples. In conjunction with Fig. 1, these results indicate that in both yeast and mammalian cells, NEMO physically interacts with HIF-2α but not HIF-1α. Defining a Minimal HIF-2α-binding Site on NEMO—Based upon the predicted domain architecture of NEMO from its primary amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A), a series of N- and C-terminal NEMO deletion mutants were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and analyzed for HIF-2α interaction via mammalian two-hybrid assays. Full interaction was maintained with removal of both the N-terminal 49 amino acids of NEMO and the C-terminal zinc finger domain (Fig. 3B, deletion mutant 50–358). Further deletion at either end resulted in a dramatic loss of HIF-2α binding. Western analysis confirmed that the loss of reporter activity was not a result of decreased protein expression, because Gal4DBD-NEMO deletions (for example amino acids 1–302 and 196–358), which bind HIF-2α poorly, expressed better than the 1–358 and 50–358 constructs that bind HIF-2α with the same affinity as full-length NEMO (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that amino acids 50–358 of NEMO are required for high affinity interaction with amino acids 565–820 of HIF-2α. NEMO Dose-dependently Increases HIF-2α Activity—To characterize the functional effect of the HIF-2α/NEMO interaction, NEMO was overexpressed in HEK 293T cells co-transfected with a HRE luciferase reporter gene together with either HIF-2α or HIF-1α (Fig. 4A). HIF-α overexpression increased HRE activity at normoxia, presumably through titration of inhibitory hydroxylases. NEMO overexpression dose-dependently increased normoxic HIF-2α-dependent reporter gene activity but had no significant effect with HIF-1α. At the highest levels of NEMO, HIF-2α-driven reporter expression increased to a maximum of ∼3-fold. As a result of either a nonspecific NEMO overexpression effect or the potential weak interaction between NEMO and full-length HIF-1α, transfection of highest NEMO levels also resulted in a small increase in HIF-1α-dependent reporter activity. Hypoxia, a major stimulus of HIF-α activation, dramatically increased reporter activity, overriding the positive influence of NEMO at the lower HIF-2α levels in normoxia (Fig. 4A). NEMO expression similarly increased normoxic HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, reporter activity in Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating that this effect is not specific for 293T cells (Fig. 4B). To support the notion that the effect of NEMO overexpression on HIF-2α activity is a result of physical interaction, Gal4DBD-tagged NEMO deletion mutants were also assayed for their affect on HRE-driven reporter activity (Fig. 4C). In agreement with data in Fig. 3B, GalDBD-NEMO deletion mutants capable of HIF-2α binding up-regulated HIF-2α activity to similar extents, whereas an interaction-deficient NEMO deletion mutant (GalDBD-NEMO 1–302) did not significantly alter HIF-2α activity. As anticipated, none of the NEMO constructs had a significant affect on HIF-1α activation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NEMO is specifically able to up-regulate HIF-2α transcriptional activity on a HRE-driven reporter gene in a cellular context and that this is dependent upon its high affinity interaction with HIF-2α. HIF-2α Does Not Affect NF-κB Activation—Because NEMO is essential for NF-κB activation in response to virtually all known stimuli (21.Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 23.Li Y. Kang J. Friedman J. Tarassishin L. Ye J. Kovalenko A. Wallach D. Horwitz M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of transient overexpression of HIF-α on a NF-κB-responsive reporter gene. In both 293T (Fig. 5A) and Jurkat (Fig. 5B) cells, expression of neither HIF-1α nor HIF-2α significantly changed NF-κB reporter activity under these assay conditions. Similarly, HIF-α expression did not have a major effect on NF-κB activation by the known inducers tumor necrosis factor α or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in 293T cells (Fig. 5C). Endogenous NEMO Increases HIF-2α Activity—To investigate the influence of endogenous NEMO on HIF-2α activity, the cDNA for NEMO was subcloned into an expression vector in the reverse orientation to produce an antisense transcript, enabling down-regulation of cellular NEMO levels in 293T cells. As expected, expression of antisense NEMO resulted in the decreased activity of a HRE reporter gene driven by HIF-2α but not HIF-1α (Fig. 6A). The reduction in HIF-2α activity, although significant, was not complete. This is likely attributable to the incomplete knockdown of NEMO expression, as shown with co-expression of the antisense transcript with trace amounts of Myc-tagged NEMO (Fig. 6B), or factors other than solely NEMO being responsible for the higher intrinsic activity of HIF-2α, compared with HIF-1α, on a HRE reporter. For example, differential activity of the N-terminal TAD. In addition to NEMO overexpression in Fig. 4, these data implicate endogenous NEMO in the regulation of the normoxic activity of HIF-2α. NEMO Regulation Is Not Dependent upon ARNT Heterodimerization, the HIF-2α C-TAD, or Protein Stability—Because the C-TAD of HIF-2α is hypoxically regulated, crucial to HIF-2α activity, and adjacent to the NEMO-interacting region, we investigated whether the C-TAD is required for the ability of NEMO to up-regulate HIF-2α activity. The minimal NEMO-interacting region of HIF-2α (565–820), or a larger region including the C-TAD (565–874), were fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, as were the corresponding regions of HIF-1α. These constructs were transfected into 293T cells in the presence or absence of NEMO and analyzed for transcriptional activity on a Gal4-responsive reporter gene. NEMO expression specifically increased the activity of both HIF-2α constructs by similar amounts (∼2-fold), although total reporter activity mediated by HIF-2α 565–820 is greatly reduced because of the absence of an endogenous transactivation domain (Fig. 7A). Thus, up-regulation of HIF-2α activity by NEMO is not dependent upon the HIF-2α C-TAD. Consistent with previous data, NEMO had no effect on HIF-1α constructs, regardless of C-TAD presence or absence. Western analysis of whole cell lysates from the same transfected cells demonstrated that the up-regulation of HIF-2α activity by NEMO is not attributable to changes in HIF-2α protein levels, because no significant difference was observed with NEMO overexpression (Fig. 7B). Thus, NEMO/HIF-2α interaction does not appear to regulate HIF-2α activity by altering protein stability. This is supported by pulse-chase experiments indicating that NEMO does not specifically increase HIF-2α stability compared with HIF-1α (data not shown). Therefore, NEMO appears to specifically increase the transcriptional activity of the HIF-2α C terminus in a protein stability and C-TAD-independent manner. Another possible mechanism of NEMO action is increasing HIF-2α/ARNT heterodimerization. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, however, demonstrate that the ability of HIF-2α to heterodimerize with ARNT is not affected by NEMO overexpression (Fig. 2C). NEMO Increases HIF-2α Activity via p300 Recruitment— NEMO is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Ref. 24.Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). However, recent data has indicated a potential nuclear role. Genotoxic stress has been found to direct the sumoylation of a non-IKK-associated portion of NEMO, resulting in nuclear accumulation (31.Huang T.T. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Wu Z.H. Miyamoto S.

Since its initial isolation (1.Mosbah A. Kharrat R. Renisio J.G. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. El Ayeb M. Darbon H. Toxicon. 1999; 37: 1233Google Scholar), MCa has been successfully produced by chemical synthesis, which allows the characterization of its biological activity and the solution of its three-dimensional structure (2.Mosbah A. Kharrat R. Fajloun Z. Renisio J.G. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. El Ayeb M. Darbon H. Proteins. 2000; 40: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MCa has been shown to be one of the most potent effectors of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), an intracellular calcium channel target. The toxin stimulates the binding of [3H]ryanodine onto RyR1 present in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles (3.Chen L. Estève E. Sabatier J.M. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol.

It induces strong modifications in the gating of RyR1 channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers that are characterized by the appearance of long lasting subconductance states (4.Estève E.

MCa application to purified SR vesicles produces Ca2+ release, which is consistent with these biophysical effects (3.Chen L. Estève E. Sabatier J.M. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J.

Using a calcium-imaging approach, it was also shown that the addition of MCa to the extracellular medium of cultured myotubes induces Ca2+ release from the SR into the cytoplasm (4.Estève E.

These observations were confirmed with the identification of the binding site of MCa on RyR1, which indicates a cytoplasmic localization (6.Altafaj X. Cheng W. Estève E. Urbani J. Grunwald D. Sabatier J.M. Coronado R. De Waard M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4013-4016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). According to the 1H NMR analysis of MCa, the peptide presents three disulfide bridges (Cys3–Cys17, Cys10–Cys21, and Cys16–Cys32) and folds along an inhibitor cystine knot motif (2.Mosbah A. Kharrat R. Fajloun Z. Renisio J.G. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. El Ayeb M. Darbon H. Proteins. 2000; 40: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MCa contains three β-strands from amino acid residues 9–11 (strand 1), 20–23 (strand 2), and 30–33 (strand 3), respectively. The β-strands 2 and 3 form an antiparallel β-sheet. It is a highly basic peptide that contains eleven basic amino acid residues (33% of the molecule composition). Interestingly enough, eight of the eleven basic residues are oriented toward the same face of the molecule (Fig. 1A). Two pieces of evidence suggest that MCa should be able to cross the plasma membrane to reach its intracellular target. First, MCa has biological activity consistent with the direct activation of RyR1 when added to the extracellular medium. Second, a structural analysis of MCa reveals a stretch of positively charged amino acid residues that is reminiscent of the protein transduction domains (PTD) found in proteins, such as Tat from the HIV-1 virus (7.Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 8.Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar), the Drosophila homeotic transcription factor ANTP (encoded by the antennapedia gene) (9.Dorn A. Affolter M. Gehring W.J. Leupin W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 61: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) VP22 transcription vector (10.Lundberg M. Johansson M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to these domains are called cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and have in common the inherent trait of containing many basic residues (arginine and lysine), often oriented toward the same face of the molecule (Fig. 1B). Because of this structural feature, CPPs possess the interesting ability to cross biological membranes in a receptor- or transporter-independent manner (11.Prochiantz A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 12.Schwarze S.R. Dowdy S.F. Trends Pharmacol.

These peptides seem to target the lipid bilayer directly, using complementary charges, and penetrate the cell through a mechanism called translocation, which remains unclear. Three possible models have been put forth in the literature to explain peptide penetration: 1) the inverted mycelle model (14.Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with its membrane-destabilization model variant (11.Prochiantz A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), 2) the carpet model (15.Pouny Y. Rapaport D. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12416-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and 3) the pore formation model (16.Gazit E. Lee W.J. Brey P.T. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10681-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise mode of entry, CPPs possess unique features worth mentioning: (i) delivery in 100% of the cells (17.Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar), (ii) delivery in all cell types both in vitro and in vivo (18.Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 19.Gratton J.P. Yu J. Griffith J.W. Babbitt R.W. Scotland R.S. Hickey R. Giordano F.J. Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), (iii) the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (18.Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar), and (iv) the potential to act as carriers and to translocate large compounds, such as proteins and oligonucleotides (20.Dunican D.J. Doherty P. Biopolymers. 2001; 60: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The current study investigated the ability of MCa to penetrate into cells. We showed that a biotinylated version of MCa effectively and rapidly enters various cell types and behaves as a good carrier to allow the penetration of larger compounds. As for other CPPs, the mechanism of cell penetration is not linked to an endocytotic pathway. We concluded that MCa represents a new class of disulfide-linked CPP and is the first scorpion toxin shown to enter cells. Chemical Synthesis of MCa and Biotinylated Mca—N-α-Fmoc-l-amino acids, 4-hydroxymethylphenyloxy resin, and reagents used for peptide synthesis were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. N-α-Fmoc-l-Lys(Biotin)-OH was purchased from Neosystem Groupe Societe Nationale des Poudres et Explosifs. The MCa and biotinylated MCa (MCab) were obtained by solid phase peptide synthesis (21.Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), using an automated peptide synthesizer (Model 433A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Peptide chains were assembled stepwise on 0.25 meq of hydroxymethylphenyloxy resin (1% cross-linked; 0.89 meq of amino group/g) using 1 mmol of N-α-Fmoc amino acid derivatives. The side chain-protecting groups were as follows: trityl for Cys and Asn; tert-butyl for Ser, Thr, Glu, and Asp; pentamethylchroman for Arg; and tert-butyloxycarbonyl or Biotin for Lys. N-α-Amino groups were deprotected by treatment with 18 and 20% (v/v) piperidine/N-methylpyrrolidone for 3 and 8 min, respectively. The Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were coupled (20 min) the same as their hydroxybenzotriazole-active esters in N-methylpyrrolidone (4-fold excess). To obtain MCa, an aliquot of peptide resin was removed at its corresponding cycle. After peptide chain assembly, the peptide resin (∼0.9 g) was treated between 2 and 3 h at room temperature in constant shaking with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid:H2O/thioanisol/ethanedithiol (88:5/5/2, v/v) in the presence of crystalline phenol (2.25 g). The peptide mixture was then filtered, and the filtrate was precipitated by adding cold tert-butylmethyl ether. The crude peptide was pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant was discarded. The reduced peptide was then dissolved in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, at a final concentration of 2.5 mm and stirred under air to allow oxidation/folding (between 50 and 72 h, room temperature). The target products, MCa and MCab, were purified to homogeneity, first by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, C18 Aquapore ODS, 20 μm, 250 × 10 mm) by means of a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/0–30% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 6 ml/min (λ = 230 nm). A second step of purification of MCa and MCab was achieved by ion exchange chromatography on a carboxymethyl cellulose matrix using 10 mm (buffer A) and 500 mm (buffer B) sodium phosphate buffers, pH 9.0 (60-min linear gradient from 0 to 60% buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min). The homogeneity and identity of MCa or MCab were assessed by the following: (i) analytical C18 reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Merck, C18 Li-Chrospher, 5 μm, 4 × 200 mm) using a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; (ii) amino acid analysis after acidolysis (6 n HCl/2% (w/v) phenol, for 20 h at 118 °C in N2 atmosphere); and (iii) mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Formation of the MCab·Streptavidin-Cyanine 3 Complex—Soluble streptavidin-cyanine 3 (Strept-Cy3, Amersham Biosciences) was mixed with four molar equivalents of MCab (1 mm) for 2 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline. Preparation of Heavy SR Vesicles—Heavy SR vesicles were prepared following the method of Kim et al. (22.Kim D.H. Onhishi S.T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9662-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified as described previously (23.Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J.

Cell Cultures—L6 cells (rat myogenic L6 cells) were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures ECACC (clone C5) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Differentiation of L6 cells was induced by a shift to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% horse serum) when they reached confluence, as described previously (24.Seigneurin-Venin S. Parrish E. Marty I. Rieger F. Romey G. Villaz M. Garcia L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CA1 Hippocampal Neurons—Hippocampi from neonatal mice (between days 1 and 2 postpartum) were dissected, cleaned of meninges, and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). They were transferred into a dissociation medium containing Hanks' balanced salt solution, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2,000 units/ml DNase I and 1% (w/v) trypsin/EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 7 min. After sedimentation, the supernatant was removed, and the tissue was washed with a Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The tissue was gently triturated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2,000 units/ml DNase I, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with a plastic pipette until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. After centrifugation at 100 × g for 1 min, the cell pellet was resuspended in Neurobasal/B27 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mm l-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cell cultures were seeded at a density of 105 cells/cm2 on culture dishes coated previously with 20 μg/ml poly(l-lysine) at 37 °C for 2 h. After 2 days, 3 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to the cultures to control the proliferation of non-neuronal cells, and 24 h later, half of the medium was replaced. The culture medium was then subsequently changed every other day. HEK293 Cells—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, Invitrogen) were passaged by 1% trypsin treatment prior to confluence and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and were placed into an incubator and 5% CO2. The culture medium was changed every other day. [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—Heavy SR vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h in an assay buffer composed of 5 nm [3H]ryanodine, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm Ca2+ (pCa = 5), and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. 100 nm MCa or MCab·Strept-Cy3 were added prior to the addition of heavy SR vesicles. [3H]Ryanodine bound to heavy SR vesicles was measured by filtration through Whatman GF/B glass filters followed by three washes with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. [3H]Ryanodine retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled ryanodine. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Ca2+Release Measurements—Ca2+ release from heavy SR vesicles was measured using the Ca2+-sensitive dye antipyrylazo III. The absorbance was monitored at 710 nm by a diode array spectrophotometer (MOS-200 optical system, Biologic, Claix, France). Heavy SR vesicles (50 μg) were actively loaded with Ca2+ at 37 °C in 2 ml of a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 7.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, supplemented with 250 μm antipyrylazo III, 1 mm ATP/MgCl2, 5 mm phosphocreatine, and 12 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (25.Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6142-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ loading was started by sequential additions of 50 and 20 μm CaCl2. In these loading conditions, no calcium-induced calcium release interfered with the observations. At the end of each experiment, Ca2+ remaining in the vesicles was determined by the addition of 4 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Sigma), and the absorbance signal was calibrated by two consecutive additions of 20 μm CaCl2. Imaging on Fixed Cells—Cell cultures were incubated with 100 nm (final concentration) of the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex in the cell culture medium in the dark and at room temperature, unless otherwise stated, for 30 min or 1 h. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed at room temperature and in the dark by 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted with fluorescence antifading medium (Dako) for observation with the confocal microscope. All conditions were compared under identical settings. The samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP2 operating system. Cy3 fluorescence was excited using the 543-nm line of a helium-neon laser, and the fluorescence emission was collected from 554 to 625 nm. Imaging on Living Cells—Living cells were incubated at room temperature in fresh culture medium on the stage of an upright compound microscope (Eclipse 600 FN, Nikon) equipped with a water immersion 40× objective (numerical aperture 0.8) and a confocal head (PCM 2000, Nikon) or with the Leica TCS-SP2 microscope with a 100× objective under “XYZt” mode. MCab·Strept-Cy3 penetration kinetics were followed immediately after injection of this complex at 100 nm into the culture medium. Cy3 fluorescence was excited with the 488-nm wavelength line of an argon laser. Emitted light was filtered by a 595 ± 35-nm filter. Images were acquired and analyzed with the EZ2000 software (Nikon). Relative fluorescence quantitative analysis was realized on the stack using the devoted Leica software. Synthesis of Biotinylated MCa and Complex Formation with Cy3-labeled Streptavidine—We have previously identified MCa as a potent activator of the skeletal muscle RyR1 calcium channel (3.Chen L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37822-37831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As RyR1 is an intracellular target, these observations suggested that MCa may modulate RyR1 by one of two mechanisms: (i) indirectly through binding onto a plasma membrane receptor (implies no cell penetration) or (ii) directly through binding onto RyR1 itself (implies cell penetration). With the recent identification of a RyR1 binding site for MCa (6.Altafaj X. Cheng W. Estève E. Urbani J. Grunwald D. Sabatier J.M. Coronado R. De Waard M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4013-4016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and earlier evidence that MCa alters the gating of purified RyR1 channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers, we favor the hypothesis that MCa can reach its intracellular target directly by crossing the plasma membrane. To investigate this question, we synthesized a biotinylated version of MCa (MCab) to create a fluorescent complex MCab coupled to Cy3-labeled streptavidine (MCab·Strept-Cy3). We first tested whether biotinylation and complex formation with Strept-Cy3 impairs the functional effects of MCa on RyR1. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex retains the ability to stimulate [3H]ryanodine binding on SR vesicles (panel A) as well as to induce Ca2+ release from SR vesicles (panel B). The slower kinetics of Ca2+ release induced by the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex, as compared with MCa alone, is indicative of a slightly reduced efficiency (Fig. 2B). This difference probably stems from a reduced accessibility of MCab·Strept-Cy3 to the active MCa binding site on RyR1 because of the bulkiness of Strept-Cy3 (molecular mass of streptavidine of 60,000 Da compared with 4,108 Da for MCab). However, these data indicate that the formation of a complex with Strept-Cy3 does not alter MCa structure and regulatory function, making the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex a valid fluorescent indicator in detecting the ability of MCa to penetrate into cells. Cell Penetration of MCab·Strept-Cy3 Complex—Using the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex, we investigated the ability of MCa to transduce various cell types (Fig. 3). A primary cell culture of hippocampal CA1 neurons and two cell lines, HEK293 and L6 cells (before and after differentiation), were incubated for 30 min (room temperature) with 100 nm MCab complexed to Strept-Cy3. The cells were then fixed and the fluorescence observed by confocal microscopy. The data demonstrated that all cells were labeled, with a strong and uniform staining at the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm, whereas the nucleus is weakly labeled (Fig. 3). In contrast, cells incubated in the presence of 100 nm non-biotinylated MCa and equivalent concentrations of Strept-Cy3 do not display any labeling, demonstrating that Strept-Cy3 alone is not able to transduce into cells. The association of Strept-Cy3 with MCab is thus required for the fluorescent complex to enter cells, demonstrating the active function of MCa in this process. These data thus indicate that MCa not only acts as a CPP, but similar to many other CPPs, has the ability to cargo large molecular mass proteins (streptavidine is 14.6-fold larger than MCa). Kinetics of Cell Penetration by the MCab·Strept-Cy3 Complex—To further characterize the transduction properties of MCa, we analyzed the time course of the fluorescence labeling of living non-differentiated L6 cells by MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex. To achieve this study, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy in a way that preserved cell integrity and viability over at least a 1-h period. Cell labeling was evident for periods of time as short as 3 min after the addition of 100 nm MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex in the extracellular medium (Fig. 4A). We defined three regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to the plasma membrane (ROI-1), the cytoplasm (ROI-2), and the nucleus (ROI-3). The positioning of the different ROIs was facilitated by the analysis of the transmitted light image of the cell under observation (Fig. 4B). We then analyzed the evolution of the fluorescence intensity as a function of time in the different ROIs with a Leica confocal microscope under the XYZt mode (Fig. 4C). At the start of application of the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex at 100 nm in the bath, the fluorescence intensity increased in all cell compartments, although at different rates. The evolution was fastest and greatest for the plasma membrane (ROI-1) and reached a peak in 10 min. A slower, but nevertheless important, increase in fluorescence was also observed for the cytoplasmic compartment (ROI-2), whereas a much smaller, but above background, fluorescence increase was observed for the nucleus (ROI-3). The rate and the relative intensity at which fluorescence increased in each compartment was consistent with the direction of progression of the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex within the cell, i.e. from the extracellular space to the plasma membrane, from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm, and then from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Of note, the fluorescence signal recorded in ROI-1 corresponded to the fluorescence associated to the plasma membrane plus the cytoplasmic area close to the membrane. Because the signal was normalized, it underestimated the plasma membrane-associated fluorescence. In contrast, the relative fluorescence intensity of the cytoplasm should be more accurate. Two conclusions should be drawn from these data. First, the passage of the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is very weak, suggesting that this transition is far less favored than the two other ones. Second, the fluorescence associated to cell compartments is far greater than the fluorescence from the bath, demonstrating that cells act as MCa “concentrators.” We also followed the evolution of the fluorescence once the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex was washed out of the bath, i.e. after 12 min of MCab·Strept-Cy3 application and 5 min of wash (Fig. 4C). We observed that the fluorescence intensity of ROI-1 decreased, whereas that of ROI-2 increased. ROI-3 fluorescence intensity remained constant. The fluorescence increase of the cytoplasmic compartment must thus be related to a continued transfer of the complex from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. This plasma membrane/cytoplasm transfer is probably the rate-limiting step in MCa entry. The decrease in fluorescence intensity of the plasma membrane must thus result both from a leakage of the fluorescent complex to the extracellular medium and from its transfer to the cytoplasm. Longer periods of observations were precluded by the appearance of an inhomogeneous distribution of the fluorescent dye in the cytoplasm, maybe linked to degradation pathways (data not shown). However, we conclude from these data that complexes of MCab·Strept-Cy3 that penetrate into cells appear to stably remain inside the cell, suggesting that MCa has a favored direction of plasma membrane crossing. Endocytosis Is Not Required for Translocation of the MCab·Strept-Cy3 Complex—Several cell mechanisms are known that may allow the entry of MCa. Transduction mechanisms are postulated to be energy-independent and do not require a specific receptor for translocation across the plasma membrane, whereas endocytosis and pinocytosis are energy-dependent. Although a contribution of an endocytotic process is possible, two reasons suggest that it is not the primary mode of entry of MCa. First, the distribution of the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex in the cytoplasm is quite uniform. Second, the normal intracellular target of MCa (RyR1) requires a direct release of MCa into the cytoplasm, which is hardly compatible with endocytosis. We, nevertheless, investigated the contribution of energy-dependent processes in the entry of the MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex (Fig. 5). We first tested the effect of decreasing the temperature on the entry of MCab·Strept-Cy3 complex (Fig. 5B). The data unambiguously demonstrated that the entry of the complex still occurs at 4 °C. At this temperature, the complex similarly labels the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm. Also, we tested the effect of specific inhibitors of pinocytosis and endocytosis. Neither 3 mm amiloride (Fig. 5C) nor 50 μm nystatin (Fig. 5D) had any effect on the cell entry of the complex or its relative distribution in the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, again confirming that the main pathway for entry of MCa into cells does not involve either endocytosis or pinocytosis. In this study, we demonstrated that MCa has the ability to translocate into cells by crossing the plasma membrane. This process is rapid, because translocation appears evident even for incubation times as short as 1 or 2 min. It reaches saturation in the plasma membrane around 10 min, although longer times were required for entry into the cytoplasm. This is consistent with the kinetics of entry of other CPPs with a peak of entry of 15 min for the Tat·p27Kip1 (26.Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) and Tat·β-galactosidase complexes (18.Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we coupled MCab to streptavidine, which is of significantly higher mass than MCa itself, demonstrating that MCa can also carry large molecules into cells, similar to other CPPs (27.Anderson D.C. Nichols E. Manger R. Woodle D. Barry M. Fritzberg A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28.Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The fact that MCab is so efficient with such a large cargo suggests that uncoupled MCa should be even more efficient when added to the extracellular medium of cells. Indeed, it was observed that Ca2+ release from myotubes alone occurred as fast as 3 s after the addition of MCa, suggesting a much faster translocation in the absence of a cargo molecule. The demonstration that uncoupled MCa has an even faster kinetics of cell entry awaits the synthesis of a fluorescent derivative of MCa. Attempts to produce such a derivative have been unsuccessful so far. In our experiments, we used a concentration of MCab (100 nm) that is in the range for which other CPPs demonstrate efficient translocation (usually between 25 to 200 nm (17.Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). We show that translocation of MCa occurs at 4 °C, as well as in the presence of inhibitors of pinocytosis and endocytosis, demonstrating that the process is energy-independent, similar to other CPPs (17.Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar, 29.Elliot G. O'Hare P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Although the current mechanism of MCa translocation is unknown, we can only propose that it may occur along one of the mechanisms suggested for other CPPs. As with other CPPs, we found that maurocalcine has the ability to effectively translocate in different cell types, suggesting that the process is insensitive to the nature of the biological membrane or to the types of receptors expressed on its surface. It is thought that CPPs interact with the plasma membrane before translocation through their positively charged surface, presumably with negative charges present at the extracellular surface of the lipid bilayer (31.Lindgren M. Hallbrink M. Prochiantz A. Langel U. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Because MCa also possesses such a positively charged surface, we can assume that it interacts with the lipid bilayer in a manner akin to other CPPs. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that endocytosis may represent an additional contributing factor to MCa cell entry for longer periods of incubation, although we did not investigate this question. Referencing the literature, we noticed that all CPPs are small peptides. In Tat, the PTD encompasses the basic amino acid residues 47–57 (17.Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar, 32.Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 33.Ezhevsky S.A. Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Gius D.R. Wei M.C. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10699-10704Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), whereas in VP22 and ANTP, the PTD goes from residues 267 to 300 (29.Elliot G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) and 43 to 58 (14.Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Similarly, the putative PTD sequence of maurocalcine should be shorter than 33 amino acid residues. The sequence of MCa that triggers translocation is unknown. However, because of its similarities with other CPPs, the basic amino acid-rich sequence is the principal suspect. One intriguing observation is that part of the same basic sequence involved in translocation also appears to mediate the interaction with RyR1. For instance, mutation of Arg24 of MCa, which belongs to the putative CPP sequence, results in a complete loss of interaction with RyR1 (4.Estève E. Smida-Rezgui S. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Regaya I. Chen L. Altafaj X. Rochat H. Allen P. Pessah I.N. Marty I. Sabatier J.M. Jona I. De Waard M. Ronjat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37822-37831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Interestingly, part of the PTD of HIV-1 Tat, the Gly-Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg sequence, is also a potential nuclear localization sequence (12.Schwarze S.R. Dowdy S.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In addition, Tat, VP22, and ANTP are all proteins implicated in transcriptional regulation, and the PTDs are the domains that make contact with nucleic acids. This seems to indicate that PTD may intrinsically possess multiple functions, such as protein translocation (all CPPs), protein targeting (Tat), and protein (MCa) or nucleic acid (Tat, VP22 and ANTP) interaction. Overall, we thus have several arguments to believe that MCa behaves as a CPP. Similar to recognized CPP sequences, the following appears to be evident: 1) MCa is a small peptide, 2) it is positively charged, 3) it enters many cell types, 4) it enters in an efficient manner and at low concentration, 5) the translocation is a fast process that is energy-independent, and 6) it can carry a cargo molecule. It possesses yet two other essential properties that may not be shared with other CPPs, which are: 1) its apparent capacity to enter cells against its concentration gradient and 2) it enters the cell far more rapidly than its exit. The reasons for these properties are unknown, but we tentatively assume that the membrane potential may work as a driving force for cell penetration and maintenance. Because MCa is structured by disulfide bridges, it should be classified as belonging to a new class of CPP. Also, the disulfide linkage of MCa, which makes it more rigid than other CPPs, implies that the transduction mechanism at the basis of MCa cell penetration does not rely on extensive peptide unfolding. Because of the growing importance of CPPs in delivering functionally important molecules into cells, the identification of MCa will be useful to further understand the molecular basis of cell penetration of CPPs. In addition, MCa may constitute a leading compound for the design of new and efficient analogues to deliver active drugs inside cells that would otherwise have limited or no bioavailability. A new CPP may be of interest for biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies."

CTLs recognize infected cells by detecting foreign peptides presented on the cell surface in the cleft of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. When a foreign epitope (peptide plus associated MHC-I) is detected, CTLs activate the Fas death receptor pro-apoptotic pathway and secrete perforins and granzymes that lead to cell lysis (10.Berke G. Cell. 1995; 81: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Antigenic peptides are produced in the cytoplasm of almost all cell types by the proteasome and are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they assemble with the MHC-I heavy and light chains. The trimeric complex is formed with the assistance of a number of protein chaperones and, once properly folded, exits the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Ultimately, the peptide-loaded MHC-I arrive on the cell surface to display their antigens to CTLs (11.Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). To combat the anti-viral immune response, some viruses have developed strategies to disrupt antigen presentation and to thereby prevent CTL recognition of infected target cells (12.Ploegh H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2777-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Based on data collected in non-T cell lines, it was thought that Nef reduced MHC-I cell surface expression by accelerating endocytosis and promoting retrograde transport of internalized MHC-I to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (18.Le Gall S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2777-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, more recent experiments that directly compared MHC-I trafficking in Nef-expressing T cells and HeLa cells have since revealed that Nef behaves differently in T cells (25.Kasper M.R. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In T cells, the predominant effect of Nef is to disrupt transport of MHC-I from the secretory pathway to the cell surface, and this results in a more dramatic effect of Nef on MHC-I cell surface expression. Recent data has indicated that the adaptor protein, AP-1, is necessary for Nef to disrupt MHC-I trafficking (26.Roeth J.F. Williams M. Kasper M.R. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a heterotetrameric protein complex that sorts proteins by binding recognition sequences in cytoplasmic tails and linking them to clathrin. In this manner, proteins are directed from the TGN into the endolysosomal pathway. Nef targets MHC-I from the TGN to the lysosomes for degradation by promoting a physical interaction between AP-1 and the cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I (26.Roeth J.F. Williams M. Kasper M.R. Filzen T.M. Collins K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, it is not known why this pathway is more active in T cells than other cell types. We now present evidence that in T cells, Nef targets MHC-I early in the biosynthetic pathway by preferentially binding newly synthesized hypophosphorylated MHC-I. Nef then prevents MHC-I from reaching the cell surface and becoming phosphorylated. We have found that the capacity for Nef to recruit AP-1 and disrupt MHC-I trafficking is cell type-dependent. In HeLa cells, a more rapid rate of MHC-I maturation through the secretory compartment appears to limit the ability of the Nef·MHC-I complex to bind AP-1. Reducing the rate of MHC-I maturation by incubating these cells at a lower temperature rescues Nef activity and promotes AP-1 recruitment to the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail. By binding newly synthesized MHC-I early in the secretory pathway, Nef targets the MHC-I most likely to harbor viral antigenic peptides. Preparation of Cell Lines Expressing HLA-A2 Mutants—The construction of TM1, TM2, TM3, and TM4 has been described previously (27.Paulson E. Tran C. Collins K. Fruh K. Virology. 2001; 288: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The combined mutant TM1,4 was made by PCR mutagenesis using the TM4 primers with TM1 as a template (27.Paulson E. Tran C. Collins K. Fruh K. Virology. 2001; 288: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Then TM1,4 was used as a template to make the triple mutants TM1,2,4 using the following mutant primers: TM124–5′ (5′-GCAGATAGAAAAGGAGGGGCCTACGCCCAGGCTGCAAGCAGTGAC-3′) and TM124–3′ (5′-GTCACTGCTTGCAGCCTGGGCGTAGGCCCCTCCTTTTCTATCTGC-3′). TM2E and TM3E were constructed by PCR mutagenesis using wild type HLA-A2 as a template with the following mutant primers: TM2E-5′ (5′-GCTCAGATAGAAAAGGAGGGGAGTACGAGCAGGCTGCAAGCAGTGAC-3′), TM2E-3′ (5′-GTCACTGCTTGCAGCCTGCTCGTACTCCCCTCCTTTTCTATCTGAGC-3′), TM3E-5′ (5′-GCTACTCTCAGGCTGCAAGCGAGGACGAGGCCCAGGGCTCTGATGTG-3′), and TM3E-3′ (5′-CACATCAGAGCCCTGGGCCTCGTCCTCGCTTGCAGCCTGAGAGTAGC-3′). Each PCR product was cloned into the murine stem cell virus retroviral vector (28.Hawley R. Lieu F. Fong A. Hawley T. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar), packaged into retrovirus (29.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar), and introduced into CEM T cells or HeLa cells, and the cell lines were selected in neomycin (1 mg/ml). HeLa cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. CEM-SS lines were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin. Preparation of Primary T Cells—HLA-A2+ PBMCs were purified from buffy coats obtained from the Lansing Red Cross as previously described (13.Collins K. Chen B. Kalams S. Walker B. Baltimore D. Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Nonadherent cells were used within 24 h for pulse-chase assays or were phytohemagglutinin-activated and HIV-infected as previously described (13.Collins K. Chen B. Kalams S. Walker B. Baltimore D. Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The monoclonal antibodies BB7.2 and HC10, which specifically recognizes the HLA-A2 allotype of MHC-I (30.Parham P. Brodsky F.M. Hum. Immunol. 1981; 3: 277-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and unfolded MHC-I (31.Stam N.J. Vroom T.M. Peters P.J. Pastoors E.B. Ploegh H.L. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), respectively, were purified from ascites using a Hitrap protein A FF column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The antibody directed at placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) was obtained from Biomeda. The AG11 HIV-1 Nef antibody (32.Chang A.H. Hoxie J.A. Cassol S. O'Shaughnessy M. Jirik F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) for Western blotting was obtained from Dr. James Hoxie. HA-HLA-A2 was detected using the anti-HA antibody HA.11 (Covance). The pasta-1 antibody was obtained from Peter Cresswell (33.Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The μ1 adaptin subunit of AP-1 was detected using RY/1 (1:2500, from Dr. Linton Traub). The antibody to the γ-adaptin subunit of AP-1 was purchased from BD Biosciences. The β2m antibody was purchased from DAKO. The secondary antibodies used in this study were goat antimouse immunoglobulin G-phycoerythrin (Caltag) for HLA-A2 stains and goat anti-rabbit-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag) for PLAP stains. Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and goat anti-mouse anti-IgG1 heavy chain (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used for Western blotting. Viral Transduction of CEM T Cells and HeLa Cells—A replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing HIV-1 NL4–3 Nef (Adeno-Nef) and lacking the entire E3 region (including E3/19k, 27925–30954) was made by the University of Michigan Vector Core by recombining the cosmid cAd5.dlE3 with a Nef-containing shuttle plasmid by a Cre-Lox reaction (21.Williams M. Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Fleis R.I. Przybycin C.G. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12173-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25.Kasper M.R. Collins K.L. J.

The control virus (control-adeno) was identical to adeno-Nef except that it lacked the Nef open reading frame. Adenovirus transductions were performed as follows: HeLa cells or T cells were incubated with adenovirus in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 2% FBS. After 2 h, an equal volume of fresh DMEM or RPMI plus 10% FBS was added. The cells were then incubated for 24 to 72 h prior to harvest. CEM T cells were less susceptible to adenoviral transduction than HeLa cells; equivalent Nef levels required an MOI of 10,000:1 for CEM T cells compared with an MOI of 100:1 for HeLa cells (based on 293 cell infectivity) (25.Kasper M.R. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, CEM T cells were much more susceptible to Nef, and therefore an MOI of 100:1 resulted in a 2-fold decrease in MHC-I surface expression in HeLa cells compared with a 5–10-fold decrease in CEM T cells. For HIV transductions, primary T cells were treated as previously described (13.Collins K. Chen B. Kalams S. Walker B. Baltimore D. Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). CEM T cells were treated with 1 ml of high titer HXB-EP (13.Collins K. Chen B. Kalams S. Walker B. Baltimore D. Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 35.Chen B.K. Saksela K. Andino R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) pseudotyped with VSV-G protein and analyzed for MHC-I expression after 72 h. This HIV molecular clone contains the marker gene PLAP inserted into the envelope open reading frame and expresses levels of Nef equivalent to that of unmodified HIV molecular clones (13.Collins K. Chen B. Kalams S. Walker B. Baltimore D. Nature. 1998; 391: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 36.Chen B. Gandhi R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PLAP marker was used to monitor infection rate, which was usually greater than 90% (25.Kasper M.R. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—To assess the level of cell surface MHC-I or PLAP, the cells were incubated with primary antibody for 20 min at 4 °C in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 1% HEPES, 1% sodium azide), washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (see above), washed again, and analyzed on a Becton Dickenson FACScan™ using CELLQuest™ software. Measurement of MHC-I Transport Rate—To assess how rapidly MHC-I was transported into the medial Golgi compartment, a pulse-chase assay with endo H digestion was performed. For each time point, one million HeLa cells plated the previous day, 1 × 107 CEM T cells, or 2 × 107 primary T cells were washed with PBS and incubated in prelabel medium (DMEM or RPMI, lacking methionine and cysteine plus 10% dialyzed FBS) for 15 min. The cells were then pulsed for 10 min with 0.2 mCi/ml 35S-Pro-Mix (Amersham Biosciences), washed with PBS, and chased with complete DMEM or RPMI plus 10% FBS for the indicated time period. The cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences)) and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody BB7.2 as previously described (21.Williams M. Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Fleis R.I. Przybycin C.G. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12173-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), except that the immune complexes were washed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The precipitated samples were then digested with endo H according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs), separated by SDS-PAGE, and quantified using a PhosphorImager with Image Quant software. Transport Assay—The ability of Nef to disrupt transport of HLA-A2 was measured as previously described (37.Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Thomas L. Feliciangeli S.F. Hung C.H. Thomas G. Cell. 2002; 111: 853-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 106 transduced CEM T cells or 5 × 105 HeLa cells (plated on day one, transduced with adeno-Nef on day 2, and harvested on day 4) were pulse-labeled as described above and incubated for the indicated chase period in PBS plus 0.5 mg/ml cell-impermeable biotinylation reagent (NHS-biotin; Pierce). The reaction was quenched in 25 mm lysine according to the manufacturer's protocol. HLA-A2 was immunoprecipitated as described above except that the precipitated sample was eluted from the beads by boiling for 10 min in 10% SDS. One-third of the eluate was collected to examine total HLA-A2 levels, and the remaining two-thirds were diluted and reprecipitated with avidin-agarose beads (CalBiochem) to capture HLA-A2 that had been transported to the cell surface and biotinylated (25.Kasper M.R. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified using a PhosphorImager with Image Quant software. Phosphate Labeling—5 × 106 CEM T cells were transduced with the indicated MOI of adenovirus. The cells were washed with PBS, preincubated for 30 min in DMEM or RPMI phosphate-free medium plus 10% dialyzed FBS, and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h. The cells were then lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and HLA-A2 was immunoprecipitated as described above. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified using a PhosphorImager with Image Quant software. Co-precipitation Assays—The protocol used to detect Nef binding has been described previously (21.Williams M. Roeth J.F. Kasper M.R. Fleis R.I. Przybycin C.G. Collins K.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12173-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7.5 × 105 HeLa cells (plated the day before) or 5 × 106 CEM T cells were transduced with the indicated MOI of adenovirus. Alternatively, 10 × 106 primary T cells were transduced with HXB-EP and grown for 3 days. Four hours prior to harvest, the cells were incubated in 25 mm NH4Cl. The cells were then washed with PBS, treated with the reversible cross-linker DTBP (Pierce), and lysed in PBS, 0.3% Chaps, 0.1% SDS, pH 8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. One percent of the lysates (normalized for total protein) were set aside for input controls, and the remainder was precleared over night with protein A/G-agarose (Oncogene). The lysates were then immunoprecipitated for 2 h with pasta-1 or BB7.2 beads, washed six times in Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% Chaps, 0.1% SDS, and eluted in 150 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. The presence of co-precipitating Nef or HA-HLA-A2 was detected by immunoblot using an antibody against Nef (AG11, 1:500 (32.Chang A.H. Hoxie J.A. Cassol S. O'Shaughnessy M. Jirik F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) from Dr. James Hoxie) or HA-HLA-A2 (Covance) and goat anti-mouse IgG1 horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:50,000). Co-precipitating AP-1 was detected using an antibody against the γ-adaptin subunit of AP-1(1:100) and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:50,000). Input controls were mock eluted in 150 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed by Western blot as described above except that the secondary antibody was used at a higher dilution (1:200,000). For analysis of Nef bound to surface MHC-I, the binding was performed as described above except that 2 × 107 transduced CEM T cells were incubated in a cell impermeable NHS-biotin (Pierce) solution in PBS to label cell surface proteins and then washed in 25 mm lysine after cross-linker treatment. In addition, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity matrix beads (Roche Applied Science), washed, and eluted with HA peptide (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C. A fraction of the eluate was collected and saved to examine Nef co-precipitation with total HA-A2. A fraction was reprecipitated with BB7.2 beads. The remainder was reprecipitated with avidin-agarose beads to capture HA-A2 that had been transported to the cell surface and biotinylated. Sample volumes were adjusted with a goal to precipitate similar amounts of HA-A2. All of the samples were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% Chaps, 0.1% SDS, pH 8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, eluted in 150 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min, and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Densitometry was performed on scanned images using Image Quant 5.2 software. RNA Interference Treatment—The following duplex siRNAs (Ambion) were used in this study: siGFP (sense, 5′-GCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAUCTT-3′; antisense, 5′-GAUGAACUUCAGGGUCAGCTT-3′) and siβ2m (sense, 5′-GGUUUACUCACGUCAUCCATT-3′; antisense, 5′-UGGAUGACGUGAGUAAACCTG-3′). The μ1A siRNA has been previously described (38.Hirst J. Motley A. Harasaki K. Peak Chew S.Y. Robinson M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 625-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Astrocytoma (373mg) or HeLa cells were transfected with annealed duplex siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, on day 1, the cells were plated onto 6-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well). On day 2, each well was transfected using 0.16 nmol of siRNA and 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. On day 3, the cells were replated onto 6-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well), and on day 4 they were transfected a second time. Four to six hours after the second siRNA transfection, the medium was removed, and the cells were transduced with adenovirus (MOI of 50:1). The cells were harvested and analyzed 24 h post-transduction. For experiments using CEM T cells, the cells were first transduced with adenovirus (MOI of 100:1). Twenty-four hours later, 5 × 106 cells were electroporated with 1 nmol of siRNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amaxa Biosystems). The cells were then incubated for 48 h before analysis. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—373 cells were grown on 8-well chambered glass slides and were transduced with adeno-Nef at an MOI of 300. Twenty-four hours post-transduction, the cells were fixed in methanol:acetone (1:1) for 2 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with wash buffer (PBS, 10 mm HEPES, 2% goat serum, 0.025% sodium azide) and blocked in wash buffer (supplemented with 10% human serum and 10% goat serum). The cells were first stained with a monoclonal antibody for tapasin (pasta-1, 1:100, (33.Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar)), followed by secondary staining with goat anti-mouse IgG1 AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes; 1:250). The cells were then incubated in wash buffer supplemented with 10% mouse serum overnight. Nef was detected by first staining with a biotinylated anti-Nef antibody (AG11, 20 μg/ml) followed by staining with NeutrAvidin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes, 1:400). The AG11 antibody was biotinylated with NHS-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Glass coverslips were mounted using Prolong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Single Z sections were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope, and the images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. The Effect of Nef on MHC-I Phosphorylation—MHC-I is phosphorylated on its cytoplasmic tail late in its biosynthesis after it has reached the TGN (39.Eichholtz T. Vossebeld P. van Overveld M. Ploegh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22490-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Lippe R. Luke E. Kuah Y.T. Lomas C. Jefferies W.A. J. Exp.

Because there is evidence that Nef affects MHC-I trafficking after it has reached the TGN, we asked whether Nef expression affected MHC-I phosphorylation. To test this, T cells transduced with a replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing Nef or a control adenoviral vector were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and MHC-I HLA-A2 was immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 1 (lanes 3 and 4), MHC-I was indeed phosphorylated in T cells, and as expected, all of the phosphorylated MHC-I was endo H-resistant (i.e. it had migrated into the medial Golgi apparatus and undergone trimming of mannose residues rendering it resistant to cleavage by endo H). In contrast, ∼50% of newly synthesized HLA-A2 was endo H-resistant after a 4-h continuous labeling with 35S-labeled amino acids (Fig. 1). Mutation of key serine residues in the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 2A; tail mutant; TM1,2,4) dramatically reduced phosphorylation of MHC-I, confirming that MHC-I phosphorylation occurred on its cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1). Finally, we demonstrated that expression of Nef resulted in a 10-fold decrease in MHC-I phosphorylation (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6).Fig. 2Mutation of the MHC-I cytoplasmic tail serines affects the ability of Nef to disrupt MHC-I trafficking.A, HLA-A2 cytoplasmic tail sequence and location of serine mutations.

This motif contrasts with the more commonly occurring Galβ1–4GlcNAc (LacNAc or LN) motif. To better understand LDN biosynthesis and regulation, we stably expressed the cDNA encoding the Caenorhabditis elegans β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT), which generates LDN in vitro, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Lec8 cells, to establish L8-GalNAcT CHO cells. The glycan structures from these cells were determined by mass spectrometry and linkage analysis. The L8-GalNAcT cell line produces complex-type N-glycans quantitatively bearing LDN structures on their antennae. Unexpectedly, most of these complex-type N-glycans contain novel “poly-LDN” structures consisting of repeating LDN motifs (-3GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-)n. These novel structures are in contrast to the well known poly-LN structures consisting of repeating LN motifs (-3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-)n. We also stably expressed human α1,3-fucosyltransferase IX in the L8-GalNAcT cells to establish a new cell line, L8-GalNAcT-FucT. These cells produce complex-type N-glycans with α1,3-fucosylated LDN (LDNF) GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-R as well as novel “poly-LDNF” structures (-3GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα 1–3)GlcNAcβ1-)n. The ability of these cell lines to generate glycoprotein hormones with LDN-containing N-glycans was studied by expressing a recombinant form of the common α-subunit in L8-GalNAcT cells. The α-subunit N-glycans carried LDN structures, which were further modified by co-expression of the human GalNAc 4-sulfotransferase I, which generates SO4-4GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-R. Thus, the generation of these stable mammalian cells will facilitate future studies on the biological activities and properties of LDN-related structures in glycoproteins.

There is a growing appreciation of the important roles of glycoconjugates in modulating a wide variety of biological processes. A critical limiting factor in exploring glycan functions is the difficulty of obtaining many glycans either in a purified chemical form or within a relatively homogenous biological system.

However, another type of nonreducing terminal glycan structure that is less well understood but now appears to also be expressed by many organisms, including mammals, is based on the LacdiNAc (LDN) sequence GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-R, which can also occur within 4-O-sulfated, α1,3-fucosylated, or α2,6-sialylated derivatives. LDN-type glycans play vital roles in regulating the circulatory half-life of pituitary glycoprotein hormones (1.Baenziger J.U. Kumar S. Brodbeck R.M. Smith P.L. Beranek M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Many human pathogens synthesize LDN and fucosylated LDN glycans, such as GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-R, termed LDNF. Both LDN and LDNF as well as other modified LDN-type glycans are important determinants recognizable by our adaptive immune system and various carbohydrate-binding proteins within the innate immune system, such as DC-SIGN (10.Nyame A.K.

Although some LDN-based structures have been synthesized in vitro, there is no convenient biological system available to produce these structures in vivo to facilitate studies of their biological properties, and little is understood about the relationship of LDN expression to protein glycosylation in general. We recently identified a cDNA encoding the Caenorhabditis elegans β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (Ceβ4GalNAcT) (18.Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and found that the recombinant Ceβ4GalNAcT was active and capable of promoting LDN synthesis in vitro. Here we have explored whether mammalian cells stably expressing the Ceβ4GalNAcT can be used to generate LDN-type N-glycans on cellular and recombinant glycoproteins. To this end, we generated a cell line derived from CHO Lec8 cells, termed L8-GalNAcT, that expresses Ceβ4GalNAcT and produces complex N-glycans containing LDN structures on their antennae. CHO Lec8 cells were chosen because they lack a functional UDP-Gal transporter and synthesize complex N-glycans with terminal β-linked GlcNAc residues (19.Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, L8-GalNAcT cells also produced novel poly-LDN-type structures with the repeating LDN structure (-3GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-)n, indicating that at least one member of the mammalian β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase family, which is responsible for poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis through the addition of β3-linked GlcNAc to terminal β4-linked Gal residues, also recognizes terminal β4-linked GalNAc to allow formation of the poly-LDN structures. Furthermore, we found that the poly-LDN backbone was efficiently fucosylated by recombinant human α1,3-fucosyltransferase IX (FucT 9) when it was stably co-expressed with the Ceβ4GalNAcT in a new cell line, termed L8-GalNAcT-FucT. The ability to generate such novel LDN-related glycans should aid in future studies to define the biological roles of LDN-containing glycans in a variety of biological systems, including bioactive glycoproteins in humans, such as pituitary hormones and fertility-related glycoproteins like glycodelin as well as in human immune responses to parasitic infections. Materials—All chemicals and reagents used in this study, unless otherwise indicated, were from Sigma. FuGENE 6 and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture were from Roche Applied Science. Geneticin and zeocin were from Invitrogen. HighSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate was from Pierce. Radiolabeled nucleotide sugars were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ-S-pNP was synthesized from GlcNAcβ-S-pNP using Ceβ4GalNAcT as previously described (18.Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding full-length human GalNAc 4-sulfotransferase I was a kind gift from Dr. Jacques Baenziger. Establishment of Cell Lines—CHO Lec8 cells (19.Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were transfected with a plasmid encoding the complete open reading frame of Ceβ4GalNAcT under the control of the CMV promoter; this plasmid also encoded a Geneticin resistance gene. The transfection was carried out using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml Geneticin to select for stably transformed cells. After 4 weeks in culture, a cell line expressing the Ceβ4GalNAcT activity (L8-GalNAcT) was cloned from a single cell by limiting-dilution culturing. Next, L8-GalNAcT cells were transfected, as above, with a plasmid encoding the complete open reading frame of human FucT 9 under the control of the CMV promoter; this plasmid also encoded a zeocin resistance gene. The cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 600 μg/ml Geneticin, and 400 μg/ml zeocin to select for stably transformed cells. After 4 weeks in culture, a cell line expressing GalNAcT and FucT activities (L8-GalNAcT-FucT) was cloned from a single cell as above. Glycosyltransferase Assays—Confluent cells grown in T-25 culture flasks were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in 1.25 ml/flask of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (EDTA-free). The extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 4 min, and the supernatants were used for further analyses. Glycosyltransferase assays were carried out for 1 h at room temperature in duplicate using extracts equivalent to 15,000 cells/reaction in a final volume of 50 μl of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 0.15% Triton X-100, 5 mm ATP. GalT and GalNAcT assays contained 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm GlcNAcβ-S-pNP, 50 μm UDP-Gal or UDP-GalNAc, and 0.1 μCi/reaction of UDP-[3H]Gal or UDP-[3H]GalNAc. Fucosyltransferase assays contained 1 mm GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ-S-pNP, 50 μm GDP-Fuc, and 0.1 μCi/reaction of GDP-[3H]Fuc. The reactions were then diluted with 1 ml of water, and the products were isolated using 1 cm3 Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges (Waters) and assayed for incorporation of radioactivity by liquid scintillation as described (21.Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconj. J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Cell extracts were mixed with loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. For Western blot analysis, the membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 h at 4 °C. It was then incubated with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-LDN IgM SMLDN1.1 or anti-LDNF IgM SMLDNF (11.Nyame A.K. Leppanen A.M. DeBose-Boyd R. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) in the same buffer (without bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed in the same buffer, and incubated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-mouse IgM) as before. The membrane was then washed again, incubated in HighSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate for 2 min at room temperature, and exposed to a BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 min. The film was then developed using a processing machine (Konica SRX-101). For Ponceau S staining, the membrane was rinsed in water and stained for 3 min with 0.2% Ponceau S in 3% trichloroacetic acid. The membrane was then rinsed again in water and air-dried. Preparation of N-Glycans and MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—N-Glycans were prepared from 3 × 107 cells of each cell line as previously described (22.Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins extracted from washed cell pellets were reduced and carboxymethylated and then digested with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. The tryptic peptides were then treated with peptide N-glycosidase F, and the released N-glycans were purified and permethylated. MALDI data were acquired using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager-DETM STR mass spectrometer in the reflectron mode with delayed extraction. Derivatized glycans were dissolved in 10 μl of methanol, and 1 μl of dissolved sample was premixed with 1 μl of matrix (2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid) before loading onto a target plate. GC-MS Linkage Analysis—Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated samples for gas chromatography-MS linkage analysis. Linkage analysis was carried out on a PerkinElmer Clarus 500 instrument fitted with an RTX-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32-mm internal diameter; Restek Corp.). The sample was dissolved in hexanes and injected onto the column at 65 °C. The column was maintained at this temperature for 1 min and then heated to 290 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. Expression and Analysis of the Glycoprotein Hormone α-Subunit—A plasmid encoding an HPC4-tagged version of the human glycoprotein hormone α-subunit under the control of the CMV promoter was constructed. A PCR-amplified DNA fragment starting at bp 72 of the open reading frame of the human α-subunit and extending beyond the stop codon was subcloned into the BamHI site of the pcDNA 3.1(+)-TH vector. The resulting vector (pHPC4-α-subunit) encodes a fusion protein consisting of a signal peptide at the N terminus, followed by an HPC4 linear peptide epitope (23.Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24.Stearns D.J. Kurosawa S. Sims P.J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 826-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is followed by the mature peptide of the α-subunit (beginning at Ala25, the first amino acid after the endogenous, cleavable, signal peptide). The mature HPC4-tagged α-subunit protein (after the removal of the signal peptide) has a calculated molecular mass of 11,785.01 Da, but the mature protein contains two N-glycosylation sites and migrates anomalously on reducing SDS-PAGE as a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼25 kDa (25.Delahaye R. Berreur P. Salesse R. Counis R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). CHO Lec8 and L8-GalNAcT cells were transfected with pHPC4-α-subunit, with or without co-transfection with a plasmid encoding full-length human GalNAc 4-sulfotransferase I (26.Xia G. Evers M.R. Kang H.G. Schachner M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38402-38409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 36 h post-transfection. The α-subunit was then affinity-purified from the extracellular medium and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the HPC4 monoclonal antibody, as previously described (18.Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Establishment of L8-GalNAcT and L8-GalNAcT-FucT Cell Lines—CHO Lec8 cells were chosen as founder cells for a new cell line to explore the expression of glycans with the LDN motif GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R. The CHO Lec8 cells lack a functional UDP-Gal transporter; thus, they are expected to synthesize complex N-glycans with terminal β-linked GlcNAc residues at the nonreducing termini of their antennae (19.Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant Ceβ4GalNAcT has β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAcT) activity toward GlcNAc-terminating glycans (18.Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CHO Lec8 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding Ceβ4GalNAcT under the control of the CMV promoter as well as a Geneticin resistance gene. A stable, clonal cell line (L8-GalNAcT) was established from these cells by antibiotic selection and limiting-dilution culturing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We also wanted to explore the possibility that the Lec8-GalNAcT cells could be used for stably producing N-glycans containing the LDNF motif GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-R, which is a common sequence found in parasite-derived glycans and is recognized by the human dendritic cell lectin DC-SIGN (14.van Die I. van Vliet S.J. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Bank C.M. Appelmelk B. Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To this end, we generated an additional cell line, L8-GalNAcT-FucT, by transfecting L8-GalNAcT cells with a plasmid encoding human FucT 9 under the control of the CMV promoter as well as a zeocin resistance gene. FucT 9 acts efficiently on the acceptor glycans with the LN sequence Galβ1–4GlcNAc-R to generate the Lewis x motif Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAc-R (27.Kaneko M. Kudo T. Iwasaki H. Ikehara Y. Nishihara S. Nakagawa S. Sasaki K. Shiina T. Inoko H. Saitou N. Narimatsu H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recombinant FucT 9 also shows activity in vitro toward the LDN acceptor GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R to generate the LDNF motif GalNAcβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβ1-R (28.Toivonen S. Nishihara S. Narimatsu H. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Both these cell lines retain their newly integrated genetic material even after several months of culturing in the absence of antibiotics, as judged by their enduring resistance to the reintroduction of these selection agents and by the retention of the introduced glycosyltransferase activities. Glycosyltransferase Activities in L8-GalNAcT and L8-GalNAcT-FucT Cells—The newly established L8-GalNAcT and L8-GalNAcT-FucT cell lines were assayed to assess whether they effectively express the glycosyltransferase activities of the introduced cDNAs. Cell extracts from the new cell lines and from the parental CHO Lec8 cells were assayed for GalT and GalNAcT activities acting on the acceptor GlcNAcβ1-pNP and for fucosyltransferase (FucT) activity acting on the acceptor GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-pNP. All three cell lines have comparable levels of GalT activity (Fig. 1). It should be noted that CHO Lec8 glycans lack Gal residues due to a deficiency in UDP-Gal transport and not in GalT activities (19.Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, CHO Lec8 cells lack GalNAcT activity, whereas both L8-GalNAcT and L8-GalNAcT-FucT cells have GalNAcT activity levels substantially higher than their endogenous GalT activity. Furthermore, L8-GalNAcT-FucT cells, but not the other cell lines, contain substantial FucT activity in addition to GalNAcT activity. The Presence of LDN and LDNF Structures on Endogenous Glycans of L8-GalNAcT and L8-GalNAcT-FucT Cells—We examined whether the new cell lines produce N-glycans containing LDN and LDNF on endogenous glycoproteins. Cell extracts from the two cell lines and from the parental CHO Lec8 cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for the presence of LDN and LDNF determinants by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to each of these structures (Fig. 2). In agreement with the results of the glycosyltransferase activity assays and with previous observations (18.Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29.Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), CHO Lec8 glycoproteins lack detectable levels of LDN or LDNF structures. By contrast, we observed strong staining of extracts from L8-GalNAcT cells with anti-LDN but only trace staining with the anti-LDNF antibody, demonstrating that these cells express LDN structures on many glycoproteins. In contrast to the results with L8-GalNAcT cells, anti-LDNF strongly stained glycoproteins from L8-GalNAcT-FucT cells, and there was a decrease in staining with anti-LDN. These results suggest that the LDN structures found in L8-GalNAcT cells were largely converted to LDNF structures in L8-GalNAcT-FucT cells and that the LDNF antigen is expressed on many different glycoproteins. We expect that the LDN and LDNF structures in the new cell lines should be expressed on N-rather than O-glycans, as we have previously demonstrated in transiently transfected CHO-Lec8 cells (18.Kawar Z.S. Van Die I. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34924-34932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This is to be predicted, since CHO-Lec8 cells produce O-glycans consisting primarily of GalNAcα1Ser/Thr (30.Do S.I. Cummings R.D. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1992; 24: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which may or may not be α2–6-sialylated (31.Sasaki H. Bothner B. Dell A. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12059-12076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of N-Glycans Produced by L8-GalNAcT and L8-GalNAcT-FucT Cells—To obtain a more detailed view of the carbohydrate structures produced by the cell lines in this study, MALDI-TOF-MS analyses were carried out on N-glycans released from the endogenous glycoproteins of these cells (Fig. 3 and Table I). Signals consistent with compositions of HexNAc3Fuc1Hex3-HexNAc7Fuc1Hex3 (m/z 1591.5–2571.7) detected from CHO-Lec8 cells indicate the presence of truncated complex N-glycans. The spectra of the N-glycans from the Lec8-GalNAcT cells clearly indicate the presence of larger complex structures with compositions of HexNAc3Fuc1Hex3-HexNAc16Fuc1Hex3 (m/z 1590.9–4775.8). The spectra of the N-glycans from the Lec8-GalNAcT-FucT cells is dominated by highly fucosylated complex structures with compositions of HexNAc4Fuc1Hex3-HexNAc14Fuc5Hex3 (m/z 1836.5–4983.5). Additional MALDI-TOF MS experiments at higher mass ranges detected signals consistent with compositions up to HexNAc24Fuc1Hex3 and HexNAc18Fuc9Hex3 in the Lec8-GalNAcT and Lec8-GalNAcT-FucT, respectively (data not shown).Table IObserved mass signals (m/z) and predicted compositions of the N-glycans from CHO Lec8, L8-GalNAcT, and L8-GalNAcT-FucT cellsCHO Lec8L8-GalNAcTL8-GalNAcT-FucTCompositionaHexNAc, N-acetylhexosamine (GlcNAc/GalNAc); Fuc, fucose (deoxyhexose); Hex, hexose (mannose)m/zbPermethylated glycans with a Na+ ion adductCompositionm/zCompositionm/zHexNAc2Hex51580.5HexNAc2Hex51579.9HexNAc2Hex51580.4HexNAc3Fuc1Hex31591.5HexNAc3Fuc1Hex31590.9HexNAc2Hex61784.5HexNAc4Hex31662.5HexNAc4Hex31661.9HexNAc4Fuc1Hex31836.5HexNAc2Hex61784.5HexNAc2Hex61783.8HexNAc2Hex71988.6HexNAc4Fuc1Hex31836.5HexNAc4Fuc1Hex31835.9HexNAc4Fuc2Hex32010.6HexNAc5Hex31907.5HexNAc5Hex31906.8HexNAc4Fuc1Hex42040.6HexNAc2Hex71988.6HexNAc2Hex71987.8HexNAc5Fuc1Hex32081.6HexNAc4Fuc1Hex42040.5HexNAc4Fuc1Hex42039.8HexNAc2Hex82192.7HexNAc5Fuc1Hex32081.6HexNAc4Hex52069.8HexNAc4Fuc1Hex52244.7HexNAc6Hex32152.6HexNAc5Fuc1Hex32080.8HexNAc5Fuc2Hex32255.7HexNAc2Hex82192.6HexNAc6Hex32151.8HexNAc6Fuc1Hex32326.7HexNAc5Hex42285.6HexNAc2Hex82191.7HexNAc2Hex92396.8HexNAc6Fuc1Hex32326.6HexNAc6Fuc1Hex32325.7HexNAc6Fuc2Hex32500.8HexNAc2Hex92396.6HexNAc2Hex92396.6HexNAc7Fuc1Hex32571.9HexNAc6Fuc1Hex42530.6HexNAc7Fuc1Hex32570.7HexNAc6Fuc3Hex32674.9HexNAc7Fuc1Hex32571.7HexNAc8Hex32641.7HexNAc7Fuc2Hex32745.9HexNAc8Fuc1Hex32815.6HexNAc7Fuc3Hex32920.0HexNAc9Hex32886.6HexNAc8Fuc2Hex32991.0HexNAc9Fuc1Hex33060.5HexNAc8Fuc3Hex33165.1HexNAc10Hex33131.5HexNAc8Fuc4Hex33339.1HexNAc10Fuc1Hex33305.4HexNAc9Fuc3Hex33410.1HexNAc11Fuc1Hex33550.3HexNAc9Fuc4Hex33584.2HexNAc12Fuc1Hex33795.2HexNAc10Fuc3Hex33655.2HexNAc13Fuc1Hex34040.2HexNAc10Fuc4Hex33829.2HexNAc14Fuc1Hex34285.0HexNAc10Fuc5Hex34003.3HexNAc15Fuc1Hex34530.8HexNAc11Fuc5Hex34248.3HexNAc16Fuc1Hex34775.8HexNAc12Fuc4Hex34319.3Largest N-glycan detectedcIn experiments performed at higher mass range; data not shownHexNAc12Fuc5Hex34493.4HexNAc24Fuc1Hex3HexNAc12Fuc6Hex34667.4HexNAc14Fuc4Hex34809.5HexNAc14Fuc5Hex34983.5Largest N-glycan detectedcIn experiments performed at higher mass range; data not shownHexNAc18Fuc9Hex3a HexNAc, N-acetylhexosamine (GlcNAc/GalNAc); Fuc, fucose (deoxyhexose); Hex, hexose (mannose)b Permethylated glycans with a Na+ ion adductc In experiments performed at higher mass range; data not shown Open table in a new tab Linkage Analysis—The N-glycans from the three cell lines were subjected to gas chromatography-MS linkage analysis (Table II).

Additionally, the small amounts of 3,4,6-linked mannose and 4,6-linked GlcNAc residues indicate that the N-glycan core can also be modified by fucosylation and bisecting GlcNAc.

A deficiency in monoamine oxidase A results in aggressive behavior in both humans and mice. Studies on the regulation of monoamine oxidase A gene expression have shown that the Sp1 family is important for monoamine oxidase A expression. To search for novel transcription factors, the sequences of three Sp1 sites in the monoamine oxidase A core promoter were used in the yeast one-hybrid system to screen a human cDNA library. A novel repressor, R1 (RAM2), has been cloned. The R1 cDNA encodes a protein with 454 amino acids and an open reading frame at the 5′-end. The transfection of R1 in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-BE (2)-C, inhibited the monoamine oxidase A promoter and enzymatic activity. The degree of inhibition of monoamine oxidase A by R1 correlated with the level of R1 protein expression. R1 was also found to repress monoamine oxidase A promoter activity within a natural chromatin environment. A gel-shift assay indicated that the endogenous R1 protein in SK-N-BE (2)-C cells interacted with the R1 binding sequence. R1 also bound directly to the natural monoamine oxidase A promoter in vivo as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that R1 was expressed in both cytosol and nucleus, which suggested a role for R1 in transcriptional regulation. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of endogenous R1 mRNA in human brain and peripheral tissues. Taken together, this study shows that R1 is a novel repressor that inhibits monoamine oxidase A gene expression.

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) 1The abbreviations used are: MAO, monoamine oxidase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. catalyzes the oxidative deamination of a number of biogenic and dietary amines in brain and peripheral tissues and produces hydrogen peroxide (1Shih J.C.

Cytochem. 1987; 35: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two forms of MAO have been defined, MAO A (3Johnston J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1968; 17: 1285-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar) and MAO B (4Knoll J. Magyar K. Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol. 1972; 5: 393-408PubMed Google Scholar). MAO A has higher affinity for the substrates serotonin and norepinephrine, whereas MAO B has higher affinity for phenylethylamine and benzylamine. MAO A and B are encoded by different genes (5Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4934-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar); however both consist of 15 exons with identical exon-intron organization (6Grimsby J. Chen K. Wang L.J. Lan N.C. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). They are closely linked, tail to tail, located on the X-chromosome (7Lan N.C. Heinzmann C. Gal A. Klisak I.

MAO A or B gene knock-out mice exhibit different alterations in neurotransmitter levels and behavior (8Shih J.C. Chen K. Neurobiology. 1999; 7: 235-246PubMed Google Scholar). Mice deficient in MAO A have shown elevated amounts of brain serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (9Cases O. Seif I. Grimsby J. Gaspar P. Chen K. Pournin S. Muller U. Aguet M. Babinet C. Shih J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), no change in phenylethylamine (8Shih J.C. Chen K. Neurobiology. 1999; 7: 235-246PubMed Google Scholar), and display a distinct behavioral syndrome that includes enhanced aggression in males (10Shih J.C. Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the impulsive aggression reported in men from a Dutch family with a MAO A deficiency (11Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefield X.O. Ropers H.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1993; 262: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in MAO B show elevated levels of phenylethylamine but no changes in serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine. Phenylethylamine is implicated in modulating mood and affect (12Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J.D. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, mice lacking MAO B are resistant to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), a toxin that induces a Parkinson's disease-like condition (12Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J.D. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). MAO A and B double knock-out mice display reduced body weight, with increases in anxiety and brain levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and phenylethylamine (13Chen K. Holschneider D.P. Wu W. Rebrin I. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 22: 22Google Scholar). The increased amounts of all four monoamines in MAO A/B double knock-out mice are significantly higher than in either MAO A or B single knock-out mice (13Chen K. Holschneider D.P. Wu W. Rebrin I. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 22: 22Google Scholar). MAO A/B double knock-out mice also show increased baroreceptor response (14Holschneider D.P. Scremin O.U. Roos K.P. Chialvo D.R. Chen K. Shih J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H964-H972PubMed Google Scholar) and abnormal heart rate dynamics (15Holschneider D.P. Scremin O.U. Chialvo D.R. Chen K. Shih J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1751-H1759PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that MAO A and B regulate many important biochemical functions and behaviors. The identification of potential factors that regulate MAO A and B gene expression has great significance. The core promoter region of both human MAO A (16Zhu Q.S. Grimsby J. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and B (18Shih J.C. Grimsby J. Chen K. Zhu Q.S. J. Psychiatry Neurosci. 1993; 18: 25-32PubMed Google Scholar) consists of clusters of Sp1 sites. The human MAO B promoter contains two clusters of overlapping Sp1 sites separated by a CACCC element (19Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sp1 and Sp4 activate the MAO B core promoter via Sp1 overlapping sites, and its activation is repressed by Sp3. A Sp1-like transcription factor, TIEG2 (20Zhang J.S. Moncrieffe M.C. Kaczynski J. Ellenrieder V. Prendergast F.G. Urrutia R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), also activates MAO B promoter via Sp1 overlapping sites, although it represses the promoter activity via CACCC element (21Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21021-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The human MAO A core promoter region (-303/-64 bp) contains four imperfect tandem repeats, each containing a Sp1 binding site in reverse orientation (17Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A positive correlation has been found among cellular Sp1 concentration and MAO A promoter and catalytic activity (17Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that Sp1 is an activator of MAO A gene expression. However other controlling factors involved in the regulation of the human MAO A gene are unknown. In this study, the Sp1 motif in the MAO A core promoter was used as bait, and a novel repressor R1 of the human MAO A was cloned and characterized. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—Because the human MAO A promoter contains a cluster of Sp1 motifs, a probe with three copies of Sp1 sequence 5′-ccg gac gcg cag cCC CGC CCG CCC GCC tac gcg cag-3′ was used as bait in the yeast one hybrid system to search for additional transcription factors. The Matchmaker One-Hybrid System (Clontech) was used to screen the human cDNA library for protein-binding cDNA clones. After screening 1 × 106 colonies, four independent clones containing 1.9-kb inserts were found (GenBank BC009352, RAM2), which was named R1. Plasmids—The coding region of R1 was amplified by PCR and cloned downstream to an expression vector driven by a CMV promoter (pcDNA3.1, KpnI/ApaI) for generating the R1-expression vector (pcDNA3.1-R1), which was used in stable cell line selection and transient transfection assay. The MAO A promoter-luciferase constructs were obtained as follows. The MAO A 2-kb promoter (Mlu I/Hind III) (-2072/-64 bp) was cloned into the polylinker site (Mlu I/Hind III) upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) for generating the MAO A 2-kb-luc construct. The Sp1 sites deleted MAO A 2-kb-luc or the core promoter of MAO A (-303/-64 bp, 0.24 kb)-luciferase construct (MAO A 0.24-kb-luc) were generated by PCR, and the PCR product was subcloned into Zero Blunt TOPO vector (PCR cloning kit, Invitrogen) for verifying DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the PCR product was subcloned into pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector by restriction enzyme digestion (XhoI/Hind III) using self-ligation. All plasmid DNA was extracted and purified using Qiagen Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Cell Culture and Stable Cell Line Selection—The human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE (2)-C cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in a medium containing a 1:1 mixture of Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution and Ham's F12 medium with 2.5 mm l-glutamine. For generating R1 stable cell lines, R1-expression vector or pcDNA3.1 vector were transfected into SK-N-BE (2)-C cells. After 24 h, cells were replated into 5-cm dishes, and Geneticin (G418, 600 μg/ml) was added. Resistant clones were isolated into separate dishes after 6 days and cultured under continuous G418 selection. For generating MAO A 2-kb-luc stable cell lines, wild-type or Sp1 sites deleted MAO A 2-kb-luc construct was cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-neomycin plasmid into cells. The G418 selection was performed as above. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfections in SK-N-BE (2)-C cells were performed using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions (21Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21021-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 2 ml of medium and 10% fetal bovine serum and grown until 60% confluence (24–36 h). For MAO A promoter activity studies, 1 μg of MAO A 2-kb-luc or Sp1 sites deleted MAO A 2-kb-luc or MAO A 0.24-kb-luc were co-transfected into the cells with 20 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused upstream to the Renilla luciferase gene, which is used as an internal control; Promega) as described previously (22Wong W.K. Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22222-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For co-transfection experiments with pcDNA3.1-R1, the total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by the addition of empty expression vector pcDNA3.1. MAO A Catalytic Activity Assay—SK-N-BE (2)-C cells stably expressed R1 protein or pcDNA3.1 empty vector (control group) was used for determining MAO A catalytic activity. One-hundred micrograms of total protein from ∼1 × 106 cells were incubated with 100 μm [14C]serotonin in the assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 6 n HCl. The reaction products were then extracted with benzene/ethyl acetate and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The organic phase containing the reaction product was extracted, and its radioactivity was obtained by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (23Geha R.M. Rebrin I. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9877-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Generation of Anti-R1 Antibody—For production of anti-R1 antibody, the peptide CRQVIQREDSTSESE (R1 amino acids 186–200) was synthesized. This fragment has the lowest identity (46%) between human and mouse R1 (see Fig. 2B, c). Therefore it was used to generate antibody specific against the human R1. The synthesized peptide was cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits. The titer of the serum was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a standard protocol (Anaseptic Co., San Jose, CA). The R1 antiserum was purified by sequential absorption over a R1 protein-coupled sulfolink resin (Pierce). IgG fractions were dialyzed, quantified, and stored. Western Blot Analysis of R1—R1 or pcDNA3.1 stable or transient transfected cell lines were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously (24Ou X.M. Storring J.M. Kushwaha N. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14299-14307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Forty micrograms of total protein were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the transfer, membranes were blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) (24Ou X.M. Storring J.M. Kushwaha N. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14299-14307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti-R1 antibody (1:4000) overnight at room temperature. After incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h, the bands were visualized by horseradish peroxidase reaction using DAB as substrate (Sigma). The relative intensity of each R1 band was quantified by PhosphorImager System (Typhoon 8610, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunofluorescence—SK-N-BE (2)-C cells were plated on coverslips the day before experiment. After 24 h, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-R1-antibody, followed with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. The stained slides were mounted by Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) in the presence of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (for nuclear staining) and examined with a fluorescence microscope. Gel-shift Assay—Nuclear proteins were extracted, and a gel-shift assay was performed as described previously (24Ou X.M. Storring J.M. Kushwaha N. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14299-14307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (20 μg/sample) of SK-N-BE (2)-C cells were preincubated with 2 μl of anti-R1 antibody in a 25-μl reaction containing DNA binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) and 2 mg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 20 min. 32P-labeled Sp1-sites (5′-ccg gac gcg cag cCC CGC CCG CCC GCC tac gcg cag-3′) or cold Sp1-sites served as probes (60,000 cpm/sample) and were added and incubated for an additional 20 min (25Ou X.M.

The reaction was separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and then exposed to film overnight at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays and Quantitative Real Time PCR—SK-N-BE (2)-C cells (7 × 106 cells/150-mm dish) were plated and grown for 2 days. Cells were cross-linked by incubating with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) at room temperature for 10 min and then scraped into phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (Sigma) and centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 rpm. Cells were resuspended in 350 μl of lysis buffer and processed for immunoprecipitation following the methods described previously (21Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21021-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 35 μl of the supernatant was saved as input DNA. The nuclear protein-DNA complex was immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-R1 (with BioMag Goat Anti-mouse) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The DNA fragments within immunoprecipitates were isolated by heating at 65 °C for 4 h and recovered from the beads with an elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) and analyzed by quantitative real time PCR using an iCycler optical system (Bio-Rad). The PCR product was determined by SyBr green reagent (2× SYBR Green Supermix, Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers for the MAO A core promoter (342 bp, from -360 bp to -17 bp) and irrelevant locus (353 bp, from -1377 to -1024 bp for negative control) were: core promoter forward, 5′-GTGCCTGACACTCCGCGGGGTT-3′ (bases -360 to -338); core promoter reverse, 5′-TCCTGGGTCGTAGGCACAGGAG-3′ (bases -38 to -17); 5′-irrelevant locus forward, 5′-ACAGCCTGACCGTGGAGAAG-3′ (bases -1377 to -1358); 5′-irrelevant locus reverse, 5′-GAACGGACGCTCCATTCGGA-3′ (bases -1043 to -1024). The PCRs for input, R1-associated DNA or 5′-irrelevant locus were done in triplicate under the following conditions, 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of PCR consisting of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. The average threshold cycle (CT) for the triplicate was used in all subsequent calculations. A ΔCT value was calculated for each sample using the CT value for the input DNA samples to normalize the ChIP assay results as outlined in the iCycler optical systems protocol. The ΔCT values were converted to the -fold induction required to reach the threshold amount of PCR by raising 2 to the ΔCT power. The relative differences between input sample and R1 assay or negative control were determined using the ΔCT method (21Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21021-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and presented as the percentage of input, which was taken as 100%. Data were the mean ± S.D. from triplicate samples of three independent experiments. Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA isolated from SK-N-BE (2)-C, 1242-MG (human astrocytoma), LNCaP (human prostate cancer) using RNA isolation reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX), human brain (Clontech) or 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from human peripheral tissues (Clontech) were loaded on gel and then transferred to membranes. A 500-bp EcoRI fragment (R1-specific probe) was labeled with 32P and hybridized to the membranes overnight at 42 °C. After hybridization the membranes were washed twice with low stringency buffer (2× SSC) followed by high stringency buffer (0.1× SSC) twice at 42 °C, 30 min each. Blots were exposed for 16 h. The same blots were hybridized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (positive control probe) and hybridized and washed under the same condition. The film was exposed for 4 h. A Novel Repressor R1 for Human MAO A Has Been Isolated by the Yeast One-hybrid System—The human MAO A core promoter contains a cluster of Sp1 motifs (17Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shih J.C. Grimsby J. Chen K. Zhu Q.S. J. Psychiatry Neurosci. 1993; 18: 25-32PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA sequence (ccg gac gcg cag cCC CGC CCG CCC GCC tac gcg cag)3 (see Fig. 1A for location of Sp1 sites) was used as bait in the yeast one-hybrid system to search for additional transcription factors. After screening 1 × 106 colonies, four independent clones containing 1.9-kb inserts were selected and sequenced. The sequences of the inserts were identical and matched with GenBank™ (accession number: BC009352, RAM2). The deduced protein sequence of 454 amino acids (molecular mass ∼56 kDa) is shown in Fig. 1B. Several important protein domains were found in the R1 amino acid sequence (Fig. 1B). The 77 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B, amino acids 349–425) in C-terminal show 87% identity with c-Myc target protein JPO1 (Fig. 2A), which ultimately leads to tumor genesis. There are 12 conserved cysteine residues within this sequence (Fig. 2A, numbered from 1 to 12). This region contains 4 CXXC zinc finger putative DNA binding domains (Fig. 2A, I, II, III, and IV). The zinc finger structure has been shown to be involved in DNA binding in several proteins, including DNA methyltransferase 1, CpG-binding protein, and methyl binding domain protein 1 (26Prescott J.E. Osthus R.C. Lee L.A. Lewis B.C. Shim H. Barrett J.F. Guo Q. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48276-48284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The interaction among cysteines in zinc finger domains is essential for providing proper protein conformation for the DNA binding. This region is highly conserved between human (HR1) and mouse R1 (Fig. 2B, e, MR1, 94% identity). This data suggests that there are DNA binding domains in R1. Thus R1 may be a transcription factor. Further analysis of the amino acid sequence of human R1 protein, the important functional domains and multiple phosphorylation sites in R1 protein (Fig. 2B) were identified; the N-terminal acidic region (amino acids 1–29) is highly conserved and has 91% identity between human and mouse R1 (Fig. 2B, a). A PEST region (Pro, Glu, Ser, Thr-rich region flanked by Arg and Lys; amino acids 30–54) known to be susceptible to proteasome degradation was identified using PEST find website; therefore R1 is easily degraded (Fig. 2B, b). A nuclear targeting sequence between amino acids 301 and 318 has been found, which suggests that R1 may be translocated between nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 2B, d). This region is also highly conserved and has 85% identity between human and mouse R1. In addition, the multiple potential phosphorylation sites conserved in human and mouse R1, such as serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y) were found (Fig. 2B). It suggests that the cellular location of R1 may be dependent on the status of phosphorylation, and the phosphatases and kinases change during different stages of cell cycle. Repressor R1 Inhibits MAO A Catalytic Activity—The effect of R1 on the MAO A catalytic activity was studied (Fig. 3). After pcDNA3.1-R1 was transfected into SK-N-BE (2Thorpe L.W. Westlund K.N. Kochersperger L.M. Abell C.W. Denney R.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) cells and selected by G418, MAO A enzymatic activity was determined in five separated clones to evaluate the function of R1. The result showed that R1 inhibited MAO A catalytic activity by ∼50% compared with control when R1 was stably transfected into SK-N-BE (2)-C cell line (Fig. 3A). The level of R1 expression in stably transfected cell lines was analyzed by Western blot using anti-R1 antibody (Fig. 3B). The intensities of the bands were quantified by PhosphorImager (Fig. 3C). The level of stably expressed R1 was increased significantly compared with pcDNA3.1 alone stably expressed cell line (Fig. 3C). Data represented the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. R1 Interacts with Sp1 Sites and Represses the MAO A Promoter Activity—After the R1 expression vector was cotransfected with MAO A 2-kb-luc into cells, R1 was found to repress MAO A at the transcriptional level. Luciferase activity was decreased ∼45% in MAO A 2-kb-luc activity (Fig. 4A). However, when R1 was cotransfected with Sp1 sites deleted the MAO A 2-kb-luc, MAO A promoter activity was not repressed, indicating that the R1 effect is specific to the Sp1 sites (Fig. 4B). When R1 expression vector was cotransfected with MAO A 0.24-kb-luc containing 4 × Sp1 sites (Fig. 4C) into SK-N-BE (2)-C cells, ∼60% decrease in MAO A core promoter activity (Fig. 4C) was observed, which confirmed that the R1 repression effect is through Sp1 sites. The Degree of Repression of R1 on MAO A Promoter Activity Correlates with the Level of R1 Expression—For transiently transfected R1 expression, the different amounts of R1 or pcDNA3.1 vector (0, 300, 600, 1200, and 2400 ng/dish) were cotransfected with MAO A 2-kb-luc into SK-N-BE (2)-C cells for 2 days, and the luciferase activity was determined (Fig. 5B), or nuclear proteins were extracted and analyzed by Western blot using anti-R1 antibody. The relative intensity of each R1 band was quantified by PhosphorImager system. Values were normalized to actin levels on the corresponding reprobed filters and then expressed as the -fold of control, in which the control was taken as 1 (Fig. 5C). The results showed that the degree of repression of R1 correlates with the level of R1 expression. The Repressor Function of R1 Was Also Found in the Context of a Chromatinized Template—For studying the role of R1 on MAO A promoter within a natural chromatin environment, SK-N-BE (2)-C cells were stably transfected with the wild-type or Sp1 sites deleted MAO A 2-kb-luc to generate the cell line with a MAO A 2-kb-luc stably integrated genome. The introduction of R1 expression vector into cells revealed a pattern of repression similar to that observed when a transiently transfected MAO A 2-kb-luc was used (Fig. 6A). These similar results were obtained from four individual clones. Furthermore, when cells with a mutated MAO A 2-kb-luc (deleted the Sp1 sites) were used, the transcriptional repression of R1 on MAO A promoter was abolished (Fig. 6B). These results provided further evidence that R1 repressor was not only specific to transient constructs but could also be observed in the context of a chromatinized natural environment. The Novel Repressor Protein R1 Was Present in Nuclear Extracts of SK-N-BE (2)-C Cells and Bound to Sp1 Sites—A gel-shift assay was performed to test whether there was endogenous R1 interaction with the R1 binding motif (Sp1 sites). The nuclear extracts from SK-N-BE (2)-C cells (Fig. 7, lanes 2, 3, and 4) were incubated with 32P-labeled R1 binding motif (the same DNA fragment used in yeast one-hybrid system to fish out R1, for sequence, see “Materials and Methods”). The R1-DNA complex was supershifted by anti-R1 antibody (Fig. 7, lane 4). This R1-DNA complex was competed by excess unlabeled R1 binding motif oligonucleotides (Fig. 7, lane 3), suggesting that R1 binds specifically to Sp1 sites. This indicates the presence of endogenous R1 in this cell line and that R1 interacts with R1 binding motif in MAO A core promoter directly. R1 Interacted with the Endogenous MAO A Promoter Directly in Vivo as Shown by ChIP Assay—The association of R1 with the endogenous MAO A core promoter (containing 4 × Sp1 sites) compared with a 5′-irrelevant region of MAO A was determined by ChIP assay combined with quantitative real time PCR using SK-N-BE (2)-C cells (Fig. 8). The nuclear protein-DNA complex was immunoprecipitated by anti-R1 antibody and quantitatively analyzed by real time PCR. The core promoter sequence and 5′-irrelevant region (negative control) were used for occupancy analysis (Fig. 8A). The representative R1 ChIP/quantitative real time PCR amplification plots (triplicate) are shown in Fig. 8B. The average CT for input sample, TIEG2 cross-linked DNA, and 5′-irrelevant region were 18.06 ± 0.98, 24.44 ± 1.09, and 31.12 ± 0.92, respectively (Fig. 8B). The relative differences between input sample and R1 ChIP assay or negative control are summarized in Fig. 8C and presented as percent of input, which was taken as 100%. The relative differences of R1-conjugated DNA were 1.71% compared with the input DNA (Fig. 8C). The analysis of 5′-irrelevant region yielded negligible values (less than 0.05% input DNA, Fig. 8C). This result indicated that R1 bound to the endogenous core promoter of MAO A directly. R1 Protein Was Located in Both Nucleus and Cytosol as Shown by Immunocytochemistry—To examine cellular localization of R1 protein, the immunofluorescent staining of cells in culture was performed (Fig. 9) by using rabbit anti-R1 antibody (green). R1 staining was found in both nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 9A). When cells were incubated with secondary antibody alone, it displayed only background immunoreactivity (data not shown). Because R1 was present in the nucleus, it suggested the role of R1 in the transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, because R1 contains many predicted phosphorylation sites, the location of R1, whether nuclear or cytosolic, may depend on the status of its phosphorylation. In addition, the nucleus was stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Fig. 9B, blue), and the merge of nucleus with cytosol was shown in Fig. 9C. Northern Blot Analysis Shows the Presence of Endogenous R1 mRNA in Various Cell Lines, Human Brain, and Peripheral Tissues—A single species of mRNA (∼3 kb) was found in the human SK-N-BE (2)-C, 1242-MG, and LNCaP cell lines and in human brain tissue (Fig. 10A). In addition, the same mRNA band was found in all peripheral tissues studied including testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, with stronger expression in testis, heart, and pancreas (Fig. 10B). This is the first study to demonstrate that there is a novel repressor R1 that regulates the human MAO A gene expression. R1 binds to Sp1 sites in MAO A core promoter (Figs. 7 and 8) and inhibits MAO A promoter and catalytic activities (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6). The human R1 has an 83% similarity with the mouse (Fig. 2). The presence of a mouse R1 homolog suggests that R1 may be functionally significant. Similar to MAO A (27Saura J. Bleuel Z. Ulrich J. Mendelowitsch A. Chen K. Shih J.C. Malherbe P. Da Prada M. Richards J.G. Neuroscience. 1996; 70: 755-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), R1 is expressed widely in the human brain and peripheral tissues. The presence of a nuclear targeting sequence (amino acids 301–318) in R1 and the subcellular distribution of R1 in nucleus (Fig. 9) are consistent with its functional role in the transcriptional regulation of MAO A. The C-terminal of R1 contains 77 amino acid residues (amino acids 349–425), which have 87% identity with the c-Myc target protein JPO1, which leads to tumor genesis (26Prescott J.E. Osthus R.C. Lee L.A. Lewis B.C. Shim H. Barrett J.F. Guo Q. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48276-48284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore R1 may also be a target gene of c-Myc and may play important role in tumor genesis. It has been shown that MAO A has been a pro-apoptotic gene (28De Zutter G.S. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6168-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MAO A expression was increased in cells during nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis, which inhibited neuronal proliferation and accelerated cell apoptosis through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (28De Zutter G.S. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6168-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The inhibition of MAO A by clorgyline prevented the cells from undergoing apoptosis (28De Zutter G.S. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6168-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, MAO A is a key enzyme for catalyzing the oxidative deamination of a variety of amine neurotransmitters. The byproduct of MAO A activity is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which has cytotoxic effects and causes apoptosis or cell death (29Girgin Sagin F. Sozmen E.Y. Ersoz B. Mentes G. Neurotoxicology. 2004; 25: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). R1 is a potential repressor of MAO A, thus, increased R1 may decrease MAO A gene expression and therefore may prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. The role of R1 in apoptosis remains to be studied. Further, multiple phosphorylation sites have been identified on human R1 protein (Fig. 2B), which are conserved in human and mouse R1. This suggests that the cellular location of R1 may be dependent on the status of phosphorylation and the presence or absence of phosphatases and kinases. This study shows that R1 regulates MAO A gene expression via Sp1 sites. The core promoter region of MAO A contains four Sp1 binding sites. The Sp3 and Sp4 may interact with these sites in addition to Sp1 (19Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that R1 may coordinate with other Sp1 family or/and other unknown factors to regulate MAO A gene expression. Because R1 recognizes Sp1 sites, other promoters that contain Sp1 sites may also be regulated by R1. This novel R1 may regulate a group of genes that bear similar promoter sequences as MAO A. These interesting features need to be investigated. In summary, this study identified the function of protein R1. R1 is the first novel transcription factor demonstrated to negatively regulate MAO A gene expression. R1 was found both in the nucleus and cytosol. It was further shown to be expressed in brain and peripheral tissues. The identification of R1 has provided new information concerning the molecular mechanism of MAO A gene transcriptional regulation. The R1 regulation of MAO A gene expression may provide insight on the new function of MAO A in cell growth and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2048358065,"The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) type 1 receptor (CRF1) is a class B family G protein-coupled receptor that regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis. Astressin is an amino-terminal truncated analog of CRF that retains high affinity binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor and is believed to act as a neutral competitive antagonist of receptor activation. Here we show that despite being unable to activate the CRF1 receptor, astressin binding results in the internalization of the receptor. Furthermore, entirely different pathways of internalization of CRF1 receptors are utilized following CRF and astressin binding. CRF causes the receptor to be phosphorylated, recruit β-arrestin2, and to be internalized rapidly, likely through clathrin-coated pits. Astressin, however, fails to induce receptor phosphorylation or β-arrestin2 recruitment, and internalization is slow and occurs through a pathway that is insensitive to inhibitors of clathrin-coated pits and caveolae. The fate of the internalized receptors also differs because only CRF-induced internalization results in receptor down-regulation. Furthermore, we present evidence that for astressin to induce internalization it must interact with both the extracellular amino terminus and the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. Astressin binds with 6-fold higher affinity to full-length CRF1 receptors than to a chimeric protein containing only the extracellular domain attached to the transmembrane domain of the activin IIB receptor, yet two 12-residue analogs of astressin have similar affinities for both proteins but are unable to induce receptor internalization. These data demonstrate that agonists and antagonists for CRF1 receptors promote distinct conformations, which are then differentially regulated.

Vale W. Nature. 1983; 305: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 2Vale W. Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science. 1981; 213: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). In mammals, CRF and the related urocortins 1, 2, and 3 bind to and activate two distinct G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), termed CRF1 and CRF2 (3Dautzenberg F.M. Hauger R.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The CRF1 receptor is expressed mainly in the pituitary and central nervous system, where it is responsible for most of the central functions of CRF and urocortin 1, including integration of endocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses to stress, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) release from corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary (4Koob G.F. Heinrichs S.C. Pich E.M. Menzaghi F. Baldwin H. Miczek K. Britton K.T. Ciba Found. Symp. 1993; 172 (290-275): 277-289PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is strong evidence that alterations in the CRF1 receptor system occur in many anxiety and depressive disorders (5Holsboer F. J. Psychiatr. Res. 1999; 33: 181-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 6Gilligan P.J. Robertson D.W. Zaczek R. J. Med.

Agents. 2001; 1: 63-97Crossref Google Scholar). CRF2 receptors bind all three urocortins with high affinity and CRF with lower affinity (3Dautzenberg F.M. Hauger R.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). These receptors exist as three independent isoforms (CRF2(a), CRF2(b), and CRF2(c)) and are expressed both in the central nervous system and the periphery, including in the heart, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and epididymis (3Dautzenberg F.M. Hauger R.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 71-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The functions performed by the various isoforms of the CRF2 receptor are currently being elucidated (8Bale T.L. Vale W.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 525-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors belong to the Class B family of G protein-coupled receptors, which includes (but is not limited to) the receptors for glucagon, parathyroid hormone (PTH), secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. All class B receptors possess a large extracellular domain (ECD) with which they bind with high affinity to the carboxyl-terminal regions of their peptide ligands (9Harmar A.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (3013.3011-3013.3010)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction alone is not sufficient to stimulate coupling of the receptor to G proteins, however, and a second interaction must occur between the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor (the transmembrane helices and intervening loops) and the first few residues within the amino-terminal portion of the peptide ligand (7Grigoriadis D.E. Haddach M. Ling N. Saunders J. Curr. Med. Chem. Cent. Nerv. Syst. Agents. 2001; 1: 63-97Crossref Google Scholar, 10Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 885: 312-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Because discrete regions of class B ligands perform high affinity binding and receptor stimulation, truncating the endogenous peptides at their amino termini produces high affinity competitive antagonists for class B receptors. Further modifications made to CRF truncated in this manner have produced a number of different antagonist peptides including astressin (cyclo(30–33)-[d-Phe12,Nle21,38,Glu30,Lys33]CRF-(12–41)), a high affinity antagonist for CRF1 receptors that also possesses enhanced biological stability, allowing its extensive use in vivo to dissect the functions of the CRF system (11Gulyas J. Rivier C. Perrin M. Koerber S.C. Sutton S. Corrigan A. Lahrichi S.L. Craig A.G. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10575-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12Rivier C. Rivier J. Lee S. Brain Res. 1996; 721: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Astressin has no detectable agonist activity at the CRF1 receptor and thus it is believed to act as a neutral competitive antagonist. In addition to binding to the ECD of CRF1 receptors, a recent report has suggested that astressin may form a second low affinity contact with the juxtamembrane domain because astressin retains the ability to inhibit CRF activation of a CRF1 receptor fragment that lacks the ECD (13Hoare S.R. Sullivan S.K. Schwarz D.A. Ling N. Vale W.W. Crowe P.D. Grigoriadis D.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3996-4011Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Following activation by agonists, almost all GPCRs undergo a series of modifications to prevent continuous signaling of the receptor, and to enable the cells on which they are expressed to regulate their sensitivity to future exposures to agonist. This is achieved first by preventing the activated receptors from further interacting with G proteins (desensitization), and then by internalizing the receptors into intracellular compartments (also called sequestration or endocytosis) (14Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 15Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Desensitization occurs through phosphorylation of intracellular domains of the receptor by GPCR kinases (GRKs) that specifically recognize agonist-occupied receptor molecules, followed by the recruitment and binding of β-arrestins, which sterically hinder further receptor-G protein coupling. The subsequent internalization of the receptors can occur through multiple pathways, the most common of which utilize clathrin-coated pits and caveolae, although some less well defined pathways have also been described, including those that use non-coated vesicles and macropinosomes (16Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Internalization can result in either short or long term reductions in sensitivity to further agonist stimulation depending on whether the receptors become resensitized and recycle back to the cell surface, or are targeted for degradation (down-regulated) (17von Zastrow M. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A few examples of GPCRs undergoing regulation by antagonists have also been described, including internalization and down-regulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2A receptor by several atypical antipsychotics (18Roth B.L.

A. 1996; 93: 2398-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); and phosphorylation and internalization of angiotensin II type 1A receptor by several antagonist peptide analogs of angiotensin II (21Thomas W.G.

Southwell B.R. Lew M.J. Thomas W.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been reported that the class B PTH1 receptor also undergoes internalization following binding to the truncated antagonist peptide PTH-(7–34), a process that is independent of receptor activation (23Sneddon W.B. Syme C.A. Bisello A. Magyar C.E. Rochdi M.D. Parent J.L. Weinman E.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Friedman P.A. J. Biol.

In light of these discoveries, we investigated whether this phenomenon of peptide antagonist-induced internalization also occurs with CRF1 receptors, and to probe the mechanism(s) underlying this process.

Complementary DNAs for dynamin 1, caveolin 1, and β-arrestin2 were amplified from a human brain cDNA library, and inserted into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His®TOPO® vector following the manufacturer's instructions. Mutations were made in dynamin 1 (K44A) and caveolin 1 (S80A, S80E) (26Shigematsu S. Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10683-10690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The β-arrestin2-R. mulleri GFP construct was made by adding EcoRI restriction sites to the β-arrestin2 and R. mulleri GFP coding sequences by PCR with the primer pairs: 5′-AAAGAATTCACCATGGGGGAGAAACCC-3′ and 5′-AAAGAATTCGCAGAGTTGATCATCATAGTC-3′; and 5′-AGAATTCGGAAGCAAGCAGATCCTGAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-TCACGATGCGGCCGCTACA-3′, respectively. Both products were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His®TOPO® and subsequently digested with EcoRI. The released β-arrestin2 fragment was purified and subsequently ligated into the linearized R. mulleri GFP construct. All plasmid DNA constructs were amplified in Escherichia coli using standard molecular biology procedures, harvested using Qiagen® DNA preparation kits, and their correct sequences confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using an ABI377 automated DNA sequencer and Big-Dye™ Terminator version 3.0 sequencing kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary Flp-In (CHO-K1 Flp-In) cells, and mouse pituitary corticotrope adenoma AtT-20/D16v-F2 cells (AtT20, purchased from ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), and either 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for HEK-293 and CHO-K1 Flp-In, or 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum for AtT20. Stable expression of receptor in CHO-CRF1 cells was maintained by selection with 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. Transient transfections into HEK-293 cells were performed using FuGENE 6® (Roche Diagnostics) at a ratio of 3 μl FuGENE 6® to every 1 μg of plasmid DNA. Experiments were performed on these cells 48 h after transfection. Overexpressed caveolin 1 mutants and dynamin 1 K44A were detected in cell lysates separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-caveolin 1 and anti-dynamin 1 antibodies (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and detection by chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Measurement of Receptor Internalization by Flow Cytometry—Cells transiently or stably expressing FL-CRF1 receptor were seeded at 4 × 105 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well dishes (BIOCOAT™, Fort Washington, PA). The following day the cells were subjected to the appropriate drug treatments, washed twice with ice-cold internalization medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in internalization medium. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold internalization medium and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for a further 30 min with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor™ 488 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted to 1:250 in internalization medium. Cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold PBS three times, detached from the dishes with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, and fixed by the addition of formaldehyde to 0.8% (w/v). The fluorescence intensity of 104 cells from each well was then measured on a FACScan™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Concanavalin A (Sigma) was added to the cells at 0.25 mg/ml 1 h prior to stimulation. Hypertonic medium treatment, potassium depletion, and disruption of caveolae with filipin III were carried out using previously described methods (27Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Examination of Receptor Internalization by Fluorescence Microscopy—CRF1 receptor internalization was visualized using a previously described method with a minor modification (30Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected AtT20 or HEK-293 cells expressing FL-CRF1 receptor with or without β-arrestin2-R. mulleri GFP were grown on Nunc® Lab-Tek® II CC2® multichamber glass slides. Surface receptors on AtT20 cells were labeled (20 min at 37 °C) with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated M1 anti-FLAG antibody, or on HEK-293 cells with M1 anti-FLAG-Cy3 conjugate (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions using either Alexa Fluor 488 Monoclonal Antibody Labeling Kit, (Molecular Probes), or Cy3 mono-Reactive Dye Pack (Amersham Biosciences)). Cells were washed once and exposed to 10 μm CRF or 10 μm astressin (2 h at 37 °C) to induce internalization. Cells were washed twice with PBS and immediately fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times at 10-min intervals with PBS before mounting using ProLong® Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was visualized on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with the CARV confocal module (Kinetic Imaging, Nottingham, UK) using appropriate dichroic filter sets. Images were acquired with a MicroMAX cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) and processed using the Meta-Morph® Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). [32P]Orthophosphate (32Pi) Labeling and Receptor Immunoprecipitation—CHO-CRF1 or CHO-K1 Flp-In cells were serum starved for 1 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml of 32Pi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h, then 100 nm microcystin-LF (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added and the cells were incubated for a further 15 min before stimulation with 100 nm astressin or CRF at 37 °C, or left untreated. Cells were washed twice with PBS and extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 500 μl of glycerol lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 100 nm microcystin-LF, and Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche)). The samples were clarified by centrifugation, and FL-CRF1 receptor was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell lysate with 30 μl of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose conjugate (Sigma) for 16 h with constant mixing. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with glycerol buffer and eluted with 40 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 200 mm dl-1,4-dithiothreitol. Half the volume (20 μl) of the immunoprecipitates was resolved on a 4–20% Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). The gel was dried and incorporation of 32Pi measured using the VersaDoc3000 phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Measurement of Receptor Down-regulation by ELISA—CHO-CRF1 cells were seeded at 7.5 × 104 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well dishes (BIOCOAT). The following day the cells were subjected to the appropriate treatments, washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 200 μl/well of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in PBS supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, Roche) for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. Detergent-insoluble fractions were sedimented by 10 min centrifugation at 2,000 × g, and the amount of CRF1 receptor present in the clarified cell lysates was quantified by ELISA. Briefly, protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay method (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (12 μg/well) were transferred to anti-FLAG M2-coated 96-well plates (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Each well was washed 4 times with ELISA wash buffer (0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the previously described anti-CRF1 receptor antiserum 4467a-CRF1 (31Chatzaki E. Murphy B.J. Wang L. Million M. Ohning G.V. Crowe P.D. Petroski R. Tache Y. Grigoriadis D.E. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) diluted 1:10,000 in antibody dilution buffer (PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). The plates were washed, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2,000 in antibody dilution buffer, followed by a final four washes. Plates were incubated with 200 μl/well of ready-to-use horseradish peroxidase substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by addition of 100 μl/well 0.5 m H2SO4 to stop the reaction. The optical density of each well was read at 450 nm using an EMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To determine whether CRF and the antagonist astressin are both capable of inducing the internalization of the CRF1 receptor, CHO-CRF1 cells (CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the hemagglutinin-FLAG-tagged hCRF1 receptor) were treated with 100 nm CRF or astressin for 30 min to 24 h, and the loss of receptors from the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry. Time-matched vehicle-treated controls were also performed to allow all data points to be normalized to the appropriate level of cell surface expression. Fig. 1A shows that both CRF and astressin induced substantial internalization over this period, however, the total amount of internalization following 24 h stimulation with CRF was greater than with astressin (71 ± 7.4 and 51 ± 8.1%, respectively). This difference was the result of a higher rate of receptor sequestration by CRF in the first hour of stimulation (63% with CRF, 17% with astressin), after which sequestration by both peptides proceeded at similar rates (evident from the similar slopes of the graphs between 2 and 24 h in Fig. 1A). Full dose-response relationships were then produced for CRF and astressin to allow the EC50 values to be calculated (Fig. 1B). Both peptides internalized CRF1 receptor in a dose-dependent manner, however, despite the fact that astressin possessed only partial efficacy in the internalization assay, astressin and CRF promoted internalization with almost identical potencies (EC50 = 7.6 and 7.8 nm, respectively). Taken together, these data indicate that the agonist CRF possesses high efficacy for internalizing CRF1 receptors, whereas the antagonist astressin appears to possess only partial efficacy. Despite this difference in internalization efficacy, astressin and CRF were equipotent for this effect. We next determined whether the phenomenon of astressin-induced internalization also occurred in a cell line that expresses the CRF1 receptor endogenously. Corticotropes of the anterior pituitary are major sites of CRF1 receptor expression, where it stimulates the secretion of ACTH into the blood in response to CRF released from the hypothalamus (2Vale W. Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science. 1981; 213: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar, 32Chen R. Lewis K.A. Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The mouse pituitary corticotrope adenoma AtT20 cell line expresses CRF1 receptors (∼100 fmol/mg of membrane protein, data not shown), produces cyclic AMP (25Hoare S.J.R. Sullivan S.K. Fan J. Khongsaly K. Grigoriadis D.E. Peptides. 2005; 26: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and secretes ACTH (33Richardson U.I. Life Sci. 1983; 33: 1981-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) when challenged with CRF peptide. To measure CRF1 receptor internalization, AtT20 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged CRF1 receptor to allow its movement to be tracked both by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry (Fig. 2). Prior to treatment, immunostaining of live AtT20 cells with anti-FLAG M1 antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 dye revealed substantial cell surface expression and no visible staining of intracellular receptors (not shown). The cells were then treated for 2 h with vehicle, or with a maximal dose of CRF or astressin (10 μm), and the redistribution of the immunofluorescence-stained receptors was monitored. No internalization of CRF1 receptors was observed in cells treated with vehicle for 2 h (Fig. 2A, i), demonstrating that the conjugated M1 antibody alone did not induce receptor internalization. Following treatment with CRF, however, many of the labeled receptor molecules had redistributed from the cell surface into compartments within the cytosol (Fig. 2A, ii). A less robust but similar pattern of CRF1 receptor redistribution to intracellular compartments was observed following astressin treatment, with substantial levels of receptor remaining at the cell surface (Fig. 2A, iii). This reduced level of receptor redistribution with astressin correlated well with the amount of CRF1 receptor internalization measured in AtT20 cells using flow cytometry (Fig. 2B), where CRF induced internalization of 39% after 2 h, increasing to 45% at 4 h, while astressin internalized 9% after 2 h and 16% after 4 h. The majority of GPCRs are internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (16Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This process normally requires the receptors to be bound to agonist, phosphorylated by GRKs, and to recruit cytosolic arrestins, however, clathrin-mediated internalization following antagonist binding has also been reported (34Sneddon W.B.

Furthermore, some peptide antagonists are known to cause receptor phosphorylation without activating G protein coupling (21Thomas W.G. Qian H. Chang C.S. Karnik S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2893-2900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Holloway A.C. Qian H. Pipolo L. Ziogas J. Miura S. Karnik S. Southwell B.R. Lew M.J. Thomas W.G. Mol.

To determine whether such mechanisms could underlie astressin-induced CRF1 receptor internalization, we compared the ability of astressin and CRF to promote CRF1 receptor phosphorylation and the recruitment of β-arrestin2 (Fig. 3, A and B). CHO-CRF1 cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi, stimulated with 100 nm astressin or CRF between 5 min and 1 h, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the CRF1 receptor was assessed by autoradiography of receptor immunoprecipitates. Fig. 3A shows that stimulation of cells with astressin caused no phosphorylation of the rece"
https://openalex.org/W2161353685,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) enhances urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) expression in ovarian cancer cells; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this event have not been investigated. In this study, we used the invasive ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 cell line to explore the signaling molecules and pathways essential for LPA-induced uPA up-regulation. With the aid of specific inhibitors and dominant negative forms of signaling molecules, we determined that the G<sub>i</sub>-associated pathway mediates this LPA-induced event. Moreover, constitutively active H-Ras and Raf-1-activating H-Ras mutant enhance uPA expression, whereas dominant negative H-Ras and Raf-1 block LPA-induced uPA up-regulation, suggesting that the Ras-Raf pathway works downstream of G<sub>i</sub> to mediate this LPA-induced process. Surprisingly, dominant negative MEK1 or Erk2 displays only marginal inhibitory effect on LPA-induced uPA up-regulation, suggesting that a signaling pathway distinct from Raf-MEK1/2-Erk is the prominent pathway responsible for this process. In this report, we demonstrate that LPA activates NF-κB in a Ras-Raf-dependent manner and that blocking NF-κB activation with either non-phosphorylable IκB or dominant negative IκB kinase abolished LPA-induced uPA up-regulation and uPA promoter activation. Furthermore, introducing mutations to knock out the NF-κB binding site of the uPA promoter results in over 80% reduction in LPA-induced uPA promoter activation, whereas this activity is largely intact with the promoter containing mutations in the AP1 binding sites. Thus these results suggest that the G<sub>i</sub>-Ras-Raf-NF-κB signaling cascade is responsible for LPA-induced uPA up-regulation in ovarian cancer cells."

Using a strategy of consecutive enzymatic digestions and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, we succeeded in identifying a number of disulfide-linked peptides from the N-terminal cysteine-rich region. Based on these building blocks, we propose a model that can explain the various oligomeric forms found in purified MBL preparations. Furthermore, the model was challenged by the production of cysteine to serine mutants of the three N-terminally situated cysteines.

It is a C-type lectin that recognizes and binds to specific sugars such as d-mannose and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine present on pathogen surfaces (1Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The main functions in innate immunity are 1) the opsonin effect, where it binds to the surface of the pathogen and thereby enhances its clearance from the bloodstream (2Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and 2) the ability to activate the complement cascade via the lectin pathway (3Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Activation of the complement cascade requires binding of the MBL-associated serine proteases to the oligomeric forms of MBL (3Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 4Dahl M.R. Thiel S. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Willis A.C. Christensen T. Vorup-Jensen T. Jensenius J.C.

Nature. 1997; 386: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex that perforates the cell membrane of the pathogen. The function of MBL is thus dependent on its oligomeric structure, since the small oligomer forms act as opsonins and the large oligomer forms activate complement (6Holmskov U. Laursen S.B.

Silverman V.J. Ezekowitz R.A. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The overall polypeptide structure of MBL is similar to that of the other collectins (surfactant protein A, surfactant protein D, conglutinin, CL-43, liver collectin 1, and CL-46). It includes a short, cysteine-rich N-terminal stretch (aa 1–21), a collagen-like region (aa 22–81) with one interruption (aa 43–44) that causes the collagen-like structure to bend, a neck region (aa 82–115), and a carbohydrate recognition domain (aa 116–228) (9Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). This domain confers the carbohydrate specificity of MBL and is stabilized by two disulfide bonds (1Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Due to the collagen-like domain, MBL forms homotrimers, designated the MBL subunit. The collagen-like structure is stabilized by the presence of hydroxyprolines and glycosylated hydroxylysines (10Ma Y. Shida H. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The subunit structures assemble from the C to the N terminus. The neck region initiates the folding (11Childs R.A. Feizi T. Yuen C.T. Drickamer K. Quesenberry S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20770-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the collagen-like region zips toward the N terminus, creating trimeric subunits. The structure is finally stabilized by intrasubunit disulfide bonds in the N-terminal region (12Hansen S. Holmskov U. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 165-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The oligomer structure of MBL is similar to the structure of C1q, the primary component of the classical pathway of complement (13Ikeda K. Sannoh T. Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7451-7454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the bouquet-like forms arise from the formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds in the N-terminal region (14Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1143-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, whereas C1q is made up of three different polypeptide chains, MBL consists of homotrimers. In addition, C1q only exists as hexamers, whereas MBL exists as anything from dimers to octamers. The disulfide-bonding pattern of C1q thus cannot be expected to be identical to that of MBL. The elucidation of the structure of MBL is complicated by the fact that the polypeptide chain of MBL is very heterogeneous. In addition to several post-translational modifications, there are three well documented mutations in the collagen-like region (15Garred P. Thiel S. Madsen H.O. Ryder L.P. Jensenius J.C. Svejgaard A.

Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These mutations all lead to amino acid substitutions, which distort the collagen-like region and inhibit the correct formation of the oligomer forms of MBL. In addition to the heterogeneity of the polypeptide chain, promoter polymorphisms (18Madsen H.O. Garred P. Thiel S. Kurtzhals J.A. Lamm L.U. Ryder L.P. Svejgaard A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3013-3020PubMed Google Scholar) result in highly variable amounts of MBL in the blood. The objective of the present work was to map the disulfide-bonding pattern of the N-terminal part of MBL. The work was performed using recombinant protein due to the availability of larger amounts and the fact that the recombinant protein would be more homogenous than MBL purified from a pool of plasma.

Proteins—rhMBL was produced by NatImmune A/S using a human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, principally as described elsewhere (19Vorup-Jensen T. Sørensen E.S. Jensen U.B. Schwaeble W. Kawasaki T. Ma Y. Uemura K. Wakamiya N. Suzuki Y. Jensen T.G. Takahashi K. Ezekowitz A.B. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). rhMBL was captured from the cell debris-deprived cell culture broth using a Glucosamine-Sepharose 4FF column (custom-designed resin from Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently eluted with TBS containing EDTA. The retained product was concentrated on a Source 30Q column and desalted on a Sephacryl S-400 HR column (both column materials from Amersham Biosciences). The full process also included steps to remove DNA by nuclease treatment (Benzonase; Merck) and removal of virus (Planova filters; Asahi Kasei Corp.). Western Blot—The protein samples were separated using 3–8% SDS-PAGE from Novex. 20 ng of protein was loaded per lane, and electrophoresis was for 2 h at 125 V. The gel was blotted onto a prewetted 45-nm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the XCell II blot module and a blotting time of 135 min at 25 V. The membrane was blocked for 30 min in a Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, and the primary antibody was applied and incubated for 3–12 h with gentle shaking. The membrane was washed and incubated with the second antibody for 90 min with gentle shaking. The protein bands were finally visualized using the SuperSignal West substrate (Pierce) and Fujifilms. Electron Microscopy—Purified MBL was diluted and adsorbed to glow-discharged, carbon-coated copper grids at room temperature. Grids were then washed with two drops of deionized water and stained with two drops of freshly prepared 0.75% uranyl formate (Pfaltz & Bauer, Waterbury, CT). Specimens were inspected with a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope operated at 120 kV. Images were taken at a nominal magnification of 52,000 Å using low dose procedures. Coating of Magnetic Beads—The MPG® Long Chain Alkylamine beads (CPG Inc.) were coated with 50 μg of porcine trypsin as previously described (20Krogh T.N. Berg T. Højrup P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 274: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Proteolytic Digestions—Lyophilized rhMBL was reconstituted in 8 m urea and diluted to 1 m in 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 5% chymotrypsin (1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated; Worthington). The digestion mixture was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, and the enzyme activity was quenched by freezing until separation by reversed phase HPLC. Lyophilized N-terminal of rhMBL was reconstituted in 8 m urea and diluted to 1 m in 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 50 μl of trypsin-coated magnetic beads. To a control sample in the same buffer was added 5 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide (IAA), and the mixture was incubated for 10 min in the dark prior to the addition of trypsin-coated beads. The digestions were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with shaking and quenched by removal of the magnetic beads and freezing until separation by reversed phase HPLC. Some lyophilized fractions of N-terminal rhMBL peptides were reconstituted in 5 μl of 10 mm NH4HCO3 and 1 μl of subtilisin (1 pmol/μl of 10 mm NH4HCO3; Calbiochem). The digestions were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and quenched by micropurification and elution onto MALDI target. Reversed Phase HPLC—All proteolytic digestions were separated using the Δkta LC-900 system controlled by Unicorn software (version 3.21.02; Amersham Biosciences). All separations were performed on a Jupiter 5μ C18 250 × 4.60-mm column (Phenomenex), using a 1%/min gradient from 5–50% B solvent followed by a 3%/min gradient from 50–80% B solvent. The A solvent used was 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and the B solvent was 90% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The subdigestions of the N-terminal part of rhMBL were separated using a Jupiter 5μ C18 250 × 2.00-mm column (Phenomenex). Fractions were analyzed by MALDI MS or MALDI Q-TOF MS. Reduction of Disulfides—Lyophilized samples were reconstituted in 10 mm DTT, incubated at 56 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by MALDI MS or MALDI Q-TOF MS. N-terminal Sequencing—N-terminal sequencing of peptides was performed on a Hewlett Packard G1005A protein sequencing system run according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Approximately 100 pmol of sample was applied to the sequencer. MALDI MS of rhMBL Peptides—MALDI MS analysis of peptides was performed on a Voyager-DE™ STR controlled by the Data Explorer software (version 3.4.0.0; both from PerSeptive Biosystems). The instrument was run with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV, grid voltage 65%, and delay time 100 ns. 100–300 shots were accumulated per spectrum. Approximately 1 pmol of sample was loaded in α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (20 μg/μl in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) using the dried droplet method. MALDI Q-TOF MS—MALDI Q-TOF MS of peptides was performed on a Q-Tof Ultima™ MALDI controlled by MassLynx software (version 3.5; both from Micromass Ltd.). Approximately 10 pmol of sample was concentrated on a reversed phase microcolumn (POROS® 50 R2; Perseptive Biosystems) packed in a GelLoader tip (Eppendorf) as previously described (21Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The sample was eluted onto the target with a 10 μg/μl solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Data Analysis—All data obtained on the Voyager-DE™ STR was processed using the m/z software (version 2001.08.14; Proteometrics Inc.). External calibration of all spectra was performed using tryptic peptides of lactoglobulin (MH+ values of 837.48 and 2313.27). All MALDI Q-TOF data were processed using the MassLynx software (version 3.5; Micromass Ltd.). Peptides and modifications were identified using the GPMAW software (version 5.03; Lighthouse Data) and the sequence of human MBL (Swiss-Prot number P11226), without the 20-aa signal peptide. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human cDNA encoding wild-type MBL has previously been cloned (19Vorup-Jensen T. Sørensen E.S. Jensen U.B. Schwaeble W. Kawasaki T. Ma Y. Uemura K. Wakamiya N. Suzuki Y. Jensen T.G. Takahashi K. Ezekowitz A.B. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding MBL was recloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Briefly, the cDNA coding for MBL is placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer. To create the mutant variants of MBL, we mutated Cys5, Cys12, and Cys18 to Ser using a PCR-based method. We modified the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) method to create all possible combinations of mutants. The mutagenesis reactions were carried out as described elsewhere. 2P. H. Jensen and D. Weilguny, manuscript in preparation. After mutagenesis, the relevant parts of the plasmid were sequenced to verify that the correct mutations were generated. Transient Transfection of HEK-293 Cells—Transient transfection of the mutated MBL constructs into human embryonic kidney HEK293-F cells was performed using the FreeStyle™ 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). For transfection, 2 μg of each of the plasmids, complexed to the transfection reagent 293fect, was added to 5 × 106 cells in T-25 flasks with FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with ascorbic acid. The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C with a humid atmosphere of 8% CO2. After 7 days, the supernatants were harvested and analyzed by Western blot. Oligomeric Distribution of MBL—Electron microscope pictures of pMBL and rhMBL (Fig. 1) show that the structures present in the plasma-derived preparation of MBL are also present in the rhMBL preparation. A Western blot of rhMBL also shows the presence of the many different oligomer forms (Fig. 2A). Upon reduction all the forms of rhMBL are reduced to the polypeptide chain of MBL with the apparent mass of ∼32 kDa (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Western blots of nonreduced rhMBL (A) and reduced rhMBL (B). A, 20 ng of a denatured rhMBL was separated using a 3–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex). B, 10 ng of a reduced and denatured rMBL was separated on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex). Both gels were blotted onto 0.45-μm membranes, and rhMBL was detected using anti-pMBL antibodies (Hyb131.1; The Antibody Shop) and SuperSignal West substrate (Pierce).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isolation of the N-terminal Part of rhMBL—In order to isolate the N-terminal part of rhMBL from the C-terminal part, several different digests (trypsin, endoproteinase Lys-C, collagenase) and chemical cleavage (cyanogen bromide) were set up (data not shown). However, the N-terminal peptides could not be recovered from any of these preparations. The N-terminal peptides were finally obtained from a chymotryptic digest separated by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 3). All of the fractions were monitored by MALDI MS in order to locate the N-terminal region. The heterogeneous peak eluting at ∼25% (v/v) acetonitrile (27–30 min in Fig. 3) contained Glu1–Leu46 of rhMBL. The mass spectrum inserted in Fig. 3 shows the reduced N-terminal peptide with an m/z value of 5316. The four peak clusters at m/z 5154, 4992, 4830, and 4668 correspond to the loss of 1–4 monosaccharide units respectively, originating from the glycosylated residues Lys36 and Lys39, probably due to in-source fragmentation. The heterogeneity of each peak cluster arises from the variation in hydroxylation of residues Pro21 and Pro27. The identity of the peptides was further confirmed using Edman degradation. Identification of Disulfide-linked Peptides and the Bonds Involved—The disulfide-linked peptides Glu1-Leu46 were subdigested with trypsin, and the resulting peptide mix was separated by reversed phase HPLC. All peaks in Fig. 4 were monitored, reduced, and nonreduced by MALDI MS in order to locate disulfide-linked peptides. A tryptic digest of the N-terminal part of MBL yields two cysteine-containing peptides: Glu1–Lys10 and Thr11–Lys29. Several different disulfide-linked species were identified in the reversed phase HPLC run as indicated in Fig. 4. One fraction contained two peptides Glu1–Lys10 interlinked by a disulfide bond (Fig. 4). Fig. 5A illustrates how the peak at m/z 2243 disappears upon reduction, yielding m/z 1123, which corresponds to Glu1–Lys10. This identifies the presence of a Cys5–Cys5 bond in rhMBL as illustrated by the inset in Fig. 5A. The presence of a peak at m/z 1123 in the nonreduced spectrum is due to partial in-source fragmentation of the disulfide bond. Several fractions contained two peptides Glu1–Lys10 linked to one peptide Thr11–Lys29 (Fig. 4). The separation into multiple fractions reflects the heterogeneity in the hydroxylation of Pro21 and Pro27. As illustrated by Fig. 5B, the peak at m/z 4092 disappears upon reduction, yielding two peaks at m/z 1123 and 1849 corresponding to the peptides Glu1–Lys10 and Thr11–Lys29. This identifies the presence of a Cys5–Cys12 and a Cys5–Cys18 bond in rhMBL as illustrated by the inset in Fig. 5B. Also present in the nonreduced spectrum in Fig. 5B is a peak at m/z 2972, which disappears upon reduction. This peak corresponds to one peptide Glu1–Lys10 and one peptide Thr11–Lys29 inter-linked by a disulfide bond. This species arises from the insource fragmentation of a disulfide bond resulting in the loss of one peptide Glu1–Lys10 (m/z 1123, also present in the spectrum) within the mass spectrometer. Several fractions contained two interlinked peptides Thr11–Lys29 (Fig. 4). Again this is the result of the heterogeneity in the hydroxylation of Pro21 and Pro27. As illustrated by Fig. 5C, the peak at m/z 3697 disappears upon reduction, yielding a peak at m/z 1849 corresponding to peptide Thr11-Lys29. This does not lead directly to the identification of disulfide bonds, since peptide Thr11-Lys29 contains two cysteines as illustrated by the inset in Fig. 5C. In order to identify the involved disulfide bonds, the fraction was subdigested with subtilisin, since Wallis and Drickamer (22Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have previously shown that subtilisin can cut the Ala15–Cys16 bond in rat rMBL-C. Fig. 6 illustrates the original sample (top panel), the nonreduced subtilisin-digested sample (middle panel), and the corresponding reduced sample (lower panel). The subtilisin digestion gives rise to two peaks (m/z 1345 and 2390), which disappear upon reduction. These two peaks correspond to two interlinked Thr11–Ala17 peptides and two interlinked Cys18–Lys29 peptides, cleavage taking place at the Ala17–Cys18 bond. This identifies the presence of Cys12–Cys12 and Cys18–Cys18 bonds in rhMBL, as illustrated by the two building blocks inserted in the top of Fig. 6. Upon reduction, the peak at m/z 1196 (Cys18–Lys29) gets more intense, whereas the peak of Thr11–Ala17 (m/z 672) is below the cut-off m/z. This parameter is set to avoid suppression of the peptide signals, due to intense matrix signals in the low mass range. Identification and Localization of a Free Cysteine—Fig. 4 also shows one fraction containing two peptides Glu1–Lys10 linked to two peptides Thr11–Lys29. However, this species was not identified in the control run, where IAA was added prior to trypsin digestion. Here one peptide Glu1–Lys10 linked to one peptide Thr11–Lys29 with one IAA was identified. Upon reduction of this species, two peaks at m/z 1123 and 1907 appeared, corresponding to Glu1–Lys10 and Thr11–Lys29 + IAA (data not shown). The peak at m/z 1907 was further fragmented by MALDI Q-TOF MS, and from the resulting mass spectrum (Fig. 7) most of the peptide sequence could be deduced. This sequence reveals that Pro21 and Pro27 are both hydroxylated, Asn24 is deamidated (procedure-related artifact), and Cys18 is not modified by IAA, leaving only Cys12 to be alkylated, indicating the presence of a free Cys12 in rhMBL. This is illustrated by the inset in Fig. 7. Two such peptides can, if the cysteines are not protected otherwise, form a Cys12–Cys12 disulfide bond. This scrambling can give rise to the 2 (Glu1–Lys10) + 2 (Thr11–Lys29) species identified in the nonalkylated sample (Fig. 4). Also shown in Fig. 4 is the presence of three interlinked peptides Thr11–Lys29. Based on the intensity of the mass spectra, this tripeptide is present in less than 2% of the dipeptide. The tripeptide is no longer observed in the control run (i.e. after alkylation), indicating that it must have arisen by scrambling of a larger oligomer by the free cysteine (Cys12). The conformation of this species is likely to resemble that of two-cysteine collectins like CL-43, but due to the low amount present, this was not investigated. Oligomerization of the Cys to Ser Mutants of rhMBL—The preliminary binding model proposed, based on the MALDI MS results shown so far, was challenged by the production of Cys to Ser mutants of the N-terminal cysteines responsible for this binding. A series of PCR setups led to the production of all of the possible Cys to Ser mutants (i.e. the three single mutants, the three double mutants, and the triple mutant). A Western blot of their oligomerization patterns is illustrated in Fig. 8. The C5S and C12S single mutants form mainly polypeptide dimers and subunit monomers. C5S also forms a small amount of different oligomers. The C18S single mutant and all of the double mutants form polypeptide monomer but mainly polypeptide dimers. The triple mutant only exists as polypeptide monomers, as expected. Model for Oligomer Formation in rhMBL—Since the MBL molecule is known to consist of 2–8 subunits plus intermediate forms (Fig. 2), a model will have to allow for the continuous assembly as well as the termination of disulfide bonding. The results from the MALDI MS experiments (Figs. 5, 6, 7) and the Cys to Ser mutants (Fig. 8) together gave rise to the oligomerization model illustrated in Fig. 9. This scheme proposes the formation of two isomers of a continuous subunit as well as a terminating subunit. The present study was performed using recombinant human mannan-binding lectin (rMBL) as opposed to plasma-derived mannan-binding lectin (pMBL). This approach presents several advantages. First, rMBL produced from one clone expressing a single type of MBL is more homogenous than pMBL purified from a pool of plasma, where several isoforms are known to exist (15Garred P. Thiel S. Madsen H.O. Ryder L.P. Jensenius J.C. Svejgaard A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 90: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Lipscombe R.J. Sumiya M. Hill A.V. Lau Y.L. Levinsky R.J.

Immunogenetics. 1994; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Second, the quantities necessary for this kind of study are readily available, unlike performing a similar study on pMBL. Purification of such a large amount of homozygotic wild type pMBL would require large amounts of genotyped A/A plasma, and interpretation of the results could be further complicated by the presence of partially degraded pMBL as a result of the natural turnover in the human body. In addition, all available evidence indicates that no major differences exist, with regard to post-translational modification and processing, between the native and the recombinant protein. The rMBL is produced in human cells, from a construct containing the wild type human MBL gene. A previous study of the similarity between pMBL and rMBL found that HEK293 rMBL is both structurally and functionally similar to pMBL (19Vorup-Jensen T. Sørensen E.S. Jensen U.B. Schwaeble W. Kawasaki T. Ma Y. Uemura K. Wakamiya N. Suzuki Y. Jensen T.G. Takahashi K. Ezekowitz A.B. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This study analyzed both the degree of oligomerization and the complement activating properties of rMBL. Electron microscopy pictures comparing the structures of pMBL and rMBL further support the high similarity (Fig. 1). Furthermore, all post-translational modifications located in rMBL have also been identified in pMBL (23.Nielsen, P. H. (2001) Primary Structure Analysis of Human MBL: Disulfide Bonds and Other Modifications. Master's thesis, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, DenmarkGoogle Scholar), and the complement activating capabilities of the two preparations are similar (24Jensenius J.C. Jensen P.H. McGuire K. Larsen J.L. Thiel S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The MBL subunit consists of three interlinked polypeptide chains (the subunit monomer) that further assemble into oligomeric forms. The collagen-like region, in combination with the α-helical coiled-coil neck region, is responsible for the association of the polypeptide chains into the subunit monomer (10Ma Y. Shida H. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Childs R.A. Feizi T. Yuen C.T. Drickamer K. Quesenberry S. J. Biol. Chem. 199"
https://openalex.org/W1985996671,"(-)-Matairesinol is a central biosynthetic intermediate to numerous 8–8′-lignans, including the antiviral agent podophyllotoxin in Podophyllum species and its semi-synthetic anticancer derivatives teniposide, etoposide, and Etopophos®. It is formed by action of an enantiospecific secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase, an NAD(H)-dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the conversion of (-)-secoisolariciresinol. Matairesinol is also a plant-derived precursor of the cancer-preventative “mammalian” lignan or “phytoestrogen” enterolactone, formed in the gut following ingestion of high fiber dietary foodstuffs, for example. Additionally, secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase is involved in pathways to important plant defense molecules, such as plicatic acid in the western red cedar (Thuja plicata) heartwood. To understand the molecular and enantiospecific basis of Podophyllum secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase, crystal structures of the apo-form and binary/ternary complexes were determined at 1.6, 2.8, and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. The enzyme is a homotetramer, consisting of an α/β single domain monomer containing seven parallel β-strands flanked by eight α-helices on both sides. Its overall monomeric structure is similar to that of NAD(H)-dependent short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, with a conserved Asp47 forming a hydrogen bond with both hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose of NAD(H), and thus specificity toward NAD(H) instead of NADP(H). The highly conserved catalytic triad (Ser153, Tyr167, and Lys171) is adjacent to both NAD+ and substrate molecules, where Tyr167 functions as a general base. Following analysis of high resolution structures of the apo-form and two complex forms, the molecular basis for both the enantio-specificity and the reaction mechanism of secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase is discussed and compared with that of pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase.

The 8–8′-linked lignans represent an abundant class of ubiquitous vascular plant natural products, with important roles in human health protection, pharmacological applications, as well as in plant defense (1.Lewis N.G.

Of these, the lignans matairesinol (1), secoisolariciresinol (2) (Fig. 1), or derivatives thereof can accumulate in high fiber foodstuffs and are metabolized in humans following dietary ingestion to afford the cancer-preventative “mammalian” lignans/“phytoestrogens” enterolactone (3) and enterodiol (4) (3.Adlercreutz H.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In particular, the (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein has been extensively studied in vitro (23.Halls S.C. Lewis N.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9455-9461Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31.Halls S.C. Davin L.B. Kramer D.M. Lewis N.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2587-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), in terms of the kinetics of its unique stereoselective radical capture/coupling mechanism that controls both regio- and stereospecificities during phenoxy radical coupling. Thus, a recent report (33.Morreel K. Ralph J. Kim H. Lu F. Goeminne G. Ralph S. Messens E. Boerjan W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3537-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) claiming that the (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein physiological function in vivo was “elusive” cannot be reconciled with the fact that its function has been explicitly and unambiguously documented in vitro (13.Davin L.B.

The generation of an “unnatural” lignan derived from 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol (10), in extracts from caffeic acid O-methyltransferase-deficient poplar, is not evidence for the lack of stereoselective coupling control, because, for example, dirigent proteins have not been shown to bind and utilize 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol in vitro. Indeed, generation of this unnatural dimer is not unexpected given the experimental design employed. In contrast, there are innumerable examples of rigorous stereoselective and regiospecific coupling control in the plant kingdom involving formation of 8–8′-, 8–2′, 8–5′-, 8-O-4′-lignans, norlignans (1.Lewis N.G.

Furthermore, in the case of (+)-pinoresinol (11a)-mediated formation in many species, the latter can undergo sequential enantiospecific reductions, catalyzed by the NADPH-dependent bifunctional pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase (PLR) 1The abbreviations used are: PLR, pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase; Lu, L. usitatissimum; PDB, protein data bank; Pp, P. peltatum; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; SDH, secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases; Tp, T. plicata.1The abbreviations used are: PLR, pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase; Lu, L. usitatissimum; PDB, protein data bank; Pp, P. peltatum; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; SDH, secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases; Tp, T. plicata.

There are also other examples, such as in Thuja plicata, where two enantio-merically distinct forms of PLR have been reported and fully characterized (1.Lewis N.G. Davin L.B. Barton Sir, D.H.R. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 1. Elsevier Science Ltd., London, UK1999: 639-712Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Fujita M. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol.

Ser. 1998; 697: 389-421Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and there is indirect evidence that different enantiospecific pathways in lignan biosynthetic pathways may be operative in distinct organs even within the same plant (43.Suzuki S. Umezawa T. Shimada M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1468-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These discoveries thus point again to the exquisite level of control exercised over phenoxy radical coupling processes and downstream metabolism. More recently, it was possible to explain the molecular basis of catalysis and the distinct enantiospecificities of PLRs following comparative analyses of the x-ray crystal structure (2.5 Å resolution) of T. plicata PLR_Tp1 (10.Fujita M. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 618-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and L. usitatissimum PLR_Lu (20.Ford, J. D. (2001) Cancer Chemopreventive Flax Seed Lignans: Delineating the Metabolic Pathway(s) to the SDG-HMG Ester-linked Polymer. Ph.D. thesis, Washington State UniversityGoogle Scholar) (with (-)-pinoresinol (11b)) and those catalyzing the opposite conversion using (+)-pinoresinol (11a), i.e. PL-R_Tp2 (10.Fujita M. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 618-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Forsythia intermedia PLR_Fi1 (12.Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R.

In all cases, a highly conserved Lys is required for general base catalysis as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (K138A) through abolition of PLR_Tp1 catalytic activity (28.Min T. Kasahara H. Bedgar D.L. Youn B. Lawrence P.K. Gang D.R. Halls S.C. Park H. Hilsenbeck J.L. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Kang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50714-50723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To account for the enantiospecific differences, a comparison of the amino acid sequences of PLR_Tp1/PLR_Lu and PLR_Fi1/PLR_Tp2, together with modeling of the PLR substrate binding pocket, revealed symmetrical substitutions in both enantiospecific classes favoring binding of the (-)-antipode (11b) with PLR_Tp1/PLR_Lu and (+)-pinoresinol (11a) with PLR_Tp2/PLR_Fi1, i.e. from Val268/Leu272 in PLR_Tp1 (Val265/Leu272 in PLR_Lu) to Gly267/Phe271 in PLR_Tp2 (Gly268/Tyr272 in PLR_Fi1), respectively. A third amino acid substitution, in the enantiospecifically distinct PLR_Tp1 and PLR_Tp2, was also considered as potentially enhancing substrate binding specificity in Thuja species, i.e. from Phe164 in PLR_Tp1 to Leu164 in PLR_Tp2 (28.Min T. Kasahara H. Bedgar D.L. Youn B. Lawrence P.K. Gang D.R. Halls S.C. Park H. Hilsenbeck J.L. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Kang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50714-50723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although there were other symmetrical substitutions in both PLR enantiospecific classes (i.e. those at the equivalent positions of Gln47, Leu128, Gln252, and Met305 in PLR_Tp1), these are more likely associated with substrate access or gating rather than being involved in binding/catalysis. The current study was therefore next directed toward establishing the crystal structure of secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SDH), which catalyzes the enantiospecific conversion of (-)-secoisolariciresinol (2a) into (-)-matairesinol (1a) (Fig. 2) (5.Xia Z.-Q. Costa M.A. Proctor J. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 2000; 55: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21.Xia Z.-Q. Costa M.A. Pélissier H.C. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12614-12623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This is the last enzymatic step in vascular plants to the precursor of the mammalian lignan, enterolactone (3), as well as being involved in the pathway to the antiviral lignan, podophyllotoxin (5), and thus to its semi-synthetic derivatives, teniposide (6), etoposide (7), and Etopophos® (8). As indicated earlier, it is also an obligatory step to various plant defense metabolites, such as plicatic acid (9). Metabolite Isolation—(-)-Matairesinol (1a) was isolated from F. intermedia stems as described in Umezawa et al. (44.Umezawa T. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10210-10217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of SDH—SDH_Pp7, cloned into an Invitrogen pTrcHis2-TOPO® TA vector, was transformed into TOP10 Escherichia coli cells as described previously (21.Xia Z.-Q. Costa M.A. Pélissier H.C. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12614-12623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Expression of SDH_Pp7 was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm final concentration at mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5–0.7). The induced cell suspension cultures were grown for 12 h at 37 °C, with shaking at 250 rpm. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 20 min). The SDH_Pp7-derived pellet was suspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing EDTA (3 mm) and dithiothreitol (3 mm)), sonicated (5 × 10 s, model 450 sonifier®, Branson Ultrasonics Co.), and centrifuged (20,000 × g for 40 min). The resulting supernatant was next subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation, with the recombinant SDH_Pp7 precipitating between 70 and 80% ammonium sulfate. This fraction was reconstituted in 40 ml of Buffer A, desalted over a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), then subjected to anion exchange column chromatography (Self Pack™ POROS® 10HQ, Applied Biosystems) pre-equilibrated in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing EDTA (3 mm) and dithiothreitol (1 mm)), at a flow rate of 5 ml min−1. Recombinant SDH_Pp7 was eluted using a NaCl step gradient (to 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 2.0 m, 50 ml each), and the corresponding fractions of interest (eluting at 0.1 m NaCl) were desalted and concentrated into Buffer B by ultrafiltration in an Amicon 8050 cell with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore). The concentrated SDH_Pp7 was next applied to a MonoQ® HR16/10 (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column equilibrated in Buffer B at a flow rate of 3 ml min−1 and eluted using a NaCl step gradient (to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 2.0 m; 20 ml each); the corresponding catalytically active fractions were eluted at 0.05 m NaCl. This SDH_Pp7-enriched fraction was then concentrated as above, the buffer exchanged to 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and applied to a CHT-10 hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column (1 × 10 cm), equilibrated in the same buffer, at a flow rate of 3.5 ml min−1. The column was eluted with a linear sodium phosphate gradient (5–500 mm in 200 ml). SDH_Pp7 did not bind to the matrix, and the flow-through fraction containing it was concentrated as above with the buffer exchanged to Buffer B. The resulting SDH_Pp7-enriched protein fraction was then applied to a MonoQ™ GL10/100 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml min−1 and eluted with a NaCl step gradient (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 2.0 m; 20 ml each); the catalytically active SDH_Pp7 fraction eluted at 0.05 m NaCl. The SDH_Pp7 so obtained was concentrated, with a final purity >99% as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Coomassie Blue staining). Molecular Mass Determination by Size Exclusion Chromatography and Multiangle Laser Light Scattering—A TSK G3000SW (TosoHaas) column was pre-equilibrated in Buffer B followed by loading of the SDH_Pp7 solution (100 μl, 1 or 2 mg ml−1) in the same buffer. The chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 and a temperature of 22 °C by using an Acuflow series IV pump (Analytical Instruments), with the resulting eluant passed in tandem through a UV detector (Gilson), a refractometer (Optilab DSP, Wyatt Technology Corp.), and a multiangle laser light-scattering detector (Dawn EOS, Wyatt Technology Corp.), respectively, with the scattering data analyzed using the software ASTRA (Wyatt Technology Corp.). Relative weight-average molecular masses were determined from the scattering data using the Zimm fitting method, in which K*c/R(Q) is plotted against sin2(Q/2), where Q is the scattering angle; R(Q) is the excess intensity (I) of scattered light at the angle Q; c is the concentration of the sample, and K* is a constant equal to 4π2n2(dn/dc)2/λ04NA (where n = solvent refractive index; dn/dc = refractive index increment of scattering sample; λ0 = wavelength of scattered light, and NA = Avogadro's number). Extrapolation of the Zimm plot to zero angle gave an estimate of the weight-averaged molecular mass (M̄w), where the latter is defined in Equation 1, M¯w=∑(ciMi)∑ci (Eq. 1) for c moles of i different species with individual molecular weights (Mi).

https://openalex.org/W2047652788,"The cDNAs for two isoforms (I and II) of the 14-3-3 proteins have been cloned and functionally characterized in Trypanosoma brucei. The amino acid sequences of isoforms I and II have 47 and 50% identity to the human τ isoform, respectively, with important conserved features including a potential amphipathic groove for the binding of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing motifs and a nuclear export signal-like domain. Both isoforms are abundantly expressed at approximately equal levels (1–2 × 106 molecules/cell) and localized mainly in the cytoplasm. Knockdown by induction of double-stranded RNA of isoform I and/or II in both bloodstream and procyclic forms resulted first in a reduction of cell motility and then significant reduction in cell growth rates and morphological changes; the changes include aberrant numbers of organelles and abnormal shapes and sizes that mimic phenotypes produced by various cytokinesis inhibitors. Morphological and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of the cell cycle suggested that isoforms I and II might play important roles in nuclear (G2-M transition) and cell (M-G1 transition) division. These findings indicate that the 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in cell motility, cytokinesis, and the cell cycle.

These findings indicate that the 14-3-3 proteins play important roles in cell motility, cytokinesis, and the cell cycle. 14-3-3 proteins are a group of dimeric acidic proteins with a relative molecular mass of 30 kDa that bind to phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing sequences. 14-3-3 proteins are well conserved and exist in all lower and higher eukaryotes. The proteins are involved in many biological processes acting as molecular chaperones. In mammalian cells, 14-3-3 proteins are crucial for cell survival signaling through binding to proteins such as Raf-1, proapoptotic proteins BAD and BAX, transcription factor FKHR, and cell cycle phosphatase Cdc25 (for a review, see Refs. 1.Fu H.

In plants, 14-3-3 proteins act as important regulators of phosphorylated enzymes of biosynthetic metabolism, ion channels, and regulators of plant growth (6.Bunney T.D. van Walraven H.S. de Boer A.H.

Among yeast, 14-3-3 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with upstream activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (STE 20), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (RTG3), nutrient-regulated transcription factors (MSN2 and MSN4), and cell cycle-dependent filaments in the nucleus (FIN 1) (for a review, see Ref. 9.van Hemert M.J. van Heusden G.P.H. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 14-3-3 proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe bind to cell cycle-dependent phosphatase (Cdc25) and phospholipase C (9.van Hemert M.J. van Heusden G.P.H. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, yeast 14-3-3 proteins are functionally interchangeable with the plant and mammalian isoforms (9.van Hemert M.J. van Heusden G.P.H. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting genetic conservation of 14-3-3 molecules in these species. However, to our knowledge, there have been no functional analyses of protozoan 14-3-3. The protozoan pathogen T. brucei is the causal agent of sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana disease in cattle, which hamper African human health and economies, respectively. The disease is spread by the bite of the tsetse fly, in which procyclic forms (PCF) 1The abbreviations used are: PCF, procyclic form(s); BSF, bloodstream form(s); dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; dsRNAi, dsRNA interference; PP1, phosphatase 1; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; Tet, tetracycline; OKA, okadaic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; Ab, antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: PCF, procyclic form(s); BSF, bloodstream form(s); dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; dsRNAi, dsRNA interference; PP1, phosphatase 1; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; Tet, tetracycline; OKA, okadaic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; Ab, antibody. proliferate and differentiate into bloodstream forms (BSF), the life cycle stage that proliferates in the mammalian host. Signal transduction pathways in Trypanosoma brucei have not been extensively studied because of low homologies of the sequences to mammalian and yeast sequences, reflecting the ancient divergence of T. brucei in the eukaryotic lineage. We have therefore undertaken studies of 14-3-3 in T. brucei to identify global signal transduction pathways conserved from humans to trypanosomes as well as divergent pathways that may be novel targets to combat these devastating diseases. To elucidate the functions of 14-3-3 in PCF and BSF cells, we generated and characterized 14-3-3 isoform-specific Tet-inducible double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-expressing cell clones. We report here that inhibition of 14-3-3 expression produces cells with an aberrant number of organelles and multinucleated giant cells. Several earlier studies examined the control of nuclear number by protein phosphatases and their association with 14-3-3 molecules. The results of these studies can be summarized as follows: 1) treatment with protein phosphatase inhibitors induced multinucleated cells in Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi (10.Das A. Gale Jr., M. Carter V. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Orr G.A. Werner C. Xu J. Bennett M. Weiss L.M. Takvorkan P. Tanowitz H.B. Wittner M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); 2) mammalian 14-3-3s are complexed with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (12.Rubio M.P. Geraghty K.M. Wong B.H.C. Wood N.T. Campbell D.G. Morrice N. MacKintosh C. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and 3) PP1 and protein phosphatase 2A play important roles in cell division of mammalian cells and sperm motility (13.Sugiyama K.

These findings suggest that protein phosphatase might regulate the phosphorylation status of the microtubular network and thereby change protein-protein interaction with microtubule-associated proteins, of which disruption may cause aberrant cytokinesis and cell division. We also report here that 14-3-3 isoforms I and II play distinctive roles in nuclear division (G2-M transition) and cell division (M-G1 transition), respectively. The cell cycle of trypanosomes has periodic nuclear events, G1, S, G2, and M phases, which are identical to those in the eukaryotic cell cycle (16.Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to eukaryotes, trypanosomes exhibit a periodic S phase for the kinetoplast, and segregation of the kinetoplast before mitosis is a useful marker of cell cycle progression (16.Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell cycle control in trypanosomes also differs from other eukaryotes, since T. brucei cytokinesis is independent of both mitosis and nuclear DNA synthesis (17.Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain BSF 427 was grown in DDY mice and purified as described previously (18.Carrington M. Hide J.E. Protocols in Molecular Parasitology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 1-13Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 109 cells were used to purify total RNA with 20 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA was purified with the MACS mRNA isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). One μg of total RNA or 3 μg of mRNA were used to synthesize cDNA using Cap-finder oligonucleotide oligo(dT) (Clontech). The conserved amino acid sequences KMKGDY and VFYYEI of 14-3-3 among yeasts, plants, and mammals were used to design the primers, 5′-AARATGAARGGNGAYTAY-3′ and 5′-DATYTCRTARTARAANAC-3′. PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min and then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 48 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s plus 10 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s, followed by 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI), and the sequences of 11 clones were analyzed using an ABI 310 sequencer. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA end was carried out using T. brucei miniexon sequence, 5′-CGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTTG-3′, and the sequence obtained from the PCR product, 5′-GGTGCCAGTGAACTGTTCGCCA-3′. 3′-Rapid amplification of cDNA end was carried out using the PCR primer of Cap-finder (Clontech) and the sequence obtained from the PCR product, 5′-CACGGAGGTGGCGAACAGTTCA-3′. The 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end products were cloned, and the sequences were examined. The complete coding sequence of 14-3-3 obtained here was then used to screen a genomic library of the PCF 427 strain, which was constructed using λ BlueSTAR BamHI kit (Novagen, Madison, WI). Genomic DNA was completely digested with BamHI, and the above 9-kb fragments were ligated to the λ BlueSTAR. Plaques, which gave rise to five weak and three strong signals in low stringency hybridization conditions, were purified. pBlue-STAR plasmid clones were then obtained from those phage clones by in vivo excision. The resultant pBlueSTAR plasmid DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes, including PstI or SalI, to verify the restriction digestion patterns, and Southern blot hybridization was carried out using the coding sequence of 14-3-3. The ∼2.7-kb PstI-digested fragment that weakly hybridized and the ∼3.0-kb SalI-digested fragment that strongly hybridized with the coding sequence of 14-3-3 obtained by reverse transcription-PCR, were isolated and subcloned in pGEM 3Zf(+) (Promega). Sequences were examined using the EN::TN 〈KAN-2〉 insertion kit (Epicenter Technologies). A T. brucei cDNA library was constructed using λZipLox, NotI-SalI Arms (Invitrogen). Clones were obtained by hybridizations using two different 14-3-3 coding sequences. The coding sequences of 14-3-3 were also verified with those clones. 14-3-3 cDNA, designated as I, II, and human 14-3-3 τ, were amplified with LA Taq (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) using the following primers: I, sense (5′-CGAATTCATGACGGACTGCATCAAGT-3′) and antisense (5′-GGTCTCCACCCTTGTCAGTT-3′); II, sense (5′-CGGAATTCATGGCGGGCTTTCAAATAC-3′) and antisense (5′-GAGCTCACTCCAATTCCTCCATC-3′); τ, sense (5′-GAATTCATGGAGAAGACTGAGCTGATCC-3′ and antisense (5′-CTTAGTTTTCAGCCCCTTCTGCCGCAT-3′). Underlines indicate restriction enzyme recognition sites. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, and sequences were checked. Each EcoRI-digested cDNA fragment was subcloned into pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), pGEX-1λT (Amersham Biosciences). Wistar rats were immunized once with 200 μg of GST-I or II fusion proteins. Sera were obtained 3 weeks after immunization and used for this study. The overall scheme is shown as a diagram in Supplementary Fig. 1. Construction of the pQuadra1 Vector (Contains the Stuffer Fragment)—As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, in order to insert a BstXI-BamHI-SrfI/SmaI-BstXI polylinker into a TA-cloning site, the primer pair, 5′-TACCAACTCTATGGATCCGCCCGGGCCAA-3′ and 5′-TACCATCTCTTTGGCCCGGGCGGATCCAT-3′, was annealed and extended using ExTaq polymerase (Takara) and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the sequence was verified. The resultant plasmid was named pQuadraA. The EM7-blasticidin sequence was generated by PCR from pIB/His A (Invitrogen) using the primer pair 5′-CGTGTTGACAATTAATCATCGGCAT-3′ and 5′-CACGAAGTGCTTAGCCCTCCCACA-3′. The EM7-blasticidin fragment was blunted with T4 DNA polymerase and subcloned into SmaI-digested pQuadraA. The resultant plasmid, pQuadra1, was digested with BstXI, and the released insert fragment was purified from gel for use as a stuffer fragment. Construction of pQuadra2 (for Cloning of the Target cDNA)—In order to insert a second, slightly different BstXI-BamHI-SrfI/SmaI-BstXI polylinker into a TA-cloning site, a second pair of primers, 5′-TACCAATGTGATGGATCCGCCCGGGCCAA-3′ and 5′-TACCATAGAGTTGGCCCGGGCGGATCCAT-3′, was annealed, extended by ExTaq polymerase, and subcloned into pGEM-T Easy, generating pQuadra2. In this report, 14-3-3 I, II, and I + II cDNA fragments were obtained by PCR (plus ligation reaction in the case of I + II) using the following sets of primers: I, sense (5′-GTGGGATCCGGTAATATAACACGAGGCAA-3′ and antisense (5′-GCGGGATCCCTTGGCGTAGGCGTCGAGTGC-3′; II, sense (5′-TAGTGGATCCCAAGCGGTTAAAATGGCG-3′) and antisense (5′-CCTCGGATCCGCGGTCAGGACTCTTCAGGA-3′); I + II, sense (5′-GTGGGATCCGGTAATATAACACGAGGCAA-3′) and antisense (5′-GCTTTCGCGGTTCTCAATAGAAGTG-3′); I + II, sense (5′-CAAAAGAAAAAACAACGGTTAA-3′) and antisense (5′-GGTCGGATCCGCGCTTGAAGGCCTTAATGA-3′). Those fragments were cut with BamHI and subcloned in pQuadra2 at the BamHI site, and sequences were confirmed. The resultant pQuadra2 vectors containing 14-3-3 fragments were digested with BstXI, and the inserts were purified from the gel. The luciferase gene in pLew100 (a gift from Drs. Elizabeth Wirtz, Simone Leal, and George Cross (Rockefeller University)) (19.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) was removed by digestion with BamHI and HindIII followed by blunting and insertion of a HindIII linker (5′-CAAGCTTC-3′). To remove the internal BstXI sites, the resultant plasmid was digested with BstXI, followed by blunting, and the resultant two fragments were separated and gel-purified. The fragment containing the β-lactamase gene was treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences) and religated with the other fragment. The resultant plasmid was checked by digestion with several restriction enzymes and then digested with HindIII and blunted. A blunted BstXI-BamHI-SrfI-BstXI polylinker was generated by annealing of the primer pair 5′-TACCAGTGTGCTGGATCCGCCCGGGCCAT-3′ and 5′-TACCAGTGTGATGGCCCGGGCGGATCCAG-3′ and extension with ExTaq polymerase followed by T4 DNA polymerase treatment and ligated with the vector. The resultant plasmid was designated pQuadra3. To prepare the vector for the quadric ligation, pQuadra3 was digested completely with BstXI, followed by treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase to reduce the background, separated in a 0.6% TAE/agarose gel, and purified from the gel using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The inserts generated from pQuadra1 and pQuadra2 were ligated to the digested and purified pQuadra3 vector using the Ligation kit, version 2 (TaKaRa). The ligated fragments were used to transform DH5α competent cells (Toyobo, Japan), and plasmid DNA isolated from the transformants, designated as pQuadra I, pQuadra II, and pQuadra I + II, was analyzed by restriction digestions. The plasmids pQuadra I, II, and I + II were linearized with NotI and transfected into 29-13 T. brucei PCF cells, which express T7 RNA polymerase and Tet repressor, as described (also a gift from Drs. Elizabeth Wirtz, Simone Leal, and George Cross) (19.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Sixteen h after transfection, one-quarter of the cells were plated on 96-well plates and selected with 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. The same DNA constructs, with the addition of the SV40 enhancer sequence (20.Dean D.A. Dean B.S. Muller S. Smith L.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) at the EcoRI site, were transfected into 90-13 T. brucei BSF cells (also a gift from Drs. Elizabeth Wirtz, Simone Leal, and George Cross) (19.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Conditions for transfection of BSF cells were described previously (21.Schnaufer A. Panigrahi A.K. Panicucci B. Igo Jr., R.P. Wirtz E. Salavati R. Stuart K. Science. 2001; 291: 2159-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The PCF and BSF cells were treated as indicated and placed on 8-well glass slides, dried and fixed with methanol, and stored at -80 °C until use. These slides were then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-α-tubulin (clone, DM-1 A) (Sigma) followed by 4′,6′-diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Other slides were stained with anti-I and anti-II rat serum followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rat antibodies (Invitrogen). The stained slides were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX-60, Olympus, Tokyo) with cooled CCD (Olympus DP-70). Cells (0.5 ml) at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml with Tet induction on day 5 were placed into Acryl cuvettes (19 × 4 × 45 mm) (SARSTEDT), and the cuvettes were incubated at 27 °C for 8 h. The OD in each sample was measured at 600-nm wavelength. The motility index was calculated as follows: OD of Tet+ culture divided by OD of Tet+ culture after mixing the medium. FACS analysis of DNA contents was carried out as follows. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+, Mg2+-), fixed in 30% phosphate-buffered saline, 70% methanol at 4 °C for 1 h, pelleted, and rehydrated. Cells were then treated with 10 μg/ml RNase at room temperature for 1 h and stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide. The resultant samples were analyzed by FACsort (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest and ModFIT software (BD Biosciences). We cloned two isoforms of 14-3-3 from T. brucei 427 cDNA and genomic libraries. They were designated as 14-3-3 I and II, respectively (GenBank™ accession numbers AB059827 and AB066565). Genomic library screening with low stringency hybridization conditions and direct sequence analysis of reverse transcription-PCR products using several primers derived from 14-3-3 sequences ensured that only two isoforms existed in T. brucei (data not shown). According to sequences available in the Sanger Institute Blast Server (accession numbers TRYPtp25a10ec07.p1k_63), both genes are located on chromosome 11. The start codon was determined from homology with other 14-3-3 sequences isolated from mammals to yeasts, and no potential start codon was found upstream of our determined start codon. Amino acid sequences of I and II have 47 and 50% identity to the human τ isoform, respectively, and conserved important features of a potential amphipathic groove for the binding of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing motifs, which consists of amino acid residues as follows: Lys77, Arg84, Arg88, Lys150, Asp154, Arg157, Tyr158, Leu199, Val203, Leu244, Leu248, and Trp256 in I and Lys56, Arg63, Arg67, Lys128, Asp132, Arg135, Tyr136, Leu174, Val178, Leu221, Leu225, and Trp233 in II (Fig. 1) (1.Fu H.

Although the critical amino acid residues required for dimerization are not well conserved, T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins dimerize. 2M. Inoue, unpublished data. These data are consistent with evolutionarily conserved features of 14-3-3 proteins: 1) they mainly exist as dimeric forms, 2) they bind to phosphoserine-containing motifs in a sequence-dependent manner, and 3) they contain a nuclear exporting signal (1.Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 2.Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Thus, they may act as adaptor molecules, increasing or decreasing protein-protein interactions and regulating the subcellular localization of the target proteins and activated or inhibited enzymes, possibly through their binding to phosphoserine/threonine-containing sequence motifs in diverse partners. In order to determine the expression of 14-3-3 in PCF and BSF cells, rats were immunized with purified GST-I and GST-II proteins (Fig. 2A). Western blot using purified maltose-binding fusion proteins (MAL) of I, II, and human 14-3-3 τ showed specificity of the Abs (Fig. 2B). We then checked the specificity of these Abs by Western blot using the lysates of PCF cells, showing that both antibodies recognized a band with a relative molecular mass of 30 kDa with little background (Fig. 2C). Northern blot analysis of PCF cells detected the ∼2.2-kb transcript of I and the ∼3.8-kb transcript of II (Fig. 2D). The amount of transcript of II appears to be ∼3-fold that of I, based on the finding that intensity of the hybridized marker RNA in both blots was equal. Two cDNAs in pGEM-T Easy vector were amplified using M13 forward and reverse primers, and the resultant fragments were used as probes, and the labeling efficiencies of both probes appeared to be identical (Fig. 2D). Quantitative Western blot analysis showed that the amount of I was slightly higher than that of II in PCF cells (I, 107 ng/1 × 106 cells; II, 70 ng/1 × 106 cells), whereas the amount of I was almost equal to that of II in BSF cells (I, 92 ng/1 × 106 cells; II, 84 ng/1 × 106 cells). Theoretically, an approximately equivalent amount (1–2 × 106 molecules/cell) of each 14-3-3 isoform was expressed (Fig. 2E). Combined Northern and Western blot data indicated that the levels of 14-3-3 were post-transcriptionally regulated, as are many proteins of trypanosomes. Immunostaining of PCF cells using anti-I and II Ab clearly showed that both isoforms were localized mainly in cytoplasm (Fig. 3) in the same way as other 14-3-3 isoforms from different species.Fig. 2Characterization of 14-3-3 proteins.

Several phleomycin-resistant clones transfected with pQuadra I, II, and I + II plus pZJM (25.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) constructs were selected, and the viable cell counts were compared on day 6, with or without Tet induction. The data are summarized in Supplementary Table 1A, showing that pQuadra system is as efficient as pZJM. Some of these Tet-responsive clones were tested for the reduction of I and II protein levels on day 8 of Tet induction, showing that specific reduction of I and II protein levels was obtained in all clones (Supplementary Fig. 2). Establishment of BSF Cells—To increase the transfection efficiency, SV40 sequence (47 bp) (20.Dean D.A. Dean B.S. Muller S. Smith L.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was introduced at the EcoRI site in pQuadra (pQuadra SV40) and used for further studies. We isolated several clones and compared the cell counts on day 2, with or without Tet induction. The data are summarized in Supplementary Table 1B. We confirmed the reduction of 14-3-3 protein levels in these clones by Western blot (data not shown). Biochemical Characterization—We selected four clones and used them in further studies; B10, C6, H8, and B2 are representative of pQuadra NC- and pQuadra I-, II-, and I + II-transfected clones, respectively. dsRNAi of 14-3-3 gene expression in PCF cells decreased the growth rates very slowly as shown in Fig. 4. The reduction in growth rate after Tet induction became prominent on day 6 of Tet induction in the order of B2 (I + II knockdown), H8 (II knockdown), and C6 (I knockdown) cells, whereas there was no reduction in B10 (control) cells (Fig. 4). The levels of I mRNA in C6 (I knockdown) and B2 (I + II knockdown) cells became undetectable within 24 h of Tet induction, whereas the levels of I mRNA in B10 (control) and H8 (II knockdown) cells were stable (Fig. 5A). The levels of II mRNA in H8 (II knockdown) and B2 (I + II knockdown) cells became undetectable within 24 h of Tet induction, whereas the levels of II mRNA in B10 (control) and C6 (I knockdown) cells were stable (Fig. 5A). The overall Northern blot data indicated that specific and quick reduction of mRNA occurred in response to dsRNAi. In C6 (I knockdown) cells, the amount of I protein gradually decreased and was almost undetectable within 4 days after Tet induction, whereas the amount of II was stable (Fig. 5B). In H8 (II knockdown) cells, the amount of II protein gradually decreased and was undetectable by 3 days after induction, whereas the amount of I was stable (Fig. 5B). In B2 (I + II knockdown) cells, the amounts of I and II proteins gradually decreased and were almost undetectable within 5 and 4"

We have analyzed the products of this reaction and characterized the mechanism of complex formation. Following the incubation seven new bands not previously identified were apparent in SDS-PAGE. Three of these bands did not contain TSG-6, including heavy chain (HC)1·bikunin, HC2·bikunin, and free bikunin.

Bikunin inhibits several serine proteases, but more effective inhibitors exist, and the physiological relevance of the protease inhibitor activity remains unclear (3Potempa J. Kwon K. Chawla R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One of the characteristics of bikunin is its involvement in novel crosslinks with the HCs. The molecular structure of the cross-link has previously been determined (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

The C-terminal Asp residues of the HCs are esterified via the α-carbon to C-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine of the CS chain. HC1 and HC2 are most likely in close proximity on the 12- to 18-disaccharidelong CS chain, and HC1 is attached further away from bikunin than HC2 (8Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Cheng F. Fransson L.A.

The cross-link is referred to as a protein-glycosaminoglycan-protein (PGP) cross-link (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The bikunin proteins are present in high concentrations in the blood (9Steinbuch M. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 760-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (10Blom A. Pertoft H. Fries E. J. Biol.

TSG-6 is a secreted protein of ∼35 kDa produced during inflammation and inflammation-like processes (13Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The mRNA encoding for the protein was originally identified following tumor necrosis factor treatment of human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts (14Lee T.H. Lee G.W. Ziff E.B. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Like the members of the bikunin proteins, TSG-6 is thought to play a vital role in the ECM in general and particularly during cumulus cell·oocyte complex stabilization (13Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 16Fulop C. Szanto S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Development. 2003; 130: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The mammalian ovulation is accompanied by the permeabilization of the blood/follicle barrier, allowing ingress of blood proteins (17Powers R.W. Chen L. Russell P.T. Larsen W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E290-E298PubMed Google Scholar). During this process hyaluronan (HA), IαI, and TSG-6 interact and stabilize the expansion of the cumulus cell·oocyte complex. The importance of these interactions has been emphasized in animal models where the bikunin or the TSG-6 genes have been knocked out. Both the bikunin- and TSG-6-deficient mice were unable to assemble the ECM surrounding the oocyte causing infertility (11Zhuo L. Yoneda M. Zhao M. Yingsung W. Yoshida N. Kitagawa Y. Kawamura K.

The interactions between TSG-6 and IαI have been studied in vitro. After a brief incubation of purified human IαI and human TSG-6 an apparent covalent complex between components of IαI and TSG-6 is formed (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Ochsner S.A. Day A.J. Rugg M.S. Breyer R.M. Gomer R.H. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4376-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this complex is composed of HC2, bikunin, and TSG-6 (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition the TSG-6 and IαI complex formation has been observed in vivo underscoring the biological importance of the cross-linking (20Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 6593-6601PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we show that the interaction between IαI and TSG-6 leads to the formation of seven distinct reaction products not previously characterized. These include two high molecular weight (HMW) IαI species, HC1·TSG-6, HC2·TSG-6, HC1·bikunin, HC2·bikunin complexes, and free bikunin. The data suggest that the PGP ester bond between the α-carbonyl of the C-terminal Asp and carbon-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine in the CS chain is cleaved during a transesterification reaction. An intermediate is formed, and a partitioning occurs between HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 complex formation or transfer of HCs to the CS through competing pathways. Materials—Bovine testicular hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35), Proteus vulgaris chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27), hyaluronic acid sodium salt from human umbilical cord, 1,10-phenanthroline, and polyethylene glycol 8000 were obtained from Sigma. Immobilon-P membrane was from Millipore. Biodyne B membrane (0.45 μm) was obtained from Pall, Gelman Laboratory, and microspin filters (0.2 μm) were from Lida. ECL Western blotting detection reagents, 5-ml Blue-Sepharose High Performance columns, 5-ml HiTrap Q High Performance columns, and S-300 HR column material were from Amersham Biosciences. Zorbax SB C18, 3.5-μm reverse phase column material was from Agilent. PicoFrit columns (75-μm ID) were from New Objective. Mass Spectrometry grade Trypsin was from Promega/Ramcon. Human plasma was obtained from Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. IαI and TSG-6 were purified as previously described (1Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J.

Both TSG-6 antiserum and purified TSG-6 protein were kindly provided by Dr. Hans-Georg Wisniewski, New York University Medical Center, Department of Microbiology, New York. SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer in the presence of 10-50 mm dithiothreitol. SDS-PAGE was performed in 5-15% gradient gels or in 7.5% uniform gels (10 cm × 10 cm × 0.15 cm) using the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propandiol/HCl system described previously (22Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The gels were stained for protein in the conventional way using Coomassie Blue or by the trypsin inhibition counter-staining technique (TIC staining) that specifically visualizes trypsin inhibitory activity (1Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Uriel J. Berges J. Nature. 1968; 218: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Samples were resolved in 7.5% or 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride membrane) (24Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6 (TBS-T) containing 5% skim milk powder. The blots were incubated over night at 4 °C in TBS-T containing 1% milk and rabbit antiserum against TSG-6. The next day the blots were washed in TBS-T and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Sigma) for 1 h. Following additional TBS-T washing, TSG-6 was detected using the ECL detection system. Complex Formation between IαI and TSG-6—Complexes were produced in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, by incubating IαI and TSG-6 at molar ratios ranging from 1:0.1 to 1:8 for 60 min at 37 °C. Complex Formation between HA, IαI, and TSG-6—Approximately 35 μg of HA was mixed with 3.5 μg of IαI in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Subsequently, 0.6 μg of TSG-6 was added producing an IαI: TSG-6 molar ratio of 1:1. The sample was incubated for 2 h at 37°C and then prepared for SDS-PAGE. Before SDS-PAGE the sample was filtered using a 0.2-μm microspin filter (Lida). Hyaluronidase Digestion and NaOH Treatment of the IαI·TSG-6 Complex and the HA·IαI Complex—Hyaluronidase was dissolved in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. The IαI·TSG-6 complex was made as described above using an IαI/TSG-6 molar ratio of ∼1:8. The IαI·TSG-6 complex was digested using 0.06 unit of hyaluronidase/20 pmol of IαI. The reaction was continued for 5 h at 37 °C. NaOH dissociation of IαI, IαI·TSG-6 complexes, or HA·IαI complex were performed as described before (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In-gel Digestion—Bands of interest were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels, cut in small cubes, and washed in water. The gel pieces were then incubated in acetonitrile and rehydrated in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Finally, the gel pieces were swelled in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 25 μg/ml trypsin before ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the pieces. The samples were digested for ∼16 h at 37 °C. Following digestion, the tryptic peptides were extracted, filtered, and acidified prior to the mass spectrometry analysis. Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Micromass/Waters) connected to a LC-Packings UltiMate nano LC System (LC-Packings). A nano-spray ion source was used to hold the packed PicoFrit™ columns (New Objective) and apply capillary voltage through a Valco union. The PicoFrit™ columns (75-μm ID × 10 cm) were packed with Zorbax SB C18, 3.5-μm reverse phase column material (Agilent) using a high pressure column Loader (Proxeon). The column was developed at a flow rate of 200 nl/min and linear gradients from 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid/0.5% acetic acid in water (Buffer A) to 0.02% heptafluorobutyric acid/0.5% acetic acid in 75% acetonitrile/24.5% water (Buffer B). After data acquisition, the individual MS/MS spectra acquired for each of the precursors within a single LC run were combined, smoothed, deisotoped, and centroided using the Micromass Masslynx data processing software and output as a single Mascot-searchable peak list. The peak list files were used to query the Swiss-Prot data base using the Mascot program (25Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). Determination of Whether Both Forms of TSG-6 Are Capable of Forming a Covalent Complex with the HCs—IαI·TSG-6 complexes were produced as described above and analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE. The upper reservoir buffer composition was altered by adding only 0.05% SDS and by including 25 mg/liter Coomassie Brilliant Blue to facilitate staining of the proteins during electrophoresis (26Schagger H. Aquila H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After the SDS-PAGE the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a Biodyne B membrane (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). The section containing the bands, including HC1·bikunin, HC2·bikunin, HC1·TSG-6, and HC2·TSG-6 complexes, were excised and the membrane pieces were treated with NaOH (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were extracted in sample buffer and analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-TSG-6 polyclonal antibodies. Proteolytic Fragmentation of the HC2·TSG-6 Complex—Purified IαI and TSG-6 was incubated as described above and separated by unreduced SDS-PAGE. The HC2·TSG-6 complex was electroeluted (28Hunkapiller M.W. Lujan E. Ostrander F. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), and the recovered protein material was then digested with thermolysin. TSG-6 was more resistant to proteolysis than the HCs and conditions were established where the HCs were digested leaving TSG-6 intact. The reaction products were separated by a second SDS-PAGE analysis and electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. After Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane, the band corresponding to TSG-6 was excised and analyzed by automated Edman degradation. NH2-terminal Sequence Analysis—Automated Edman degradation was performed in an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer with on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis using an Applied Biosystems 120A HPLC system operated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Incubation of IαI and TSG-6 Produce Seven New Protein Bands in SDS-PAGE—The incubation of purified IαI and TSG-6 resulted in the appearance of seven protein bands when analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). To aid in the description we used the following nomenclature: numbers refer to new bands that are covalently associated protein products of the reaction. These include HMW IαI (bands 1 and 2), HC2·TSG-6 (band 3), and HC1·TSG-6 (band 4). Letters refer to bands that appear to be the result of dissociation of one or more IαI components, including HC2·bikunin (band A), HC1·bikunin (band B), and free bikunin (band C). Bikunin-containing Complexes and Free Bikunin (Bands A-C) Are Generated during the Incubation of IαI with TSG-6—The bikunin-containing bands formed during the incubation of IαI and TSG-6 were identified by non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by TIC staining (Figs. 1 and 2). This technique enables the unambiguous identification of bikunin in contrast to Coomassie Blue staining (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fixed concentration of IαI was incubated with increasing amounts of TSG-6. When equal amounts or a molar excess of TSG-6 was used (Fig. 2, lanes 7-9), a broad band about 30-45 kDa in size showed trypsin inhibitory activity (Fig. 2, band C). This band represents free bikunin carrying the CS chain (4Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol.

In addition to free bikunin two ∼120-kDa bikunin-containing bands (Figs. 1 and 2, bands A and B) were observed. The upper band (band A) was significantly more intense than the lower band (band B)(lanes 4-6). The identity of the bikunin-containing complexes were established by a combination of (i) the apparent molecular mass in SDS-PAGE, (ii) immunoblotting using HC1, HC2, or bikunin-specific antibodies (data not shown), and (iii) the dissociation of both complexes by CS-degrading enzymes (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). Based on these results we conclude that band A is composed of HC2·bikunin and band B of HC1·bikunin. These data show that free bikunin, HC1·bikunin, and HC2·bikunin are generated during the reaction between IαI and TSG-6. We note that a significantly smaller amount of HC1·bikunin was consistently produced as compared with HC2·bikunin.Fig. 3Two TSG-6-containing protein products are formed during incubation of IαI with TSG-6.

Upper panel, Coomassie Blue-stained gel; lower panel, the samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblot analysis using an antibody against TSG-6. The numbering of bands is given according to Fig. 1. These results show that the complexes between TSG-6 and components of IαI are not degradable with hyaluronidase (bands 3 and 4) opposed to the high molecular weight proteins (bands 1 and 2). The numbered bands were subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) High Molecular Weight Bands (Bands 1 and 2) Are Generated during Incubation of IαI and TSG-6—Following the incubation of purified IαI and TSG-6, two high molecular weight protein bands appear in both reduced and non-reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, bands 1 and 2). TIC gel analysis revealed that both protein bands contain bikunin (Figs. 1 and 2). If IαI was incubated with a molar excess of TSG-6 only very small amounts of these high molecular weight proteins were apparent (Fig. 2, lane 9, and unpublished data). We noticed that a smaller amount of the upper HMW IαI band was produced compared with the lower HMW IαI band. To determine the polypeptide composition, the two bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to LC-MS/MS. The analysis revealed the presence of bikunin, HC1, and HC2 in both bands (Table S1, Supplementary Material). No evidence for other proteins was apparent. We conclude that the high molecular weight proteins are made of the same components as IαI (bikunin, HC1, and HC2) (1Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15975-15981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slower than expected migration in SDS-PAGE is most likely caused by a change in the bikunin/HC1/HC2 stoichiometry as compared with IαI. The molecular weight of the faster migrating HMW IαI band was estimated by reduced SDS-PAGE to be 71 kDa higher than IαI (data not shown). An increase of 71 kDa is consistent with the addition of one more HC as compared with IαI. The slower migrating HMW IαI band similarly displayed an increase in size as compared with the faster migrating HMW IαI band. This suggests that HMW IαI are formed in a process where additional HCs are cross-linked to the CS-chain. We designate these reaction products HMW IαI.Fig. 5HA inhibits the formation of HMW IαI. Coomassie Bluestained reduced SDS-gel showing molecular size standards (lane 1), IαI·TSG-6 complex (lane 2), IαI·TSG-6 complex formation in the presence of HA (lane 3). After IαI·TSG-6 complex formation in the presence of HA the sample was treated with NaOH prior to electrophoresis (lane 4). The samples in lanes 2-4 were filtered before subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. The bands are labeled according to Fig. 1. It is apparent that the presence of HA prevents the formation of HMW IαI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of TSG-6-containing Protein Complexes (Bands 3 and 4) Generated during Incubation of IαI with TSG-6—The IαI·TSG-6 complexes are resistant to both hyaluronidase (Fig. 3, lane 5, bands 3 and 4) and chondroitinase ABC degradation (data not shown). These properties were exploited to separate the TSG-6-containing bands from the co-migrating bikunin-containing bands in SDS-PAGE (HC1·bikunin, band B; HC2·bikunin, band A). After the digestion, HC1·TSG-6 and HC2·TSG-6 remained at the same position in the gel, while HC1·bikunin and HC2·bikunin dissociated and migrated further into the gel (data not shown). The TSG-6-containing bands were subsequently subjected to LC-MS/MS (Fig. 3, lane 5, bands 3 and 4). The analyses revealed that band 3 contained HC2 and TSG-6, whereas band 4 contains HC1 and TSG-6 (Table S1, Supplemental Material). We noted that significantly smaller amounts of HC2·TSG-6 as compared with HC1·TSG-6 were generated consistently during complex formation. Stability of the HMW IαI Cross-links—The nature of the HMW IαI cross-links (bands 1 and 2) were investigated by analyzing their stability toward enzymatic or chemical dissociation protocols (Figs. 3 and 4). The complexes were dissociated by hyaluronidase (Fig. 3), chondroitinase ABC (data not shown), or by mild NaOH treatment (Fig. 4). This behavior is analogous to previous results obtained during the analysis of the PGP cross-link in IαI and PαI (5Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 747-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Roepstorff P. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11804-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) suggesting that PGP cross-links are responsible for the cross-linking of HMW IαI. Stability of the HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 Cross-links—The cross-link stabilizing the HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 interaction was investigated as described above for the HMW IαI proteins, including (i) stability toward hyaluronidase (Fig. 3), (ii) chondroitinase ABC (data not shown), and (iii) mild NaOH treatment (Fig. 4). Significantly, the HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 cross-links were readily disrupted following NaOH treatment but was resistant to CS-degrading enzymes (Figs. 3 and 4, bands 3 and 4). Because NaOH dissociated the complex but CS-degrading enzymes did not, we conclude that an ester bond independent of the CS chain mediates the interaction. In addition the interaction between IαI and TSG-6 produced HC1·bikunin and HC2·bikunin as described above. These are generated at the same time as the HC2·TSG-6 or HC1·TSG-6 complexes are formed (Fig. 1). Because HC1 is positioned closest to the nonreducing end of the CS (8Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Roepstorff P. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11804-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) the formation of HC1·bikunin is impossible if cross-link formation involved cleaving the CS chain. Accordingly, the formation of HC2·TSG6 or HC1·TSG-6 does not involve cleavage of the CS chain. The C-terminal Asp of HC2 Is Involved in the HC2·TSG-6 Cross-link—The IαI·TSG-6 complex was prepared as described and separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The HC·TSG-6 band was electroeluted and digested with thermolysin. TSG-6 was more resistant to proteolysis than the HCs, and conditions were established where TSG-6 remained intact following thermolysin digestion. The HCs were degraded, and the digest was separated by reduced SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. N-terminal protein sequence analysis of the TSG-6 band revealed two sequences: the sequence LAQGSQVLESTPPPHVMRVEN(D) (Asp was not detected), corresponding to the C terminus of HC2, and WGFKDGIFHNSIWLERAAGVYH, which matches the N-terminal sequence of TSG-6. All residues except Asp-702 of HC2 were detected during Edman degradation suggesting that the C-terminal Asp-702 is involved in the HC2·TSG-6 cross-link. HA Inhibits the Formation of HMW·IαI—The effect of HA on the formation of HMW·IαI was investigated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When IαI and TSG-6 were incubated in the presence of HA the formation of HMW·IαI was abolished (Fig. 5, lane 3). In addition IαI, HC1·bikunin, HC2·bikunin, HC1·TSG-6, and HC2·TSG-6 were not observed (Fig. 5, lane 3). The formation of a HA·HC complex is the most likely explanation for this observation (16Fulop C. Szanto S. Mukhopadhyay D. Bardos T. Kamath R.V. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Salustri A. Hascall V.C. Glant T.T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These complexes are large and will not migrate into the gel. However, the interaction between HA and the HCs are mediated by an ester (30Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26657-26663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which is vulnerable to mild NaOH treatment. Significantly, we observed that mild NaOH treatment of complex between IαI, TSG-6, and HA produced free HCs (Fig. 5, lane 4). The result shows that incubating IαI and TSG-6 in the presence of HA generates HA·HC complexes and inhibits the formation of HMW IαI. Both the Glycosylated and the Non-glycosylated Forms of TSG-6 Are Capable of Forming a Covalent Complex with the HCs—It has been suggested that the two TSG-6 bands (Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5) are caused by differences in glycosylations (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine if both TSG-6 glyco-forms were able to participate in complex formation IαI·TSG-6 was separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and blotted to a Biodyne B membrane. The protein bands representing the HC1·bikunin, HC2·bikunin, HC1·TSG-6, and HC2·TSG-6 complexes were excised and treated with NaOH. The proteins were extracted from the membrane, and finally the sample was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-TSG-6. The result shows that both the glycosylated and the nonglycosylated forms of TSG-6 are able to form covalent interactions with the HCs (Fig. 6). When IαI and TSG-6 interact apparent covalent interactions between TSG-6 and components of IαI are formed (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 51068-51076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the reaction and the identity of the products are not clear (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the present study we have analyzed the polypeptide compositions of the reaction products, the chemical properties of the cross-links formed, and the reaction mechanism. Characterization of the Reaction Products—Immunoblotting using TSG-6 antibody demonstrated that two TSG-6-containing complexes were formed during the incubation. In addition we show that HC1·bikunin, HC2·bikunin, free bikunin, and HMW IαI were produced (Fig. 7). In contrast to a previous study (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) we specifically dissociated the HC1·bikunin and HC2·bikunin complexes before SDS-PAGE. The IαI·TSG-6 complexes were resistant to both hyaluronidase and chondroitinase ABC, whereas HC1·bikunin and HC2·bikunin were readily dissociated. This prevented co-migration of HC(1 or 2)·bikunin and the two TSG-6 containing complexes. Subsequently, LC-MS/MS analyses of the two TSG-6-containing bands then revealed that they only were composed of HC1·TSG-6 or HC2·TSG-6 (Table S1, Supplementary Material). Bikunin is not involved in the TSG-6-containing complexes as suggested previously (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The conflicting results reported previously (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 20Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have led to the suggestion that different complexes between IαI and TSG-6 exist in vivo (20Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Day A.J. Salustri A. Fulop C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although we are not able to explain the lack of HC1 or chondroitinase ABC sensitivity observed in a previous study (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), our data support that coincubation of IαI and TSG-6 produce only HC1·TSG-6 and HC2·TSG-6 complexes. In addition to the TSG-6-containing complexes the reaction produced other covalent protein complexes that we designate HMW IαI. These bands did not contain TSG-6 and were shown to be composed of the same components as IαI (Table S1, Supplementary Material, and Fig. 7). The bands behaved like IαI in terms of trypsin inhibitory activity and dissociation by both chemical and enzymatic procedures. They are likely the result of HC transfer from one IαI molecule to another during the reaction. Both the production of HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 complexes and HMW IαI thus consume HCs and the detection of HC1·bikunin, HC2·bikunin, and free bikunin suggests that IαI served as a HC donor. In support of this we showed that more HC1·TSG-6 than HC2·TSG-6 was produced during the reaction (Fig. 3). Significantly, this was correlated with the formation of less HC1·bikunin than HC2·bikunin (Fig. 2). It is possible that the difference in the amount produced is caused by steric hindrance as HC2 is positioned closets to the reducing end of the CS (8Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Roepstorff P. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11804-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This could produce different environments for the two HCs and affect their ability to participate in the reaction. In the present study we did not attempt to remove trace amounts of divalent cations from our protein preparations or buffer. Thus, we cannot out rule that the TSG-6·IαI complex formation is a metal ion-dependent process. The HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 Cross-link—Several lines of evidence suggest that the cross-linking of IαI and TSG-6 involves a transesterification where the PGP cross-link is cleaved, including (i) the cross-linking reaction dissociates IαI producing free bikunin and HC(1 or 2)·bikunin (Fig. 2); (ii) HC·TSG-6 is not dissociated by CS-degrading enzymes suggesting that the cross-link does not contain [GlcUA-GalNAc] disaccharides (Fig. 3); (iii) the complexes are readily dissociated by mild NaOH treatment suggesting an ester bond (Fig. 4); and (iv) the HC2·TSG-6 cross-link was shown to be between the C-terminal Asp residue of HC2 and TSG-6. The most likely scenario is that during complex formation the ester bond between the α-carbon of the C-terminal Asp and the carbon-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine is cleaved (Fig. 8A). A new ester bond is formed between the C-terminal Asp residues of the HCs and a TSG-6 residue containing a functional hydroxyl group, including Tyr, Ser, Thr, or a carbohydrate moiety (Fig. 8A). It has been suggested that the two TSG-6 bands observed following reduced SDS-PAGE, are glycosylated and non-glycosylated TSG-6 (18Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The fact that both forms are involved in the covalent complex formation (Fig. 6) suggests that TSG-6 hydroxyl groups are not carbohydrate-derived. The HMW IαI Cross-link—The cross-links stabilizing HMW IαI are different from the HC·TSG-6 cross-link. The HC·TSG-6 cross-link was resistant to CS-degrading enzymes, whereas HMW IαI readily dissociated and the HMW IαI cross-links are likely analogous to the PGP cross-link of IαI (Fig. 3). Recently it has been demonstrated that TSG-6 is able to transfer HCs from IαI to unsulfated chondroitin (29Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fulop C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the bikunin CS is heterogeneously sulfated (8Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Roepstorff P. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11804-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The sulfate groups were mainly associated with disaccharides near the reducing end while the CS at the non-reducing end did not carry sulfate groups. It is possible that HMW IαI is formed by a similar process where HCs are transferred from the CS of one IαI molecule to the unsulfated CS region of another IαI molecule (Fig. 8B). Consequently, IαI molecules with more than two HCs are produced, accounting for the higher molecular weight (Fig. 7). HA is a better HC acceptor than chondroitin (29Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fulop C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the fact that HA abolished the formation of HMW IαI (Fig. 5), provides additional evidence for this hypothesis. Mechanism of Complex Formation—The cross-linking reaction did not cleave the CS chain. If cleavage of the CS chain was part of the mechanism HC1·bikunin would not have been detected according to the position of the HCs on the CS (8Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Roepstorff P. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11804-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition CS-degrading enzymes were unable to dissociate the HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 complex (Fig. 3) implying that [GlcUA-Gal-NAc] disaccharides were not involved in the cross-link. This is in contract to the HMW IαI complex, which was readily cleaved by CS-degrading enzymes. Based on these findings the mechanism is likely to involve the formation of an intermediate that partitions to generate HC(1 or 2)·TSG-6 complexes or transfer HCs to CS via competing pathways. In favor of this mechanism two different covalent products are produced (HC·TSG-6 and HMW IαI) and a progressively lower level of HMW IαI was generated when a fixed concentration of IαI was titrated with increasing amount of TSG-6 (Fig. 2). Taken together the data suggest that the cross-linking of IαI and TSG-6 involves a transesterification where the PGP cross-link is cleaved. A new ester bond is formed between the C-terminal Asp α-carbonyl of the HCs and a TSG-6-derived hydroxyl donor most likely a Tyr, Ser, or Thr residue or possibly a glycan moiety. In a competing reaction HCs are transferred to the CS chain of an IαI molecule by forming a new ester bond between C-terminal Asp α-carbonyl of HCs and a carbon-6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine of the CS producing a new PGP cross-link (Fig. 8).

The increase in IGF-I expression activates cell signaling mechanisms that participate in the differentiation process. One potential contributor is the SOCS-3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3) gene, which regulates signaling mechanisms and may be sensitive to changes in IGF-I concentrations. For the first time, the role of SOCS-3 is investigated in myoblast differentiation. SOCS-3 mRNA levels and SOCS-3 transcriptional activity increase during myoblast differentiation.

In addition, overexpression of SOCS-3 specifically increased serum response factor-driven transcriptional activity but had no effect on nuclear-factor of activated T cell-driven transcriptional activity.

Myogenesis is a highly regulated process in striated muscle that is controlled by a complex interaction of numerous intracellular signaling mechanisms (1Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. Cells Tissues Organs. 2004; 176: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Myogenesis is composed of multiple fundamentally distinct stages, with myoblast differentiation allowing for the increase in contractile gene expression and cell fusion inducing the appearance of multinucleated myotubes (2Charge S.B. Rudnicki M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Myoblasts utilize this process to ultimately form mature muscle during development or to repair damaged muscle fibers. In culture, myoblast differentiation occurs in what is defined as growth factor withdrawal; although the terminology is widely used, it suggests that little to no growth factors are exposed to the myoblasts during the differentiation process. However, differentiating myoblasts increase autocrine/paracrine production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; SRF, serum response factor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cell; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3; IGFBP, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EF, elongation factor; SRE, serum response element; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; RT, reverse transcription. proteins (3Tollefsen S.E.

Indeed, during the differentiation process myoblasts increase the expression of IGF-I mRNA by 6–10-fold and IGF-II mRNA by 25-fold (3Tollefsen S.E. Lajara R. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. Rotwein P. J.

The increased concentration of IGF-I is thought to induce specific signaling mechanisms that are necessary for the induction of the differentiation process. Although the production of IGF-I is much lower by the myoblasts than IGF-II, the role of IGF-I still appears to be critical for the differentiation process (5Florini J.R. Magri K.A. Ewton D.Z.

Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which IGF-I induce myoblast differentiation remain undefined. A recently described family of proteins, the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, acts in a negative feedback loop to regulate cytokine or growth factor signaling (6Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Chesnokova V. Melmed S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 917: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The SOCS family consists of eight family members, with each member having a SH2 domain and a conserved homologous C-terminal region designated as a SOCS box (7Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain allows for interactions with key regulatory tyrosine regions in the activation loop of other signaling proteins (7Alexander W.S. Hilton D.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 503-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). For example, SOCS-3 has been implicated as having the ability to regulate insulin signaling in cultured adipocytes (8Ueki K. Kondo T. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5434-5446Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Because insulin and IGF-I share many signaling properties, it is possible that SOCS-3 may regulate IGF-I signaling as well. Indeed, Dey et al. (9Dey B.R. Furlanetto R.W. Nissley P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) described an interaction between SOCS-3 and the IGF-I receptor in embryonic kidney 293 cells, and because the activation of the IGF-I receptor is critical for the induction of myoblast differentiation (10Galvin C.D. Hardiman O. Nolan C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 200: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it is possible that SOCS-3 is critical for myoblast differentiation. SOCS-3 is expressed in skeletal muscle (11Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C. Freidinger K. Hilton D.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47944-47949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 12Haddad F. Zaldivar F.P. Cooper D.M. Adams G.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2005; 98: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar); however a mechanistic role for the expression of SOCS-3 in skeletal muscle has yet to be defined. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether SOCS-3 expression contributed to myoblast differentiation. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) IGF-I production by the differentiating myoblast will increase SOCS-3 expression and 2) SOCS-3 expression will alter the transcriptional activity of various contractile proteins during myoblast differentiation. For the first time, a mechanistic role for SOCS-3 has been defined in skeletal muscle with respect to myoblast differentiation. All of the cell culture experiments were performed using C2C12 mouse myoblasts (an immortalized mouse myoblast cell line; ATCC, Rockville, MD) that were maintained at a subconfluent density at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic (Invitrogen). Differentiation was induced by transferring the myoblasts to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media containing 2% horse serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic. C2BP5 cells are C2 cells that are stably expressing mouse IGFBP5 cDNA, rendering the cells nonresponsive to endogenous IGF-I (13James P.L. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured according to previously described conditions (13James P.L. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that mimicked the conditions described above except for the inclusion of G418 (400 μg/ml). C2BP5 cells were induced to differentiate as described above; however, as previously described by James et al. (13James P.L. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the cells will undergo minimal differentiation without the inclusion of exogenous R3-IGF-I. R3-IGF-I is an IGF-I analog that mimics the actions of IGF-I, but lacks the IGFBP binding region, and therefore can induce the C2BP5 myoblasts to differentiate (13James P.L. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, when it was necessary to induce differentiation, 2 nm R3-IGF-I was included in the differentiation medium as previously described (13James P.L. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's directions and previously described methods (14Spangenburg E.E. Bowles D.K. Booth F.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2054-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mouse SOCS-3 promoter (15Auernhammer C.J. Bousquet C. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C1624-C1633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse myosin heavy chain IIx and IIb promoters (19Allen D.L. Sartorius C.A. Sycuro L.K. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43524-43533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were utilized as previously described. In addition, the SRF and NFAT “sensor” constructs were employed as previously described (14Spangenburg E.E. Bowles D.K. Booth F.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2054-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Vyas D.R. Spangenburg E.E. Abraha T.W. Childs T.E. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C545-C551Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both the SRF and NFAT constructs contain four multimerized consensus cis-binding elements for the either the SRF or NFAT transcription factors, respectively. The pGL3 and pGL2 plasmids were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Briefly, transfections were carried out on 80% confluent myoblasts in 24-well tissue culture plates with a total of 0.5 μg of DNA/transfection in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All of the assays were performed using equimolar ratios of DNA, with the total amount of DNA/transfection adjusted using the parent vector of SOCS-3 to ensure that each well received 0.5 μg of cDNA as previously described (14Spangenburg E.E. Bowles D.K. Booth F.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2054-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Vyas D.R. Spangenburg E.E. Abraha T.W. Childs T.E. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C545-C551Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After completion of the transfection, the culture medium was changed to differentiation medium. Each experimental condition was performed three or four times in three independent experiments. Cell lysis and luciferase measurements were performed utilizing the luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (20Vyas D.R. Spangenburg E.E. Abraha T.W. Childs T.E. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C545-C551Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). At the prescribed time point, the cells were gently washed twice with PBS, cell lysis buffer was then added, and the plates were gently rocked for 15 min at 4 °C. The homogenates were then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was retained and stored at -80 °C. All of the luciferase measurements were normalized as previously described (21Allen D.L. Leinwand L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45323-45330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the fold increase in promoter activity over the “promoterless” control plasmids transfected under the identical conditions. For all conditions at least three independent experiments were performed, each consisting of three or four separate measurements. To determine whether SOCS-3 was enhancing the differentiation process, the SOCS-3 cDNA was subcloned into a vector containing the skeletal muscle-specific MCK promoter (22Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). More specifically, the SOCS-3 gene was ligated out of the pEF plasmid using XbaI and subsequently cloned into the XbaI site of the previously described MCK-green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid (23Lim W. Neff E.S. Furlow J.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 18: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using an inverse PCR strategy, primers were generated to allow for removal of the stop codon after the GFP sequence, which allowed for the creation of a N-terminal SOCS-3 GFP fusion construct. Briefly, the primers (forward, 5′-CGA AGA TCT GTC ACC CAC AGC AAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TAG AGA TCT TTT GTA TAG TTC ATC-3′) were designed to remove the sequence containing the stop codon and ensure that the GFP and SOCS-3 sequence were in frame. In addition, the primers allowed for the introduction of a BglII site (see underlined letters). PCR amplification was performed using 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 50 ng of template cDNA, 0.5 mm dNTPs (Invitrogen), and 3 mm MgCl2. Amplifications were performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler with an initial denaturing step of 94 °C for 45 s, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 7.5 min at 72 °C. The final cycle ended with 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting band was gel-purified and sequenced. The MCK-SOCS-3-GFP or MCK-GFP plasmid was transiently transfected into C2C12 myoblasts. Using fluorescence microscopy, at no time was GFP signal visible when the C2C12 cells were maintained as myoblasts; however, when the cells were exposed to differentiation medium GFP fluorescence was detectable as early as 36 h later (data not shown). It should be noted that this increase in fluorescence coincides with the time point at which SOCS-3 expression begins to increase during differentiation. To ensure that a proper fusion protein had formed, Western blotting procedures were performed using a GFP primary rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes). C2C12 myoblasts were transfected as myoblasts with 1 μg of either MCK-SOCS-3-GFP cDNA or MCK-GFP cDNA. The cells were either maintained as myoblasts or induced differentiate for 24, 48, or 72 h. Cellular protein was subsequently isolated, and total protein was quantified as previously described (24Spangenburg E.E. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C204-C211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Western blotting procedures were subsequently performed to determined GFP expression as previously described (24Spangenburg E.E. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C204-C211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated according to previously described methodology (25Pattison J.S. Folk L.C. Madsen R.W. Childs T.E. Spangenburg E.E. Booth F.W. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Childs T.E. Spangenburg E.E. Vyas D.R. Booth F.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C391-C398Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown to 80% confluent on 35-mm plates. The cells were induced to differentiate by washing the cells twice with sterile PBS and subsequently exposed to 2% horse serum. At the prescribed time point, the cells were gently washed twice with PBS. One ml of TRIzol was added to the plate, and RNA was isolated accordingly. RNA concentrations were determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm. The quality of the RNA was examined visually by ethidium bromide staining of 18 and 28 S staining of gel electrophoresed RNA. The RNA was subsequently stored at -80 °C for later use. Reverse Transcription—One microgram of total RNA was reversed transcribed. Briefly, the RNA was incubated with Super Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), mixed oligo(dT), and random decamers (Ambion, Austin, TX) in a 25-μl reaction at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction was inactivated by incubation at 70 °C for 15 min. The samples were subsequently stored at 4 °C for later use. PCR—All methods have been previously described. Briefly, a semiquantitative form of PCR was employed using 18 S as a standard (Ambion) for each reaction. The following primer sequences were utilized (5′ → 3′): SOCS-3 sense (GGA CCA GCG CCA CTT CTT CAC), SOCS-3 antisense (TAC TGG TCC AGG AAC TCC CGA), IGF-I sense (ACA TCT CCC ATC TCT CTG GAT TTC CTT TTG C), IGF-I antisense (CCC TCT ACT TGC GTT CTT CAA ATG TAC TTC C), myogenin sense (ACT CCC TTA CGT CCA TCG TG), myogenin antisense (CAG GAC AGC CCC ACT TAA AA), skeletal α-actin sense (GCG CAA GTA CTC AGT GTG GA), and skeletal α-actin antisense (CAC GAT TGT CGA TTG TGG TC) as previously described (27Huang K.C. Chen C.W. Chen J.C. Lin W.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Szepeshazi K. Schally A.V. Armatis P. Groot K. Hebert F. Feil A. Varga J.L. Halmos G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4371-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of the primers were purchased from Invitrogen. The SOCS-3 primers produced a product size of 220 bp and were designed based on GenBank™ accession number U88328. The IGF-I primers produced a product size of 514 bp and were designed based on GenBank™ accession number M14156. The myogenin primers produced a product size of 175 bp and were designed based on GenBank™ accession number NM_031189. The skeletal α-actin primers produced a product size of 184 bp and were designed based on GenBank™ accession number M12233. Two microliters of each reverse transcription reaction were mixed with 12.5 μl of AccuPrime Super Mix II (Invitrogen), 0.5 μm 18 S primer/competimer mix, and 0.2 μm target primer mix in final 25-μl volume. However, for some reactions 18 S amplifications were done as separate but parallel reactions using the identical cycling conditions. SOCS-3 amplifications were performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler with an initial denaturing step of 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C as previously described (27Huang K.C. Chen C.W. Chen J.C. Lin W.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The final cycle ended with 10 min at 72 °C. For IGF-I amplification, an initial denaturing step was performed at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C as previously described (28Szepeshazi K. Schally A.V. Armatis P. Groot K. Hebert F. Feil A. Varga J.L. Halmos G. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4371-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The final cycle ended with 7 min at 72 °C. For myogenin or skeletal α-actin amplifications, an initial denaturing step was performed at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The final cycle ended with 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were then separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The gels were scanned, and signal quantification was performed with ImageQuant software. The signal determined for each target was subsequently normalized to the signal for the 18 S target. To determine STAT3 content and phosphorylation status, cells were plated to obtain ∼75–80% confluency. To obtain protein from cells in the myoblast state, the medium was aspirated 24 h after the initialing plating, and the cells were then washed twice with sterile PBS and lysed as described below. To obtain cellular protein from differentiating myoblasts (48 h) or myotubes (96 h), the medium was replaced with 2% horse serum and allowed to incubate until designated time points when the plates were removed, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with ice-cold sterile PBS two times. The cells were lysed and scraped in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40,10% glycerol, 200 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm NaVO4). The cell extracts were then rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The extract was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant protein was then quantified using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of total protein were then resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. All of the blots were then incubated with Ponceau S (Sigma) to ensure equal loading in all lanes (data not shown). The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) and probed with either an antibody specific for phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705; Cell Signaling, Beverley, MA (1:1000)) or total STAT3 (Cell Signaling (1:1000)). The membranes were washed in TBS-T and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody (1:2,000; Cell Signaling). Finally, the horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). The membrane was exposed to autoradiographic film (Kodak-XAR5) with the exposure time adjusted to keep the integrated optical densities within a linear and nonsaturated range. To determine the total protein expression, blots for each specific protein that was previously probed for the phosphorylation status were stripped in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 55 °C. The membrane was then reprobed with an antibody specific to the total specific protein as described above. All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons followed by a Tukey's post hoc test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. SOCS-3 mRNA expression significantly increased after 72 h of differentiation compared with myoblasts that were maintained in a proliferative state (Fig. 1, A and B). Proper activation of the differentiation process was confirmed by increases in myogenin mRNA (Fig. 1A). This increase in SOCS-3 mRNA expression was coupled with a significant increase in 2.0-kb SOCS-3 promoter activity after 48 and 72 h of differentiation when compared with nondifferentiated myoblasts (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, SOCS-3 promoter activity decreased after the first 24 h of differentiation when compared with the proliferating myoblast condition. The signal for the up-regulation of SOCS-3 expression during myoblast differentiation remains unclear. Both growth hormone and insulin can induce SOCS-3 mRNA expression in muscle (29Adams T.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15985-15991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), although neither growth hormone or insulin are necessary for myoblast differentiation. However, IGF-I is necessary for differentiation (10Galvin C.D. Hardiman O. Nolan C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 200: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and myoblast production of IGF-I increases during the differentiation process (3Tollefsen S.E. Lajara R. McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13810-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore IGF-I could induce SOCS-3 expression. IGF-I mRNA expression increases in C2C12 myoblasts after 48 h of differentiation (Fig. 2A). To determine whether IGF-I affects SOCS-3 expression, the 2.0-kb SOCS-3 promoter was transiently transfected into the C2C12 myoblasts, and the myoblasts were induced to differentiate with and without recombinant IGF-I (Fig. 2B). The 2.0-kb SOCS-3 promoter was significantly increased after exposure to 15 and 30 ng/ml of recombinant IGF-I when compared with the myoblasts not treated with exogenous IGF-I, respectively. To determine whether IGF-I was necessary for induction of transcriptional activity of the SOCS-3 promoter, C2C12 myoblasts were induced to differentiate in the presence of a specific IGF-I receptor antibody (αIR3, 3 μg/ml), which prevents the activation of the IGF-I receptor during myoblast differentiation (10Galvin C.D. Hardiman O. Nolan C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 200: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Inclusion of the antibody significantly reduced SOCS-3 promoter activity after 72 h of differentiation; however receptor inhibition did not completely reduce activity to base-line levels (dashed line) (Fig. 2C). Similarly, SOCS-3 transcriptional activity was also reduced in C2BP5 cells, a cell line that is stably transfected with IGFBP5 cDNA and cannot respond to endogenously produced IGF-I (Fig. 3). More specifically, after the transfected C2BP5 myoblasts were exposed to differentiation medium for 72 h without R3-IGF-I (analog form of IGF-I, which is not buffered by the IGFBPs), there was still a moderate increase in SOCS-3 promoter activity compared with the myoblast condition. However, when R3-IGF-I was added to the medium for 72 h there was a significant increase in SOCS-3 promoter activity when compared with either the myoblast or the 72-h non-IGF-I-treated condition. Currently, it is unclear why inhibition of the IGF-I receptor or use of C2BP5 cell line did not completely abolish SOCS-3 transcription; however, it is possible that another unidentified factor is stimulating SOCS-3 transcription in parallel to IGF-I. These findings suggest that autocrine/paracrine production of IGF-I, at least in part, contributes to the increase in SOCS-3 expression during differentiation.Fig. 3The up-regulation of SOCS-3 expression during myoblast differentiation is enhanced by IGF-I. To examine the role of IGF-I in myoblast differentiation in greater detail, C2BP5 cells were utilized. C2BP5 myoblasts overexpress IGFBP5 by stable transfection of IGFBP5 cDNA and therefore are unresponsive to endogenously produced IGF-I. C2BP5 myoblasts were transiently transfected with the 2.0-kb SOCS-3 promoter construct and subsequently induced to differentiate with and without R3-IGF-I (2 nm) for various lengths of time. R3-IGF-I is an IGF-I analog that acts in a similar manner to IGF-I but is not buffered by the IGFBPs (13James P.L. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cellular protein was isolated at the defined time point, and the luciferase activity was measured. The data are expressed as the fold increases in promoter activity over the promoterless control plasmid (pGL3). These results are from three independent experiments. * indicates a value statistically different from the myoblast and 24-h groups (p < 0.05). # indicates statistically different from the 72-h non-IGF-I-treated group (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SOCS-3 gene expression is mediated at least in part by activation of the transcription factor STAT3 (15Auernhammer C.J.

To confirm this finding in the muscle culture system, C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with a dominant negative STAT3 expression vector and the 2.0-kb SOCS-3 reporter construct. The cells were induced to differentiate with and without IGF-I. After 48 h, IGF-I (15 ng/ml) significantly enhanced SOCS-3 promoter activation, whereas the dominant negative STAT3 blocked the IGF-I-induced transcriptional act"
https://openalex.org/W2007767755,"Plk1 is a multifunctional protein kinase involved in regulation of mitotic entry, chromosome segregation, centrosome maturation, and mitotic exit. Plk1 is a target of DNA damage checkpoints and aids resumption of the cell cycle during recovery from G2 arrest. The polo-box domain (PBD) of Plk1 interacts with phosphoproteins and localizes Plk1 to some mitotic structures. In a search for proteins that interact with the PBD of Plk1, we identified two of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins, Mcm2 and Mcm7. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis showed an interaction between full-length Plk1 and all other members of the MCM2-7 protein complex. Endogenous Plk1 co-immunoprecipitates with basal forms of Mcm7 as well as with slower migrating forms of Mcm7, induced in response to DNA damage. The strongest interaction between endogenous Plk1 and Mcm7 was detected in a soluble chromatin fraction. These findings suggest a new function for Plk1 in coordination of DNA replication and mitotic events."
https://openalex.org/W2000949690,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate the ability of a diverse array of extracellular stimuli to control intracellular signaling. Many GPCRs are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), a process that mediates agonist-specific desensitization in many cells. Although GRK binding to activated GPCRs results in kinase activation and receptor phosphorylation, relatively little is known about the mechanism of GRK/GPCR interaction or how this interaction results in kinase activation. Here, we used the α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) as a model to study GRK/receptor interaction because GRK2 phosphorylation of four adjacent serines within the large third intracellular loop of this receptor is known to mediate desensitization. Various domains of the α2AAR were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and tested for the ability to bind purified GRK2. The second and third intracellular loops of the α2AAR directly interacted with GRK2, whereas the first intracellular loop and C-terminal domain did not. Truncation mutagenesis identified three discrete regions within the third loop that contributed to GRK2 binding, the membrane proximal N- and C-terminal regions as well as a central region adjacent to the phosphorylation sites. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a critical role for specific basic residues within these regions in mediating GRK2 interaction with the α2AAR. Mutation of these residues within the holo-α2AAR diminished GRK2-promoted phosphorylation of the receptor as well as the ability of the kinase to be activated by receptor binding. These studies provide new insight into the mechanism of interaction and activation of GRK2 by GPCRs and suggest that GRK2 binding is critical not only for receptor phosphorylation but also for full activity of the kinase.

Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). GPCRs are bound to heterotrimeric G proteins, which contain GDP in the nucleotide-binding pocket of the α-subunit. Upon agonist stimulation, a conformational change in the receptor promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP and leads to subsequent dissociation of the α-GTP and βγ subunits from the receptor. These subunits then transduce and amplify the signal to specific downstream effector molecules that are important for cell growth and metabolism (3Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Regulation of GPCR function is achieved through three principal mechanisms: desensitization, defined as the waning of receptor responsiveness to agonist; endocytosis, a process by which receptors are removed from the cell surface; and down-regulation, in which total receptor levels are decreased through degradation (4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 89: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GPCR regulation is mediated largely by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), a family of enzymes that specifically phosphorylate activated GPCRs on serine/threonine residues (4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 6Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation promotes high affinity binding of arrestins, which function to uncouple receptor/G protein interaction and promote receptor endocytosis. However, GRKs have also been implicated in phosphorylation-independent desensitization (8Pao C.S. Benovic J.L. Science's STKE. 2002; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2002/153/pe42)PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), whereas additional receptors appear to bind arrestins in a phosphorylation-independent manner (11Jala V.R. Shao W.H. Haribabu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4880-4887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Min L. Galet C. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 702-710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, many GPCRs are also regulated by second messenger-dependent kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C (6Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). The seven members of the GRK family can be classified into three subgroups: (i) GRK1 (rhodopsin kinase) and GRK7; (ii) GRK2 (βARK1) and GRK3 (βARK2); and (iii) GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6. GRK2 is the most extensively studied member. GRK2 is ubiquitously expressed and phosphorylates a wide variety of GPCRs including α2-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, opioid, muscarinic, adenosine, and substance P (4Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 7Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 13Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Although the actual mechanism by which GRK2 specifically phosphorylates an activated receptor is not known, it has been proposed that GRKs interact with receptor domains that become accessible during receptor activation. For example, previous studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from the first and third intracellular loops of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) inhibit GRK2 phosphorylation of receptor substrates, suggesting that there are multiple sites of interaction on the receptor for GRK2 (14Benovic J.L. Onorato J. Lohse M.J. Dohlman H.G. Staniszewski C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1990; 30: 3S-12SCrossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, GRKs also appear to be activated upon binding to an agonist-occupied receptor. GRK1 is activated by binding to rhodopsin, and this activation is attenuated when the third intracellular loop of the receptor is proteolyzed (15Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous studies have demonstrated that GRK2 is activated by binding to rhodopsin or the β2AR (16Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several intracellular loop peptides from the M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor as well as mastoparan, a peptide that mimics activated receptors, have also been shown to activate GRK1 and GRK2 (17Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12594-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies reveal that GRK2 interacts with multiple domains on the intracellular surface of the receptor and suggest that agonist binding promotes a conformational change that enables the receptor to directly interact with and activate GRK2. However, the specific interaction between GRK2 and receptor remains poorly characterized both in terms of binding determinants and mechanism of action. Three α2-adrenergic receptor (α2AR) subtypes have been cloned: α2AAR, α2BAR, and α2CAR (18Lomasney J.W. Lorenz W. Allen L.F. King K. Regan J.W. Yang-Feng T.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

Activation of these receptors by epinephrine and norepinephrine in the central nervous system results in the suppression of pain perception, sedation, and lowering of blood pressure (21Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Nichols A.J. Stadel J.M. Hieble J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 33: 243-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system and modulate a variety of pathways through coupling with Gi resulting in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, suppression of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and activation of receptor operated K+ channels (20Regan J.W. Kobilka T.S. Yang-Feng T.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6301-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 22Limbird L.E. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2686-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). α2ARs also activate Ras (23Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (24Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M.

Pharmacol. 1996; 302: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). α2AAR and α2BAR are phosphorylated by GRK2 in an agonist-dependent manner, and in particular the phosphorylation of the α2AAR occurs at four adjacent serines in the third intracellular loop (26Liggett S.B.

Interestingly, previous studies have revealed that the α2AAR third intracellular loop interacts with a number of proteins including arrestins (28Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29DeGraff J.L. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13462-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, spinophilin has been suggested to antagonize GRK2-promoted phosphorylation of the α2AAR (33Wang Q. Zhao J. Brady A.E. Feng J. Allen P.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Greengard P. Limbird L.E. Science. 2004; 304: 1940-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Much work has focused on the interactions between GPCRs and G proteins; however, far less is known in regard to the interaction of GPCRs and GRKs. How do GRKs recognize activated receptors and what is the molecular mechanism involved in GRK activation? To begin to address these questions, we used the α2AAR as a model to identify regions that interact with GRK2. We generated glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of various regions of the α2AAR and used them in direct binding assays with purified GRK2. Through these studies we have defined four specific regions that bind to GRK2. Truncation and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the importance of several basic residues in α2AAR/GRK2 interaction. Furthermore, disruption of GRK2 binding led to decreased activation of the kinase and attenuated phosphorylation of the receptor. These studies provide important insight into the mechanism of interaction and activation of GRK2 by the α2AAR and suggest that GRK2 binding is not only critical for receptor phosphorylation but also for full activity of the kinase. Plasmid Construction—Full-length FLAG-tagged α2AAR was cloned into pcDNA3 as described previously (34DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The first (residues 61–71), second (residues 130–149), and third (residues 218–375) intracellular loops and the C terminus (residues 431–451) of the α2AAR were amplified by PCR using the full-length human α2AAR cDNA as a template. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SalI, purified, and inserted in-frame into EcoRI/SalI-digested pGEX5X-1. The DNA sequence was verified by dideoxy chain sequence analysis. Truncation mutants of the third intracellular loop were prepared as described above and cloned into pGEX5X-1: residues 218–292, 218–245, 218–232, 224–291, 292–324, 300–324, 324–349, 349–375, 358–375, and 361–375. Point mutations of α2AAR were generated through oligonucleotide-directed PCR mutagenesis in constructs 218–245 (R218A, R225A, P242A, P243A), 300–324 (K320A, R322A) and 358–375 (K358A, R361A, K370A, R368A, K371A). The mutant R225A/K320A/K358A was generated in the complete third loop by nested PCR. The N terminus of the third loop was made using a forward mutagenic primer containing the R225A mutation and reverse mutagenic primer with the K320A mutation using the full-length α2AAR as the template. The C terminus of the third loop was generated with a forward mutagenic primer with K320A and reverse mutagenic primer with K358A using the full-length α2AAR as the template. The PCR products of the N and C-terminal reactions (100 ng each) were then utilized as template using the forward R225A primer and K358A reverse mutagenic primers for amplification. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and subsequently cloned into pGEX5X-1. The QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations to generate the mutant R225A/K320A/K358A in the holo-α2AAR. Briefly, PCR amplification was performed using pcDNA3-α2AAR as the template, the three mutagenic primers (12.5 pmol each) R225A (5′-tac cag atc gcc aag gcg cgc acc cgc gtg -3′), K320A (5′-cgc ggt ccc cgg ggc aaa ggc gcg gcc cga gcg agc-3′), and K358A (5′-gag cgc gtc ggg gct gcc gcg gcg tcg cgc tgg cgc-3′), and the following cycling parameters: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C 1 min, 55 °C 1 min, and 65 °C 11 min. PCR product was digested with DpnI for 1–2 h at 37 °C and transformed into XL-10 Gold-competent cells. DNA sequencing was used to confirm the mutant. GRK2 Expression and Purification—GRK2 was overexpressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells as detailed previously (35Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation 48 h after infection. The pellet was homogenized in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.02% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at high speed. The supernatant was diluted and applied onto an SP-Sepharose column, washed, and eluted with a 50–300 mm NaCl gradient. Peak fractions were pooled, loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column, and eluted with a 100–600 mm NaCl gradient. Peak fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. GST-α2AAR Fusion Protein Binding with Purified GRK2—GST fusion constructs were expressed and purified as described previously (29DeGraff J.L. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43247-43252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 5–10 μg of GST or GST-α2AAR fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 25–500 nm purified GRK2 in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were centrifuged (1000 × g) for 1 min and washed three times with binding buffer. Bound GRK2 was eluted with SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblotting using a GRK2/3 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) at 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were scanned and quantitated by densitometry. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. COS-1 cells grown to 50–75% confluence in 15-cm dishes were transfected with either wild-type or mutant (R225A/K320A/K358A) FLAG-tagged pcDNA3-α2AAR using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 72 μl of FuGENE 6 was incubated with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 min at room temperature; 12 μg of pcDNA3-α2AAR DNA was then added and incubated for 20 min, and this mixture was added to the COS-1 cells and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Preparation of Urea-treated Membranes—COS-1 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by washing twice with PBS and then were scraped into 6 ml of ice cold buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) per 15-cm dish. The cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was homogenized using a polytron and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g. The final pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing 5 m urea and sonicated on ice until the pellet was resuspended (∼3 × 15 s). The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was washed six times with buffer A to remove urea. The final pellet was resuspended in buffer A by Dounce homogenization, assayed for protein and ligand binding, and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Crude membranes were prepared using this membrane-stripping procedure to enable us to evaluate agonist-dependent phosphorylation of α2AAR by GRK2. Pretreatment of membranes with urea effectively strips away peripheral membrane proteins and enriches the α2AAR in membranes. Radioligand Binding Assays—α2AAR expression in urea-treated COS-1 membranes was determined by radioligand binding using the α2AR selective antagonist [3H]yohimbine. Briefly, 5–10 μg of membrane protein was incubated with 20 nm [3H]yohimbine in the absence or presence of 100 μm yohimbine in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA for 1 h at room temperature. Receptor-bound ligand was separated from free radioligand by vacuum filtration over GF/C filters and washing with ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA buffer. Filters were mixed with scintillation fluid and counted. Phosphorylation of α2AAR—Urea-treated membranes containing 20 nm α2AAR (∼100 pmol of α2AAR/mg of protein) was incubated with 5–10 nm GRK2 at 30 °C for 15–30 min in the presence or absence of epinephrine (100 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1–2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of SDS sample buffer and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the gel was dried, and 32P-labeled receptors were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by excising the bands and scintillation counting. To assess phosphorylation of various GST-α2AAR fusion proteins, the proteins were purified on glutathione beads, eluted with 20 mm glutathione, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl. The purified fusions (2 μm final concentration) were incubated for 30 min with 10 nm GRK2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1–2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. 32P-Labeled fusion proteins were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by excising the bands and scintillation counting. Activation of GRK2 by α2AAR—The peptide RRRASAAASAA was synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry with an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer. The peptide was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Dynamax C-18 reverse phase column using 0–20% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A stock solution of the purified synthetic peptide was prepared, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 by the addition of Tris base. Activation assays (20 μl) were carried out by incubating 1 mm synthetic peptide with 50 nm GRK2 and either purified GST-α2AAR fusion protein (2 μm) or urea-treated membranes (10–25 nm α2AAR) for 0–60 min at 30 °C. The incubations were performed in the presence or absence of 100 μm epinephrine in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1–2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 15% trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants (10 μl) were spotted onto P81 paper and washed six times with 75 mm phosphoric acid. GRK2 activity was defined as phosphate incorporation in the peptide. GRK2 Primarily Binds to the Third Intracellular Loop of the α2AAR—The α2AAR contains relatively small first (11 amino acids) and second (20 amino acids) intracellular loops, a large third intracellular loop (158 amino acids), and a short C terminus (21 amino acids) (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of four adjacent serine residues (residues 296–299) within the third loop of the α2AAR by GRK2 is known to mediate rapid homologous desensitization (27Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the acidotropic environment of these serines appears important for GRK2-promoted phosphorylation (36Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the mechanism by which GRK2 targets the activated α2AAR for phosphorylation. In an effort to identify the regions in the α2AAR that mediate GRK2 interaction, the first (I1, residues 61–71), second (I2, residues 130–149), and third (I3, residues 218–375) intracellular loops and the C terminus (CT, residues 431–451) of the α2AAR were expressed as GST fusion proteins, purified on glutathione-agarose, and assessed for their ability to bind purified GRK2 (Fig. 1B). GRK2 binds to the GST-I2 and GST-I3 loops, but not to the I1 loop or CT fusion proteins. To further characterize GRK2 binding to the I2 and I3 loops, we used various concentrations of purified GRK2 in a binding assay (Fig. 1C). At all concentrations, GRK2 interacted more effectively with the I3 loop than with the I2 loop. Analysis of these data revealed a Kd of 0.08 ± 0.02 μm for GRK2 binding to the I3 loop, whereas binding to the I2 loop did not approach saturation and thus could not be adequately fit. The Kd for binding of GRK2 to the I3 loop of the α2AAR is comparable with the Km for GRK2 phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (14Benovic J.L. Onorato J. Lohse M.J. Dohlman H.G. Staniszewski C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1990; 30: 3S-12SCrossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since these results suggest that the α2AAR I3 loop provides the primary binding domain for GRK2, additional studies focused on this region of the receptor. Identification of GRK2 Binding Domains within the I3 Loop of the α2AAR—To further define the specific GRK2 binding domains within the α2AAR I3 loop, several GST-I3 loop truncation mutants were expressed, purified, and tested for GRK2 binding. This analysis identified three discrete regions within the I3 loop that bind GRK2 (Fig. 2B). The first region was located within the N terminus of the I3 loop (residues 218–245) and was shown to lose binding when truncated further (residues 218–232) (Fig. 2A). This implicates a role for residues 233–245 in GRK2 interaction. However, since a construct containing this latter region (residues 224–291) did not bind GRK2 there may be two subregions within the 218–245 construct that mediate GRK2 interaction. The second GRK2 binding region was positioned in the central part of the I3 loop (residues 300–324) and was adjacent to the known phosphorylation sites on the α2AAR (serines 296–299). The third binding domain was located in the C-terminal portion of the I3 loop (residues 358–375). Interestingly, truncation of three additional residues from this construct (to residues 361–375) completely abolished GRK2 binding. The membrane-proximal regions of the I3 loop seem to play a prominent role in agonist-dependent protein interactions and also to mediate interaction with arrestin (29DeGraff J.L. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43247-43252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and G protein (30Wade S.M. Dalman H.M. Yang S.Z. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1191-1197PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies reveal that there are at least three distinct regions within the I3 loop of the α2AAR that are involved in binding GRK2. To identify specific residues within these three regions that are critical for GRK2 binding, we engineered a series of alanine point mutations within each of the three binding regions (Fig. 3 and Table I). Several mutations within the GST-α2AAR-(218–245) fusion protein significantly reduced GRK2 binding including R218A, R225A, and R226A, whereas mutation of Lys-224, Pro-242, and Pro-243 had minimal effect (Table I). The R225A mutant was particularly effective in attenuating GRK2 binding (Fig. 3B). Mutation of the acidic residues (Asp-292, Glu-294, Glu-295) important for GRK2 phosphorylation of the α2AAR had no effect on binding to GST-α2AAR-(292–324). Mutation of Lys-318 was also without effect, whereas mutation of Lys-320 or Arg-322 completely disrupted binding (Table I). In the C-terminal binding region, mutation of Lys-358 almost completely attenuated binding, whereas mutation of additional basic residues (Arg-361, Arg-368, Lys-370, Arg-371) had minimal effect on GRK2 binding (Table I). It is also worth noting that the putative BXBB G protein binding and activation motif in the α2AAR (Arg-368, Lys-370, Arg-371) does not appear to play a role in GRK2 binding. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that selective point mutations within the three binding regions effectively disrupt GRK2 interaction.Table ICharacterization of GRK2 binding to 13 loop constructsGST-I3 loop construct% Binding218-245100R218A 218-24517 ± 5K224A 218-245105 ± 3R225A 218-2450 ± 2R226A 218-24515 ± 4P242A 218-24566 ± 4P243A 218-24585 ± 7300-324100D292A/E294A/E295A 292-32494 ± 7K318A 300-324117 ± 6K320A 300-3240 ± 3R322A 300-3248 ± 2358-375100K358A 357-3756 ± 3R361A 357-37586 ± 5R368A 357-37579 ± 7K370A 357-375106 ± 5R371A 357-375110 ± 6 Open table in a new tab GRK2 Phosphorylation of Wild-type and Mutant α2AAR I3 Loops—To evaluate whether the residues found to disrupt GRK2 interaction with the various I3 loop constructs also disrupted phosphorylation of the I3 loop, we generated a GST-mutant I3 loop (R225A, K320A, K358A) through nested PCR and used this construct in a phosphorylation assay with purified GRK2. The mutant I3 loop was severely impaired in its ability to be phosphorylated by GRK2 compared with the wild-type I3 loop (Fig. 4), demonstrating a correlation between binding and phosphorylation. The three point mutations (R225A, K320A, K358A) were next introduced into the holo-α2AAR, and the receptor was then tested as a substrate for GRK2. COS-1 cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant α2AAR, and membranes were prepared and treated with 5 m urea, a procedure previously used to study GRK phosphorylation of muscarinic receptors (37Debburman S.K. Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 224-233PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant α2AAR (118 pmol of receptor/mg of protein) expression was comparable with that of wild-type α2AAR (123 pmol of receptor/mg of protein), whereas control membrane preparations did not express any α2AAR. The wild-type α2AAR was phosphorylated by GRK2 in an agonist-dependent manner, whereas the phosphorylation of the mutant α2AAR was significantly attenuated (Fig. 5A). In addition, a time course experiment further demonstrated that the wild-type α2AAR was more effectively phosphorylated than the mutant receptor (Fig. 5B). At 60 min, the stoichiometries of phosphorylation were 3.1 ± 0.3 mol/mol for wild-type α2AAR and 1.3 ± 0.2 mol/mol for the mutant α2AAR. Thus, the I3 loop mutations that attenuate GRK2 binding are also effective in disrupting the phosphorylation of the receptor by GRK2.Fig. 5Agonist-dependent phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant α2AAR. A, urea-treated membranes containing wild-type or mutant (R225A/K320A/K358A) α2AAR were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation reactions were performed with or without 100 μm epinephrine (Epi) in a total volume of 20 μl and contained urea-treated membranes (0.4 pmol of α2AAR), 5 nm purified GRK2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and ∼1–2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. Control membranes (Ctrl) did not contain any α2AAR. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. B, time course using urea-treated membranes containing wild-type (WT) and mutant α2AAR.

In addition, GRK2 can be stimulated by binding to the agonist-occupied form of the β2AR (16Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of this activation is not known. To test whether the α2AAR can also activate GRK2, we assayed the ability of GRK2 to phosphorylate the relatively poor peptide substrate RRRASAAASAA (16Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of various α2AAR preparations. GRK2 phosphorylation of the peptide in the presence of control membranes that did not express α2AAR was low (Fig. 6A). The urea-treated membrane preparation containing the α2AAR increased peptide phosphorylation ∼3-fold above the control, suggesting that the receptor is able to bind and induce some activation of GRK2. The addition of agonist to the α2AAR promoted a further 3–4-fold increase in peptide phosphorylation above the phosphorylation of the receptor sample without epinephrine, demonstrating that the agonist-occupied α2AAR is able to effectively activate GRK2 (Fig. 6A). We next compared the ability of the wild-type and mutant α2AARs to activate GRK2. Similar to Fig. 6A, the wild-type α2AAR exhibited an ability to partially activate GRK2 in the absence of agonist, whereas the agonist-occupied receptor effectively activated GRK2 (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the ability of the mutant α2AAR to activate GRK2 was ∼4-fold lower than the wild-type α2AAR (Fig. 6B). In an effort to further correlate GRK2 binding with activation, we also tested whether any of our GST-α2AAR third loop constructs activated GRK2. The GST-I3 loop, the three smaller regions within the I3 loop that bind to GRK2, and the various mutants were used in a GRK2 activation assay (Fig. 6C). Given that only small regions of the holoreceptor were used in the activation assay, we did not expect full activation of the kinase. Nevertheless, the I3 loop, as well as the three smaller regions within the I3 loop, was able to enhance peptide phosphorylation ∼2 fold. In contrast, the various mutant constructs did not activate GRK2. Although we still do not fully understand the mechanism involved in GRK2 activation, these studies are the first to demonstrate that small receptor domains are able to activate GRK2 and that activation is directly correlated with binding. Conclusions—We have characterized four regions within the α2AAR that interact with GRK2, the I2 loop as well as three specific sites within the I3 loop. One site is located adjacent to the four serines that are phosphorylated by GRK2 (phosphorylation site), and the other sites are located at the membrane proximal regions of the I3 loop. Even though acidic residues adjacent to the serines are important for phosphorylation, these residues did not play a significant role in GRK2 binding. In addition, we identified several basic residues within these three binding domains that are critical for GRK2 interaction with the α2AAR, including Arg-225, Lys-320, and Lys-358. Mutation of these three residues effectively attenuated the ability of the α2AAR to both activate and serve as a substrate for GRK2. However, there are likely additional regions of the α2AAR involved in GRK2 binding, including the I2 loop (Fig. 1). Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of the inactive holo-GRK2 bound to Gβγ has been solved (44Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Based on the docking analysis of GRK2 with rhodopsin, the catalytic domain of GRK2 is predicted to have many contacts with the receptor with one important site being the structurally disordered nucleotide gate. Because we determined that several basic residues in the α2AAR are important for GRK2 binding, we hypothesize that acidic residues on the kinase might contribute to receptor binding. Interestingly, the 20-amino acid nucleotide gate in GRK2 is particularly rich in acidic residues, including Glu-476, Asp-481, Asp-484, Asp-489, Glu-490, Glu-491, and Glu-492, and thus might provide potential ionic interactions with basic residues in the α2AAR. It is intriguing that the nucleotide gates within several other members of the GRK family contain an adjacent serine and threonine in place of the Asp-489, Glu-490, Glu-491, and Glu-492 found in GRK2 and GRK3. In GRK5, autophosphorylation of these residues (Ser-484 and Thr-485) enhances receptor phosphorylation 15–20-fold (45Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also worth noting that receptor phosphorylation by GRK2 is very sensitive to inhibition by salt (46Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further suggesting the importance of ionic interactions in GRK2/substrate binding. An additional region that has been implicated in GRK2 interaction with GPCRs is a proline-rich motif that is just N-terminal to the nucleotide gate (47Gan X. Ma Z. Deng N. Wang J. Ding J. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49741-49746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this proline-rich motif in GRK2 disrupted its ability to bind to light activated rhodopsin, suggesting that this region contributes to recognition of activated receptor. Further studies with GRK2 mutants should provide additional insight on the mechanism of GRK/receptor interaction. In summary, we have shown that multiple regions of the α2AAR play a key role in substrate recognition. Mutations of Arg-225, Lys-320, and Lys-358 in the I3 loop disrupted GRK2 binding and resulted in decreased activation of GRK2 and decreased receptor phosphorylation. These results suggest that ionic interactions will likely play an important role in mediating GRK/GPCR interaction. Our findings also demonstrate that small receptor domains are able to activate GRK2 and that activation is directly correlated with binding. The membrane-proximal regions on GPCRs have been implicated in binding a number of proteins including G proteins, arrestins, and now GRKs. These regions are likely exposed upon agonist binding and are then able to interact with target proteins. This will likely serve as a general mechanism for mediating the agonist-dependent targeting of GPCRs by GRKs. We thank members of the Benovic laboratory for continuous encouragement."

In this study we investigated the mechanism by which interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced osteoclast differentiation in mouse osteoclast precursors. We show here that both IL-3 and GM-CSF potently inhibits TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation by direct action on osteoclast precursors. The inhibitory effect of IL-3 and GM-CSF on osteoclast differentiation was completely neutralized by anti-IL-3 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies, respectively. In addition, the inhibitory effect of IL-3 and GM-CSF on TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation was irreversible. In osteoclast precursors, IL-3 and GM-CSF inhibited c-Fms expression post-transcriptionally. Interestingly, IL-3 and GM-CSF down-regulated both mRNA and surface expression of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2. Furthermore, cells in the presence of IL-3 and GM-CSF showed high expression of macrophage antigen CD11b, and low expression of dendritic cells antigen CD11c and prolong exposure of osteoclast precursors to GM-CSF increased the CD11c expression compare with IL-3.

Res. 1988; 3: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).TNF-α induces a number of biological responses via two cell-surface receptors termed TNFR1 and TNFR2 (also called TNFR p55 and TNFR p75, respectively) (36Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 37Tartaglia L.A.

Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 transduce intracellular signals that stimulate the proteolytic breakdown of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB), a cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB (38Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

It is well established that mouse TNF-α binds to both mouse TNFR1 and TNFR2 with high affinity, whereas human TNF-α binds mouse TNFR1 with higher affinity than to mouse TNFR2 (36Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 37Tartaglia L.A.

Colony-stimulating factors such as IL-3 and GM-CSF regulate osteoclast differentiation in mouse hemopoietic tissue (40Hattersley G. Chambers T.J. J. Cell.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2544-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Others and we have recently shown that IL-3 and GM-CSF inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation by direct action on osteoclast precursors (45Khapli S.M. Mangashetti L.S. Yogesha S.D. Wani M.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 46Miyamoto T. Ohneda O. Arai F. Iwamoto K. Okada S. Takagi K. Anderson D.M. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 98: 2544-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). IL-3 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, by down-regulation of c-Fos expression and prevention of NF-κB signaling, and diverts the cells to macrophage lineage; whereas, GM-CSF inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, by inhibiting c-Fos expression, and diverts the cells to dendritic cell lineage. However, the mechanism of IL-3 and GM-CSF action in TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation is not known.In this study, using stromal and lymphocyte-free cultures of osteoclast precursors, and whole bone marrow cells, we investigated the mechanism of action of IL-3 and GM-CSF on osteoclastogenesis induced by TNF-α in the presence of M-CSF. We show here that IL-3 and GM-CSF act directly on osteoclast precursors and completely inhibit TNF-α-induced osteoclast formation. In addition, the inhibitory action of IL-3 and GM-CSF is irreversible. Furthermore, IL-3 and GM-CSF both inhibit osteoclastogenesis by down-regulation of mRNA and surface expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Animals—Osteoprotegerin and soluble recombinant human RANKL were obtained from Insight Biotechnology (Wembley, UK). Recombinant human M-CSF, recombinant mouse IL-3, recombinant mouse TNF-α, and recombinant mouse GM-CSF and anti-mouse IL-3, anti-mouse GM-CSF, anti-mouse TNF-α, anti-mouse IL-12, anti-mouse IL-18, and anti-mouse IFN-β neutralizing antibodies were obtained fromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Control goat IgG, rabbit IgG-FITC and goat IgG-FITC were obtained from Banglore Genei (Banglore, India). Polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Fms and goat anti-TNFR1 and -TNFR2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat anti-mouse CD11b and hamster anti-mouse CD11c were purchased from BD Biosciences. 5- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice, IL-4, and IFN-γ knock-out and matched BALB/c control mice, IL-10 knock-out, and matched C57BL6 control mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Facility of the National Center for Cell Science, Pune. The institutional animal ethics committee approved all animal protocols. All cultures were incubated in αMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma-Aldrich). All incubations were performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.Osteoclast Differentiation in Vitro—Stromal and lymphocyte-free, M-CSF-dependent, osteoclast precursors were prepared from bone marrow cells as previously described (47Wani M.R. Fuller K. Kim N.S. Choi Y. Chambers T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bone marrow cells were isolated from 5- to 8-week-old mice. Femora and tibiae were aseptically removed and dissected free of adherent soft tissues. The bone ends were cut, and the marrow cavity was flushed out with αMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) from one end of the bone using a sterile 21-gauge needle. The bone marrow suspension was carefully agitated with a plastic Pasteur pipette to obtain a single-cell suspension. Bone marrow cells were washed twice and resuspended in αMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated for 24 h in the presence of M-CSF (10 ng/ml) at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in a 75-cm2 flask. After 24 h, nonadherent cells were harvested and layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells at the gradient interface were collected, washed, and resuspended (4 × 105 cells/ml) in αMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. These osteoclast precursors were added to 96-well plates (100 μl/well) containing Thermonax plastic coverslips (Invitrogen). After 1–2 h individual coverslips were washed vigorously with PBS at least four times to remove nonadherent and loosely adherent cells and then transferred to new wells with fresh medium. This preparation depletes the lymphocytes in cultures (48Paulnock D.M. Macrophages. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 31-60Google Scholar). Adherent cells were then incubated with M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and TNF-α (40 ng/ml) without or with various concentrations of IL-3 or GM-CSF. Cultures were fed on day 3 by replacing 100 μl of culture medium with an equal quantity of fresh medium and reagents. After incubation for 5 days, osteoclast formation was evaluated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. The number of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells (MNCs) was scored. Absence of contaminating stromal cells and lymphocytes was confirmed in cultures in which M-CSF was omitted. In the absence of M-CSF, such cultures showed no cell growth (data not shown). In some experiments we cultured whole bone marrow cells and examined the effect of IL-3 and GM-CSF on TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation and also on surface expression of c-Fms, TNFR1, and TNFR2 as indicated at the appropriate place.Isolation of Spleen Cells—Spleen cells were isolated from 2- to 5-day-old BALB/c mice as previously described (47Wani M.R. Fuller K. Kim N.S. Choi Y. Chambers T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, spleen cell suspensions were prepared by mechanically disaggregating spleens with a sterile frosted slides followed by repeated passage through a 21-gauge needle. The suspension was washed twice and resuspended (106/ml) in αMEM and 10% fetal calf serum. This suspension was added (100 μl/well) to the wells of 96-well plates. To each of these wells an additional 100-μl medium containing M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and TNF-α (40 ng/ml) with or without different concentrations of IL-3 or GM-CSF was added. Cultures were fed on day 3 by replacing 100 μl of culture medium with an equal quantity of fresh medium and reagents. After incubation for 6 days, osteoclast formation was evaluated by TRAP staining.Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase Staining—Osteoclast formation was evaluated by quantification of TRAP-positive MNCs as described previously (49Fuller K. Lean J.M. Bayley K.E. Wani M.R. Chambers T.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP is preferentially expressed at high levels in osteoclasts and is considered, especially in the mouse, to be an osteoclast marker. After incubation, cells on coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min, and stained for acid phosphatase in the presence of 0.05 m sodium tartrate (Sigma-Aldrich). The substrate used was napthol AS-BI phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). Only those cells that were strongly TRAP-positive (dark red) were counted by light microscopy.RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Expression of TNFR1, TNFR2, TRAP, Cathepsin K, c-Src, and β-actin mRNAs was assessed by RT-PCR analysis. RNA was isolated from cytokine-treated and control cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was used for the synthesis of cDNAs by RT (cDNA synthesis kit, Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified using PCR for 35 cycles. Each cycle consisted of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing, and 30 s of extension at 72 °C. The sequences of sense (S) and antisense (AS) primers used were Cathepsin K, S, 5′-GTGGGTGTTCAAGTTTCTGCTGC-3′; Cathepsin K, AS, 5′-GCTCTCTTCAGGGCTTTCTCGTTC-3′; c-Src, S, 5′-CTCCGACTCCATCCAGGCTG-3′; c-Src, AS, 5′-CCTCTCCGAAGCAACCCTGG-3′; TRAP, S, 5′-GGATTCATGGGTGGTGCTG-3′; TRAP, AS, 5′-TGGCTAACAATGGTCGCAAG-3′; c-Fms, S, 5′-AACAAGTTCTACAAACTGGTGAAGG-3′; c-Fms, AS, 5′-GAAGCCTGTAGTCTAAGCATCTGTC-3′; TNFR1, S, 5′-TCCTTACACAATATCCAGTCGTGAG-3′; TNFR1, AS, 5′-TTCAATCAAAACTTGACCGTTCTAC-3 (14Kobayashi K.

The cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (0.1% sodium azide and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and blocked with mouse Fc block (1:100, BD Biosciences) for 20 min (all steps were performed at 4 °C). Cells were treated with primary antibody for 30 min, washed three times with FACS buffer, and treated with secondary FITC or phycoerythrin-labeled antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with FACS buffer and acquired with FACS Vantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with Cell Quest Pro Software (BD Biosciences).Immunofluorescence—Osteoclast precursors were cultured in 8-well glass Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nunc, Naperville, IL) with M-CSF (30 ng/ml), M-CSF (30 ng/ml), and TNF-α (40 ng/ml) in the absence or the presence of IL-3 (5 ng/ml) or GM-CSF (5 ng/ml) for 12 days. The cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and blocked with mouse Fc block (1:100) for 20 min (all the steps were performed at 4 °C). Cells were treated with primary antibody for 20 min, washed, and treated with secondary FITC or phycoerythrin-labeled antibodies for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS. For nuclear staining cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After washing cells were treated with 5 mg/ml RNase for 10 min at room temperature and then treated with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) (50 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and mounted using Dabco (Sigma-Aldrich) and viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with argon and helium lasers (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).Statistical Analysis of Data—Statistical differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t test and were considered significant at p < 0.01.RESULTSTNF-α Induces Osteoclast Differentiation in Stromal and Lymphocyte-free Cultures of Osteoclast Precursors—TNF-α is known to induce osteoclast differentiation from M-CSF-dependent bone marrow macrophages (14Kobayashi K.

To examine whether TNF-α induces osteoclast differentiation in stromal and lymphocyte-free cultures of osteoclast precursors, we incubated osteoclast precursors for 5 days in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and various concentrations of TNF-α. In this culture system we added TNF-α at the beginning of the culture. Formation of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells (more than three nuclei) was induced by TNF-α (10 ng/ml), and the number of osteoclasts increased with the increase in concentrations of TNF-α (Fig. 1A). These TRAP-positive osteoclasts resorbed bone in the presence of IL-1 confirming the formation of bona fide osteoclasts (data not shown). TRAP-positive MNCs induced by TNF-α was inhibited by anti-mouse TNF-α antibody in a dose-dependent manner, whereas osteoprotegerin (100 ng/ml), the soluble decoy receptor for RANKL, and the isotype-specific mouse IgG did not show the inhibitory effect on TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 1B). Thus in our culture system TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation was independent of RANKL. In all further experiments TNF-α was used at a concentration of 40 ng/ml on day 0 for differentiation of osteoclasts.IL-3 and GM-CSF Are Potent Inhibitors of TNF-α-induced Osteoclast Differentiation—To investigate whether IL-3 and GM-CSF inhibit TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation, osteoclast precursors were incubated in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and TNF-α (40 ng/ml) and increasing concentrations of IL-3 or GM-CSF. IL-3 and GM-CSF both inhibited TNF-α-induced osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner, and significant inhibition was seen at 0.01 ng/ml (Fig. 2, A and B). GM-CSF was found to be more potent than IL-3 for inhibition of osteoclast formation. Photomicrographs in Fig. 2C show the inhibitory effect of IL-3 and GM-CSF on TRAP-positive osteoclast formation. TNF-α-induced osteoclasts showed strong expression of osteoclast-specific genes such as Cathepsin K, c-Src, and TRAP. Both IL-3 (5 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (5 ng/ml) showed significant inhibition of expression of these genes detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 2D). We also observed that both IL-3 and GM-CSF inhibited TNF-α-induced osteoclast formation in cultures of whole bone marrow cells and in spleen cells in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).Fig. 2Effect of IL-3 and GM-CSF on TNF-α-induced osteoclast differentiation in osteoclast precursors. Osteoclast precursors were incubated in 96-well plates in the presence of M-CSF (30 ng/ml) and TNF-α (40 ng/ml) in the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations of IL-3 (A) or increasing concentrations of GM-CSF (B). After 5 days the number of TRAP-positive MNCs was counted. In both A and B results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of six cultures per variable. *, p < 0.01 versus cultures with M-CSF and TNF-α.

https://openalex.org/W2154799281,"The DNA damage response, triggered by DNA replication stress or DNA damage, involves the activation of DNA repair and cell cycle regulatory proteins including the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) complex and replication protein A (RPA). The induction of replication stress by hydroxyurea (HU) or DNA damage by camptothecin (CAMPT), etoposide (ETOP), or mitomycin C (MMC) led to the formation of nuclear foci containing phosphorylated Nbs1. HU and CAMPT treatment also led to the formation of RPA foci that co-localized with phospho-Nbs1 foci. After ETOP treatment, phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci were detected but not within the same cell. MMC treatment resulted in phospho-Nbs1 foci formation in the absence of RPA foci. Consistent with the presence or absence of RPA foci, RPA hyperphosphorylation was present following HU, CAMPT, and ETOP treatment but absent following MMC treatment. The lack of co-localization of phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci may be due to relatively shorter stretches of single-stranded DNA generated following ETOP and MMC treatment. These data suggest that, even though the MRN complex and RPA can interact, their interaction may be limited to responses to specific types of lesions, particularly those that have longer stretches of single-stranded DNA. In addition, the consistent formation of phospho-Nbs1 foci in all of the treatment groups suggests that the MRN complex may play a more universal role in the recognition and response to DNA lesions of all types, whereas the role of RPA may be limited to certain subsets of lesions.

Both replicative stress and DNA damage initiate cellular processes collectively termed the DNA damage response. These processes include activation of appropriate DNA repair mechanisms, delay of the cell cycle in order to allow sufficient time for repair, and in some cases apoptosis (1.Barzilai A. Yamamoto K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 2.Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). One hallmark of the DNA damage response is the aggregation of multiprotein complexes into foci or repair centers. The composition of the foci depends upon the nature of the DNA lesion and is temporally dynamic, changing as the damage is first recognized, processed, and then repaired (3.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 4.Lisby M. Rothstein R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The assembly of foci appears to be largely governed by a network of protein-protein interactions rather than DNA-protein interactions (3.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R. Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 4.Lisby M. Rothstein R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), providing an explanation for the dynamic composition of the foci. Although different types of DNA damage activate specific repair pathways and therefore specific proteins, there are some protein factors that respond to multiple types of lesions (3.Lisby M.

These global response proteins are organized in a distinct spatiotemporal fashion depending upon the nature of the DNA lesion (3.Lisby M. Barlow J.H. Burgess R.C. Rothstein R.

Two protein complexes that are intimately involved in the DNA damage response to multiple types of lesions are the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) 1The abbreviations used are: MRN, Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1; RPA, replication protein A; HU, hydroxyurea; ETOP, etoposide; CAMPT, camptothecin; MMC, mitomycin C; DSBs, double-strand breaks; SSBs, single-strand breaks; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: MRN, Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1; RPA, replication protein A; HU, hydroxyurea; ETOP, etoposide; CAMPT, camptothecin; MMC, mitomycin C; DSBs, double-strand breaks; SSBs, single-strand breaks; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. complex and replication protein A (RPA).The MRN complex is best known for its role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair (7.Haber J.E.

We wanted to determine whether the interaction of the MRN complex with RPA was specific to replicative stress responses or whether other types of DNA damage also stimulate the interaction. To achieve this goal, we used topoisomerase inhibitors and cross-linking agents. Whereas HU leads to replication fork stalling due to depletion of deoxyribonucleotide substrates (44.Sogo J.M.

HU and CAMPT treatment led to phospho-Nbs1 foci that co-localized with RPA foci. In contrast, ETOP treatment induced both phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci but not within the same cell. Treatment with MMC induced phospho-Nbs1 foci but did not induce any RPA foci formation until the latest time point investigated. These localization differences suggest that, although the DNA damage response is activated (evidenced by Nbs1 phosphorylation) in response to HU, CAMPT, ETOP, and MMC, the interaction of the MRN complex and RPA at the level of co-localization into repair foci is limited to responses to HU and CAMPT.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Treatments—HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Cell Culture (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). For HU (Sigma) treatment, asynchronous cells were incubated in growth medium containing 4 mm HU for 1–24 h before harvesting. For CAMPT (Sigma) treatment, the drug was added directly to the cell medium at a final concentration of 1μm for 1–6 h before cell harvest. For ETOP (Sigma) treatment, cells were incubated in growth medium containing 25 μm ETOP for 1–6 h before harvesting, whereas for MMC (Sigma) treatment, the drug was added to the media at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 1–6 h before cell harvest.Immunofluorescent Detection of Foci—Cells were grown on 12-mm coverslips (BD Biosciences Labware, Bedford, MA) for 48 h prior to treatment. Cells were treated with 4 mm HU for 1–24 h, 1 μm CAMPT for 1–6 h, 25 μm etoposide for 1–6 h, or 1 μg/ml MMC for 1–6 h. After treatment, cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and then blocked in PBS containing 15% fetal bovine serum. After incubation in primary antibody solutions overnight at 4 °C, cells were washed with PBS, incubated in secondary antibody solutions at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then placed on slides using gel-mounting medium (Biomedia, Foster City, CA) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as a counterstain. Primary antibody dilutions used were as follows: anti-RPA (1:1500) (NeoMarkers, Freemont, CA) and anit-Nbs1-SP343 (1:1500) (Novus Biological). Secondary antibody dilutions used were as follows: anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:250) and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (1:250) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The percentages of cells containing foci were determined using a Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope, and images of the foci were captured using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M equipped with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images were processed using Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). For each experiment, at least 100 cells were analyzed and experiments were repeated three times.Western Immunoblots—Cell lysates were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were probed using anti-RPA-p34 (1:5000) and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England; 1:3,000). Bound antibodies were visualized using chemiluminescent detection.Comet Assays—Neutral comet assays were performed as described previously (61.O'Neill K.L. Fairbairn D.W. Smith M.J. Poe B.S.

The slides then were placed in neutral lysis buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, and 18 mmN-laurylsarcosine) for 3 min and then placed into deionized H2O for 10 min. Electrophoresis was done at 20 V, 200 mA for 10 min in electrophoresis buffer (230 mm Tris, 180 mm boric acid, and 0.2 mm EDTA). Following electrophoresis, cells were immersed in a propidium iodide solution (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma) for 20 min and rinsed in deionized H2O and coverslips were placed on the gels. Slides were analyzed using a Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope with attached CCD camera. Images were saved as Bitmap files, and tail moments were determined using CometScore™ Freeware from TriTek Corp.

Dixon K. Oakley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34802-34810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and consistent with that report, we observed co-localization of phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci following HU treatment (Fig. 1A, panels D–F). In a similar fashion, cells treated with CAMPT, a topoisomerase I inhibitor (46.D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Liu L.F. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Mao Y. Sun M. Sim S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 922: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), also formed phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci that co-localized (Fig. 1A, panels G–I). To determine the extent of foci formation, we calculated the percentage of cells containing phospho-Nbs1 foci, RPA foci, or both. Although not addressing co-localization, the percent of cells expressing foci provided information on the ability of the MRN complex and RPA to form foci independently of each other. The percentage of cells that contained phospho-Nbs1, RPA, or both phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci showed a marked similarity between HU and CAMPT treatment. The percentage of cells containing phospho-Nbs1 foci increased from ∼40% at 1 h to 60% at 6 h. Notably, the cells that contained phospho-Nbs1 foci also contained RPA foci and the reverse was also true. (Fig. 1B). With these agents, the phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci co-localized, implying that the MRN complex and RPA responded jointly at both stalled replication forks and DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs).ETOP and MMC Induce Phospho-Nbs1 and RPA Foci That Do Not Co-localize—To determine the extent of phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci formation and to determine whether these proteins co-localize at other DNA lesions, we investigated two additional agents that damage DNA by different mechanisms: ETOP, a topoisomerase II inhibitor (46.D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Hande K.R. Cancer Chemother. Biol. Response Modif. 2003; 21: 103-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MMC, a DNA cross-linking agent (56.Tomasz M. Palom Y. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 76: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 57.Tomasz M. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 575-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In contrast to the HU- and CAMPT-induced foci, ETOP and MMC treatment did not lead to phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci co-localization (Fig. 1A, panels L, O, and R). Following treatment with ETOP, the majority of cells contained either phospho-Nbs1 or RPA foci but not both (Fig. 1, A, panels J–O, and B). After 1 h of ETOP treatment, ∼60% cells had phospho-Nbs1 foci and ∼20% had both phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci. At later time points, an equivalent percentage of cells (∼50–55%) demonstrated either phospho-Nbs1 or RPA predominant foci. However, the percentage of cells that contained both phospho-Nbs1 and RPA foci dropped to 5% at 3 h and had risen to ∼20% by 6 h (Fig. 1B).Treatment with MMC led to an increase in the percentage of cells containing phospho-Nbs1 foci from ∼25% after 1 h of treatment to 95% after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 1B). Notably, RPA foci were not seen until the 6-h time point where only ∼20% cells, which contained phospho-Nbs1 foci, also contained RPA foci (Fig. 1B). Coupled with the ETOP data, this difference in co-localization suggested that the response of the MRN complex and RPA was not equivalent for all types of lesions. Whereas the MRN complex responded to every type of lesion and at every time point investigated, the response of RPA to MMC was very weak and only occurred at the latest time point investigated despite the robust MRN response. The difference in response of the MRN complex and RPA is also supported by the observation that, although both the MRN complex and RPA responded to ETOP, their responses were independent of each other as demonstrated by the ability of each to form foci in the absence of the other.HU, CAMPT, ETOP, and MMC Induce RPA-p34 Hyperphosphorylation—We have previously shown that HU treatment leads to damage-dependent phosphorylation of Mre11 and hyperphosphorylation of RPA-p34 (15.Robison J.G. Elliott J. Dixon K. Oakley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34802-34810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Formation of phospho-Nbs1 foci in the immunofluorescence experiments verified that HU, CAMPT, ETOP, and MMC all induced the phosphorylation of Nbs1. To determine whether these agents induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA-p34, we performed Western immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates and looked for the characteristic hyper-phosphorylated band. HU, CAMPT, ETOP, and MMC all led to the hyperphosphorylation of RPA-p34 with a time-dependent increase in the amount of the hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4, 6–8, 10–12, and 16; Form 5 represents the hyperphosphorylated band). Consistent with the foci data that showed that RPA did not respond to MMC treatment until 6 h, RPA hyperphosphorylation was only seen at the 6-h time point and was much less robust than with the other agents (Fig. 2, lane 16).Fig. 2HU-, CAMPT-, ETOP-, and MMC-induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA-p34. HeLa cells were treated with 4 mm HU, 1 μm CAMPT, 25 μm ETOP, or 1 μg/ml MMC for 1–3 h. HU, CAMPT, ETOP, and MMC led to the hyperphosphorylation of RPA-p34 (lanes 2–4, 6–8, 10–12, and 16). RPA-p34 hyperphosphorylation was determined by the appearance of a slower migrating band (Form 5) on the Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ETOP and MMC Induce DNA DSBs—The foci data suggested that different types of lesions generated specific responses that differed in the extent of RPA involvement.

In this study, we used C2C12 myoblasts and human fetal primary myoblasts to investigate the function of Nkx2.5 in skeletal myogenesis. The expression levels of Nkx2.5 decreased as C2C12 myoblasts elongated and fused to form myotubes. The expression of human NKX2.5 in C2C12 myoblasts inhibited myocyte differentiation and myotube formation, and up-regulated Gata4 and Tbx5 expression. The expression of NKX2.5 in terminally differentiated C2C12 myotubes resulted in a change in morphology and breakdown into smaller myotubes. Furthermore, overexpression of NKX2.5 in C2C12 cells and primary cultures of human fetal myoblasts led to differentiation of myoblasts into neuron-like cells and expression of neuronal markers. This study sheds light on the previously unknown non-cardiac functions of Nkx2.5 transcription factor.

The expression of NKX2.5 in terminally differentiated C2C12 myotubes resulted in a change in morphology and breakdown into smaller myotubes. Furthermore, overexpression of NKX2.5 in C2C12 cells and primary cultures of human fetal myoblasts led to differentiation of myoblasts into neuron-like cells and expression of neuronal markers. This study sheds light on the previously unknown non-cardiac functions of Nkx2.5 transcription factor. The cardiac and skeletal muscle progenitor cells are derived from the mesoderm and are committed to their lineages early in embryogenesis. The molecular pathway(s) involved in differentiation of myocytes from their progenitor cells is not well understood. The transcription factor CSX/Nkx2.5, a vertebrate homolog of Drosophila Tinman, is one of the earliest determinants of the cardiac cell lineage and is detected mainly in cardiac progenitors and pharyngeal endoderm as early as 7.5 days post coitum (1Evans S.M.

Recent findings have indicated that Nkx2.5 is essential for myocardial cell lineage specification and development of the cardiac conduction system (4Pashmforoush M. Lu J.T. Chen H. Amand T.S.

The extracardiac expression and function of Nkx2.5 is controversial (2Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Nkx2.5 expression has been demonstrated in a subset of the cranial skeletal muscle, spleen, stomach, liver, tongue, and anterior larynx in addition to the heart (7Kasahara H. Bartunkova S. Schinke M. Tanaka M. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggesting that Nkx2.5 might play a role in development of these organs. The homozygous deletion of Nkx2.5 in mice is lethal at the early stages of development because of defective looping of the heart tube (8Tanaka M. Chen Z. Bartunkova S. Yamasaki N. Izumo S. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1269-1280PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore it has been difficult to study the function of Nkx2.5 in development of other organs as well as in the differentiation and maturation of cardiac myocytes. Notwithstanding its function in embryonic cardiac development, Nkx2.5 overexpression seems to be detrimental in postnatal cardiac myocyte and dramatically changes the cardiac cell structure and function (9Kasahara H. Ueyama T. Wakimoto H. Liu M.K. Maguire C.T. Converso K.L. Kang P.M. Manning W.J. Lawitts J. Paul D.L. Berul C.I. Izumo S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulatory network governing the cardiac myocyte differentiation is not completely elucidated; however, it is known that Nkx2.5 physically interacts with other transcription factors such as GATA4 and Tbx5 to synergistically activate target cardiac-specific genes (10Sepulveda J.L.

The C2C12 myoblast cell line has been used extensively in the study of skeletal myogenesis (13Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). When cultured in the presence of growth factors, these myoblasts proliferate as mononucleated cells and express muscle regulatory factors such as MyoD and Myf-5. C2C12 myoblasts terminally differentiate into skeletal myocyte and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes when cultured to confluence and deprived of growth factors. A fraction of C2C12 cells (reserve cells, 20–50% of cells) remain in a proliferating undifferentiated state. The expression of transcription factors myogenin and MRF-4 significantly increases as myoblasts elongate and fuse to form myotubes, whereas cell cycle-regulatory proteins such as cyclin A are down-regulated (14Wang J. Nadal-Ginard B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the expression of Nkx2.5 and its function in myogenesis and demonstrate that Nkx2.5 expression level is critical for myocyte differentiation and myotube formation. In addition, overexpression of Nkx2.5 in myoblasts results in expression of neuronal markers suggesting a role for this gene or a gene under Nkx2.5 regulation in neurogenesis. Culturing C2C12 and Primary Myoblasts—C2C12 cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were normally cultured in growth medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 10% CO2. To allow cells to differentiate, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum. Approximately 70% of the cells differentiated and fused to form myotubes after 3–5 days in a routine experiment. Mouse and human fetal skeletal myoblast preparation was done according to a published protocol for mouse myoblast preparation (15Springer M.L. Blau H.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Approval of the institute ethics committee was obtained for collecting samples from terminated pregnancies. Approximately 70% of prepared myoblasts fused to form myotubes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% serum. To isolate C2C12 myotubes, myoblasts were allowed to form myotubes in differentiation medium. The myotubes were detached by brief exposure to trypsin (0.05% + EDTA) and were passed through a 100-μm filter and seeded at 2–4 myotubes/mm2 on a gridded 35-mm dish. The next day the cells were briefly treated with distilled H2O to remove the contaminating myoblasts and maintained in media containing 2% horse serum. Adenoviral Expression of NKX2.5—To express NKX2.5 from adenovirus, AdEasy adenoviral expression system was obtained from Stratagene. Human NKX2.5 (accession number: BC025711) cDNA was amplified from fetal heart RNA (Clontech) using primers AGACTGGTCGACTGCCACCATGTTCC and AGAGTCAGGGATCCTAGTTGAGGTG, digested with SalI and BamHI and cloned into the AdTrack-CMV vector (Invitrogen) in forward or reverse orientations. Manufacturer's instructions were followed for virus production. Adenoviral titers and multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1The abbreviations used are: MOI, multiplicity of infection; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; MyHC, myosin heavy chain; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. were estimated in human embryonic kidney-293 cells by counting the number of GFP+ cells, 24 h after infection. The recombinant adenoviruses were used at 2–20 MOI for primary and C2C12 myoblasts and at ∼200 MOI to infect myotubes. Cell Cycle Analysis—The standard method for cell cycle analysis using DNA staining by propidium iodide was used. Briefly, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol solution (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). For real time PCR analysis either TaqMan assay (assay-on-demand for mouse myogenin and Nkx2.5, Applied Biosystems) or SYBR Green (for Tbx5, Gata4) was used. Data were analyzed by relative quantitation method using standard curve. The following sets of primers were used for SYBR Green real time assay or in one-step RT-PCR (kit from Qiagen) analysis: Nkx2.5, GGCGTCGGGGACTTGAACACC, CGCACTCACTTTAATGGGAAG; Gata4, CTTGAGGCATGGCACATCTCTGCA, TAATGGTGGGAGATGGGAA; Tbx-5, GCAGGGCCTGAGTACCTCTT, GGCTGATGGGCCACTGAGGT; myogenin, CACTCCCTTACGTCCATCGTG, CGGCAGCTTTACAAACAACAC; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG, GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACT; and synapsin-I, GCAACGGAGACTACCGCAGTTTG, TTGTCTTCATCCTGGTGGTCACC. PCR conditions for all the primers were 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1s for 26–30 cycles. Immunofluorescence, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Analysis— MyHC antibody (MF-20) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health and maintained by the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA. Other antibodies were purchased. Nkx2.5, MyoD, p21, p27, and cyclin A were purchased from Santa Cruz, myogenin was purchased from Pharmingen, nestin and NeuN were purchased from Chemicon, and BrdUrd antibody was from Pharmingen. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis were performed according to standard procedure. Immunoprecipitation of Nkx2.5 was performed using 400 μg of whole cell lysates and 1 μg of anti Nkx2.5 antibody. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was determined by oneway analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was used to determine a significant difference. We examined the expression of Nkx2.5 and myogenin in C2C12 cells at different stages of differentiation using real time RT-PCR. RNA was prepared from C2C12 cells at day -1 (subconfluent), and at days 0 (100% confluent), 1, and 3 after the culture medium was changed to differentiation medium. The cells started to elongate at day 1, and multinucleated myotubes appeared at day 3 (not shown). Fig. 1A demonstrates a real time analysis of Nkx2.5 and myogenin RNA. The Nkx2.5 RNA level in differentiated C2C12 cells declined to about 25% of its level in the undifferentiated cells. However, myogenin was highly up-regulated (by ∼45-fold) as cells differentiated and fused (days 1–3). Accordingly, the Nkx2.5 protein was also reduced as cells underwent differentiation (Fig. 1B). Immunostaining with Nkx2.5 antibody revealed expression throughout nuclei and cytoplasm, which was absent in human umbilical cord endothelial cell culture negative control (not shown). We evaluated the role of Nkx2.5 in myocyte differentiation by overexpressing human NKX2.5 in C2C12 cells from an adenovirus. The human and mouse Nkx2.5 proteins (accession numbers BC025711 and X75415, respectively) are 87% identical (using BLAST program) and therefore expected to have fundamental properties in common. Expression of Nkx2.5 in C2C12 myoblasts and human fetal skeletal myoblasts completely blocked the formation of myotubes, as no myosin heavy chain (MyHC) protein was detected in the cells cultured for 4 days in differentiation media (Fig. 2A) indicating that Nkx2.5 modulates skeletal myogenesis. The expression levels of myogenin, MyoD, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 (Cip1) and p27 (Kip1), and cyclin A were also examined in the C2C12 cells overexpressing NKX2.5 in growth- and differentiation-promoting conditions. Overexpression of NKX2.5 in C2C12 cells lowered the level of MyoD and blocked the expression of myogenin. Concomitantly, p21 and p27 were significantly up-regulated in NKX2.5-expressing cells, whereas cyclin A was reduced (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, cells treated with adenovirus expressing NKX2.5 and/or GFP were analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorter for cell cycle analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C the percentage of cells in S phase was reduced by ∼2-fold in cultures treated with NKX2.5-expressing adenovirus after 24 h (5.125 ± 0.81% in NKX2.5-overexpressing cells versus 10.95 ± 1.23% in the GFP-expressing cells). The expression levels of transcription factor genes, Gata4 and Tbx5 were evaluated in C2C12 cells treated with increasing amounts of NKX2.5 adenovirus, using real time PCR. Both Gata4 and Tbx5 were slightly up-regulated when cells were treated with low concentrations of the adenovirus (Fig. 2D); however, higher concentrations of the adenovirus and therefore higher level of NKX2.5 expression resulted in the down-regulation of these genes. The C2C12 cells overexpressing NKX2.5 did not express cardiac-specific cell markers ANF and cTnI as examined by RT-PCR (not shown). C2C12 and human fetal myoblasts overexpressing NKX2.5 demonstrated a change in morphology 2–3 days after treatment, and displayed small, spherical, and refractive cell bodies with long cellular processes (Fig. 3, a and b) compared with normal myoblast morphology in GFP-vector-treated control cells (Fig. 3c). The majority of NKX2.5-expressing C2C12 cells were positive for the immature neuronal cell marker, nestin, 3–5 days post-treatment (Fig. 3, d–i). Nestin was also detected in differentiated myocytes and myotubes in control cells (not shown). In addition, a number of cells with neuronal morphology expressed NeuN (Fig. 3, j–l), whereas no glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells were detected by immunofluorescence suggesting that the majority of cells were acquiring neuronal and not glial cell characteristics. Furthermore, NKX2.5-transduced C2C12 and primary human myoblasts expressed synapsin I, a protein found in the nerve terminals and known to play a role in axonogenesis and synaptogenesis (16Chin L.S. Li L. Ferreira A. Kosik K.S. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9230-9234Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3m). The level of synapsin-I expression in NKX2.5-expressing fetal myoblasts was similar to the RNA level detected in a fetal mouse brain (Fig. 3m, lanes 4 and 6). To further investigate the function of Nkx2.5 in myogenesis we transduced C2C12 myotubes with NKX2.5-expressing adenovirus. The myotubes, normally expressing a lower level of Nkx2.5, changed morphology and produced a bead-on-a-string appearance. Two to three days after cells were transduced with NKX2.5-adenovirus, the nuclei were positioned into separate clusters of several or sometimes single nuclei, and the sarcomeric proteins (MyHC and α-actinin) started to disappear from the cytoplasm of the myotubes (Fig. 4A). Later, constrictions appeared throughout the length of the myotubes and finally smaller myotubes or mononucleated myoblasts were separated (Fig. 4A). Almost 100% of the myotubes expressing NKX2.5 showed the morphological change, whereas a similar phenotype was rarely seen in myotubes in the control plate. To evaluate the mitotic ability of the myotubes, C2C12 myotubes were isolated, separated from myoblasts, and seeded at low density on a gridded plate before being infected with NKX2.5-expressing adenovirus. Cell cultures were then treated with BrdUrd and the number of cells undergoing DNA synthesis was evaluated using anti-BrdUrd antibody. The number of BrdUrd+ cells did not seem to significantly differ in NKX2.5-transduced cells under conditions used (Fig. 4B). Nkx2.5 is one of the earliest genes expressed in cardiac mesoderm during development and functions in association with other transcription factors such as GATA4, Tbx5, and MEF2C (3Bruneau B.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to initiate cardiac muscle differentiation. The expression of Nkx2.5 in cranial muscle and tongue in addition to the heart has been reported previously (7Kasahara H. Bartunkova S. Schinke M. Tanaka M. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this study we discovered a previously unknown function of Nkx2.5 in skeletal myogenesis. Our results clearly contradict a report suggesting the absence of Nkx2.5 expression in C2C12 cells (2Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used real time PCR and Western blot analysis to show expression of Nkx2.5 RNA and protein in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Nkx2.5 expression levels corresponded to the differentiation status of the skeletal myoblasts. The adenoviral expression of NKX2.5 in myoblasts prevented the differentiation into myocytes and formation of myotubes. The levels of myogenic transcription factors, MyoD and myogenin, were markedly reduced in the NKX2.5-expressing cells. In addition, C2C12 cells expressing NKX2.5 demonstrated a marked increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, a reduction in cyclin A, and cell cycle block at G1/S transition. Previous studies have indicated that cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation of myoblasts is accompanied with expression of p21 and p27 and down-regulation of cyclin A (14Wang J. Nadal-Ginard B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The changes in expression of these regulatory proteins might partially explain cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation of NKX2.5-expressing cells into a non-myocyte lineage. Expression of human NKX2.5 was not sufficient for transdifferentiating C2C12 myoblasts into cardiac myocytes as cells did not express cardiac myocyte markers, ANF and cTnI. However, it did result in the up-regulation of Gata4 and Tbx5 transcription factor genes that are highly expressed during heart development. Our findings support the previous reports of regulation of Tbx5 by Nkx2.5 (21Sun G. Lewis L.E. Huang X. Nguyen Q. Price C. Huang T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Schwartz R.J. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4187-4192PubMed Google Scholar). A higher level of expression of NKX2.5 resulted in down-regulation of Gata4 and Tbx5. This may indicate differentiation of myoblasts into cells with non-myocyte characteristics. Forced expression of NKX2.5 in myoblasts resulted in a change in morphology and expression of neuronal markers indicating that either Nkx2.5 or a gene(s) under its regulation is responsible for reprogramming myoblasts into neuron-like cells in vitro. The expression of Nkx2.5 has not been reported in the nervous system. However, genes such as Pax7 and TrkC receptor that are involved in neurogenesis have potential Nkx2.5 binding sites in their promoters (23Syagailo Y.V. Okladnova O. Reimer E. Grassle M. Mossner R. Gattenlohner S. Marx A. Meyer J. Lesch K.P. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Ichaso N. Rodriguez R.E. Martin-Zanca D. Gonzalez-Sarmiento R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Nkx2.5, TrkC, and its ligand neurotrophin-3 are all expressed in developing a conduction system of the heart (25Hiltunen J.O. Arumae U. Moshnyakov M. Saarma M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is believed that neuronal genes such as neurofilaments are expressed in the cardiac conduction system myocytes (26Vitadello M. Vettore S. Lamar E. Chien K.R. Gorza L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1833-1844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and therefore these findings could represent the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into cells with characteristics of cardiac conduction cells. Furthermore, in this study we have demonstrated that increased expression of NKX2.5 in myotubes, normally expressing low levels of Nkx2.5, leads to degradation of the sarcomere and division of myotubes into smaller myotubes. The apparent division of myotubes overexpressing NKX2.5 may represent dedifferentiation; however, the assessment of the potential of regenerated cells to differentiate into myoblasts or other cell types was not possible using our adenoviral expression system, because the majority of treated myotubes died after a few days in culture. Similarly an alteration of sarcomere structure and down-regulation of connexin 40 and 43 has been reported when Nkx2.5 is overexpressed in neonatal cardiomyocytes (9Kasahara H. Ueyama T. Wakimoto H. Liu M.K. Maguire C.T. Converso K.L. Kang P.M. Manning W.J. Lawitts J. Paul D.L. Berul C.I. Izumo S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 243-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, there was no increase in BrdUrd incorporation in myotubes expressing Nkx2.5. We speculate that the activation of other regulatory genes is needed in order for the cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Reprogramming myotubes into myoblasts has been achieved by overexpressing a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, Msx-1 (27Odelberg S.J. Kollhoff A. Keating M.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1099-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and by exposing cells to myoseverin, a microtubule-binding purine in vitro (28Rosania G.R. Chang Y.T. Perez O. Sutherlin D. Dong H. Lockhart D.J. Schultz P.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A relationship between Nkx2.5 overexpression and up-regulation of Msx-1 in myoblasts remains to be studied. A cDNA microarray analysis is now underway to study the genes under Nkx2.5 regulation in skeletal myoblast. In conclusion, this study describes a hitherto unknown function of the transcription factor Nkx2.5 as a differentiation factor in skeletal myogenesis and neurogenesis. These findings may have future applications in regeneration of terminally differentiated muscle and neurons using myoblasts."

GEP has been identified several times and is also known as PC-cell-derived growth factor, progranulin, proepithelin, and acrogranin. The murine teratoma PC cell line secretes granulin in the form of an 88-kDa glycoprotein, which acts as an autocrine growth factor. A 68-kDa form of granulin produced by rat liver cells is sufficient to support the growth in serum-free medium of 3T3 cells null for the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor. No other growth factor can by itself stimulate the growth of these cells (3.Zanocco-Marani T. Bateman A. Romano G. Valentinis B. He Z.H. Baserga R.

Histopathol. 2003; 18: 1275-1288PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 308: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9.Davidson B. Alejandro E.

Its expression is correlated with tumorigenicity, and the proliferation of malignant human breast carcinoma cells is inhibited by GEP antisense RNA or anti-GEP antibodies. GEP can substitute for estradiol in stimulating DNA synthesis in breast cancer cells, rendering them estrogen-independent and tamoxifen-resistant (10.Lu R. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3993-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). GEP also stimulates the growth of several other cell lines, including epithelial cells and rat adrenal gland pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (4.Daniel R. He Z. Carmichael K.P. Halper J. Bateman A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In normal tissues full-length granulin and individual granulins mediate the wound response and coordinate host defense and wound repair (11.He Z. Ong C.H. Halper J. Bateman A. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 12.Zhu J. Nathan C. Jin W. Sim D. Ashcroft G.S. Wahl S.M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wright C.D. Ding A. Cell. 2002; 111: 867-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). GEP contains seven and a half repeats of a cysteine-rich motif (CX5–6CX5CCX8CCX6CCXDX2HCCPX4CX5–6C) in the order P-G-F-B-A-C-D-E, where A-G are full repeats and P is the half motif (Fig. 1A). The C-terminal region of the consensus sequence contains the conserved sequence CCXDX2HCCP and is suggested to have a metal binding site and to be involved in regulatory function (13.Hrabal R. Chen Z. James S. Bennett H.P. Ni F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Several of the repeat units have been isolated from tissue culture medium, blood, and urine as ∼6-kDa peptides known as granulins (or epithelins) and are individually biologically active. In some systems they stimulate cell proliferation, whereas in others they inhibit mitosis (7.Ong C.H. Bateman A. Histol. Histopathol. 2003; 18: 1275-1288PubMed Google Scholar). The GEP repeats are joined by short intergranulin linkers of diverse sequence, containing the cleavage site for the serine proteinase elastase, which is secreted in large quantities by neutrophils during infection and inflammation (12.Zhu J. Nathan C. Jin W. Sim D. Ashcroft G.S. Wahl S.M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wright C.D. Ding A. Cell. 2002; 111: 867-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The mode of action of GEP is not well understood. Granulin binding sites have been demonstrated, although cell surface receptors have not yet been characterized (14.Culouscou J.M. Plowman G.D. Carlton G.W. Green J.M. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18407-18410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Xia X. Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently GEP was reported to interact with perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan found in basement membranes and cell surfaces. The perlecan-GEP interaction was suggested to modulate tumor growth (16.Gonzalez E.M. Mongiat M. Slater S.J. Baffa R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38113-38116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). GEP leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and to stimulation of cyclin D1 protein expression. This can account for the cellular proliferation activity of granulin and its ability to replace estrogen in inducing the growth of breast cancer cells (17.Lu R. Serrero G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). More recently, we found that GEP can modulate transcription elongation by interacting with human cyclin T1, a component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). P-TEFb is a general transcription factor required for the production of mRNA by RNA polymerase II (19.Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In addition to cyclin T1, P-TEFb contains the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9, which phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of polymerase II, thereby facilitating the transition of polymerase II into a productive elongation mode (reviewed in Ref. 20.Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). P-TEFb, and cyclin T1 in particular, is a target for cellular and viral transcription regulators. For example, cyclin T1 binds the HIV-1 transcription activator Tat (21.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and allows the generation of full-length rather than prematurely terminated RNA chains (19.Zhu Y.

Lett. 2003; 220: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cyclin T1 is an exceptionally large cyclin with unique sequences in its C-terminal region (Fig. 1B) that interact with regulatory proteins (24.Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25.Yedavalli V.S. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 6373-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GEP binds specifically to the histidine-rich domain of cyclin T1 (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which is also necessary for RNA polymerase II binding (27.Taube R. Lin X. Irwin D. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GEP forms complexes with intact P-TEFb inside cells and represses transcription from the HIV-1 LTR, a promoter that is highly dependent on P-TEFb (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of granulin, GrnCDE, serves as a substrate for P-TEFb in kinase assays. Phosphorylation of a C-terminal domain peptide in vitro is inhibited when P-TEFb is bound to GST-GrnCDE, suggesting that granulin may act by repressing the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain by P-TEFb (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Remarkably, GEP also binds to the Tat proteins of HIV-1, HIV-2, and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28.Trinh D.P. Brown K.M. Jeang K.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

HIV-1 Tat is synthesized as a protein of 72–101 amino acids (aa), depending on the viral strain and alternate splicing of its mRNA. The one-exon 72-aa form, which is sufficient to activate transcription from the HIV-1 promoter (30.Cullen B.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 973-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 31.Sodroski J. Patarca R. Rosen C. Wong-Staal F. Haseltine W. Science. 1985; 229: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), is composed of five functional domains (Fig. 1C). GEP interacts with the cysteine-rich domain of Tat, which forms part of the its activation domain required for binding to P-TEFb and for transactivation. These data raised the possibility that granulins could inhibit HIV-1 transcription by binding the Tat activation domain. Previous work indicated that granulins can inhibit the HIV-1 promoter via tethered cyclin T1 in the absence of Tat (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study, we aimed first to determine whether granulins can serve as specific inhibitors of Tat transactivation via direct interactions with Tat. We found that the interaction of granulin with Tat can be sufficient for transcriptional repression and that the interactions of GEP with cyclin T1 and Tat are separable. Granulins inhibited Tat transactivation mediated by truncated cyclin T1 that lacks the histidine-rich domain essential for binding granulin. The interactions of granulins with Tat and cyclin T1 are distinguishable with respect to their requirement for zinc ions, and distinct Tat sequences are involved in interactions with granulin and cyclin T1. Next, we assessed the contribution of specific granulins to Tat and cyclin T1 binding and to the inhibition of expression from the HIV-1 promoter. We found that granulins DE and E interact differentially with cyclin T1 and Tat: these granulins bind to Tat in cell extracts and in living cells but do not interact directly with cyclin T1. Granulins DE and E repressed transcription from the HIV-1 LTR and gene expression from the viral genome and are found in complexes with Tat and P-TEFb. Thus granulins DE and E are specific inhibitors of the Tat·P-TEFb complex and of viral gene expression. Cell Lines and Culture—Adherent 293T, 3T3, and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich). Plasmids and Plasmid Construction—The plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD GH and the yeast strain CG1945 for yeast two-hybrid system experiments were from Clontech. GrnCDE (aa 342–593) and GEP (aa 1–593) were subcloned into pGBT9. Construction of cyclin T1 full-length and truncated versions and CDK9 and HIV-1 Tat expression vectors was described previously (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GrnCDE, GrnPGFBA (aa 18–341), GrnCD (aa 342–498), GrnDE (aa 442–593), GrnD (aa 442–498), and GrnE (aa 499–593) were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences), into the mammalian expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma), and into the yeast vector pGAD GH. The plasmid pcDNA3-PCDGF (encoding full-length human granulin) for expression in mammalian cells, the yeast vector pGAD GH, pLTR-luciferase (firefly), pRSV-luciferase (Renilla), and the mammalian expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2 containing GEP were described earlier (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Plasmids for expression in mammalian cells were pcDNA-HA cyclin T1-(1–333) from Q. Zhou (32.Chen D. Fong Y. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); pFLAG CMV-2-cyclin T1-(1–726) and pFLAG CMV-2-cyclin T1-(1–397) from R. Gaynor (33.Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Nee E. Guo J. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); G5-HIV-luciferase and Gal4-cyclin T1-(1–726) from L. Lania (34.Majello B. Napolitano G. Giordano A. Lania L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); and wild-type pcDNA3.HA-Tat, pcDNA3.HA-Tat C30G, and pcDNA3.HA-Tat K41A from B. M. Peterlin (35.Cujec T.P. Cho H. Maldonado E. Meyer J. Reinberg D. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription and translation, GrnCDE and GrnPGFBA were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+); GrnDE, GrnD, and GrnE were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1HisB (Invitrogen). For microscopic analysis, GrnCDE and GrnDE were subcloned into pEGFP expression vector as described previously (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Wild-type Tat was subcloned into pDSRed1-C1 vector (Clontech) to generate pRFP-Tat (26.Young T.M. Wang Q. Pe'ery T. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6373-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GST-Tat truncations were constructed by subcloning the corresponding PCR-amplified sequences from the GST-Tat72 vector (AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program (National Institutes of Health)) into the GST-containing vector pGEX-4T-3. GST-Tat-(1–101) was from K. T. Jeang (36.Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4–3-LucE– in which part of the nef gene is replaced by firefly luciferase and the envelope gene is mutated, was obtained from D. Baltimore (37.Chen B.K. Saksela K. Andino R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs used in this study were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Interactions—Protein interactions were studied in yeast using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 system (Clontech) as described in Hoque et al. (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase liquid quantification assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with recombinant GST fusion protein-expressing plasmids. Overnight cultures (grown at 37 °C) were diluted 100-fold in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 3–4 h until the A600 reached 0.6. Cells were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 4 h at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed in 5 volumes of EBCD buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2 mg/ml of lysozyme, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain. After sonication and 20-min centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 4 °C), the clear supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Binding Assay—GrnCDE and GrnPGFBA were synthesized using the in vitro TnT quick-coupled transcription and translation system (Promega). GrnDE, GrnD, and GrnE were synthesized using the coupled wheat germ extract system (TnT, Promega). In vitro synthesized [35S]Met-GrnCDE or [35S]Met-PGFBA (10 μl of reactions) were mixed with ∼2 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins, bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. To test the effect of different metal ions, various concentrations of the specified salts were added to the binding buffer. The beads were washed extensively in EBCD plus 0.03% SDS. Bound proteins were released by heating to 100 °C in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved in 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. [35S]Met-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—Cells were grown to 100% confluency in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, or in suspension to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (minus calcium and magnesium). Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain. After 30-min incubation on ice the cell lysate was sonicated for 10 s (medium frequency) to homogenize the suspension. Clear supernatants were collected after centrifugation in Eppendorf centrifuge (15 min, 13,000 rpm at 4 °C) and stored at –80 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation—Human 293T cells (5 × 106 cells) were transfected with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA using Cytofectene (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested at 24 h post-transfection and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain. Extracts were cleared, and supernatants were collected after 15-min centrifugation at 4 °C (Eppendorf, 13,000 rpm). Antibody (1 μg) was bound to protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with rocking. The conjugates were mixed with cell extract (500 μg of total protein) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing with EBCD buffer containing 0.03% SDS. Protein complexes bound to the conjugated antibody were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (38.Ramanathan Y. Reza S.M. Young T.M. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5448-5458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma; anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-cyclin T1 goat polyclonal, and anti-CDK9 rabbit polyclonal were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Co-localization of Granulins and Tat—Intracellular co-localization experiments were carried out in COS7 cells. Cells were grown on collagen-coated cover slips in tissue culture plates to a confluency of 30–40% and were transfected with the plasmids indicated using Cytofectene (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression, localization, and co-localization of the fluorescence-tagged proteins were directly analyzed using a Nikon TE-300 inverted fluorescence microscope. Digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—3T3 cells (2 × 105 cells) were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.1 ml of 1× Promega lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase activity. Jurkat cells (1 × 107 cells) were suspended in 250 μl of RPMI (without serum) and were transfected with 15 μg of DNA by electroporation. Electroporation was carried out at 900 microfarads, 250 V, and 180 ohms. Cells were harvested 15 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase assays were performed with the Promega Dual Luciferase Reporter System according to the manufacturer's instructions. Granulin Binding to Tat Is Sufficient for Inhibition of Tat Transactivation—Full-length granulin, as well as its N-terminal (GrnPGFBA) and C-terminal (GrnCDE) regions, inhibit Tat transactivation in mouse 3T3 cells supplemented with human cyclin T1 (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because granulin interacts with both cyclin T1 and Tat, the inhibition could be mediated by the binding of granulin to either or both of these transcription factors. Experiments with tethered cyclin T1 showed that granulin can inhibit expression from the HIV-1 promoter in the absence of Tat, i.e. via a granulin-cyclin T1 interaction (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether the direct interaction between granulin and cyclin T1 is necessary for inhibition, we employed a truncated form of cyclin T1 (aa 1–333) that does not bind granulin in yeast two-hybrid or GST pull-down assays (18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of human cyclin T1, containing its cyclin domain and TRM (Tat: TAR recognition motif), is sufficient to permit Tat transactivation in 3T3 cells (33.Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Nee E. Guo J. Garcia-Martinez L.F. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39.Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3512-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, Tat transactivation in 3T3 cells was greatly enhanced by either full-length human cyclin T1-(1–726) or human cyclin T1-(1–333). In both cases, GrnPGFBA and GrnCDE inhibited Tat transactivation by 3- to 6-fold. Similar results were obtained with another cyclin T1 truncation (1–397; data not shown). Thus, inhibition of Tat transactivation by granulin can occur in the absence of the granulin binding site on human cyclin T1. We note that the inhibition was weaker in the absence of the granulin binding site in the cyclin T1 C terminus. Similarly, inhibition was weaker in the absence of Tat, when cyclin T1 was tethered to the promoter (Ref. 18.Hoque M. Young T.M. Lee C.G. Serrero G. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, and see Fig. 7C below), suggesting that granulin may preferentially target the Tat·P-TEFb complex.Fig. 7GrnDE and GrnE inhibit Tat transactivation and gene expression from HIV-1 molecular clone. A, NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of vector expressing equivalent amounts of the FLAG-granulins specified, together with 20 ng of RSV-Tat72, 100 ng of FLAG-cyclin T1 (T1), and 100 ng of the reporter plasmids pLTR-luciferase (firefly) and pRSV-luciferase (Renilla) as indicated. Cell extracts were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Results are expressed as -fold activation of firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and relative to the control lacking Tat. Data are the average of three experiments in duplicate with standard deviations shown. The inset panel shows expression of granulins PGFBA, CDE, CD, and DE, detected by immunoblotting. Granulins D and E, which are expressed at low levels in 293T cells (Fig. 5B), were undetectable by immunoblotting of 3T3 cell extracts. B, Jurkat cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of HIV-1 molecular clone, 1 μg of pRSV-luciferase (Renilla), and 10 μg or equivalent amounts of the granulin plasmids specified. Firefly luciferase expression from the molecular clone was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Data are the average of three experiments in duplicate with standard deviations shown. C, NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with 0.25 μg of Gal4-cyclin T1, 100 ng of G5-HIV-luciferase (firefly) reporter plasmid, and 1.5 μg or equivalent amounts of the specified FLAG-granulins. Results are expressed as -fold activation of firefly luciferase relative to the control lacking Gal4-cyclin T1. Data are normalized to protein levels as some granulins caused a small decrease (∼30%) in the expression of Renilla luciferase from the RSV promoter. Data are the average of two experiments in duplicate with standard deviations shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To verify that the truncated cyclin T1 binds to CDK9 but not to GrnCDE, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments using transfected 293T cell extracts (Fig. 2B). Both the endogenous cyclin T1 and HA-tagged truncated cyclin T1-(1–333) were co-precipitated with anti-CDK9 antibody (lanes 1 and 6), demonstrating that the truncated protein retains the ability to form P-TEFb complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2129669593,"Abstract The presence of DNA-unwinding elements (DUEs) at eukaryotic replicators has raised the question of whether these elements contribute to origin activity by their intrinsic helical instability, as protein-binding sites, or both. We used the human c-myc DUE as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen and identified a DUE-binding protein, designated DUE-B, with a predicted mass of 23.4 kDa. Based on homology to yeast proteins, DUE-B was previously classified as an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; however, the human protein is ∼60 amino acids longer than its orthologs in yeast and worms and is primarily nuclear. In vivo, chromatin-bound DUE-B localized to the c-myc DUE region. DUE-B levels were constant during the cell cycle, although the protein was preferentially phosphorylated in cells arrested early in S phase. Inhibition of DUE-B protein expression slowed HeLa cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and induced cell death. DUE-B extracted from HeLa cells or expressed from baculovirus migrated as a dimer during gel filtration and co-purified with ATPase activity. In contrast to endogenous DUE-B, baculovirus-expressed DUE-B efficiently formed high molecular mass complexes in Xenopus egg and HeLa extracts. In Xenopus extracts, baculovirus-expressed DUE-B inhibited chromatin replication and replication protein A loading in the presence of endogenous DUE-B, suggesting that differential covalent modification of these proteins can alter their effect on replication. Recombinant DUE-B expressed in HeLa cells restored replication activity to egg extracts immunodepleted with anti-DUE-B antibody, suggesting that DUE-B plays an important role in replication in vivo."

In some hyperthermophilic archaea and bacteria, inositol is used for the synthesis of unique solutes accumulated to balance external osmotic pressure and protect intracellular macromolecules from heat and/or salt shock (for reviews of osmolytes in hyperthermophiles see Ref. 5Roberts M.F.

Da Costa M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DIP synthesized by M. igneus is chiral and composed of l-I-1-P units that are synthesized by mIPS (11Chen L. Spiliotis E. Roberts M.F. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3785-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the archaeal mIPS enzymes commit significant cell resources to DIP synthesis, the production of DIP must be tightly regulated. The mIPS gene has been identified in the A. fulgidus genome, and the gene product was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The recombinant A. fulgidus mIPS is an extremely heat-stable tetramer of 44-kDa subunits (much smaller than the eukaryotic homolog that is a tetramer of 60-kDa subunits). The catalytic activity of the enzyme was also shown to be absolutely dependent on divalent metal ions (Zn2+, Mn2+, or Mg2+), and more specifically metals are required for the cyclization step of the reaction (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of this mIPS has recently been solved to 1.9 Å (13Stieglitz K.A. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Stec B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 213-224Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Despite significant differences in protein length and sequence, the general architecture of the archaeal enzyme is similar to that of the eukaryotic mIPS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and bacterial mIPS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (15Norman R.A. McAlister M.S. Murray-Rust J. Movahedzadeh F. Stoker N.G. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 2002; 10: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The archaeal mIPS did not have divalent cations present in the structure, although in two of the four subunits there was one metal ion whose properties were consistent with K+ that interacted with NAD+. A metal ion at this position corresponds to the Zn2+ tentatively identified in structures of M. tuberculosis mIPS (15Norman R.A. McAlister M.S. Murray-Rust J. Movahedzadeh F. Stoker N.G. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 2002; 10: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and more recently in the yeast IPS (16Jin X. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1154-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, electrostatic field calculations carried out for the A. fulgidus mIPS suggested that a second metal ion-binding site might be located close to the site occupied by K+ (13Stieglitz K.A. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Stec B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 213-224Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Modeling of linearized G-6-P into the active site provided some insight into the role of metal ions, but the energy minimum has the linear G-6-P in an extended conformation, one where C-1 and C-6 are quite distant from one another. This modeling (13Stieglitz K.A. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Stec B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 213-224Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), combined with a direct comparison of structures of the archaeal and yeast/bacterial mIPS enzymes, led us to propose a mechanism for the archaeal enzyme that involved the following steps: (i) loss of the inositol C-5 hydroxyl proton to Lys274 and relay of that proton to Asp225 (a step that facilitates oxidation at C5); (ii) oxidation of C-5 by the reactive C-4 of the nicotinamide ring; (iii) enolization at the C-5–C-6 bond where Lys367 acts as a base to withdraw the pro-R proton from C-6 and stabilization of this species by Lys274 and Lys367; (iv) additional stabilization of the negative charge on C-1 from Lys306 and Lys278, which could both contribute to final hydroxyl regeneration at C-1; and (v) reduction of the inosose via a relay system of Asp225 and Lys367. To probe the catalytic roles of the individual residues proposed to directly participate in catalysis, we have mutated eight different active site residues to alanine. These include Asp225, Lys274, Lys278, Lys306, and Lys367, where direct roles in catalysis have been proposed, as well as Asn255, Leu257, and Asp332 that might aid in binding of substrate, cofactor, or divalent metal ion to the enzyme. The placement of these residues in the active site of A. fulgidus mIPS is shown in Fig. 1. Characterization of enzyme activity, the ability to carry out the initial oxidation of G-6-P, and ligand binding for each of these mutants provide definitive roles for several of these residues but also suggest a modified catalytic mechanism for the archaeal mIPS. Construction of Mutants—A. fulgidus mIPS mutants were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Overexpression and purification of the mutants were carried out according to the procedures for the wild type mIPS described previously (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gel was used to assess the purity of the mutants, and absorbance at 280 nm was used to determine the concentration of the mutants (the extinction coefficient at 280 nm is 50210 m-1 cm-1 as calculated from the sequence). All of the mutants were stored at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5. mIPS Specific Activity Assay—Conversion of G-6-P to I-1-P was monitored via 31P (202.3 MHz) NMR spectroscopy (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using a Varian INOVA 500 system with a broadband probe. Assay mixtures (5 mm G-6-P, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 20% D2O) were incubated with mIPS (typically 0.5 μg for wt enzyme) at 90 °C for 15 min, quenched by the addition of 2 mm EDTA (which stops the mIPS reaction), and kept on ice until used for NMR analyses. 31P NMR spectra were acquired with a 10115 Hz sweep width, 32384 datum points, 90° pulse width, 1000 transients, and a 2-s delay time between acquisitions. NADH Production—Wild type or mutant mIPS (20–40 μm) was incubated with 0.4 mm EDTA, 5 mm G-6-P, and 300 μm NAD+ at 90 °C for 30 min (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immediately following the incubation, absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Beckman DU640 spectrometer using a 1-cm cuvette. The absorbance of the protein/ligand mixture at 340 nm was used to identify mutants that produced NADH (the NADH absorption maximum at 340 nm has an extinction coefficient of 6.2 mm-1 cm-1). 31P NMR Assay for Pi and G-6-P Binding—Enzyme-induced line broadening of the 31P NMR resonance (at 202.3 MHz on the same spectrometer) of inorganic phosphate, Pi, was used to monitor its binding to mIPS enzymes. Pi (0.01–10 mm for wild type enzyme) was titrated into a solution containing 50–70 μm enzyme in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% D2O, with 0.4 mm EDTA, 25 °C. 31P spectra were acquired with the number of transients varied so that S/N ≥ 5; the Pi line width was measured as the width at half-height minus the line broadening applied to the free induction decay (typically 2–5 Hz depending on concentration of Pi). Instead of directly examining line width changes for G-6-P and other potential ligands binding to mIPS active site, the effect of the ligands on the weight-averaged Pi resonance in the presence of mIPS was measured. Displacement of Pi by G-6-P sharpens the Pi resonance. 31P spectra were recorded for the mixture of 50–70 μm enzyme, 0.2–0.5 mm Pi, and 0.4 mm EDTA in Tris buffer before and after the addition of G-6-P. The binding of glucose-6-sulfate, mannose-6-phosphate, glucose, glucose-6-sulfate, and glycerol phosphate to mIPS was also evaluated by monitoring the line width of Pi in the presence of the protein and in the absence and presence of added substrate analog. Intrinsic Fluorescence Assay for NAD+Binding—A Jobin y Van Fluoromax 3 spectrofluorimeter was used to monitor the binding of NAD+ to IPS and IPS mutants (∼1 μm in 10 mm EDTA with 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7). Steady state fluorescence measurements were taken at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and 2-mm excitation and emission slit widths. The mIPS emission was scanned from 300 to 400 nm in the absence and presence of 1–20 μm NAD+. Controls, run in parallel, of mIPS where only buffer was added were used to account for small volume changes associated with dilution of the mIPS when the NAD+ was added. The addition of NAD+ caused a decrease in the mIPS intrinsic fluorescence, which was plotted as ΔIfl = Io - I (in arbitrary units). The concentration of NAD+ for 50% of the maximum fluorescence change was used to characterize the apparent KD for NAD+. CD Analysis of Secondary Structure—CD spectra in the far UV were acquired using an AVIV 202 circular dichroism spectrometer. Enzyme samples (∼1 μm) in both 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7, or H2O, pH 7 were analyzed. Wavelength scans were taken from 300 to 190 nm at room temperature with a bandwidth of 1.0 nm and an averaging time of 1 s. Mutant Expression and Stabilization by Pi—The eight mutants expressed were purified to >90% homogeneity as monitored by SDS-PAGE. The secondary structure of these proteins was monitored by the CD spectra in the far UV region. The CD spectra of all proteins in 10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7 were comparable (12.5% α-helix, 40.2% β-sheet, 22.4% β-turn, and 29.4% random coil as obtained by the CD spectra deconvolution software; Neural Networks, version 2.0d). That fact suggested the overall secondary structure content of the proteins under these conditions is not altered by the different mutations. Given the unstructured regions around the active site in the yeast crystal structure in the absence of substrate (14Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is likely that the Pi binding promotes structural stability and correct folding of the A. fulgidus IPS active site region. Older preparations of wild type mIPS often lose activity that correlates with precipitation of the protein. As little as 5 mm potassium phosphate added to precipitated enzyme is able to resolubilize the protein and restore activity. Thus, Pi may aid in limited refolding of the active site regions as well as stabilize a specific folded conformation of the archaeal mIPS. The Pi bound to the purified mIPS was characterized further by 31P NMR spectroscopy. A spectrum of mIPS (3.0 mg/ml) exhibited a single 31P resonance at 3.0 ppm (compared with a chemical shift of 0.2 ppm for Pi at pH 1). The line width of the bound resonance was 13 ± 1 Hz. A comparison of the chemical shift of this bound resonance to a titration curve for Pi taken under the same conditions was consistent with the bound Pi having a -2 charge at the enzyme active site. This is consistent with the crystal structure, which shows a large number of lysine side chains in the phosphate-binding pocket (13Stieglitz K.A. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Stec B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 213-224Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Activity of Mutants—31P NMR spectroscopy provides an excellent way to monitor mIPS activity (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the 31P spectrum, the α and β isomers of G-6-P (substrate) at ∼4.4 ppm are well separated from the I-1-P (product) resonance at 4.0 ppm. The NAD+ cofactor at 1 mm, which is well in excess of what is needed to saturate the wild type enzyme, is characterized by an AB quartet at -9.0 ppm. The increase in I-1-P resonance intensity compared with G-6-P (at a concentration of 5 mm, well above the Km) was used to estimate the mIPS specific activity. Mg2+ (1 mm) present in the assay mixtures was also considerably in excess of the KD of 24 μm established for the recombinant enzyme (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, mIPS exhibited a specific activity of 13.2 μmol min-1 mg-1 at 90 °C. The only mutant that exhibited any conversion of G-6-P to I-1-P was N255A, although the reaction was significantly reduced. The estimated specific activity for N255A was 0.012 μmol min-1 mg-1, 0.09% that of recombinant wild type mIPS. All of the other mutants had specific activities much less than 0.001 μmol min-1 mg-1 because no product was detected over long periods of time and with an increased amount of protein added to assay mixtures. Generation of NADH by mIPS Mutants—Although most of the mutants did not produce I-1-P, it is possible that they could still carry out the initial oxidation of G-6-P and even the cyclization step to form the inosose compound. The addition of EDTA to the assay mix inhibits the A. fulgidus mIPS cyclization of 5-keto-G-6-P to myo-2-inosose-1-phosphate (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), because divalent metal cations are absolutely required for the aldol condensation reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, with wild type protein, stoichiometric amounts of NADH were produced after incubation of protein with excess G-6-P and NAD+ in the presence of EDTA at 90 °C. Although depletion of divalent cations dramatically slows down this first step of the reaction (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this assay can be used to see whether any of the mutants are able to carry out the first step (of the many steps and two intermediates) in I-1-P production. Of the eight mutants, NADH was produced in stoichiometric amounts to protein in only two of the mutants, K306A and D332A. Most of the mutants (e.g. L257A in Fig. 2) could not form NADH under these incubation conditions. The only mutant that exhibited very low catalytic activity, N255A, did not exhibit stoichiometric NADH production, perhaps suggesting that one or both of the ligands were weakly bound under these assay conditions. The ability to form NADH indicates that the involvement of Lys306 and Asp332 in catalysis must occur after the oxidation step. For the other residues, the lack of NADH formation suggests that they must be involved in substrate and cofactor binding in the first part of the reaction, stabilization of linearized G-6-P in the active site, deprotonation of the C-5 hydroxyl group, and/or oxidation of C-5. Detection of G-6-P Substrate and Substrate Analog Binding—The five mutants that were unable to form NADH might, alternatively, be unable to bind substrates (NAD+ and G-6-P). Because Pi bound to mIPS could be detected in the 31P spectrum of the isolated protein, this method could be applicable for detecting G-6-P and other (containing phosphate group) potential ligands binding to the enzyme. However, the 31P spectrum of ∼70 μm wt mIPS mixed with 1 mm G-6-P in the presence of EDTA showed no broadening of the G-6-P phosphorus line width (which was <2 Hz in the buffer alone under these conditions). If the KD for G-6-P is comparable with the Km for this substrate, most of the enzyme would be saturated with G-6-P, leading to a significant fraction of enzyme-bound G-6-P. This observation has three possible explanations: (i) G-6-P does not bind without divalent cations bound to the protein, (ii) the bound G-6-P is not in fast exchange with free G-6-P (a possibility that must be considered because during the reaction the intermediates are tightly bound and not released into solution), and (iii) with residual NAD+ present, 5-keto-G-6-P might be formed and tightly bound to the enzyme so that it is not released into solution. In contrast to what was observed with G-6-P, excess Pi added to the protein with EDTA present was significantly broadened, indicating that both free and bound Pi were in exchange. The Pi bound to the enzyme (∼180 kDa) would have a long correlation time because of the large size of the complex. The 13 Hz line width observed for Pi bound to the purified protein is consistent with Pi bound to a large complex. When additional Pi was titrated into the mIPS (68 μm) solution, the Pi line width increased and then narrowed as the Pi concentration increased further (Fig. 3). A fast exchange analysis (Δνobs - Δνo = (Eo Δb)/(KD + Lo), where (Δνobs - Δνo) was the difference in line width for free Pi at a given concentration and Pi when enzyme was present, Eo was the total enzyme concentration, and Lo was the total Pi concentration) was used to estimate the enzyme bound line width, Δb, and KD for Pi binding to recombinant mIPS. Values of 19 ± 5 Hz and 0.05 ± 0.02 mm for Δb and KD were obtained. That Δb was larger than the 13 Hz line width measured for Pi bound to mIPS in the absence of any added Pi might suggest that the ligand binding is in an intermediate exchange regime. With a concentration of Pi and mIPS that leads to substantial line broadening, we can monitor whether, in the presence of EDTA (and at room temperature), substrate can displace Pi from the mIPS active site. Any solute added that binds to the active site and displaces the Pi should narrow the Pi resonance because the bound solute would reduce the population of enzyme-bound Pi that is averaged into the observed line width. When G-6-P (1 and 2 mm) was added to mIPS (56 μm) and 0.5 mm Pi, the observed Pi line width (Δνobs) narrowed significantly, from an initial value of 7 ± 1 to 3 ± 0.5 Hz with 2 mm G-6-P (Fig. 4). This indicates that G-6-P and Pi bind to the same location in the active site. Thus, Pi binding can be used indirectly to assess whether other substrate-like molecules bind to the mIPS protein as well as to mIPS mutants. Previously, we examined 2-deoxy-glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-sulfate, mannose-6-phosphate, glucose, and glycerol 3-phosphate as potential substrate analogs for the wt A. fulgidus mIPS. Although none of these molecules were substrates (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), they could still bind to the protein as inhibitors. In the presence of A. fulgidus mIPS, the Pi line width decreased significantly only when increasing concentrations (up to 2 mm) of glycerol-3-phosphate were added to the solution (Fig. 4). Hence, this small organophosphate must bind to the mIPS active site to displace Pi. The other phosphate- or sulfate-containing compounds, where the cyclic form is in equilibrium with a linear form, cannot bind tightly to the mIPS, because they do not lead to a narrowing of the Pi resonance. The addition of glucose also failed to decrease the Pi line width. However, this last result must be viewed with some caution because although it could indicate that this moiety does not bind to mIPS, it might also mean that both glucose and Pi can occupy the active site. The line width of Pi in the presence of mIPS could be used to see whether, for mutant mIPS enzymes, (i) Pi can bind to the enzyme and (ii) G-6-P can displace the bound Pi. In the eight mutants generated, binding of Pi (as monitored by an increased line width in the presence of protein) was observed for all but L257A (Table I). The lack of Pi line-broadening in the presence of L257A suggests that its active site is sufficiently perturbed so that it no longer binds Pi tightly (and by inference G-6-P); if the KD increased from 0.05 mm (wild type enzyme) to 2 mm, we would be unlikely to detect any line width changes under the conditions used. As shown in Fig. 5 for several of the mutants, observed Pi line widths reflecting Pi binding to mIPS varied depending on the mutant. This could reflect an altered mobility in the Pi·mIPS complex or an altered KD that affects the off-rate of the complex. For example, the much larger Pi line width in the presence of D332A suggests that removal of this aspartate has increased the affinity of Pi for the active site (possibly by relieving like charge repulsion) where exchange between enzyme-bound and free Pi occurs on an intermediate time scale. In contrast, the smaller line width for Pi in the presence of a comparable concentration of K274A could indicate that Pi does not bind as tightly to this mutant.Table IComparison the 31P line width (Δνobs) of 0.5 mm Pi in the presence mIPS and 0.4 mm EDTA and the decrease in Pi line width upon the addition of 5 mm G-6-PmIPSΔνobsaLine width observed for 0.5 mm Pi with 0.07–0.08 mm mIPSν+G6P–νobsbDecrease in Pi line width upon the addition of 5 mm G-6-P.

Using 0.5 mm Pi and 50–70 μm mIPS to generate a Pi line width broadened by exchange (with Δνobs ranging from 3.6 to 15.6 Hz compared with free Pi of 1 Hz; Table I and Fig. 5), we then added 5 mm G-6-P to see whether the mIPS substrate could bind to the mutant and displace Pi. As shown in Table I, for most of the mutants, G-6-P could displace bound Pi as evidenced by the decreased line width observed for Pi. D225A, K274A, K278A, K306A, and D332A all exhibited narrower Pi line widths when G-6-P was added. However, N255A and K367 showed little change in the line width of the bound Pi when 5 mm G-6-P was added. This indicates that these two mutations have impaired G-6-P binding that is much weaker than Pi binding to the wild type protein. Binding of NAD+—A. fulgidus mIPS activity was shown to be significantly increased when exogenous NAD+ was added to the protein (12Chen L. Zhou C. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12415-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although some of the subunits could have NAD+ bound already, adding NAD+ saturates all the active sites with this cofactor. NAD+ binding to vacant sites decreases the intrinsic fluorescence intensity but not the wavelength of maximum emission of the archaeal mIPS protein. This change in fluorescence intensity can be used to quantify NAD+ binding to the proteins by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence intensity at 334 nm compared with that for the protein where only buffer was added over an NAD+ concentration range of 1–20 μm. There are two tryptophans near the active site of A. fulgidus mIPS (13Stieglitz K.A. Yang H. Roberts M.F. Stec B. Biochemistry. 2004; 44: 213-224Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that could have altered characteristics upon NAD+ binding. From the change in fluorescence intensity as a function of added NAD+, we used the concentration for 50% of the maximum change to define an apparent KD for NAD+ binding (see Fig. 6 for fluorescence changes for several of the mutants). Although the wild type, N255A, L257A, K306A, and K367A were characterized by KD values <10 μm (Table II), D225A, K278A, and D332A showed considerably weaker binding of the cofactor. NAD+ did not induce any changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of K274A in the cofactor concentration range studied. This could indicate a dramatically reduced affinity of the mutant protein for NAD+. However, if mIPS quenching upon NAD+ binding is caused by a conformational change that places Lys274 in the vicinity of one of the Trp residues, removal of this lysine side chain could abolish the sensitivity of the fluorescence to NAD+ binding.Table IIKD values estimated from intrinsic fluorescence changes upon NAD+binding to A. fulgidus mIPS mutantsmIPSKDμmWild type1.0 ± 0.2aThe KD value for wild type protein is very similar to the kinetic Km for this substrate (12)D225A44 ± 16N255A2.8 ± 1.2L257A6.5 ± 3.4K274A—bThere was no change in the fluorescence intensity of this mutant when NAD+ was added to the pr"

Backbone residual dipolar couplings were used to provide long range orientational restraints, and long range (|i - j| ≥ 5 residues) nuclear Overhauser enhancement restraints were derived exclusively from samples in which at least one subunit was 15N/13C/2H/(Val-Leu-Ile)-methyl-protonated. Each subunit consists of a three-helix bundle. Hydrophobic residues lining helix 3 of each subunit are largely responsible for the formation of a parallel coiled-coil trimer. The active site histidines (His-89 from each subunit) are located in three symmetrically placed deep crevices located at the interface of two adjacent subunits (A and C, C and B, and B and A). Partially shielded from bulk solvent, structural modeling suggests that phosphorylated His-89 is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the side chains of His-93 from the same subunit and Gln-91 from the adjacent subunit. Comparison with the x-ray structure of Lactobacillus lactis IIALac reveals some substantial structural differences, particularly in regard to helix 3, which exhibits a 40° kink in IIALacversus a 7° bend in IIAChb. This is associated with the presence of an unusually large (230-Å3) buried hydrophobic cavity at the trimer interface in IIALac that is reduced to only 45 Å3 in IIAChb.

There are four branches of the pathway corresponding to four classes of enzymes II, glucose, mannose, mannitol, and lactose/chitobiose, which bear no sequence similarity to one another and for the most part no structural similarity either (2Postma P.W.

The initial steps of the PTS are common to all branches of the pathway and involve the transfer of a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate to the histidine phosphocarrier protein, HPr, via the intermediary enzyme I. Subsequently the phosphoryl group is transferred to sugar-specific enzymes II. Each enzyme II consists of two cytoplasmic domains, IIA and IIB, and a transmembrane sugar permease IIC, which may or may not be covalently linked. IIA accepts the phosphoryl group from HPr and donates it to IIB; IIC catalyzes the transport of the sugar across the membrane and its phosphorylation by IIB. Structures of many of the individual cytoplasmic components of the PTS have been solved by either NMR (5Wittekind M. Rajgopal P. Cranchini B.R. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Klevit R.E.

Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), despite the absence of any significant sequence identity. No structure, however, has been determined as yet for E. coli IIAChb. The analogous system in Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus comprises the lactose-specific enzymes II (IILac) (30Hays J.B. Simoni R.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 941-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31de Vos W.M. Boerrigter I. van Rooyen R.J. Reiche B. Hengstenberg W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22554-22560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of IIALac from Lactobacillus lactis has been solved and been shown to consist of a symmetric homotrimer (18Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar): each subunit comprises three antiparallel helices; the trimer interface consists of a parallel coiled-coil formed by the C-terminal helix from each subunit; and the trimer interface is partially stabilized by a metal ion coordinated to the side chains of three buried, symmetry-related, aspartate residues, one from each subunit. The crystal structure of IIALac, however, displays a highly unusual feature in the form of a very large (230-Å3), completely buried cavity at the trimer interface that is associated with the presence of a ∼40° kink in helix 3 and accommodates the heavy atom derivative trimethyl lead acetate (18Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). E. coli IIAChb and L. lactis IIALac share 35% sequence identity and 63% amino acid similarity with no gaps or insertions (Fig. 1). In addition, binding of divalent cations to E. coli IIAChb significantly enhances its thermostability relative to the apoform, increasing in the order Mg2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ (33Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has also been reported, on the basis of analytical ultracentrifugation data, that E. coli IIAChb is dimeric in solution (34Keyhani N.O. Rodgers M.E. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in clear contrast to the trimeric state of IIALac (18Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since the three symmetrically related active site histidines in IIALac are located in a crevice formed by the interface of two adjacent subunits (18Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), this result would imply that the surface topology of the active sites and the spatial relationships of side chains within the active sites are very different in IIALac and IIAChb. If true, this would be highly unexpected given the close sequence and functional relationship between IIALac and IIAChb. Intrigued by this discrepancy, we initiated our own investigation of the oligomerization state and three-dimensional solution structure of E. coli IIAChb. Protein Purification and Mutagenesis—The plasmid for wild-type E. coli IIAChb was a kind gift from Dr. Saul Roseman (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The plasmid was propagated in TOP10 cells, and IIAChb was expressed in BL21-Star cells (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. After induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were harvested and microfluidized in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. The protein was purified using a DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange column followed by a preparative Superdex-75 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences). IIAChb was denatured with 6 m guanidine HCl solution (pretreated with Chelex; Bio-Rad) at pH 3 and incubated at 37 °C overnight to remove residual phosphoryl groups on the protein. The pH of the denatured protein solution was then raised by the addition of 1 m Tris·HCl buffer. The protein solution was then dialyzed against either 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) or 10 mm Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 100 μm divalent cation to remove guanidine HCl and refold the protein; seven metal ions, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, were tested individually, yielding seven different samples. Excess metal ions in each metal-loaded protein sample were washed away by extensive buffer exchange in a concentrator, and the protein was further concentrated. The N-terminal deletion mutation (IIAChb-NΔ13) in which the first 13 residues were removed and the subsequent point mutation, IIAChb-NΔ13/D92L, were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers were designed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the two mutants (IIAChb-NΔ13 and IIAChb-NΔ13/D92L) were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). The two mutant proteins were purified using the same procedure described above for the wild-type protein. Typically 50 mg of protein were obtained from a 1-liter culture. The masses of the unlabeled proteins (wild type, NΔ13, and NΔ13/D92L) were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The double mutant NΔ13/D92L is referred to hereafter as IIAChb*. (Ile/Leu/Val)-methyl-protonated and otherwise fully deuterated IIAChb-NΔ13/D92L (abbreviated as ILV-IIAChb*) was expressed based on the protocol described previously (35Goto N.K. Gardner K.H. Mueller G.A. Willis R.C. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were grown in M9 minimal medium prepared in D2 O with [2H7, 13C6]glucose and [15N]NH4Cl as the carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. 80 mg of α-[13C5,3-2H1]ketoisovalerate and 50 mg of α-[13C4,3,3-2H2]ketobutyrate (Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) were added into 1 liter of culture 45 min prior to induction at an A600 nm of ∼0.6. After induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were grown under vigorous shaking for another 4 h before harvesting. Purified in H2O buffer, the protein sample carries protons only at backbone and side-chain amides, γ-methyls of Val residues, and δ-methyl(s) of Ile/Leu residues. Light Scattering—Static light-scattering data were collected using analytical size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in tandem with DAWN EOS light scattering and refractive index detectors (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). 100 μl of 75 μg of protein was applied to the pre-equilibrated Superdex-75 column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature (20 °C). The running buffer consisted of either 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, or 10 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm methionine, and 300 mm NaCl. The protein elution profile was monitored by the refractive index detector, and light-scattering measurements were made every 4 μl for a total elution volume of 20 ml. The data were analyzed using the manufacturer's proprietary software. The translational diffusion coefficient of the IIAChb-NΔ13/D92L double mutant (IIAChb*) was determined from autocorrelation analysis of quasielastically scattered light. Autocorrelation functions were collected on a BI-9000 AT autocorrelator (Brookhaven Instruments, Long Island, NY) at an angle of 90° with sampling times ranging from 0.5 μs to 10 ms. The diffusion coefficient, D20,w, was derived from autocorrelation functions of 10 independent measurements using the software provided by Brookhaven Instruments. The corresponding Stokes radius, Rs, was calculated using the equation Rs = kT/6πηD20,w where η represents the solvent viscosity, T is the absolute temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The predicted translational diffusion coefficient and Stokes radius for the crystal structure of L. lactis IIALac (18Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F.

NMR Data Collection and Analysis—All NMR samples were prepared in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.02% NaN3 and 1 mm methionine. NMR spectra were collected at 30 °C on Bruker DMX500, DMX600, DRX600, DMX750, and DRX800 spectrometers equipped either with x,y,z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes or z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobes. Spectra were processed with the NMRPipe/nmrDraw suite (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfiefer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Backbone φ/Ψ torsion angle restraints were derived from backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts using the program TALOS (43Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Side-chain torsion angle restraints were derived from 3JNCγ, 3JC′Cγ, and 3JCαCδ coupling constants measured using quantitative J correlation experiments (44Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Intersubunit nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) were obtained from a three-dimensional 13C-separated/12C-filtered NOE spectrum collected on a sample comprising a 1:1 mixture of unlabeled IIAChb* and labeled ILV-IIAChb* (42Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To ensure complete mixing of the subunits, the 1:1 mixture of the labeled and unlabeled proteins was denatured in 6 m guanidine HCl and then refolded into the NMR buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.02% NaN3, and 1 mm methionine). Intramolecular long range NOEs were obtained from four-dimensional 13C/15N-separated and 13C/13C-separated NOE spectra collected on the ILV-IIAChb* sample. As methyl-methyl NOE interactions in the unfiltered NOE spectra contain both intra- and intermolecular information, care was taken to ensure that assigned intramolecular NOE cross-peaks did not appear in the three-dimensional 13C-separated/12C-filtered NOE spectrum. NOEs involving backbone amide protons were obtained from a three-dimensional 15N-separated NOE spectrum. Backbone 1DNH, 1DNC′, and 1DCαC′ residual dipolar couplings were obtained from the difference between the 1J scalar couplings measured in dilute liquid crystalline (15 mg/ml phage pf1 (45Clore G.M. Starich M.R. Gronneborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10571-10572Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 46Hansen M.R. Hanson P. Pardi A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 220-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and isotropic (water) media. 1JNH and 1JNC′ couplings were measured from the splittings in three-dimensional HNCO-TROSY-based experiments (47Yang D. Venters R.A. Mueller G.A. Choy W.Y. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 333-343Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and 1JCαC′ couplings were derived from an intensity-modulated HN(CO)CATROSY experiment (48Jaroniec C.P. Ulmer T.S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—NOE-derived interproton distance restraints were classified into distance ranges of 1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.3, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOE cross-peak intensities, respectively. An additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper distance bound of distance restraints involving methyl groups (0.5 Å per methyl group), and 0.2 Å was added to the upper bounds for strong and medium NOE restraints involving amide protons. Nonstereospecifically assigned methyl protons and ambiguous intermolecular NOEs were represented by a (Σr-6)-1/6 sum. The error ranges used for the torsion angle restraints (which are represented by square-well potentials) are ±20° for the backbone φ/Ψ angles within helical regions and ±20° for χ1 and ±30° for χ2 side-chain torsion angles. χ1 restraints for aliphatic side chains that are not in the t rotamer and not experiencing rotamer averaging (3JCγN < 1.0 Hz) were set to 0 ± 80°. Structures were calculated using a well established protocol (49Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M.

The coordinates of the three subunits were restrained to their average positions (after best fitting) by a non-crystallographic symmetry restraint. The non-bonded contacts in the target function were represented by a quartic van der Waals repulsion term (49Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M.

Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2337-2338Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Structure figures were generated with the programs VMD-XPLOR (58Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and Pymol (59DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Reweighted atomic density probability maps were calculated from the structure ensemble as described previously (60Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Modeling of the phosphorylated state was carried out by manually docking a phosphoryl group in the vicinity of the Nϵ-1 atom of the active site His-89 of the restrained regularized mean structure in VMD-XPLOR followed by regularization using Xplor-NIH, keeping all coordinates fixed with the exception of the side chain of His-89 and the phosphoryl group. Engineering a Monodisperse Trimer—1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) correlation spectra of 15N-labeled IIAChb in both the apoform and loaded with diverse divalent cations, including Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, are all broad and poorly dispersed, indicative of chemical exchange between various states. Of these various samples, Ni2+-charged IIAChb displayed the best spectrum (Fig. 2A), suggesting slightly more favorable exchange dynamics, consistent with the prior observation that Ni2+ has the largest effect in enhancing the thermostability of IIAChb (33Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Ni2+-charged IIAChb was then subjected to light-scattering analysis. The intensity of light scattered by a molecule is directly proportional to molar mass; thus static light scattering used in tandem with analytical size exclusion chromatography can measure the average molecular weight of the eluted fractions on the fly. Light-scattering analysis reveals that wildtype Ni2+-IIAChb is a mixture of many species of different molecular masses ranging from 35 to 70 kDa, and there is no predominant species of defined molecular weight in the mixture (Fig. 3A, blue symbols). This result fully accounts for the poor quality of the 1H-15N correlation spectrum of Ni2+-IIAChb (Fig. 2A). Significantly, even at the leading edge of the gel filtration peak where the protein concentration is only ∼140 nm, the molecular mass never falls below 3 times the monomer molecular mass (12,747.7 Da), which is the molecular mass of a trimer. Further, as increasing concentration promotes higher order oligomerization, our light-scattering results are not consistent with the previous report that IIAChb behaves as a dimer even at a concentration of 30 μm or an optical density of 1 at 230 nm (34Keyhani N.O. Rodgers M.E. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To obtain a homogeneous and monodisperse sample suitable for structural studies, we constructed a series of IIAChb variants using rational mutagenesis. We first noted that (a) the N-terminal 11 residues of IIAChb are not present in L. lactis IIALac (Fig. 1), (b) the N-terminal two residues of IIALac have high B-factors in the crystal structure (18Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and (c) the secondary structure of the first 13 residues of IIAChb is predicted to be unstructured (PredictProtein, cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/). On this basis we constructed a deletion mutant of IIAChb lacking the N-terminal 13 residues, IIAChb-NΔ13 (Fig. 1). The light-scattering profile for Ni2+-loaded IIAChb-NΔ13 is also a mixture of different molecular mass species ranging from 35 to 70 kDa (Fig. 3A, green symbols). U"

ERK proteins are activated exclusively by MAPK kinase 1 and 2 phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues located within the conserved TXY MAPK activation motif. Although dual phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues confers full activation of ERK, in vitro studies suggest that a single phosphorylation on either Thr or Tyr may yield partial ERK activity. Previously, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue (Tyr(P) ERK) may be involved in regulating the Golgi complex structure during the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle (Cha, H., and Shapiro, P. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 153, 1355–1368). In the present study, we examined mechanisms for generating Tyr(P) ERK by determining cell cycle-dependent changes in localized phosphatase activity. Using fractionated nuclei-free cell lysates, we find increased serine/threonine phosphatase activity associated with Golgi-enriched membranes in cells synchronized in the late G2/early M phase as compared with G1 phase cells. The addition of phosphatase inhibitors in combination with immunodepletion assays identified this activity to be related to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The increased activity was accounted for by elevated PP2A association with mitotic Golgi membranes as well as increased catalytic activity after normalization of PP2A protein levels in the phosphatase assays. These data indicate that localized changes in PP2A activity may be involved in regulating proteins involved in Golgi disassembly as cells enter mitosis.

Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK proteins regulate cell proliferation by targeting key proteins at specific times during the cell cycle. For example, receptor activation in response to mitogens causes ERK proteins to phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as Elk-1, which promotes the expression of immediate early genes such as Fos and Egr-1, and increase cyclin D1 expression required for G1 to S phase progression (2Hipskind R.A.

Activation of the ERK pathway during G1 phase may also promote the synthesis of proteins required for the S phase by stimulating the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E during G1 phase indirectly through the MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnk1 and Mnk2) (6Waskiewicz A.J.

For example, active ERK localization to the mitotic kinetochore may regulate proteins involved in chromosome segregation during metaphase to anaphase transitions (8Shapiro P.S. Vaisberg E. Hunt A.J. Tolwinski N.S. Whalen A.M. McIntosh J.R. Ahn N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10Zecevic M. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Renzi L. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Gorbsky G.J. Weber M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, MKK1 activated by Raf-1 kinase has been reported to be involved in Golgi complex disassembly during early mitosis (16Acharya U. Mallabiabarrena A. Acharya J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1998; 92: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Colanzi A. Sutterlin C. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Despite ERK1/2 being the only known substrates for MKK1 (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and despite the fact that an ERK-like protein has been shown to associate with the Golgi complex in early mitosis (16Acharya U. Mallabiabarrena A. Acharya J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1998; 92: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a role for ERK1 or ERK2 in regulating mitotic Golgi disassembly has not been clearly established. Because ERK1/2 are the only known substrates to be regulated through phosphorylation by MKK1/2, it is likely that any functions ascribed to MKK1 or MKK2 would require the ERK proteins. In vitro kinase assays show that ERK2 can phosphorylate GRASP55 (Golgi reassembly stacking protein 55) on the same site that gets phosphorylated in cells during mitosis (12Jesch S.A. Lewis T.S. Ahn N.G. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1811-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, ERK2 phosphorylation of GRASP55 during normal progression through mitosis and the physiological consequence of phosphorylation in regulating the Golgi complex have yet to be determined. Although it is recognized that full activation of ERK1/2 requires MKK1/2 phosphorylation of both threonine (Thr183) and tyrosine (Tyr185) (numbering according to a mouse ERK2 sequence; Swissprot P27703) residues within the TEY tripeptide activation site (18Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 19Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), in vitro studies suggest that a single phosphorylation on either the Thr or Tyr residues will confer partial enzyme activity (20Zhou B. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that ERK phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue within the activation site (Tyr(P) ERK) transiently associates with the Golgi complex in the late G2 phase and with Golgi vesicles throughout mitosis (11Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In these studies, an ERK2 (Tyr185 mutated to Phe185) mutant inhibited Golgi fragmentation induced by a constitutively active MKK1 mutant (11Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given that a catalytically inactive ERK2 mutant, which could still be tyrosine-phosphorylated, did not block active MKK1-induced Golgi fragmentation, these results suggested that ERK proteins may affect mitotic events, such as Golgi fragmentation, through mechanisms that are dependent on ERK phosphorylation but independent of ERK activity. These findings are consistent with other reports indicating that ERK2 stimulates the activity of MAPK phosphatase-3 or topoisomerase IIα through kinase-independent mechanisms (21Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 22Shapiro P.S. Whalen A.M. Tolwinski N.S. Wilsbacher J. Froelich-Ammon S.J. Garcia M. Osheroff N. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The generation of a single phosphorylation within the TEY activation site of ERK, such as Tyr(P) ERK during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, could occur by a single phosphorylation of unphosphorylated ERK by MKK1/2 or by threonine dephosphorylation of dually phosphorylated ERK. Given that there is no evidence that MKK1/2 will selectively phosphorylate ERK proteins on only one of the activation sites, an alternative possibility is that dually phosphorylated ERK is targeted by a specific phosphatase activity that results in a single phosphorylation within the TEY sequence. Tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK may be generated through the actions of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is a major regulator of ERK inactivation through threonine dephosphorylation (23Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The possibility that PP2A mediates Tyr(P) ERK generation at the Golgi is further supported by evidence demonstrating a role for PP2A in regulating the phosphorylation of GM130, a protein whose phosphorylation status may regulate Golgi complex disassembly and reassembly as cells enter and exit mitosis, respectively (24Lowe M. Gonatas N.K. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined mechanisms involved in generating the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of ERK during G2/M phase transitions. Using dually phosphorylated ERK2 as a substrate, biochemical assays showed an increase in serine/threonine phosphatase activity associated with Golgi-enriched membranes isolated from cells synchronized in the late G2/early M phase compared with G1 phase cells. Using varying concentrations of the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and fostriecin, our findings suggest that PP2A is the most likely phosphatase that associates with Golgi-enriched membranes isolated from the G2/M phase. These data suggest a potential mechanism for the observed localization of Tyr(P) ERK to the Golgi during mitotic transitions and further suggest that the phosphorylation status of ERK proteins depends on their subcellular location. Cell Culture—HeLa and Ptk1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) purchased from Invitrogen. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S phase boundary by a double thymidine block. Briefly, cells that were ∼50% confluent were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution (Invitrogen), and released into complete medium for 8 h. The cells were then treated a second time for 16 h with 2 mm thymidine to generate cells that are synchronized at the G1/S phase boundary. G1/S phase synchronized cells were then washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution and incubated in complete medium for 7–8 h to obtain late G2/early M phase synchronized cells. We have previously characterized the synchronization of HeLa cells at the G1 or G2/M phase using this methodology by flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) and biochemical analysis (13Roberts E.C.

Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HeLa cells were grown in three 150-mm tissue culture dishes, synchronized in the G1/S or G2/M phases, and harvested with a cell scraper in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (Invitrogen). The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors), and lysed with 20 passages through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to remove the nuclei and loaded into the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube (UltraTube, 13 × 51 mm; Nalgene, Rochester, NY) with an equal volume of 2.3 m sucrose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The sample was overlaid with 1.2 and 0.8 m sucrose solutions (1 ml each), and the sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 73,000 × g for 2.5 h. Following centrifugation, the aliquots (0.4 ml) were taken sequentially from the top of the tube. As an alternative method, the cell lysates were loaded on top of a 5–25% (v/v) glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min, and the fractions were collected sequentially from the top of the gradient (27Jesch S.A. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Aliquots were removed from each fraction and mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the proteins were separated and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, respectively. The remaining samples were immediately frozen at -80 °C for further analysis. Golgi enrichment was assessed by immunoblotting fractions for the Golgi protein markers GM130 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and Golgin-97 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The presence of PP2A was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the 36-kDa PP2A catalytic subunit (Sigma; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; Upstate, Waltham, MA). The protein concentrations were determined using Bradford Reagent (Sigma). For some experiments, the Golgi-enriched fractions were salt-washed as described by Dirac-Svejstrup et al. (28Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Shorter J. Waters M.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, equal aliquots of each fraction were incubated in sucrose buffer (0.2 m sucrose, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors) in the presence or absence of 1 m KCl. The membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and stored at -80 °C until use in phosphatase assays and immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), blocked for 1–2 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-base, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h to overnight. The membranes were washed for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (KPL-Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD; 1 mg/ml stock diluted 1:10,000). Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in either 4% paraformaldehyde or cold methanol (-20 °C) as described previously (11Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with antibodies against Tyr(P) ERK, GM130, and PP2A followed by fluoroscein or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to identify chromosomes. The digital images were captured using a Nikon E800 epifluorescence microscope (Image Systems Inc., Columbia, MD) and processed with IPLab Scientific Imaging Software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). Phosphatase Assays—Approximately 15 μg each of G1/S phase or G2/M phase Golgi fractions were incubated in the presence of dually phosphorylated active ERK2 (1 ng; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij 35) at 30 °C for 1, 15, 30, or 60 min. Aliquots were taken at each time point and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. 10 μm microcystin (Sigma) was used as a control to block serine/threonine phosphatase activity. The phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (0–100 nm; EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and fostriecin (50 nm; LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) were preincubated with Golgi-enriched fractions for 20 min at 4 °C, and in vitro phosphatase assays were performed for 45 min at 30 °C with dually phosphorylated ERK2 as a substrate to assess inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphatase activity. As a control, dually phosphorylated ERK2 was incubated with purified PP2A (Promega) for the times indicated above. The phosphatase reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phosphatase activity was assessed by immunoblotting for the presence of Tyr(P) ERK2 (E-4 antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ppERK2 (M8159 antibody; Sigma), and ERK2 (C-14 antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Densitometry software (NIH Imager; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was used to quantify the amount of Tyr(P) ERK2 immunoreactive signal generated over time. A densitometry calibration curve was generated using bovine serum albumin of known concentrations as the standard, and the intensity of the Tyr(P) ERK2 signal was measured within the linear range and normalized to total ERK2 intensity. PP2A Immunoprecipitations and Immunodepletions—PP2A was immunoprecipitated from 100 μl of the Golgi-enriched fraction by incubation with 20 μg of PP2A monoclonal antibody raised against the catalytic subunit (Upstate) for 2 h on ice. Forty μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline was added to the mixture and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a bidirectional rotator. The mixture was centrifuged to pellet the immune complexes and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. To immunodeplete PP2A, the Golgi-enriched fractions were subjected to two additional rounds of incubation with PP2A antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads. The PP2A immunoprecipitates, PP2A immunodepleted fractions, and appropriate nondepleted PP2A controls were then used in the phosphatase assays and immunoblotting analysis. Enrichment of Golgi Membrane Proteins—Previously, we reported that ERK proteins phosphorylated only on the tyrosine residue within the TEY activation site transiently co-localized with Golgi complex proteins during the G2 phase and mitosis (11Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To assay enzymatic activities that may be involved in generating a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of ERK (Tyr(P) ERK) during this time of the cell cycle, we used gradient fractionation methods to isolate Golgi membrane-enriched fractions from cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary (referred to as the G1 phase) or late G2/early M phase (referred to as the G2/M phase). The first method employed a discontinuous sucrose gradient as previously described (26Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). Immunoblotting for the Golgi proteins GM130 and Golgin-97 was used to identify the fractions that were Golgi-enriched. The highest levels of GM130 and Golgin-97 were evident in fraction 3 of G1/S phase synchronized cells (Fig. 1A), which was in agreement with previous reports using this method to enrich Golgi membranes (26Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the G2/M phase synchronized cells, the GM130 and Golgin-97 expression levels were enriched in fraction 3 (Fig. 1B). However, GM130 and Golgin-97 staining in G2/M phase cells also showed a somewhat more diffuse staining pattern across a broader range of the gradient (Fig. 1B). The diffuse association of these Golgi proteins with multiple gradient fractions is likely due to changes that are beginning to occur in the Golgi membrane density during preparation for mitosis as previously suggested (27Jesch S.A. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, an alternative isolation method was employed where Golgi membranes from the G2/M phase synchronized cells were enriched using a 5–25% continuous glycerol gradient as previously described (27Jesch S.A. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for GM130 and Golgin-97 in the G2/M phase-specific Golgi-enriched fraction showed the highest expression levels in fraction 2 (Fig. 1C), which is in agreement with previous studies using this methodology (27Jesch S.A. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A high level of Golgi protein expression was observed at the bottom of the gradient (fraction 7, Fig. 1C), which was previously attributed to intact Golgi membranes from interphase cells (27Jesch S.A. Linstedt A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because these cells were harvested at a time corresponding to the late G2 phase, when tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK is first observed (11Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and early mitosis, it is expected that some cells contain Golgi membranes that are still largely intact. Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content following staining with propidium iodide confirmed that the cells were highly synchronized in the G1 (2 n DNA content) or the G2/M (4 n DNA content) phase (Fig. 1D). The fractions containing low or high levels of Golgi proteins from either the sucrose or glycerol gradient method for enriching Golgi membranes from both G1 and G2/M synchronized cells were used in subsequent biochemical assays. Increased Serine/Threonine Phosphatase Activity on Golgi Membranes Isolated during G2/M Phase—We next tested whether cell cycle-dependent changes in serine/threonine phosphatase activity could be responsible for accumulation of Tyr(P) ERK on the Golgi complex during the G2/M phase (11Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Samples containing equal amounts of total protein from Golgi-enriched fraction 3 from G1 phase synchronized cells or fraction 2 from G2/M phase synchronized cells (Fig. 1, A and C) were incubated with purified ERK2 that was dually phosphorylated on the threonine and tyrosine activation site residues (ppERK2). ERK2 phosphorylation status was determined over time by immunoblotting with phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies specific for the monophosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr(P) ERK2) or dually phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine residues (ppERK2) within the TEY activation site. As shown in Fig. 2A, significant Tyr(P) ERK2 immunoreactivity was observed over time after ppERK2 was incubated with Golgi-enriched fractions from G2/M phase as compared with G1 phase synchronized cells. Correspondingly, the level of ppERK2 immunoreactivity decreased following incubation with Golgi-enriched membranes from the G2/M phase (Fig. 2A). Similarly, incubations of ppERK2 with fraction 3 from G2/M-synchronized Golgi-enriched membranes isolated by the sucrose gradient (Fig. 1B) also showed enhanced Tyr(P) ERK2 reactivity compared with fraction 3 of G1 phase synchronized cells (data not shown). Given that Tyr(P) ERK2 immunoreactivity was blocked when microcystin was present in the phosphatase reaction (Fig. 2A), these data indicate that serine/threonine phosphatase activity associated with Golgi membranes is increased during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and can dephosphorylate the threonine residue on ppERK2. We next determined whether the increased phosphatase activity associated with Golgi membranes toward ppERK2 was due to increases in the total cellular phosphatase activity at this time of the cell cycle. In these experiments, whole cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein generated from G1 or G2/M phase cells were incubated with ppERK2 for varying times, and ERK2 phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting. As shown, the increase in Tyr(P) ERK2 immunoreactivity over time and the corresponding decrease in ppERK2 were similar in both G1 and G2/M synchronized cells (Fig. 2B). These data indicated that the total serine/threonine phosphatase activity in the cell does not change significantly during the cell cycle, which is in agreement with previous studies (29Ruediger R. Van Wart Hood J.E. Mumby M. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4282-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, our findings suggested that localized serine/threonine phosphatase activity associated with the Golgi membranes is elevated during the G2/M phase as compared with the G1 phase. These data are also consistent with a previous study indicating that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A is involved in regulating Golgi complex structure during mitosis (24Lowe M. Gonatas N.K. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We next tested the possibility that sucrose or glycerol used in the fractionation methods could cause an artificial inhibition of phosphatase activity in the G1 phase fraction or phosphatase activation in the G2/M phase fraction. Glycerol (5% final concentration in the G2/M phase fractions) was added to the G1 phase fraction containing high levels of Golgi proteins. Similarly, sucrose (final concentration, 200 mm in the G1 fractions) was added to the G2/M phase fraction containing the highest level of Golgi proteins. The final concentrations for sucrose and glycerol were the same used in the fractionation and phosphatase experiments shown in Figs. 1 (A and C) and 2A. The adjusted fractions were incubated with ppERK2 for 60 min, and ERK2 phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting. The addition of glycerol or sucrose to the fractions had no effect on the Tyr(P) ERK2 immunoreactivity observed after incubating ppERK2 with Golgi fractions isolated from G1 or G2/M phase cells (Fig. 2C). The phosphorylation and activity of ERK proteins is also regulated by tyrosine phosphatases (30Zhou B. Wang Z.X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 31"
