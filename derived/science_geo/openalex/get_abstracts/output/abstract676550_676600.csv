https://openalex.org/W3173881169,"Brazil has been heavily affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we used data on reported total deaths in 2020 and in January-April 2021 to measure and compare the death toll across states. We estimate a decline in 2020 life expectancy at birth (e0) of 1.3 years, a mortality level not seen since 2014. The reduction in life expectancy at age 65 (e65) in 2020 was 0.9 years, setting Brazil back to 2012 levels. The decline was larger for males, widening by 9.1% the female-male gap in e0. Among states, Amazonas lost 60.4% of the improvements in e0 since 2000. In the first 4 months of 2021, COVID-19 deaths represented 107% of the total 2020 figures. Assuming that death rates would have been equal to 2019 all-cause rates in the absence of COVID-19, COVID-19 deaths in 2021 have already reduced e0 in 2021 by 1.8 years, which is slightly larger than the reduction estimated for 2020 under similar assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W3176149352,"Background Social distancing have been widely used to mitigate community spread of SARS-CoV-2. We sought to quantify the impact of COVID-19 social distancing policies across 27 European counties in spring 2020 on population mobility and the subsequent trajectory of disease. Methods We obtained data on national social distancing policies from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and aggregated and anonymized mobility data from Google. We used a pre-post comparison and two linear mixed-effects models to first assess the relationship between implementation of national policies and observed changes in mobility, and then to assess the relationship between changes in mobility and rates of COVID-19 infections in subsequent weeks. Results Compared to a pre-COVID baseline, Spain saw the largest decrease in aggregate population mobility (~70%), as measured by the time spent away from residence, while Sweden saw the smallest decrease (~20%). The largest declines in mobility were associated with mandatory stay-at-home orders, followed by mandatory workplace closures, school closures, and non-mandatory workplace closures. While mandatory shelter-in-place orders were associated with 16.7% less mobility (95% CI: -23.7% to -9.7%), non-mandatory orders were only associated with an 8.4% decrease (95% CI: -14.9% to -1.8%). Large-gathering bans were associated with the smallest change in mobility compared with other policy types. Changes in mobility were in turn associated with changes in COVID-19 case growth. For example, a 10% decrease in time spent away from places of residence was associated with 11.8% (95% CI: 3.8%, 19.1%) fewer new COVID-19 cases. Discussion This comprehensive evaluation across Europe suggests that mandatory stay-at-home orders and workplace closures had the largest impacts on population mobility and subsequent COVID-19 cases at the onset of the pandemic. With a better understanding of policies’ relative performance, countries can more effectively invest in, and target, early nonpharmacological interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3176969719,"Frequent testing of large population groups combined with contact tracing and isolation measures will be crucial for containing Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreaks. Here we present LAMP-Seq, a modified, highly scalable reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method. Unpurified biosamples are barcoded and amplified in a single heat step, and pooled products are analyzed en masse by sequencing. Using commercial reagents, LAMP-Seq has a limit of detection of ~2.2 molecules per µl at 95% confidence and near-perfect specificity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 given its sequence readout. Clinical validation of an open-source protocol with 676 swab samples, 98 of which were deemed positive by standard RT-qPCR, demonstrated 100% sensitivity in individuals with cycle threshold values of up to 33 and a specificity of 99.7%, at a very low material cost. With a time-to-result of fewer than 24 h, low cost and little new infrastructure requirement, LAMP-Seq can be readily deployed for frequent testing as part of an integrated public health surveillance program."
https://openalex.org/W3174976051,"The study is focused on impact of manure application, rice varieties and water management on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from paddy rice soil in pot experiment. The objectives of this study were a) to assess the effect of different types of manure amendments and rice varieties on greenhouse gas emissions and b) to determine the optimum manure application rate to increase rice yield while mitigating GHG emissions under alternate wetting and drying irrigation in paddy rice production. The first pot experiment was conducted at the Department of Agronomy, Yezin Agricultural University, Myanmar, in the wet season from June to October 2016. Two different organic manures (compost and cow dung) and control (no manure), and two rice varieties; Manawthukha (135 days) and IR-50 (115 days), were tested. The results showed that cumulative CH4 emission from Manawthukha (1.084 g CH4 kg-1 soil) was significantly higher than that from IR-50 (0.683 g CH4 kg-1 soil) (P<0.0046) with yield increase (P<0.0164) because of the longer growth duration of the former. In contrast, higher cumulative nitrous oxide emissions were found for IR-50 (2.644 mg N2O kg-1 soil) than for Manawthukha (2.585 mg N2O kg-1 soil). However, IR-50 showed less global warming potential (GWP) than Manawthukha (P<0.0050). Although not significant, the numerically lowest CH4 and N2O emissions were observed in the cow dung manure treatment (0.808 g CH4 kg-1 soil, 2.135 mg N2O kg-1 soil) compared to those of the control and compost. To determine the effect of water management and organic manures on greenhouse gas emissions, second pot experiments were conducted in Madaya township during the dry and wet seasons from February to October 2017. Two water management practices {continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD)} and four cow dung manure rates {(1) 0 (2) 2.5 t ha-1 (3) 5 t ha-1 (4) 7.5 t ha-1} were tested. The different cow dung manure rates did not significantly affect grain yield or greenhouse gas emissions in this experiment. Across the manure treatments, AWD irrigation significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 70% during the dry season and 66% during the wet season. Although a relative increase in N2O emissions under AWD was observed in both rice seasons, the global warming potential was significantly reduced in AWD compared to CF in both seasons (P<0.0002, P<0.0000) according to reduced emission in CH4. Therefore, AWD is the effective mitigation practice for reducing GWP without compromising rice yield while manure amendment had no significant effect on GHG emission from paddy rice field. Besides, AWD saved water about 10% in dry season and 19% in wet season."
https://openalex.org/W3176574630,"Studies are needed to identify useful biomarkers to assess the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Here, we examine the levels of various plasma species of the SARS-CoV-2 host receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in patients at different phases of the infection. Human plasma ACE2 species were characterized by immunoprecipitation and western blotting employing antibodies against the ectodomain and the C-terminal domain, using a recombinant human ACE2 protein as control. In addition, changes in the cleaved and full-length ACE2 species were also examined in serum samples derived from humanized K18-hACE2 mice challenged with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 immunoreactivity was present in human plasma as several molecular mass species that probably comprise truncated (70 and 75 kDa) and full-length forms (95, 100, 130, and 170 kDa). COVID-19 patients in the acute phase of infection (n = 46) had significantly decreased levels of ACE2 full-length species, while a truncated 70-kDa form was marginally higher compared with non-disease controls (n = 26). Levels of ACE2 full-length species were in the normal range in patients after a recovery period with an interval of 58-70 days (n = 29), while the 70-kDa species decreased. Levels of the truncated ACE2 species served to discriminate between individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 and those infected with influenza A virus (n = 17). In conclusion, specific plasma ACE2 species are altered in patients with COVID-19 and these changes normalize during the recovery phase. Alterations in ACE2 species following SARS-CoV-2 infection warrant further investigation regarding their potential usefulness as biomarkers for the disease process and to asses efficacy during vaccination."

We assessed model performance using various measures of accuracy including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in an independent ""validation"" sample.During the first trimester, logistic regression identified 13 variables associated with preterm birth, of which the strongest predictors were diabetes (Type I: adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.23-5.42; Type II: AOR: 2.68; 95% CI: 2.05-3.46) and abnormal pregnancy-associated plasma protein A concentration (AOR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.80-2.30). During the first trimester, the maximum AUC was 60% (95% CI: 58-62%) with artificial neural networks in the validation sample. During the second trimester, 17 variables were significantly associated with preterm birth, among which complications during pregnancy had the highest AOR (13.03; 95% CI: 12.21-13.90). During the second trimester, the AUC increased to 65% (95% CI: 63-66%) with artificial neural networks in the validation sample. Including complications during the pregnancy yielded an AUC of 80% (95% CI: 79-81%) with artificial neural networks. All models yielded 94-97% negative predictive values for spontaneous PTB during the first and second trimesters.Although artificial neural networks provided slightly higher AUC than logistic regression, prediction of preterm birth in the first trimester remained elusive. However, including data from the second trimester improved prediction to a moderate level by both logistic regression and machine learning approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3175494585,"In low-income nations, high-risk fertility behavior is a prevalent public health concern that can be ascribed to unmet family planning needs, child marriage, and a weak health system. As a result, this study aimed to determine the factors that influence high-risk fertility behavior and its impact on child stunting and anemia.This study relied on secondary data sources from recent demography and health surveys of nine east African countries. Relevant data were extracted from Kids Record (KR) files and appended for the final analysis; 31,873 mother-child pairs were included in the final analysis. The mixed-effect logistic regression model (fixed and random effects) was used to describe the determinants of high-risk fertility behavior (HRFB) and its correlation with child stunting and anemia.According to the pooled study about 57.6% (95% CI: 57.7 to 58.2) of women had at least one high-risk fertility behavior, with major disparities found across countries and women's residences. Women who lived in rural areas, had healthcare access challenges, had a history of abortion, lived in better socio-economic conditions, and had antenatal care follow-up were more likely to engage in high-risk fertility practices. Consequently, Young maternal age at first birth (<18), narrow birth intervals, and high birth orders were HRFBs associated with an increased occurrences of child stunting and anemia.This study revealed that the magnitude of high-risk fertility behavior was higher in east Africa region. The finding of this study underscores that interventions focused on health education and behavioral change of women, and improvement of maternal healthcare access would be helpful to avert risky fertility behaviors. In brief, encouraging contraceptive utilization and creating awareness about birth spacing among reproductive-age women would be more helpful. Meanwhile, frequent nutritional screening and early intervention of children born from women who had high-risk fertility characteristics are mandatory to reduce the burden of chronic malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3176695170,"The purpose was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on biopsychosocial health, daily activities, and quality of life among children and adults with neuromuscular diseases, and to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 infection and the impact of this in patients with neuromuscular diseases. The study was a national questionnaire survey. Responses were obtained from 811 adults (29%) and 67 parents of children (27%) with neuromuscular diseases. Many patients reported decreased health or physical functioning, and changes in access to physiotherapy or healthcare due to the pandemic. Participants generally perceived themselves or their child to be at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19, but only 15 patients had suffered from COVID-19 and experienced mild flu-like symptoms. 25.3% of adults and 46.6% of parents experienced anxiety. 20.4% of adults and 27.6% of parents experienced symptoms of depression. In general, the pandemic contributed to anxiety, a depressed mood as well as to fewer leisure activities, less social contact, isolation from work/school and a reduced quality of life, in particular for patients who perceived themselves to be at high risk of severe illness. The results demonstrate that the pandemic has had a negative impact on biopsychosocial health and quality of life of patients with neuromuscular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3173394489,"To obtain a successful pregnancy, the establishment of maternal-fetal tolerance and successful placentation are required to be established. Disruption of this immune balance and/or inadequate placental perfusion is believed to be associated with a lot of pregnancy-related complications, such as recurrent spontaneous abortion, pre-eclampsia, and fetal intrauterine growth restriction. Extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) have the unique ability to instruct decidual immune cells (DICs) to develop a regulatory phenotype for fetal tolerance. Utilizing immortalized human first trimester extravillous trophoblast cells and primary EVTs, we found that DICs promote EVT function and placental development. We have previously shown that checkpoints T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) are important for DIC function. In the present study, we showed that blockade of Tim-3 and CTLA-4 pathways leaded to the abnormal DICs-EVTs interaction, poor placental development, and increased fetal loss. Treatment with IL-4 and IL-10 could rescue the adverse effects of targeting Tim-3 and CTLA-4 on the pregnancy outcome. Hence, the reproductive safety must be a criterion considered in the assessment of immuno-therapeutic agents. In addition, IL-4 and IL-10 may represent novel therapeutic strategies to prevent pregnancy loss induced by checkpoint inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W3175639962,"Objective To estimate the association between COVID-19 and Emergency Department (ED) psychiatric presentations, including suicidal ideation. Methods Using an interrupted time series design, we analyzed psychiatric presentations using electronic health record data in an academic medical center ED between 2018 and 2020. We used regression models to assess the association between the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and certain psychiatric presentations. The period February 26–March 6, 2020 was used to define patterns in psychiatric presentations before and after the coronavirus outbreak. Results We found a 36.2% decrease (unadjusted) in ED psychiatric consults following the coronavirus outbreak, as compared to the previous year. After accounting for underlying trends, our results estimate significant differential change associated with suicidal ideation and substance use disorder (SUD) presentations following the outbreak. Specifically, we noted a significant differential increase in presentations with suicidal ideation six weeks after the outbreak (36.4 percentage points change; 95% CI: 5.3, 67.6). For presentations with SUD, we found a differential increase in the COVID-19 time series relative to the comparison time series at all post-outbreak time points and this differential increase was significant three weeks (32.8 percentage points; 95% CI: 4.0, 61.6) following the outbreak. Our results estimate no differential changes significant at the P value &lt; 0.05 level associated with affective disorder or psychotic disorder presentations in the COVID-19 time series relative to the comparator time series. Conclusions The COVID-19 outbreak in Boston was associated with significant differential increases in ED presentations with suicidal ideation and SUD."
https://openalex.org/W3175285767,"GSTP1 is a member of the Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) family silenced by CpG island DNA hypermethylation in 90–95% of prostate cancers. However, prostate cancers expressing GSTP1 have not been well characterized. We used immunohistochemistry against GSTP1 to examine 1673 primary prostatic adenocarcinomas on tissue microarrays (TMAs) with redundant sampling from the index tumor from prostatectomies. GSTP1 protein was positive in at least one TMA core in 7.7% of cases and in all TMA cores in 4.4% of cases. The percentage of adenocarcinomas from Black patients who had any GSTP1 positive TMA cores was 14.9%, which was 2.5 times higher than the percentage from White patients (5.9%; P &lt; 0.001). Further, the percentages of tumors from Black patients who had all TMA spots positive for GSTP1 (9.5%) was 3-fold higher than the percentage from White patients (3.2%; P&lt;0.001). In terms of association with other molecular alterations, GSTP1 positivity was enriched in ERG positive cancers among Black men. By in situ hybridization, GSTP1 mRNA expression was concordant with protein staining, supporting the lack of silencing of at least some GSTP1 alleles in GSTP1-positive tumor cells. This is the first report revealing that GSTP1-positive prostate cancers are substantially over-represented among prostate cancers from Black compared to White men. This observation should prompt additional studies to determine whether GSTP1 positive cases represent a distinct molecular subtype of prostate cancer and whether GSTP1 expression could provide a biological underpinning for the observed disparate outcomes for Black men."
https://openalex.org/W3176753452,"The rapid development of urbanization has had a dramatic impact on the economy, society and environment in China. In this context, the coordination relationship between population urbanization and land urbanization is essential for achieving sustainable urbanization. Based on the statistical data from 2007–2017 in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YEB), this paper established the multi-dimensional coordination evaluation (MDCE) model by using the speed coordination evaluation (SCE) model, the level consistency evaluation (LCE) model, the entropy method and the space matching evaluation (SME) model to evaluate the coordination relationship between population urbanization and land urbanization from the speed-level-space perspective. The results showed that from 2007 to 2017: 1) the development speed of population urbanization and land urbanization in the YEB were more and more coordinated, and the speed of population urbanization lagged behind that of land urbanization. In addition, the overall development speed of the 11 provinces declined, and most of them were characterized by excessive development of land urbanization. 2) the development level of population urbanization and land urbanization in the YEB were all high, but the development level of population urbanization was lower than that of land urbanization. Further, the development level of the 11 provinces remained stable and high, and continuously improved. 3) the space matching of population urbanization and land urbanization in the YEB had a high degree of coordination, and the space matching degree of population urbanization was higher than that of land urbanization. Moreover, the space matching of most provinces in the region had declined, but the change was small. Finally, this paper proposes the policy recommendations on the coordinated development of population and land urbanization at the institutional, market and management levels to achieve coordinated and sustainable urbanization."
https://openalex.org/W3177220729,"Tuberculosis and human immune deficiency virus co-infections remained the most common cause of child mortality for the last ten years. Globally, 1.2 million cases of tuberculosis occurred in patients living with HIV/AIDS, of which 1.0 million cases occurred in children. The public health impact of tuberculosis and human immune deficiency virus co-infection among children is high in developing countries and Sub-Saharan Africa accompanied three fourth of the global burden. However, there are limited studies that assess the incidence and predictors of mortality among tuberculosis and human immune deficiency virus co-infected children in Ethiopia.A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted at Public hospitals in Southern Ethiopia with a total of 286 randomly selected records of ART enrolled children from 1st January 2009 to 31stDecember 2018. Data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and exported to STATA version 14 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to identify the predictors of mortality. Variables that had a p-value<0.05 at 95%CI in the multivariable cox proportional hazard model were considered as statistically significant.A total of 274 tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infected children's records were reviewed. The incidence of mortality among tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infected children was 17.15 per 100 children. The overall incidence density rate of mortality was 2.97(95%CI: 2.2, 3.9) per 100 child year of observation and being anemic (AHR: 2.6; 95%CI: 1.28, 5.21), not initiating isoniazid prophylaxis therapy (AHR: 2.8; 95%CI: 1.44, 5.48), developing extrapulmonary tuberculosis (AHR: 5.7; 95%CI: 2.67, 12.56) and non-adherence (AHR: 5.2; 95%CI: 2.19, 12.39) were independent predictors of mortality.Mortality rate was high among TB/HIV co-infected children at the public hospitals in Southern Ethiopia. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, anemia, non-adherence, and isoniazid preventive therapy use were statistically significant predictors of mortality among TB/HIV co-infected children. Therefore, extra pulmonary tuberculosis, and anemia should be closely monitored to increase their adherence as well as they should be provided with isoniazid preventive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3173180108,"Bee venom (BV) is the most valuable product harvested from honeybees ($30 - $300 USD per gram) but marginally produced in apiculture. Though widely studied and used in alternative medicine, recent efforts in BV research have focused on its therapeutic and cosmetic applications, for the treatment of degenerative and infectious diseases. The protein and peptide composition of BV is integral to its bioactivity, yet little research has investigated the ecological factors influencing the qualitative and quantitative variations in the BV composition. Bee venom from Apis mellifera ligustica (Apidae), collected over one flowering season of Corymbia calophylla (Myrtaceae; marri) was characterized to test if the protein composition and amount of BV variation between sites is influenced by i) ecological factors (temperature, relative humidity, flowering index and stage, nectar production); ii) management (nutritional supply and movement of hives); and/or iii) behavioural factors. BV samples from 25 hives across a 200 km-latitudinal range in Southwestern Australia were collected using stimulatory devices. We studied the protein composition of BV by mass spectrometry, using a bottom-up proteomics approach. Peptide identification utilised sequence homology to the A. mellifera reference genome, assembling a BV peptide profile representative of 99 proteins, including a number of previously uncharacterised BV proteins. Among ecological factors, BV weight and protein diversity varied by temperature and marri flowering stage but not by index, this latter suggesting that inter and intra-year flowering index should be further explored to better appreciate this influence. Site influenced BV protein diversity and weight difference in two sites. Bee behavioural response to the stimulator device impacted both the protein profile and weight, whereas management factors did not. Continued research using a combination of proteomics, and bio-ecological approaches is recommended to further understand causes of BV variation in order to standardise and improve the harvest practice and product quality attributes."

The objective was to analyse specific-mortality in a cohort of individuals invited to a CRC screening program according to type of CRC diagnosis (screen-detected cancers, interval cancers, and cancers among the non-uptake group).Retrospective cohort that included invitees aged 50-69 years of a CRC screening program (target population of 85,000 people) in Catalonia (Spain) from 2000-2015 with mortality follow-up until 2020. A screen-detected CRC was a cancer diagnosed after a positive faecal occult blood test (guaiac or immunochemical); an interval cancer was a cancer diagnosed after a negative test result and before the next invitation to the program (≤24 months); a non-uptake cancer was a cancer in subjects who declined screening.A total of 624 people were diagnosed with CRC (n = 265 screen-detected, n = 103 interval cancers, n = 256 non-uptake). In the multivariate analysis, we observed a 74% increase in mortality rate in the group with interval CRC compared to screen-detected CRC adjusted for age, sex, location and stage (HR: 1.74%, 95% CI:1.08-2.82, P = 0.02). These differences were found even when we restricted for advanced-cancers participants. In the stratified analysis for type of faecal occult blood test, a lower mortality rate was only observed among FIT screen-detected CRCs.CRC screening with the FIT was associated with a significant reduction in CRC mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3175555524,"Since 1994, IUCN Red List assessments apply globally acknowledged standards to assess species distribution, abundance and trends. The extinction risk of a species has a major impact on conservation science and international funding mechanisms. Great ape species are listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered. Their populations are often assessed using their unique habit of constructing sleeping platforms, called nests. As nests rather than apes are counted, it is necessary to know the time it takes for nests to disappear to convert nest counts into ape numbers. However, nest decomposition is highly variable across sites and time and the factors involved are poorly understood. Here, we used 1,511 bonobo (Pan paniscus) nests and 15 years of climatic data (2003-2018) from the research site LuiKotale, Democratic Republic of the Congo, to investigate the effects of climate change and behavioural factors on nest decay time, using a Bayesian gamma survival model. We also tested the logistic regression method, a recommended time-efficient option for estimating nest decay time. Our climatic data showed a decreasing trend in precipitation across the 15 years of study. We found bonobo nests to have longer decay times in recent years. While the number of storms was the main factor driving nest decay time, nest construction type and tree species used were also important. We also found evidence for bonobo nesting behaviour being adapted to climatic conditions, namely strengthening the nest structure in response to unpredictable, harsh precipitation. By highlighting methodological caveats, we show that logistic regression is effective in estimating nest decay time under certain conditions. Our study reveals the impact of climate change on nest decay time in a tropical remote area. Failure to account for these changes would invalidate biomonitoring estimates of global significance, and subsequently jeopardize the conservation of great apes in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W3175938020,"The Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are underwater mountain chains that stretch across 2,900 km in the southeastern Pacific and are recognized for their high biodiversity value and unique ecological characteristics. Explorations of deep-water ecosystems have been limited in this region, and elsewhere globally. To characterize community composition of mesophotic and deep-sea demersal fauna at seamounts in the region, we conducted expeditions to Rapa Nui (RN) and Salas y Gómez (SyG) islands in 2011 and Desventuradas Islands in 2013. Remote autonomous baited-cameras were used to conduct stationary video surveys between 150-1,850 m at RN/SyG (N = 20) and 75-2,363 m at Desventuradas (N = 27). Individual organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and relative abundance was quantified with the maximum number of individuals per frame. Deployments were attributed with associated environmental variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, chlorophyll-a, seamount age, and bathymetric position index [BPI]). We identified 55 unique invertebrate taxa and 66 unique fish taxa. Faunal community structure was highly dissimilar between and within subregions both for invertebrate (p < 0.001) and fish taxa (p = 0.022). For fishes, dogfish sharks (Squalidae) accounted for the greatest dissimilarity between subregions (18.27%), with mean abundances of 2.26 ± 2.49 at Desventuradas, an order of magnitude greater than at RN/SyG (0.21 ± 0.54). Depth, seamount age, broad-scale BPI, and nitrate explained most of the variation in both invertebrate (R2 = 0.475) and fish (R2 = 0.419) assemblages. Slightly more than half the deployments at Desventuradas (N = 14) recorded vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa such as corals and sponges. Our study supports mounting evidence that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are areas of high biodiversity and high conservation value. While Chile and Peru have recently established or proposed marine protected areas in this region, the majority of these ridges lie outside of national jurisdictions and are under threat from overfishing, plastic pollution, climate change, and potential deep-sea mining. Given its intrinsic value, this region should be comprehensively protected using the best available conservation measures to ensure that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges remain a globally unique biodiversity hotspot."
https://openalex.org/W3177250535,"Purpose The cumulative effect of medication inhibiting acetylcholine activity—also known as anticholinergic burden (AB)—can lead to functional and cognitive decline, falls, and death. Given that studies on the population prevalence of AB are rare, we aimed to describe it in a large and unselected population sample. Methods Using the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD) with claims data from ~20% of the German population we analyzed outpatient drug dispensations in 2016. Based on the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale, we classified persons into four categories and determined the cumulative AB as continuous variable. Results Among 16,470,946 persons (54% female), the prevalence of clinically relevant AB (ACB≥3) was 10% (women) and 7% (men). Below age 40 it was highest in persons ≤18 years (6% both sexes). At older ages (50–59 vs. 90–99 years), prevalence of ACB≥3 increased from 7% to 26% (men) and from 10% to 32% (women). Medication classes contributing to the cumulative AB differed by age: antihistamines, antibiotics, glucocorticoids (≤19 years), antidepressants (20–49 years), antidepressants, cardiovascular medication, antidiabetics (50–64 years), and additionally medication for urinary incontinence/overactive bladder (≥65 years). Medication dispensed by general physicians contributed most to the cumulative AB. Conclusion Although a clinically relevant AB is particularly common in older persons, prevalence in younger age groups was up to 7%. Given the risks associated with AB in older persons, targeted interventions at the prescriber level are needed. Furthermore, risks associated with AB in younger persons should be explored."
https://openalex.org/W3174874085,"To interact with real-world objects, any effective visual system must jointly code the unique features defining each object. Despite decades of neuroscience research, we still lack a firm grasp on how the primate brain binds visual features. Here we apply a novel network-based stimulus-rich representational similarity approach to study color and form binding in five convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with varying architecture, depth, and presence/absence of recurrent processing. All CNNs showed near-orthogonal color and form processing in early layers, but increasingly interactive feature coding in higher layers, with this effect being much stronger for networks trained for object classification than untrained networks. These results characterize for the first time how multiple basic visual features are coded together in CNNs. The approach developed here can be easily implemented to characterize whether a similar coding scheme may serve as a viable solution to the binding problem in the primate brain."

The objective of this study is to describe the validation of the COVID Radar. Methods COVID Radar users are asked to complete a daily questionnaire consisting of 20 questions assessing their symptoms, social distancing behavior, and COVID-19 status. We describe the internal and external validation of symptoms, behavior, and both user-reported COVID-19 status and state-reported COVID-19 case numbers. Results Since April 2nd, 2020, over 6 million observations from over 250,000 users have been collected using the COVID Radar app. Almost 2,000 users reported having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Amongst users testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the proportion of observations reporting symptoms was higher than that of the cohort as a whole in the week prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Likewise, users who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 showed above average risk social-distancing behavior. Per-capita user-reported SARS-CoV-2 positive tests closely matched government-reported per-capita case counts in provinces with high user engagement. Discussion The COVID Radar app allows voluntarily self-reporting of COVID-19 related symptoms and social distancing behaviors. Symptoms and risk behavior increase prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and user-reported case counts match closely with nationally-reported case counts in regions with high user engagement. These results suggest the COVID Radar may be a valid instrument for future surveillance and potential predictive analytics to identify emerging hotspots."
https://openalex.org/W3177282739,"We analyze the possible predictive variables for Adverse Events (AEs) during sedation for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.We consider 23,788 GI endoscopies under sedation on adults between 2012 and 2019. A Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression Mixture (ZIPRM) model for count data with concomitant variables is applied, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and evaluating the risks of multi-drug sedation. A multinomial logit model is also estimated to evaluate cardiovascular, respiratory, hemorrhagic, other AEs and stopping the procedure risk factors.In 7.55% of cases, one or more AEs occurred, most frequently cardiovascular (3.26%) or respiratory (2.77%). Our ZIPRM model identifies one population for non-zero counts. The AE-group reveals that age >75 years yields 46% more AEs than age <66 years; Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥27 27% more AEs than BMI <21; emergency 11% more AEs than routine. Any one-point increment in the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score and the Mallampati score determines respectively a 42% and a 16% increment in AEs; every hour prolonging endoscopy increases AEs by 41%. Regarding sedation with propofol alone (the sedative of choice), adding opioids to propofol increases AEs by 43% and adding benzodiazepines by 51%. Cardiovascular AEs are increased by age, ASA score, smoke, in-hospital, procedure duration, midazolam/fentanyl associated with propofol. Respiratory AEs are increased by BMI, ASA and Mallampati scores, emergency, in-hospital, procedure duration, midazolam/fentanyl associated with propofol. Hemorrhagic AEs are increased by age, in-hospital, procedure duration, midazolam/fentanyl associated with propofol. The risk of suspension of the endoscopic procedure before accomplishment is increased by female gender, ASA and Mallampati scores, and in-hospital, and it is reduced by emergency and procedure duration.Age, BMI, ASA score, Mallampati score, in-hospital, procedure duration, other sedatives with propofol increase the risk for AEs during sedation for GI endoscopy."
https://openalex.org/W3177452249,"The LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1 and Mec-3 domains) family is a key transcription factor widely distributed in animals and plants. The LIM proteins in plants are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, including cytoskeletal organization, the development of secondary cell walls, and cell differentiation. It has been identified and analyzed in many species. However, the systematic identification and analysis of the LIM genes family have not yet been reported in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Based on the genome-wide data of alfalfa, a total of 21 LIM genes were identified and named MsLIM01-MsLIM21. Comprehensive analysis of the chromosome location, physicochemical properties of the protein, evolutionary relationship, conserved motifs, and responses to abiotic stresses of the LIM gene family in alfalfa using bioinformatics methods. The results showed that these MsLIM genes were distributed unequally on 21 of the 32 chromosomes in alfalfa. Gene duplication analysis showed that segmental duplications were the major contributors to the expansion of the alfalfa LIM family. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the LIM gene family of alfalfa can be divided into four subfamilies: αLIM subfamily, βLIM subfamily, γLIM subfamily, and δLIM subfamily, and approximately all the LIM genes within the same subfamily shared similar gene structure. The 21 MsLIM genes of alfalfa contain 10 Motifs, of which Motif1 and Motif3 are the conserved motifs shared by these genes. Furthermore, the analysis of cis-regulatory elements indicated that regulatory elements related to transcription, cell cycle, development, hormone, and stress response are abundant in the promoter sequence of MsLIM genes. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that MsLIM gene expression is induced by low temperature and salt. The present study serves as a basic foundation for future functional studies on the alfalfa LIM family."
https://openalex.org/W3173194028,"As we explore beyond Earth, astronauts may be at risk for harmful DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Double-strand breaks are a type of DNA damage that can be repaired by two major cellular pathways: non-homologous end joining, during which insertions or deletions may be added at the break site, and homologous recombination, in which the DNA sequence often remains unchanged. Previous work suggests that space conditions may impact the choice of DNA repair pathway, potentially compounding the risks of increased radiation exposure during space travel. However, our understanding of this problem has been limited by technical and safety concerns, which have prevented integral study of the DNA repair process in space. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system offers a model for the safe and targeted generation of double-strand breaks in eukaryotes. Here we describe a CRISPR-based assay for DNA break induction and assessment of double-strand break repair pathway choice entirely in space. As necessary steps in this process, we describe the first successful genetic transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in space. These milestones represent a significant expansion of the molecular biology toolkit onboard the International Space Station."
https://openalex.org/W3173278725,"Background Diabetes and insulin resistance is an emerging issue in people with HIV. HIV-related mortality and morbidities have decreased markedly over the last few decades, while co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes (T2D) have increased. Setting This study investigated the incidence of T2D and insulin resistance in a cohort of HIV-patients on effective treatment. Methods Prevalence and baseline predictors of T2D were assessed in a cohort of 570 HIV-positive patients 50 years or older. Patients without diabetes (n = 505) were followed prospectively over a median period of 7.25 year (2012–2020) until T2D development, death or end of the study. T2D was defined as repeated fasting glucose values ≥7.0 mmol/L. Insulin resistance was defined as HOMA-IR ≥3.0. Predictors of T2D development (HIV-related parameters, lipids, hypertension, central obesity, inflammation, smoking and use of statins) were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Results 30% (153/505) had insulin resistance. During follow up (3485 patient-years) 9% (43/505) developed T2D and 7% (36/505) insulin resistance. Thus, at follow up the prevalence of either T2D or insulin resistance was 46% (232/505). T2D incidence was 1.2/100 patient-years. In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, T2D development was associated with baseline insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, central obesity and statin treatment, but no HIV-related factors. Conclusion The incidence of T2D in this cohort of patients with well controlled HIV-infection was high. The predictive factors associated with the development of T2D were not unique for HIV positive patients. The findings underline the importance of lifestyle changes in avoidance of T2D in people with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3175064722,"This study innovatively uses local government regulations related to manufacturing to quantitatively identify industrial policies. The degree of influence and functional mechanism of China's industrial policies on the green competitiveness of the manufacturing industry are empirically examined using the provincial and regional panel data. Additionally, the synergistic complementary effect between industrial policy power and market forces and the fiscal decentralization's role in influencing industrial policies are investigated. The results reveal that the promulgation and implementation of industrial policies have significantly promoted the green competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. Regarding functional mechanisms, environmental governance has played a positive role in promoting the green competitiveness of the manufacturing industry supported by industrial policies, resource allocation, and innovation incentives. Meanwhile, industrial policies on green competitiveness in manufacturing depend on marketization and fiscal decentralization in local governments. The above findings demonstrate that the local governments in China, a developing economy, can play the role of development-oriented governments. Based on conforming to market deepening and system optimization, they can formulate and implement industrial policies in a rational manner and achieve green development and upgrade the manufacturing industry."
https://openalex.org/W3176663537,"This study was conducted in order to know the colonization rate of MDR enterobacteria in neonates during their hospitalization in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Furthermore, we investigated risk factors for potential colonization and molecular epidemiology of isolated resistant bacteria. This prospective study was carried out in the neonatology and intensive care unit department of the University Hospital of Fez (Morocco) from February 2013 to July 2015. All consecutive admitted newborns were screened for intestinal and nasal carriage of MDR enterobacteria at admission of the babies and during the hospitalization. During the study period, a total of 641 Enterobacteriaceae were isolated and Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominated bacteria. Bacterial identification and antibiograms were performed according to the international standards. On admission, 455 newborns were screened. A median age of these newborns was 1 day with an extended 147 days and their average weight was 2612 ± 1023 grams. 22.4% of neonates were found colonized by an ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E), 8.7% by a carbapenemases producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). During hospitalization, 207 of newborns were included in the acquisition study. 59.4% of newborns acquired an ESBL-E during their stay, 12.5% has acquired CPE. The blaCTXM-15 gene was the most frequently detected (81.2%) among ESBL-E. While, all CPE has expressed the blaOXA-48 gene exclusively. Two risk factors have been significantly associated with MDR enterobacteria colonization at admission which are newborns admission from maternity of the university hospital (95% CI, 1.859-5.129, P = 0.000) and neurological distress (95% CI, 1.038 to 4.694, P = 0.040). During hospitalization, the none risk factor was significantly associated with the carriage of MDR-E. The high rate of colonization, the MDR enterobacteria and the resistance genes found represent good indicator of cross-transmission in the NICU. An active strategy to control the spread of MDR enterobacteria should be applied."
https://openalex.org/W3177125974,"Rocky desertification is the most serious ecological disaster in karst areas. Comprehensive control of rocky desertification plays an important role in promoting the economic development of karst areas. Studying the stoichiometric characteristics of mosses and soil can provide a powerful reference for the ecological restoration and evaluation of ecosystems experiencing rocky desertification. Soil and mosses were collected from sites representing different stages of ecological restoration (bare rock, grassland, shrubland, and secondary forest), and the contents of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) were detected for ecological stoichiometric analysis. The results indicate that in different restoration stages following karst rocky desertification, the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) and the stoichiometric ratios in the shrub habitat are higher than those in the bare rock, grassland, and secondary forest habitats. However, the TP and available P contents were low at all stages (0.06 g/kg and 0.62 mg/kg, respectively). The N and P contents and stoichiometric ratios in the mosses showed no significant differences among the succession stages. The C contents in the mosses had a significant positive correlation with SOC and TN and TP content, and the P content had a significant positive correlation with the soil available P. However, there was a significant negative correlation between the C: N and C:P ratios of the bryophytes and soil C: N. In summary, during the process of natural restoration of karst rocky desertification areas, SOC and soil TN contents accumulate with each succession stage. Soil nutrients are higher in shrub habitats than in other succession stages. Mosses have a strong effect on improving soil nutrients in rocky desertification areas."

Low and middle-income countries, including Tanzania, bear the largest proportion of adolescent perinatal deaths. Few adolescent girls in Tanzania access antenatal care at health facilities, the reasons for which are poorly understood.We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis study of the experiences of pregnant adolescents with accessing antenatal care in Misungwi district, Tanzania. We recruited 22 pregnant or parenting adolescent girls using purposive sampling, and conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) about antenatal care experiences. IDI data were triangulated with data from eight focus group discussions (FGDs) involving young fathers and elder men/women, and nine key informant interviews (KIIs) conducted with local health care providers. FGDs, KIIs and IDIs were transcribed verbatim in Swahili. Transcripts were then translated to English and analysed using emergent thematic analysis.Four main themes emerged: 1) Lack of maternal personal autonomy, 2) Stigma and judgment, 3) Vulnerability to violence and abuse, and 4) Knowledge about antenatal care, and highlighted the complex power imbalance that underlies barriers and facilitators to care access at the individual, family/interpersonal, community, and health-systems levels, faced by pregnant adolescents in rural Tanzania.Adolescent antenatal care-seeking is compromised by a complex power imbalance that involves financial dependence, lack of choice, lack of personal autonomy in decision making, experiences of social stigma, judgement, violence and abuse. Multi-level interventions are needed to empower adolescent girls, and to address policies and social constructs that may act as barriers, thereby, potentially reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W3174393811,"Background The medical community has increasingly embraced social media for a variety of purposes, including trainee education, research dissemination, professional networking, and recruitment of trainees and faculty. Platform choice and usage patterns appear to vary by specialty and purpose, but few studies comprehensively assess programs’ social media presence. Prior studies assessed general surgery departments’ Twitter use but omitted additional social media platforms and residency-specific accounts. Objective This study sought to broadly characterize the social media footprint of U.S. general surgery residency programs. Methods Using a protocolized search of program websites, social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), and internet search, cross-sectional data on social media usage in March 2020 were collected for programs, their affiliated departments, their program directors (PDs), and their assistant/associate PDs (APDs). Results 318 general surgery residency programs, 313 PDs, and 296 APDs were identified. 47.2% of programs had surgery-specific accounts on ≥1 platform. 40.2% of PDs and APDs had ≥1 account on Twitter and/or LinkedIn. Program type was associated with social media adoption and Twitter utilization, with lower usage among university-affiliated and independent programs (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions Most general surgery residencies, especially non-university-based programs, lacked any department or residency accounts across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram by March 2020. These findings highlight opportunities for increased social media engagement and act as a pre-pandemic baseline for future investigations of how the shift to virtual trainee education, recruitment, conferences, and clinical care affect social media use."
https://openalex.org/W3175557569,"The mammalian master circadian pacemaker within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) maintains tight entrainment to the 24 hr light/dark cycle via a sophisticated clock-gated rhythm in the responsiveness of the oscillator to light. A central event in this light entrainment process appears to be the rapid induction of gene expression via the ERK/MAPK pathway. Here, we used RNA array-based profiling in combination with pharmacological disruption methods to examine the contribution of ERK/MAPK signaling to light-evoked gene expression. Transient photic stimulation during the circadian night, but not during the circadian day, triggered marked changes in gene expression, with early-night light predominately leading to increased gene expression and late-night light predominately leading to gene downregulation. Functional analysis revealed that light-regulated genes are involved in a diversity of physiological processes, including DNA transcription, RNA translation, mRNA processing, synaptic plasticity and circadian timing. The disruption of MAPK signaling led to a marked reduction in light-evoked gene regulation during the early night (32/52 genes) and late night (190/191 genes); further, MAPK signaling was found to gate gene expression across the circadian cycle. Together, these experiments reveal potentially important insights into the transcriptional-based mechanisms by which the ERK/MAPK pathway regulates circadian clock timing and light-evoked clock entrainment."
https://openalex.org/W3176372058,"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders. HSPs are complex disorders and are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. To date, more than 80 genes or genetic loci have been reported to be responsible for HSPs in a Mendelian-dependent manner. Most recently, ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1) has been recognized to be involved in HSP. Here, we identified novel protein truncating variants in two families with pure form of HSP. A novel deletion (c.468_469delTG) in the UBAP1 gene was found in the first family, whereas a nonsense variant (c.512T&gt;G) was ascertained in the second family. The variants were confirmed in all patients but were not detected in unaffected family members. The mutations resulted in truncated proteins of UBAP1. The variants did not result in different subcellular localizations in neuro-2a cells. However, each of the two variants impaired neurite outgrowth. Taken together, our findings expand the pathogenic spectrum of UBAP1 variants in HSP."
https://openalex.org/W3177175586,"Soliva sessilis is a troublesome annual weed species in New Zealand turfgrass. This weed has been controlled selectively in New Zealand turfgrass for many years using pyridine herbicides such as clopyralid. However, in some golf courses, the continuous application of pyridine herbicides has resulted in the selection of S . sessilis populations that are resistant to these herbicides. This study focuses on a clopyralid-resistant population of S . sessilis collected from a golf course with a long history of clopyralid applications. The resistant phenotype of S . sessilis was highly resistant to clopyralid (over 225-fold). It was also cross-resistant to dicamba, MCPA and picloram but not mecoprop. The level of resistance to dicamba was high (7-14-fold) but much lower (2-3-fold) for both MCPA and picloram. The phenotype was morphologically distinct from its susceptible counterpart. Individuals of the clopyralid-resistant phenotype had fewer lobes on their leaves and were slightly larger compared to the susceptible phenotype. Resistant individuals also had a larger leaf area and greater root dry weight than the susceptible plants. An evaluation of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions confirmed that clopyralid-resistant phenotypes are conspecific with S . sessilis . In summary, the cross-resistance to several auxinic herbicides in this S . sessilis phenotype greatly reduces chemical options for controlling it; thus, other integrated management practices may be needed such as using turfgrass competition to reduce weed germination. However, the morphological differences between resistant and susceptible plants make it easy to see, which will help with its management."
https://openalex.org/W3172235433,"Quantifying a society's value system is important because it suggests what people deeply care about-it reflects who they actually are and, more importantly, who they will like to be. This cultural quantification has been typically done by studying literary production. However, a society's value system might well be implicitly quantified based on the decisions that people took in the past and that were mediated by what they care about. It turns out that one class of these decisions is visible in ordinary settings: it is visible in street names. We studied the names of 4,932 honorific streets in the cities of Paris, Vienna, London and New York. We chose these four cities because they were important centers of cultural influence for the Western world in the 20th century. We found that street names greatly reflect the extent to which a society is gender biased, which professions are considered elite ones, and the extent to which a city is influenced by the rest of the world. This way of quantifying a society's value system promises to inform new methodologies in Digital Humanities; makes it possible for municipalities to reflect on their past to inform their future; and informs the design of everyday's educational tools that promote historical awareness in a playful way."
https://openalex.org/W3174606753,"Many fungi require specific growth conditions before they can be identified. Direct environmental DNA sequencing is advantageous, although for some taxa, specific primers need to be used for successful amplification of molecular markers. The internal transcribed spacer region is the preferred DNA barcode for fungi. However, inter- and intra-specific distances in ITS sequences highly vary among some fungal groups; consequently, it is not a solely reliable tool for species delineation. Ampelomyces, mycoparasites of the fungal phytopathogen order Erysiphales, can have ITS genetic differences up to 15%; this may lead to misidentification with other closely related unknown fungi. Indeed, Ampelomyces were initially misidentified as other pycnidial mycoparasites, but subsequent research showed that they differ in pycnidia morphology and culture characteristics. We investigated whether the ITS2 nucleotide content and secondary structure was different between Ampelomyces ITS2 sequences and those unrelated to this genus. To this end, we retrieved all ITS sequences referred to as Ampelomyces from the GenBank database. This analysis revealed that fungal ITS environmental DNA sequences are still being deposited in the database under the name Ampelomyces, but they do not belong to this genus. We also detected variations in the conserved hybridization model of the ITS2 proximal 5.8S and 28S stem from two Ampelomyces strains. Moreover, we suggested for the first time that pseudogenes form in the ITS region of this mycoparasite. A phylogenetic analysis based on ITS2 sequences-structures grouped the environmental sequences of putative Ampelomyces into a different clade from the Ampelomyces-containing clades. Indeed, when conducting ITS2 analysis, resolution of genetic distances between Ampelomyces and those putative Ampelomyces improved. Each clade represented a distinct consensus ITS2 S2, which suggested that different pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processes occur across different lineages. This study recommends the use of ITS2 S2s as an important tool to analyse environmental sequencing and unveiling the underlying evolutionary processes."

By selecting samples of 1221 Chinese A-share non-financial listed companies from 2010 to 2019, this paper examines the impact of financialization on research and development through the panel threshold regression model. Then, the moderate range of the impact of financialization on corporate research and development is measured, as well as their heterogeneity is also analyzed. The research shows the following results: first, there is a dynamic relationship and moderate range between financialization and corporate research and development. Financialization has a positive effect on corporate research and development when the level of financialization exceeds 0.4748. Secondly, from further heterogeneous research, financialization has a threshold effect on research and development among enterprises with a high level of research and development. In addition, there is a promoting effect on corporate research and development only when their financialization level exceeds 0.0097 in enterprises with a high level of research and development. Therefore, in order to promote corporate research and development, financialization of non-financial enterprises should make adjustment and regulation according to the action and direction of moderate range."

The initial screening was conducted by target prediction using TargetNet web server application and only compounds 3 and 4 showed a potential interaction with XO. Compounds 3 and 4 were subsequently subjected to in silico analyses on XO protein structure (PDB: 1N5X) using Schrödinger Release 2020–3 followed by structural modeling &amp; molecular simulation studies to confirm the initial prediction result and identify the binding mode of these compounds to the XO. Molecular docking results revealed that compounds 3 (-37.3 kcal/mol) and 4 (-32.0 kcal/mol) binds more stably to XO than the reference drug allopurinol (-27.0 kcal/mol). Interestingly, two residues Glu 802 and Thr 1010 were observed as the two main H-bond binding sites for both tested compounds and the allopurinol. The center scaffold of allopurinol was positioned by some π-π stacking with Phe 914 and Phe 1009, while that of compounds 3 and 4 were supported by many hydrophobic interactions mainly with Leu 648, Phe 649, Phe 1013, and Leu 1014. Additionally, the docking simulation predicted that the inhibitory effect of compounds 3 and 4 was mediated by creating H-bond with particularly Glu 802, which is a key amino acid for XO enzyme inhibition. Altogether, in vitro studies showed that compounds 3 and 4 had better inhibitory capacity against XO enzyme with IC 50 values significantly ( p &lt; 0.001) lower than that of allopurinol. In short, the present study identified cleroda-4(18),13-dien-15,16-olide as novel potential XO inhibitors, which can be potentially used for the treatment of gout."
https://openalex.org/W3175201344,"Understanding hominin expansions requires the comprehension of movement processes at different scales. In many models of hominin expansion these processes are viewed as being determined by large-scale effects, such as changes in climate and vegetation spanning continents and thousands or even millions of years. However, these large-scale patterns of expansions also need to be considered as possibly resulting from the accumulation of small-scale decisions of individual hominins. Moving on a continental scale may for instance involve crossing a water barrier. We present a generalized agent-based model for simulating the crossing of a water barrier where the agents represent the hominin individuals. The model can be configured to represent a variety of movement modes across water. Here, we compare four different behavioral scenarios in conjunction with a set of water barrier configurations, in which agents move in water by either paddling, drifting, swimming or rafting. We introduce the crossing-success-rate (CSR) to quantify the performance in water crossing. Our study suggests that more focus should be directed towards the exploration of behavioral models for hominins, as directionality may be a more powerful factor for crossing a barrier than environmental opportunities alone. A prerequisite for this is to perceive the opposite shore. Furthermore, to provide a comprehensive understanding of hominin expansions, the CSR allows for the integration of results obtained from small-scale simulations into large-scale models for hominin expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3175433164,"A common way of illustrating phylogeographic results is through the use of haplotype networks. While these networks help to visualize relationships between individuals, populations, and species, evolutionary studies often only quantitatively analyze genetic diversity among haplotypes and ignore other network properties. Here, we present a new metric, haplotype network branch diversity (HBd), as an easy way to quantifiably compare haplotype network complexity. Our metric builds off the logic of combining genetic and topological diversity to estimate complexity previously used by the published metric haplotype network diversity (HNd). However, unlike HNd which uses a combination of network features to produce complexity values that cannot be defined in probabilistic terms, thereby obscuring the values' implication for a sampled population, HBd uses frequencies of haplotype classes to incorporate topological information of networks, keeping the focus on the population and providing easy-to-interpret probabilistic values for randomly sampled individuals. The goal of this study is to introduce this more intuitive metric and provide an R script that allows researchers to calculate diversity and complexity indices from haplotype networks. A group of datasets, generated manually (model dataset) and based on published data (empirical dataset), were used to illustrate the behavior of HBd and both of its terms, haplotype diversity, and a new index called branch diversity. Results followed a predicted trend in both model and empirical datasets, from low metric values in simple networks to high values in complex networks. In short, the new combined metric joins genetic and topological diversity of haplotype networks, into a single complexity value. Based on our analysis, we recommend the use of HBd, as it makes direct comparisons of network complexity straightforward and provides probabilistic values that can readily discriminate situations that are difficult to resolve with available metrics."

Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a severe form in which there is complete exposure of neural tissue with a lack of skin, soft tissue, or bony covering to protect the spinal cord. The all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induced rat model of (MMC) is a reproducible, cost-effective means of studying this disease; however, there are limited modalities to objectively quantify disease severity, or potential benefits from experimental therapies. We sought to determine the feasibility of detecting differences between MMC and wild type (WT) rat fetuses using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging techniques (MRI). Rat dams were gavage-fed ATRA to produce MMC defects in fetuses, which were surgically delivered prior to term. Average diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were obtained for each fetus. Brain volumes and two anatomically defined brain length measurements (D1 and D2) were significantly decreased in MMC compared to WT. Mean ADC signal was significantly increased in MMC compared to WT, but no difference was found for FA signal. In summary, ADC and brain measurements were significantly different between WT and MMC rat fetuses. ADC could be a useful complementary imaging biomarker to current histopathologic analysis of MMC models, and potentially expedite therapeutic research for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3173734630,"Critical shoulder angle (CSA) is the angle between the superior and inferior bone margins of the glenoid and the most lateral border of the acromion and is potentially affected during a rotator cuff tear (RCT). Acromioplasty is generally performed to rectify the anatomy of the acromion during RCT repair surgery. However, limited information is available regarding the changes in the CSA after anterolateral acromioplasty. We hypothesized that CSA can be decreased after anterolateral acromioplasty. Data were retrospectively collected from 712 patients with RCTs and underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between January 2012 and December 2018, of which 337 patients were included in the study. The presurgical and postsurgical CSA were then determined and compared using a paired samples t test. Because previous study mentioned CSA more than 38 degrees were at risk of rotator cuff re-tear, patients were segregated into two groups: CSA < 38° and CSA ≥ 38°; these groups were compared using an independent-samples t test. These 337 participants (160 male and 177 female) presented a CSA of 38.4° ± 6.0° before anterolateral acromioplasty, which significantly decreased to 35.8° ± 5.9° after surgery (P < .05). Before surgery, 172 patients were present in the CSA ≥ 38° group and 57 were preset in the CSA < 38° group after surgery. The CSA decreased significantly in the CSA ≥ 38° group rather than in the CSA < 38° group (P < .05). In conclusion, the CSA can be effectively decreased through anterolateral acromioplasty, and this reduction in the CSA is more significant among individuals with CSA ≥ 38° than among those with CSA < 38°, indicating that acromioplasty is recommended along with RCT repair especially among individuals with a wide presurgical CSA."

For this study, the ""Salton Sea region"" is defined as all Imperial County census tracts that include the Salton Sea within its boundaries. To measure ""access,"" this study calculated driving travel times from census tracts to hospitals within Imperial County rather than Euclidean distance to account for geography and urban infrastructures such as road networks and traffic conditions.

Results showed that the average travel time for Salton Sea region residents to drive to Imperial County emergency healthcare facilities ranged from 50-61 minutes, compared to 14-20 minutes for other Imperial County tracts. RAAM scores, compared to other Imperial County tracts, were about 30% higher in the Salton Sea region, meaning that healthcare supply is limited in the region. State and county policy should account for spatial inaccessibility to healthcare institutions in order to address emergency healthcare access."
https://openalex.org/W3174840256,"Surface condition is one of the dominant factors affecting fatigue life. Considering the complexity of surface condition, a relatively efficient and economic approach based on surface reconstruction and interpolation method was proposed. The effect of surface roughness on the fatigue life of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy is studied to analyze the fatigue life by surface roughness parameters. Surface topography was simplified into a series of elliptic micro notches, and empirical formula for stress concentration factor is established based on simulation work. Then the extraction method of surface curve is proposed to effectively represent the real surface roughness through 3D model reconstruction. Experiment of surface roughness verified the correctness of the model. The relationship between surface roughness and fatigue life is established and the calculated value of the fatigue life is compared with the test results. The maximum error is 15.65%, indicating that the formula established is reasonable and effective."
https://openalex.org/W3174885615,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of ammonia on growth performance, lipid metabolism and intestinal flora of rabbits. A total of 150 female IRA rabbits (35-days-old) were randomly divided into three groups including 0 ppm (CG), 10 ppm (LAC) and 30 ppm ammonia (HAC) groups for a period of 28 days. The average daily weight gain (ADG) of rabbits was significantly reduced in LAC (-17.11%; p < 0.001) and HAC groups (-17.46%; p < 0.001) as compared with the CG. Serum concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and glucose (Glu) were increased in LAC (+80.95%; +45.99; p < 0.05) and HAC groups (+219.05%; +45.89; p < 0.001), while apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) was decreased in LAC (-58.49%; p < 0.001) and HAC groups (-36.92%; p < 0.001). The structural integrity of cecum was damaged, and the thickness of mucosa and serosa were significantly decreased in LAC and HAC. The acetate, butyrate and propionate level of cecal chyme were reduced in HAC group (-21.67%; -19.82%; -30.81%; p < 0.05). Microbial diversity and burden of Firmicutes were significantly decreased, while that of pathogenic bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Clostridium and Proteobacteria were increased in ammonia treated groups. Spearman's correlation confirmed that burden of Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group showed significantly negative correlation with acetic acid (r = -0.67; p < 0.001) while Barnesiellaceae_unclassified showed significantly positive correlation with propionic acid (r = 0.50; p < 0.001). In conclusion, ammonia treatment was responsible for an imbalance of intestinal flora, which affected lipid metabolism and damaged intestinal barrier of rabbits, resulting in low growth performance due to lipid metabolism dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3176382481,"The efficacy of post-tensioned metal straps PTMS, wrapped around steel channels anchored to normal reinforced concrete (R.C) beams is tested in increasing the flexural capacity of the beams. For this purpose, nine normal R.C beams with dimensions of 160 mm x 240 mm x 2100 mm are constructed to fail in bending. The location and the number of the straps are considered as the main variable. It is found that using PTMS can enhance the load-carrying capacity of the beam by 29% to 63%. The decisive factors affecting the increase are the location of the straps (at the bottom or sides), shape of the flange and web edges (squared or rounded) and alignment of the flanges (vertical or inclined). A complete guide can be found in the paper as it is a novel method of strengthening beams which can be applied to the beams cast in place with integral slabs."

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the Disorder of Consciousness (DOC) Rehabilitation Unit. Methods This is a retrospective, longitudinal, descriptive, observational, pilot study. We consecutively enrolled 18 patients (age range: 40–72 years, 9 females and 9 males), from three to five months after a brain injury. They were grouped into VS (n = 8) and MCS (n = 10). A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of throat swab specimens. We collected data of lung Computed Tomography (CT) and laboratory exams. DOC patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 were classified into severe and no severe infected group, according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines. Results A total of 18 hospitalized patients with (16) and without confirmed (2) SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the analysis. After one month, a follow-up clinical evaluation reported that one patient died, one patient was transferred from Covid Unit to Emergency Unit and 3 patients were resulted negative to double swab and they returned to Rehabilitative Unit. Significant differences were reported about hypertension, cardiac disease and respiratory problems between the patients with severe infection and patients without severe infection (P&lt; 0.001). The laboratory findings, such as blood cell counts ( P &lt; 0.001), C-reactive protein, D-dimer, potassium and vitamin D levels, seemed to be considered as useful prognostic predictors. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study on a sample of chronic DOC patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. This study may offer important new clinical information on COVID-19 for management of DOC patients. Our findings showed that for the subjects with severe infection due to COVID-19, rapid clinical deterioration or worsening could be associated with clinical and laboratory findings , which could contribute to high mortality rate. During the COVID-19 epidemic period, the clinicians should consider all the reported risk factors to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and to prevent the infection transmission in DOC Rehabilitation Unit."
https://openalex.org/W3176836699,"This article aimed to compare the sports participation of populations from two distinct societies with huge cultural differences: France and Japan. At a macro-statistical level and using a societal approach based on two national ad-hoc surveys-in contrast with functionalist and culturalist analyses-it analysed the differences in sports participation between the two populations. The angle adopted for analysing sports participation was that of voraciousness (number and types of sports and physical activities practised). We performed a secondary analysis of a Japanese national ad-hoc survey and a French national ad-hoc survey (quotas sampling, June/July 2016), which reported activities precisely over the preceding 12 months. The two reconstructed samples for comparison concerned people aged between 18 and 70, and 46 PSAs and PSA families, making it possible to evaluate sports participation. The Japanese sample consisted of 2,612 individuals and the French sample of 3,791 individuals. To identify statistically significant differences between the two samples, Fisher's exact test and bootstrap approaches was used (boot package in R software). Sports participation and voraciousness for sport are higher in the French population than in the Japanese one. For the overall rate of sports practice, there is a difference of 8.2 points (95%CI[6.0;10.3], p<0.001), and the difference concerning the average number of activities practised by practitioners is 1.7 activity (95%CI[1.9;1.5], p<0.001). In both countries, young males have the highest level of sportiness. Age is an important variable with a lower difference between the youngest and oldest age groups for sports participation in Japan than in France: when compared to France, the difference in difference for the rate of no activity is 13.7 points (95%CI[6.3;21.1], p<0.001) and -2.3 activities for the average number of activities among practitioners (95%CI[-3.0;-1.7], p<0.001). Some physical and sports activities (PSAs) are specific to France (e.g. skiing with 12.7 points difference, 95%CI[11.3;14.1], p<0.001) and others to Japan, such as baseball (with 9.8 points difference 95%CI[8.6;11.0], p<0.001) or more traditional PSAs like Japanese calisthenics and radio exercise (at 15.9%). In contrast to France, Japan is still in the process of greatly modernising its sporting tradition as a result of its particular cultural dimensions. We can identify physical and sports activities which are specific to each country, as well as similar activities in the two countries and wider diversification in France. Voraciousness for sport is higher in France than in Japan. In both countries, the youngest age groups and men have the highest level of sportiness. Yet, the difference between the youngest and the oldest group is smaller in Japan due to the pressure of work."
https://openalex.org/W3173506940,"Self-care activities are important to prevent transplant-related side effects and complications among kidney transplant recipients. Therefore, we developed a theory-based self-management program for kidney transplant recipients hospitalized after surgery. This study aimed to examine the feasibility of the program and to identify its preliminary effects on autonomy, competence, and self-care agency. We assessed feasibility using quantitative data collected based on a single group repeated-measures design, along with qualitative data such as patients' feedback on satisfaction during patient counseling. The program comprised video education and individual counseling by nurses. Thirty patients completed this program. Outcome variables were measured thrice: before education, immediately following the first week of video education, and after two consecutive weeks of counseling. A repeated measures ANOVA showed a statistically significant increase in autonomy (F = 5.03, p = .038), competence (F = 17.59, p < .001), and self-care agency (F = 24.19, p < .001). Our pilot study provided preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility for implementation of the theory-based self-management program, and suggesting its preliminary effects in improving autonomy, competence, and self-care agency among kidney transplant recipients. Further research is needed to examine the short- and long-term effects of this program in a longitudinal, randomized control study with a larger sample."
https://openalex.org/W3174654717,"While it is generally accepted that language and speech have genetic foundations, and that the widespread inter-individual variation observed in many of their aspects is partly driven by variation in genes, it is much less clear if differences between languages may also be partly rooted in our genes. One such proposal is that the population frequencies of the so-called ""derived"" alleles of two genes involved in brain growth and development, ASPM and Microcephalin, are related to the probability of speaking a tone language or not. The original study introducing this proposal used a cross-linguistic statistical approach, showing that these associations are ""special"" when compared with many other possible relationships between genetic variants and linguistic features. Recent experimental evidence supports strongly a negative effect of the ""derived"" allele of ASPM on tone perception and/or processing within individuals, but failed to find any effect for Microcephalin. Motivated by these experimental findings, I conduct here a cross-linguistic statistical test, using a larger and updated dataset of 175 samples from 129 unique (meta)populations, and a battery of methods including mixed-effects regression (Bayesian and maximum-likelihood), mediation and path analysis, decision trees and random forests, using permutations and restricted sampling to control for the confounding effects of genealogy (language families) and contact (macroareas). Overall, the results support a negative weak effect of ASPM-D against the presence of tone above and beyond the strong confounding influences of genealogy and contact, but they suggest that the original association between tone and MCPH1 might have been a false positive, explained by differences between populations and languages within and outside Africa. Thus, these cross-linguistic population-scale statistical results are fully consonant with the inter-individual-level experimental results, and suggest that the observed linguistic diversity may be, at least in some cases, partly driven by genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3176579157,"The decline of soil fertility is a major constraint which results in lower levels of crop productivity, agricultural development and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study is the first to perform a focalized investigation on the most interesting technological profiles to offer to each category of producers in Benin agricultural development hubs (ADHs) using the stated preference method, more precisely, the improved choice experiment method. The investigation focused on 1047 sampled plots from 962 randomly selected producers in villages of the Smallholder Agricultural Productivity Enhancement Program in Sub-Saharan Africa of the ADHs. An analysis of the experimental choice data with the endogenous attribute attendance and the latent class models was carried out to account for the attribute non-attendance phenomenon and the heterogeneity of the producers' preferences. However, three classes of producer with different socio-economic, demographic, and soil physicochemical characteristics were identified. Thus, the heterogeneity of preferences was correlated with the attributes linked to the cost, sustainability, and frequency of plot maintenance. All producers, regardless of the ADHs, had a strong attachment to accessibility of technologies with short time restoration of soil fertility, and the ability to obtain additional benefits. These latest attributes, added to that relating to cost, tended to have a low probability of rejection in the decision-making process. These results have implications for local decision-makers facing the complex problem of resolving land degradation and local economic development challenges. The generalizability of these findings provides useful insight and direction for future studies in Sub-Saharan Africa."
