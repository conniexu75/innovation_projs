https://openalex.org/W1598149828,"Eight mouse cell lines were tested for their ability to accumulate metallothionein-I mRNA in response to dexamethasone or cadmium; 5 respond to both inducers, 1 responds to cadmium only, and 2 lymphoid lines respond to neither inducer. The glucocorticoid response was analyzed further using the sarcoma cell line (S180). Metallothionein-I mRNA synthesis increases 5-fold within 1 h of dexamethasone addition and closely parallels the accumulation of nuclear glucocorticoid receptors. Both metallothionein-I mRNA levels and metallothionein synthesis increase coordinately in response to dexamethasone and reach a new steady state by 8 h that is 10-fold higher than control values. Induction of metallothionein-I mRNA appears to be independent of dexamethasone effects on zinc uptake and does not require concomitant protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1487429768,"The regulation of the transport of neutral amino acids across the cell membrane by adaptive mechanisms has been studied in cultured human fibroblasts. Among the three transport systems (A, ASC, and L) individually discriminated, only the Na+-dependent System A was subject to adaptive regulation, showing enhancement of its activity when the cells were incubated under conditions of amino acid shortage (derepression phase) and decrease of its activity when the cells were exposed to a medium supplied with Site A-reactive amino acids (repression phase). Starvation-induced derepression of transport activity and its reversal by amino acid refeeding required active RNA and protein synthesis. Derepression involved an early mRNA synthesis which started within 30 min from the abrupt change in extracellular amino acid concentration and apparently lasted 90 min. The transcribed mRNA was rather stable and translatable for a few hours (presumably into transport proteins) in cells maintained in the absence of amino acids. Repression by amino acid refeeding also involved an early mRNA synthesis, the product of its translation being presumably a protein capable of causing degradation or inactivation of transport proteins. The rate of decay in transport activity of previously derepressed cells was somewhat faster in the presence of added Site A-reactive amino acids than in their absence. A model is proposed in which the concentration of Site A-reactive amino acids affects transport activity of System A by modulating transcription of mRNA species coding for transport proteins and their putative inactivators and by regulating the efficiency of transport protein inactivation at the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1510434718,"The kinetics of colchicine binding to tubulin has been studied, using a fluorescence stopped flow. The measurements of Garland (Garland, D. L. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 4266-4272) have been extended to high colchicine concentrations and different temperatures. The appearance of fluorescence is biphasic. Both phases depend in a nonlinear way on colchicine concentration. The presence of colchicine dimers at these concentrations has been taken into account. The fast phase is analyzed as a two-step mechanism. The thermodynamic parameters of the fast initial binding, and the activation energy of the slow conformational change, have been determined. The relative magnitude of the slow phase depends on temperature. It is interpreted as a slow preequilibrium between two tubulin conformers. The effect of the microtubule-associated proteins on the different processes is studied. The binding of colchicine to tubulin ring-like oligomers is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1561765717,"Three peptide analogs of the helix-loop-helix Ca2+ binding unit, 21-, 26-, and 34-residues in length, similar in sequence to rabbit skeletal troponin C site III have been prepared by the solid-phase method. The CD spectra of the 21-residue fragment indicated very little secondary structure in aqueous medium in the absence of Ca2+. Addition of Ca2+ increased the secondary structure of the peptide but the KCa was very weak, 3.1 x 10(2) M-1. The same peptide in hydrophobic medium in the absence of Ca2+ had considerable secondary structure and the KCa value increased considerably, 3.5 x 10(5) M-1. The 26-residue peptide, containing 5 more residues on the NH2 terminus of the 21-residue peptide, showed slightly more secondary structure in aqueous medium in the absence of Ca2+. Addition of Ca2+ to this peptide raised the amount of secondary structure in the metal ion-peptide complex and resulted in a higher KCa value, 3.8 x 10(4) M-1. By assuming that the COOH-terminal region of the 26-residue peptide-metal ion complex assumes a structure similar to that of the 21-residue peptide-metal ion complex, one is able to assign the increase in structure to the NH2-terminal side of the Ca2+-binding loop. Hydrophobic medium further increased the secondary structure of this peptide and also increased the KCa value to 4.5 x 10(5) M-1, a value similar to that obtained for the 21-residue peptide. The 34-residue peptide contained a further 8 amino acid residues on the NH2 terminus of the 26-residue peptide. This peptide had considerable secondary structure in aqueous medium which increased in the presence of Ca2+. The peptide has a reasonable affinity for Ca2+ in aqueous medium, KCa = 2.6 x 10(5) M-1. Again, a hydrophobic medium increased both the amount of secondary structure and the Ca2+ affinity constant, KCa = 9.2 x 10(5) M-1. A model of Ca2+-induced folding of the three peptides under different conditions is described and results obtained from this model are used to describe Ca2+ binding to the four Ca2+ binding units in rabbit skeletal troponin C."
https://openalex.org/W1568027782,"Messenger RNA extracted from rat medullary carcinoma of the thyroid directs the synthesis in cell-free translation systems of a precursor of calcitonin, Mr = 15,000, substantially larger than the mature form of the hormone, Mr = 3,500. When translations of the mRNA were carried out in the presence of microsomal membranes prepared from a canine pancreas, a larger product (apparent Mr = 17,000) was observed by electrophoresis of the labeled proteins in the translation mixtures on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This membrane-processed product of Mr = 17,000 was specifically immunoprecipitated by an antiserum to synthetic calcitonin and bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose. Incubation of the proteins synthesized in the cell-free translations performed in the presence of microsomal membranes with the glycosidase, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, reduced the apparent molecular weight of the membrane-processed precursor from 17,000 to 12,000. In addition, the processed Mr = 17,000 calcitonin-related precursor, but not the initial, unprocessed precursor of Mr = 15,000, was resistant to proteolytic digestion by a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin. These results indicate that the biosynthesis of calcitonin involves the glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage of a newly synthesized precursor along with sequestration of the processed precursor within microsomal vesicles. Thus, the calcitonin precursor undergoes extensive co- and post-translational processing to the smaller, unglycosylated hormone that is secreted."

https://openalex.org/W1484043176,"The production of procollagen molecules by human diploid fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1 cells) remains constant in both rapid and stationary growth phases. However, log phase cells degrade 3-fold more newly synthesized collagen inside the cell prior to secretion than do stationary phase cells. Procollagen mRNA levels, measured by hybridization with a type I procollagen mRNA-specific complementary DNA, are approximately 2-fold higher in confluent cells than in log phase cells. There are no significant differences in the ability of either log phase or confluent HFL-1 cell procollagen mRNA to be translated in an in vitro cell-free translation system. Therefore, the ability of HFL-1 cells to maintain constant collagen production irrespective of the growth status of the cells results from the combined action of a number of regulatory mechanisms, including changes in procollagen mRNA levels, the utilization of procollagen mRNA, and intracellular procollagen degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1564756381,"Cells of Pseudomonas putida, after growth with toluene, contain a multicomponent enzyme system that oxidizes toluene to (+)-1(S),2(R)-dihydroxy-3-methyl-cyclohexa-3,5-diene. One of these components has been purified to homogeneity and shown to be a flavoprotein that contains FAD as the only detectable prosthetic group. Fad was removed from the enzyme during purification. However, equilibrium dialysis experiments showed that the enzyme can bind one mol of FAD/mol of enzyme protein. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme is 46,000, as judged by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol. The latter result suggests the presence of a single polypeptide chain. The amino acid composition of the enzyme reveals a relatively high content of the hydrophobic amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine and is remarkably similar in composition to the flavoproteins that function in certain monooxygenase enzyme systems. The purified enzyme catalyzes the reduction of dichloroindophenol, nitrobluetetrazolium, ferricyanide, and ferredoxinTOL. Its ability to reduce cytochrome c and to function in the toluene dioxygenase enzyme system is absolutely dependent on the presence of ferredoxinTOL."

https://openalex.org/W1587900371,"Collagen is the major matrix protein produced by corneal endothelial cell cultures and represented 1% of total protein synthesis. The different types of collagen were determined by a combination of DEAE- and CM-cellulose column chromatography using known internal markers. Type III collagen was the major component both deposited in the extracellular matrix and secreted into the media. The basement membrane collagens, types IV and V, were also found in each compartment, although the latter was associated preferentially with the cell matrix. The ratios of types I:III:IV + V collagens synthesized by corneal endothelial cells were 3:16:1."
https://openalex.org/W88733343,"An in vitro system was developed for studying protein methylation reactions in human red blood cells. Packed erythrocytes were lysed by freeze-thawing in the presence of S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine. Specific incorporation of base-labile methyl groups into the band 3 anion transport protein and the major sialoglycoprotein (glycophorin, periodic acid-Schiff reagent-1) was demonstrated by dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis at pH 2.4, selective extractions with Triton X-100 and lithium diiodosalicylate, and protease sensitivity. Two other unidentified intrinsic membrane proteins with Mr = 96,000 and 23,500 were also methylated. Little radioactivity was incorporated into membrane proteins when membranes were incubated with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine in the absence of cytosol. No evidence was obtained for incorporation of methyl label into extrinsic proteins including bands 1, 2, 2.1, 4, 5, 6, or in zone 4.5. Proteolytic digestion of intact cells and isolated membranes revealed that one site of methylation on the band 3 polypeptide may be at the inner surface of the membrane near the junction of the cytoplasmic domain and the membrane domain. The rates of hydrolysis of the incorporated methyl groups were characterized over a range of pH values. These rates were compared to those of methyl esterified amino acids and peptides, including aspartic acid beta-methyl ester which has been isolated from proteolytic digests of methylated erythrocyte membranes (Janson, C. A., and Clarke, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 225, 11640-11643). We find that the rates of base-catalyzed hydrolysis of beta-methyl esters of aspartic acid and gamma-methyl esters of glutamic acid are highly sensitive to the presence of substituents on the alpha-carboxyl and alpha-amino groups. The rate of hydrolysis of the membrane-incorporated methyl groups are consistent with those of internal aspartic acid and glutamic acid methyl ester residues."

https://openalex.org/W1591899615,"The specific binding of [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin ([3H]H12-HTX) to the ionic channel of the nicotinic receptor in membranes from the electric organ of the electric ray Torpedo ocellata was studied by use of a rapid filter assay. The time course of the binding was monitored and the initial rate of binding (i.e. within 30 s) was found to be increased up to several hundredfold by the presence of several receptor agonists in a dose-dependent manner. Receptor antagonists blocked this agonist-increased initial rate of binding. The presence of receptor antagonists, with the exception of alpha-bungarotoxin, also increased the initial rate of [3H]H12-HTX binding, though to a much lesser degree than agonists. Preincubation of the membranes with carbamylcholine reduced the initial rate of binding in a time-dependent manner. This was proposed to be due to receptor desensitization. Thus, it is suggested that the time course of [3H]H12-HTX binding to the ionic channel sites is influenced by the conformational state of the receptor-channel complex such that receptor activation, inactivation, and desensitization appear to be reflected in [3H]H12-HTX binding."
https://openalex.org/W1494616014,"A procedure for purifying the insecticidal parasporal protoxin of Bacillus thuringiensis and a description of its biochemical and biophysical properties is provided. Mild alkali titration was necessary to generate a functional protoxin in a soluble form, and anion-exchange chromatography was used to remove contaminating cytoplasmic proteases that are nonspecifically bound to whole native parasporal crystals. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration chromatography, and meniscus depletion sedimentation equilibrium analysis revealed an apparent molecular weight for the protoxin of 1.34 x 10(5). The only NH2-terminal residue found was methionine. The soluble protoxin was 2.5 times more toxic to insect larvae than was the parasporal crystal. At alkaline pH the protoxin slowly converted to a low molecular weight toxin (apparent Mr = 6.8 x 10(4)). The molar specific toxicities of the protoxin and toxin were identical."
https://openalex.org/W2255682462,"A modified procedure is reported that enables microtubule assembly to occur in extracts of differentiated neuroblastoma cells. Of the proteins that co-assemble through five successive cycles, only two, with molecular weights of 215,000 and 71,000, are retained in constant ratio to tubulin. The 215,000-dalton protein is quantitatively sedimented with microtubules during later cycles of assembly, whereas the 71,000-dalton protein is distributed between assembling and nonassembling fractions. Similar procedures do not induce assembly for microtubules from nondifferentiated neuroblastoma cells. Two-dimensional gel analyses indicate that the differentiated cell extracts contain the 215,000-dalton protein. In contrast, gels of extracts from nondifferentiated cells show no protein in the equivalent region. These data suggest that the 215,000-dalton protein is a microtubule-associated protein that may play a role in microtubule-dependent neurite differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W134028814,"The lysosomal acid lipase has been purified 2,500-fold to near homogeneity from human liver. The enzyme was converted to a soluble form by extraction of frozen tissue with Triton X-100. The enzyme, which required Triton X-100 in buffers at all purification steps for optimal yields, was stabilized by the inclusion of 33% ethylene glycol during purification. Lectin chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose followed by chromatography on carboxymethyl-cellulose and Sephadex G-150 provided the highly purified enzyme in 17% yield. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the minimum molecular weight was about 29,000 +/- 1,000. Minor protein contaminants at Mr = 58,500, 14,700 and 13,900 were present in the final preparation. A single protein band, with enzyme activity, was observed in nondenaturing acrylamide gels containing Triton X-100. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 in the presence of Triton X-100 gave an apparent molecular weight of about 125,000 +/- 13,000. Trioleoylglycerol, cholesterol oleate, and 1,2- and 1,3-dioleoylglycerols were substrates for the purified enzyme giving apparent Vmax values of 5,400, 1,400, 19,400, and 22,100 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1, respectively, and Km values of 0.8, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.2 mM, respectively. The recoveries of both trioleoylglycerol and cholesterol oleate hydrolytic activities were nearly identical at each purification step, suggesting that the acid lipase as single enzyme is responsible for lysosomal hydrolysis of the neutral lipids. Monooleoylglycerols were not substrates for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W72086436,"The polar metabolite of the anti-estrogen alpha-[4-pyrrolidinoethoxy]phenyl-4-methoxy-alpha‘-nitrostilbene (CI628), that is selectively accumulated by the nuclear estrogen receptor in vivo, is identified as the corresponding free phenol (alpha-[4-pyrrolidinoethoxyl]phenyl-4-hydroxy-alpha‘-nitrostilbene (CI628M) and has been prepared in high specific activity tritium-labeled form to study its interaction with the rat uterine estrogen receptor. CI628M has an affinity for the cytosol receptor that is comparable to that of estradiol (Kd (CI628M) = 0.16 nM; Kd (estradiol) = 0.28 nM), and the binding of these two compounds is mutually competitive. Dissociation of the CI628M complex with the estrogen receptor is somewhat slower than that of the estradiol complex, and prewarming the complexes at 28 degrees C causes a characteristic decrease in the rate of dissociation. On low salt sucrose gradients, the CI628M and estradiol cytoplasmic receptor complexes both sediment as 8S species; their sedimentation profiles on high salt gradients are somewhat different, however. While the estradiol receptor complex shows mainly a 4.6S species that shifts to a 5.8S species upon warming, the unwarmed CI628M complex is predominantly 5.8S and becomes somewhat more disperse upon warming. Under high salt conditions, there is a progressive shift of the 4.6S to the 5.8S species as cytosol concentration increases; the CI628M complex shows a greater tendency to form the more rapidly sedimenting form at all cytosol concentrations. After in vivo injection of [3H]CI628M, the uterine nuclear receptor sediments as a characteristic 5S species. Cytosol receptor complexes with estradiol and CI628M, maintained at 0 degrees C, show very little binding to ATP-Sepharose, while after warming, 50-60% of both complexes are bound by the resin. Both complexes also show similar elution profiles from DNA-cellulose columns; however, the extent of binding of the [3H]CI628M receptor complex to the column is consistently only 40-50% that of the estradiol receptor complex. These results indicate that the properties of the uterine estrogen receptor complexed with estradiol and with the high affinity anti-estrogen CI628M are very similar. The differences observed in the behavior of the CI628M cytosol receptor complex on high salt sucrose gradients and on DNA-cellulose columns, though quantitative rather than qualitative, may be indicative of differences in receptor properties that are important to the antagonist activity of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W1490922982,"A new approach to study the thermodynamics of salt-protein interaction is described using a protein-ligand binding system. The effects of salts on the thermodynamics of association or dissociation of the ligand are related to the effect on the hydrophobic side chains on the interior of the protein by these salts. The calculated free energies of transfer of a methylene group from an interior of the protein to salt solutions are +0.1, +0.06, -0.02, and -0.06 kcal/mol for Na2SO4, NaCl, NaSCN, and Cl3CCOONa at 1 M concentration, respectively. The relationships between the thermodynamic parameters and the partial molar entropies of the solutions are analyzed."

https://openalex.org/W1582197136,"Using a micromethodology based on methylation, the specificity of sialic acid transfer to asialo-alpha 1-acid [3H]-glycoprotein in various tissues was studied. CMP-N-acetylneuraminyl: beta-galactosyl(1 leads to 4)N-acetylglucosaminide alpha(2 leads to 3)-sialytransferase activity (an activity which has not been demonstrated before) was detected in fetal calf liver, embryonic chicken brain, human placenta, and several other tissues. With the exception of the placenta all tissues investigated showed a considerable additional activity of CMP-N-acetylneuraminyl: beta-galactosyl(1 leads to 4)N-acetylglucosaminide alpha (2 leads to 6)-sialytransferase. Rat and porcine liver also contained the latter enzyme, but were essentially devoid of the alpha(2 leads to 3)-sialytransferase. Mixed enzyme experiments indicated that the alpha(2 leads to 3)-sialytransferase activity is due to a separate enzyme, which is clearly distinguishable from the CMP-N-acetylneuraminyl: beta-galactosyl(1 leads to 3)N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha(2 leads to 3)-sialytransferase of porcine liver and submaxillary gland."
https://openalex.org/W2111597989,"In the rat pituitary, several species of preprolactin (pPrl) mRNA larger than the mature mRNA have been reported (Maurer, R. A., Gubbins, E. J., Erwin, C. R., and Donelson, J. E. (1980) J Biol. Chem. 255, 2243-2246). We examined the size distribution of pPrl transcripts in nuclear, cytoplasmic, and nuclear poly(A)-containing RNA from rat pituitary tumor MtTW10 and from the pituitaries of diethylstilbestrol-treated Fischer 344 X Holtzman rats. RNA was electrophoresed in agarose/2.2 M formaldehyde horizontal slab gels, transferred to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper or to nitro-cellulose paper, and hybridized with a nick-translated recombinant DNA probe containing rat pPrl cDNA sequences. Up to 8 putative precursor mRNA molecules were detected which were from 2 to 13 times the length of mature pPrl mRNA. Three of these RNA species were larger than the maximum size of putative precursors previously reported. These probable precursors were nuclear in origin and polyadenylated, at least in the case of pituitary tumor cells. The largest molecule, 14 kilobase pairs long, may approximate the size of the initial transcript of the prolactin gene."

https://openalex.org/W162098833,"This study is concerned with the subunits of the eighth component of human complement (C8) and their role in facilitating specific incorporation of C8 into the membrane-bound cytolytic complex of complement. The noncovalently associated alpha-gamma and beta subunits of C8 were purified and examined for their ability to interact independently with the C8 binding site on C5b-7, the membrane-bound precursor of the cytolytic complex. Using erythrocyte-bound C5b-7 (EAC1-7), it was observed that native C8 and its isolated beta subunit have similar high affinities for this complex. Binding of beta to EAC1-7 was specific for the C8 binding site as evidenced by the fact that 1) nearly identical molar amounts of either C8 or beta were required to saturate C8 binding sites on EAC1-7; 2) pretreatment of EAC1-7 with saturating amounts of beta prevented binding of C8; and 3) pretreatment of EAC1-7 with saturating amounts of C8 prevented binding of beta. In related experiments, alpha-gamma alone had no affinity for EAC1-7, however, binding comparable to that exhibited by native C8 occurred if alpha-gamma was first incubated with an equimolar amount of beta. Other experiments showed that if EAC1-7 was first saturated with beta to produce EAC1-7(beta), alpha-gamma also bound to yield functional C8 on the cell surface. These results provide conclusive evidence that structural features of C8 which are essential for specific recognition by membrane-bound C5b-7 are contained in the beta subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1587019601,"The synthesis/hydrolysis of cholesteryl oleate as catalyzed by porcine pancreatic cholesterol esterase has been studied in lipid films at the air-buffer interface. With only reactants and products initially present at the interface, equilibrium is rapidly attained at subphase enzyme concentrations of 4 x 10(-8) M or less. The equilibrium constant for the reaction, 1.4 x 10(-8) mol/cm2, is independent of pH, initial composition, and surface pressure. Lecithin, if present in molar excess relative to the sum of free and esterified cholesterol, is inhibitory. Inhibition is associated with division of the substrate into reactive and unreactive pools which are not exchangeable. Bile salts and other surfactants reverse the inhibition at concentrations one-tenth their critical micelle concentrations. Presumably this occurs through formation of a surfactant surface excess at the lipid-water interface which disrupts the unreactive lecithin-substrate complex. The adsorption of cholesterol esterase to oleic acid monolayers is first order with respect to enzyme and is saturable. At saturation, the enzyme forms a close packed monolayer at the lipid-water interface with a molecular area of 4510 A2. Adsorption of cholesterol esterase to lecithin monolayers is less than one-tenth that to oleic acid monolayers and is proportional to subphase enzyme concentration. With either lipid monolayer, enzyme denaturation at the interface was negligible. In the presence of substrate, differences in enzyme absorption can only partially account for the observed inhibition of catalysis by lecithin, indicating that the reactivity or availability of substrate to the adsorbed enzyme is also affected."

https://openalex.org/W1504887823,"Rapid kinetic techniques were employed to measure the transport of the nonmetabolizable hexose, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, in suspensions of human HeLa cells, mouse L- and P388 leukemia cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells in zero-trans entry and exit and equilibrium exchange procedures. The kinetic parameters of transport were computed by fitting appropriate integrated rate equations to time courses of transmembrane equilibration of radiolabeled substrate. Transport of all four lines, as in Novikoff rat hepatoma cells, conformed to a simple carrier model with directional symmetry but differential mobility of loaded and empty carrier. As was apparent from a comparison of influx and exchange flux, the loaded carrier of all cell types moved between 4 and 14 times faster than the empty carrier. ATP depletion of the cells by incubation in glucose-free medium containing KCN and iodoacetate had no significant effect on the kinetic properties of the transporter. ATP-depleted cells were used to measure the transport of D-glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, D-galactose, and D-glucosamine in the absence of intracellular metabolism. The differential mobilities of empty carrier and carrier loaded with these hexoses and the efficiency of their transport were equivalent to those observed with 3-O-methylglucose, but the Michaelis-Menten constants for the transport of D-galactose and D-glucosamine were 5-8-fold higher than those for D-glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and 3-O-methylglucose, which were about equivalent."

https://openalex.org/W1594286521,"Molecular hybridization experiments provided new evidence for the dimeric nature of the membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement. Monomeric C5b-6, which constitutes the first intermediate complex in MAC formation, was prepared in two differentially labeled forms: biotin-125I-C5b-6 and 131I-C5b-6. Using a mixture of the differentially labeled C5b-6, the MAC was assembled on phospholipid vesicles upon addition of C7, C8, and C9. The assembled MAC containing biotin-125I and 131I was extracted from the vesicles with deoxycholate, purified, and exposed to avidin-Sepharose. Biotin-mediated binding of the MAC to avidin-Sepharose not only effected binding of 125I, but also of 131I, indicating that both radiolabels resided in the same molecular entity. When equimolar amounts of differentially labeled C5b-6 were available for MAC formation, 50% of MAC formed contained one molecule of each form. Theoretical analysis of the experimental data clearly favored the dimer structure over the structure of a higher oligomer. In contrast, fluid phase SC5b-9 was clearly monomeric on the basis of the same analysis. The electron microscopic appearance of the biotinated MAC hybrid closely resembled that of the characteristic membrane lesions of complement lysed cells. An avidin-ferritin conjugate attached itself to the ring-shaped portion of the biotinated MAC and not to its perpendicular structures, suggesting that C5b-6 is an integral part of the ring structure of the MAC."
https://openalex.org/W131052506,"The structural nature of the iron-sulfur clusters of NADH dehydrogenase from beef heart mitochondria has been studied by the cluster extrusion technique. Enzyme samples were unfolded anaerobically in 80% (v/v) hexamethylphosphoramide/aqueous buffer in the presence of o-xylyl-alpha,alpha'-dithiol as the displacing agent and the extruded clusters were then reacted with p-trifluoromethylbenzenethiol and analyzed by Fourier transform 19F NMR at 339 MHz. Whenever extrusion was nearly complete, both binuclear and tetranuclear clusters were found at a mole ratio of approximately 2:1. Thus, the dehydrogenase, with 16 g atoms of non-heme iron present/mol of FMN, contains most likely four [2Fe-2S] and two [4Fe-4S] clusters. Because the enzyme contains four or, at the most five, EPR-detectable iron-sulfur centers, it appears that one or more of the clusters are EPR-silent."
https://openalex.org/W1561181540,The positions of the half-cystines in the hormone carrier neurophysin are compared with those in three cystine-rich plant proteins. This suggests that neurophysin is a molecule of two domains with each very similar in structure to the domains in wheat germ agglutinin. It is further proposed that in proneurophysin the hormone (oxytocin or vasopressin) is covalently linked to the COOH terminus of neurophysin.

The difference spectra are characterized by an isosbestic point at 372 nm, a positive peak at 387 nm, and two negative peaks at 360 and 330 nm. The study of the concentration dependence and the effect of temperature allowed the determination of the molar extinction change and the dimerization equilibrium constant at four temperatures. The van't Hoff plot is linear, and the following thermodynamic parameters are calculated: standard enthalpy change, delta Ho/kJ . mol-1 = -31.0; and standard entropy change, delta So/J . mol-1 . K-1 = -69.5. For colcemid, similar results are obtained. The difference spectra show an isosbestic point at 385 nm and a positive peak at 397 nm. The thermodynamic parameters obtained are delta Ho/kJ . mol-1 = -26.8, and delta So/J . mol-1 . K-1 = -61.1. These thermodynamic parameters are comparable to the values obtained for the dimerization of polar dyes and the stacking of nucleotide bases."

Sexual attractivity can be induced in female T. melanogaster without estrogen treatment by heavy feeding, which results in significant increases in liver size and activity."

https://openalex.org/W1485923810,"Rat liver microsomal membranes were purified in order to remove membrane-associated secretory products. Measurements of the decay of the newly synthesized protein of these membranes in vivo were carried out at short time intervals after the protein was labeled by the administration of radioactive leucine. The result of these measurements suggest that the membranes are synthesized and degraded at approximately the same rapid rate as the synthesis and secretion of membrane-associated secretory products. Evidence that the highly dynamic protein of the purified membranes is indeed membrane protein is provided by the observations indicating: that this protein is immunochemically distinct from serum proteins, which are the major secretory product of liver; that many different protein components of the membranes turn over at similarly rapid rates; and that the biosynthesis of these proteins is specifically stimulated by the administration of phenobarbital, which is known to stimulate biosynthesis of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. These findings suggest that in liver, as had been proposed earlier for the myeloma cell, unidirectional membrane flow, accompanied by rapid synthesis at the origin of flow and rapid degradation of the membranes at or near the terminus of flow, may be the mechanism for the intracellular transport of secretory product."

https://openalex.org/W1498753138,"The effect of pyridine homologues on proton leakage, respiratory control, oxidative phosphorylation, and H+/O ratio in mitochondria have been examined. Up to a concentration of 1 mM, hydrophobic pyridine homologues diminish respiratory control in bovine heart mitochondria by increasing the State 4 respiration rate but have relatively minor effects on the State 3 and the 2,4-dinitrophenol-uncoupled respiration rates. Neither the proton gradient generated by electron transport in mitochondria in the presence of potassium ion and valinomycin, nor the rate of its anaerobic decay was affected by pyridine homologues. These observations suggest that the basal rate of electron transport is governed not directly by proton gradient, but by molecular processes in the energy-transducing membrane which can be affected by the proton gradient. By assuming that pyridine homologues are bound at low concentrations to specific functional groups in the inner membrane, the observed rates of State 4 respiration can be related quantitatively to the concentration of the organic base in solution. The observation that low concentrations of pyridine homologues decrease the H+/O ratio of mitochondria seems difficult to reconcile with the assumption that proton extrusion is driven directly by electron transport."
