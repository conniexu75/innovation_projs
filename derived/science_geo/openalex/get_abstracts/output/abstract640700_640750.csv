Consequently, regenerative approaches have significant potential for treating chronic demyelinating diseases. Here, we show that the differentiation potential of adult rodent OPCs decreases with age. Aged OPCs become unresponsive to pro-differentiation signals, suggesting intrinsic constraints on therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing OPC differentiation. This decline in functional capacity is associated with hallmarks of cellular aging, including decreased metabolic function and increased DNA damage. Fasting or treatment with metformin can reverse these changes and restore the regenerative capacity of aged OPCs, improving remyelination in aged animals following focal demyelination. Aged OPCs treated with metformin regain responsiveness to pro-differentiation signals, suggesting synergistic effects of rejuvenation and pro-differentiation therapies. These findings provide insight into aging-associated remyelination failure and suggest therapeutic interventions for reversing such declines in chronic disease.

The ability to regenerate oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the CNS, contrasts with the poor capacity to regenerate neurons in most brain regions (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2017Franklin R.J.M.

Generation of oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) occurs throughout life and contributes to myelin turnover (Young et al., 2013Young K.M. Psachoulia K. Tripathi R.B.

As with most regenerative processes, the efficiency of remyelination declines progressively with aging to the extent that it becomes so slow that it eventually fails (Oh et al., 2014Oh J. Lee Y.D. Wagers A.J. Stem cell aging: mechanisms, regulators and therapeutic opportunities.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, Sim et al., 2002Sim F.J. Zhao C. Penderis J.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has important implications for chronic demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) that can extend over several decades. Delayed remyelination renders demyelinated axons susceptible to irreversible degeneration, a phenomenon that underpins the progressive neurological decline associated with the later stages of MS (Franklin et al., 2012Franklin R.J.M. ffrench-Constant C. Edgar J.M. Smith K.J. Neuroprotection and repair in multiple sclerosis.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2012; 8: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The slowing of remyelination with aging is characterized by impaired recruitment of OPCs into the lesion area as well as their delayed differentiation into oligodendrocytes (Sim et al., 2002Sim F.J. Zhao C. Penderis J. Franklin R.J.M. The age-related decrease in CNS remyelination efficiency is attributable to an impairment of both oligodendrocyte progenitor recruitment and differentiation.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chronically demyelinated MS lesions either lack OPCs or, more commonly, contain OPCs that have failed to differentiate (Boyd et al., 2013Boyd A. Zhang H. Williams A.

Increasing the number of OPCs in white matter lesions of aged animals does not improve remyelination (Woodruff et al., 2004Woodruff R.H. Fruttiger M. Richardson W.D. Franklin R.J.M. Platelet-derived growth factor regulates oligodendrocyte progenitor numbers in adult CNS and their response following CNS demyelination.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), indicating that differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes is the bottleneck for remyelination. The mechanisms that regulate OPC differentiation are dysregulated in the aging brain (Shen et al., 2008Shen S. Sandoval J. Swiss V.A. Li J. Dupree J. Franklin R.J.M. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Age-dependent epigenetic control of differentiation inhibitors is critical for remyelination efficiency.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1024-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), in part because of age-related changes in the cells and molecules in the environment in which remyelination occurs (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2018Cantuti-Castelvetri L. Fitzner D. Bosch-Queralt M. Weil M.T. Su M. Sen P. Ruhwedel T. Mitkovski M. Trendelenburg G.

Retinoid X receptor activation reverses age-related deficiencies in myelin debris phagocytosis and remyelination.Brain. 2015; 138: 3581-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These changes can be overcome, in principle, by providing a more youthful systemic environment that is permissive for regeneration (Ruckh et al., 2012Ruckh J.M. Zhao J.W. Shadrach J.L. van Wijngaarden P. Rao T.N. Wagers A.J. Franklin R.J.M. Rejuvenation of regeneration in the aging central nervous system.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 96-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Thus, remyelination can potentially be enhanced by pro-differentiation factors lacking in the aged brain. However, it remains unclear whether OPCs undergo intrinsic changes with aging that affect their responsiveness to differentiation signals. We first asked whether age-related changes in OPCs contribute to the differentiation delay observed in aged animals during remyelination (Sim et al., 2002Sim F.J. Zhao C. Penderis J. Franklin R.J.M. The age-related decrease in CNS remyelination efficiency is attributable to an impairment of both oligodendrocyte progenitor recruitment and differentiation.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of OPC aging have been hampered by the technical challenges of culturing OPCs isolated from the aged adult rodent CNS. Thus, we first optimized existing protocols to establish cultures of adult OPCs from young adult (2–3 months) and aged (20–24 months) rats (Figure S1; Dugas and Emery, 2013Dugas J.C. Emery B. Purification and culture of oligodendrocyte lineage cells.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2013; 2013: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We used magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) for A2B5 to isolate cells from young and aged adult brains (Figure S1A). The positively selected cells showed minor contamination for CD11b+ microglia (<0.8%) or MOG+ oligodendrocytes (<2%) with no significant difference between preparations from young and aged animals (Figures S1B–S1D). Using immunohistochemistry, we found that A2B5+ cells of both age groups co-expressed PDGFRa, NG2, Sox10, and Olig2, confirming their identity as OPCs (Figures S1E–S1I and S1N–S1R). In contrast, A2B5+ cells from young or aged adults never expressed mature lineage markers such as CNPase and MBP (Figures S1J and S1K), the microglia marker Cd11b (Figure S1L), or the astrocyte marker GFAP (Figure S1M), indicating that cultures were free of mature oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. This enabled us to compare the differentiation efficiency of OPCs isolated from the young adult and aged CNS. We next tested the relative differentiation ability of OPCs from young adults (hereafter referred to as young OPCs) and OPCs from old adults (aged OPCs) when grown in differentiation medium from which the growth factors that maintain proliferation were removed. Although 60% of young OPCs differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes (CNPase+ and MBP+), fewer than 20% of aged OPCs acquired these markers within the same period, revealing a slower inherent capacity for differentiation (Figures 1A–1C). We next assessed how adult OPCs responded to thyroid hormone (T3), a well-established promoter of OPC differentiation (Gao et al., 1998Gao F.B. Apperly J. Raff M. Cell-intrinsic timers and thyroid hormone regulate the probability of cell-cycle withdrawal and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although T3 accelerated the differentiation of young OPCs, there was no significant effect on the differentiation of aged OPCs (Figures 1B and 1C). Similar results were obtained with other factors known to have pro-differentiation effects on OPCs derived from newborn animals or on pluripotent stem cells, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (Huang et al., 2011Huang J.K. Jarjour A.A. Nait Oumesmar B. Kerninon C. Williams A. Krezel W. Kagechika H. Bauer J. Zhao C. Baron-Van Evercooren A. et al.Retinoid X receptor gamma signaling accelerates CNS remyelination.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), miconazole (Najm et al., 2015Najm F.J. Madhavan M. Zaremba A. Shick E. Karl R.T. Factor D.C. Miller T.E. Nevin Z.S. Kantor C. Sargent A. et al.Drug-based modulation of endogenous stem cells promotes functional remyelination in vivo.Nature. 2015; 522: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and benzatropine (Deshmukh et al., 2013Deshmukh V.A. Tardif V. Lyssiotis C.A. Green C.C. Kerman B. Kim H.J. Padmanabhan K. Swoboda J.G. Ahmad I. Kondo T. et al.A regenerative approach to the treatment of multiple sclerosis.Nature. 2013; 502: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), all of which enhanced differentiation in young adult (Figures 1E and 1F) but not aged OPCs (Figures 1E, 1G, and S4). Cultures of aged OPCs were generally of lower cell density, suggesting decreased survival. Because the density might influence the differentiation rate through secretion of paracrine factors, we asked whether increasing the cellular density might rescue the differentiation ability of aged OPCs or reduce the differentiation rate of young OPCs. Seeding half of the normal number of young OPCs or twice the number of aged OPCs did not result in a significant change in differentiation rates (Figures S2A–S2E), indicating that the differences in cellular density between young and aged cultures do not account for the reduced differentiation of aged OPCs. Because some aged OPCs differentiated into MBP+ oligodendrocytes, we asked whether the non-differentiating cells were unable to differentiate or were differentiating at a slower rate. To test this, we cultured aged OPCs for 4 weeks in differentiation medium and found a significant increase in differentiation (Figures S2D and S2E), indicating that aged OPCs do not lose their general ability for differentiation but undergo intrinsic changes that significantly slow their differentiation program. These intrinsic changes also cause aging OPCs to become less responsive to factors that induce differentiation, which likely contributes to the failure of oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation, characteristic of many non-remyelinating chronic MS lesions (Kuhlmann et al., 2008Kuhlmann T. Miron V. Cui Q. Wegner C. Antel J. Brück W. Differentiation block of oligodendroglial progenitor cells as a cause for remyelination failure in chronic multiple sclerosis.Brain. 2008; 131: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Next we characterized molecular alterations responsible for the aged OPC phenotype using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare the transcriptomes of OPCs isolated from young and aged rats. Approximately 20% of all genes were differentially expressed with aging (1.5-fold change in expression, adjusted p value [p.adj] < 0.05). Among the genes more highly expressed in young adult OPCs were those that are characteristic of adult OPCs in 21-day-old mice (Marques et al., 2016Marques S. Zeisel A. Codeluppi S. van Bruggen D. Mendanha Falcão A. Xiao L. Li H. Häring M. Hochgerner H. Romanov R.A. et al.Oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in the mouse juvenile and adult central nervous system.Science. 2016; 352: 1326-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar; Figure 2A) and their self-renewal, including Pdgfra, Ascl1, and Ptprz1 (Emery, 2010Emery B. Regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.Science. 2010; 330: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar; Figure 2B; .Table S1). In contrast, aged OPCs expressed higher levels of the early differentiation markers Cnp1, Sirt2, and Enpp6 (Figure 2B). Because we did not find a higher proportion of MOG+ cells or those expressing more mature lineage markers, such as CNPase, in our aged OPC preparations compared with young OPCs (Figures S1J and S1K), we ruled out the possibility that these changes in the transcriptome were caused by contamination with oligodendrocytes. Thus, we concluded that aged OPCs lose their characteristic stem cell signature (Figures 2A and 2B). To identify the cellular processes that might contribute to the aged OPC state, we used ingenuity pathway analysis on genes preferentially expressed in aged OPCs. We found enrichment of terms that are closely linked to organismal and stem cell aging, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy, inflammasome signaling, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (Figure 2C). Consistent with the predictions made on the basis of the RNA-seq data, we found increased mTOR activity in freshly isolated aged OPCs by detection of the phosphorylated forms of the downstream target p70S6-kinase (Figure 2D). mTOR activity is a crucial regulator of adult stem cell quiescence, activation, and differentiation (Mihaylova et al., 2014Mihaylova M.M.

Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). Aging is associated with increased and dysregulated mTOR activity, which contributes to DNA damage and cellular senescence (Castilho et al., 2009Castilho R.M. Squarize C.H. Chodosh L.A. Williams B.O. Gutkind J.S. mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2009Chen C.

Pten dependence distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells from leukaemia-initiating cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). We therefore predicted that both DNA damage and markers of senescence would increase with adult OPC aging. Consistent with this prediction, single-cell comet assays revealed that aged OPCs had significantly more DNA damage than young OPCs (Figures 2E and 2F). Using our RNA-seq data, we also found that aged OPCs expressed several genes associated with cellular senescence at significantly higher levels than young OPCs (Figure 2G; Tacutu et al., 2018Tacutu R. Thornton D. Johnson E. Budovsky A. Barardo D. Craig T. Diana E. Lehmann G. Toren D. Wang J. et al.Human Ageing Genomic Resources: new and updated databases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: D1083-D1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We found that aged OPCs had 8-fold higher mRNA levels of the senescence marker Cdkn2a (Figure 2H). Last, aged OPCs had lower levels of ATP and reduced cellular respiration (Figures 2I and 2J), likely reflecting a combination of mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced mitochondrial content. Thus, aged OPCs, like other adult stem cells, acquire a variety of hallmarks of aging that likely contribute to loss of their regenerative potential. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that reversal of these age-related changes in OPCs might be necessary to reinstate their differentiation potential. We therefore explored strategies known to alter the effects of aging as a potential strategy to improve OPC function and remyelination in aged animals. Dietary restriction is the most effective intervention known to alter the organismal aging process (Fontana and Partridge, 2015Fontana L. Partridge L. Promoting health and longevity through diet: from model organisms to humans.Cell. 2015; 161: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) and it does so in part by enhancing the function of aged adult stem cells (Cerletti et al., 2012Cerletti M.

To test the effect of dietary restriction on remyelination, we subjected 12-month-old rats, an age when remyelination rate is substantially slower than in young adult rats (Sim et al., 2002Sim F.J. Zhao C. Penderis J. Franklin R.J.M. The age-related decrease in CNS remyelination efficiency is attributable to an impairment of both oligodendrocyte progenitor recruitment and differentiation.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Shields et al., 1999Shields S.A. Gilson J.M. Blakemore W.F. Franklin R.J.M. Remyelination occurs as extensively but more slowly in old rats compared to young rats following gliotoxin-induced CNS demyelination.Glia. 1999; 28: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), to alternate-day fasting (ADF) for 6 months (Figure 3A). We confirmed that OPCs from 12-month-old rats, like those from 24-month-old rats, were impaired in their differentiation and unable to respond to differentiation signals (Figure S3). At the end of the 6-month fasting period, we induced demyelination in cerebellar white matter by focal injection of ethidium bromide, a well-established in vivo model for studying remyelination (Woodruff and Franklin, 1999Woodruff R.H. Franklin R.J.M. Demyelination and remyelination of the caudal cerebellar peduncle of adult rats following stereotaxic injections of lysolecithin, ethidium bromide, and complement/anti-galactocerebroside: a comparative study.Glia. 1999; 25: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We assessed the degree of remyelination 50 days post lesion (dpl) induction in semi-thin resin sections stained with toluidine blue, in which remyelinated axons are easily identifiable by their thin myelin sheaths (Blakemore, 1974Blakemore W.F. Pattern of remyelination in the CNS.Nature. 1974; 249: 577-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; Figure 3B), which was confirmed by examination of electron micrographs (Figure 3C). Although remyelination in ad libitum-fed animals was restricted to the border of the lesion, animals undergoing fasting consistently exhibited nearly complete remyelination (Figures 3B and 3C). The clear difference in the extent of remyelination between the two groups was reflected by a blind ranking analysis of semi-thin sections of lesions as well as quantification of the percentage of remyelinated axons within the lesions (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3E). We also compared g ratios of control and treatment groups but found no differences, suggesting that the effect of ADF is on the extent rather than the quality of remyelination (Figure S5A). To further explore fasting-enhanced remyelination in aged animals, we characterized the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of OPCs during remyelination. At 7 dpl, there was no difference in the density of OPCs within lesions of animals subjected to fasting or ad libitum feeding (Figures 3F–3H). However, the density of mature oligodendrocytes (Olig2+/CC1+) was 2-fold greater in the lesions of fasting animals compared with those of controls at both 21 and 50 dpl (Figures 3I and 3J). The proportion of Olig2+ cells expressing CC1 was significantly higher in lesions of fasting rats at both time points relative to controls, suggesting enhanced OPC differentiation (Figure 3K). The positive effects of fasting regimens on adult stem cells has been attributed to alterations within the stem cells and to changes in the stem cell niche or in the systemic environment (Cerletti et al., 2012Cerletti M.

Selig M. et al.mTORC1 in the Paneth cell niche couples intestinal stem-cell function to calorie intake.Nature. 2012; 486: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the observed effect of fasting on remyelination is likely the consequence of changes in a variety of cell types (such as astrocytes, inflammatory cells, and vascular cells as well as OPCs) associated with the lesion, caused by changes in the systemic environment. To determine whether the enhanced differentiation capacity of aged OPCs in fasting animals was at least in part due to intrinsic alterations within the OPCs, we isolated OPCs from unlesioned ADF and control aged animals. We found that OPCs derived from fasting animals differentiated into MBP+ oligodendrocytes more rapidly than those from age-matched control rats (Figures 3L and 3M) and with efficiency comparable with OPCs from young rats (Figure 1). Moreover, OPCs derived from fasting animals expressed higher levels of OPC self-renewal genes (Figure S4A), lower levels of differentiation genes (Figure S4A), and lower levels of Cdkn2a (Figure S4B); exhibited less DNA damage (Figures S4C and S4D); showed reduced levels of phosphorylated p70S6K (Figure S4E); and had higher ATP levels (Figure S4F). Thus, we concluded that ADF restored remyelination in part through the functional rejuvenation of aged OPCs. To address whether effects on other cell types also contributed to enhanced remyelination in ADF animals, we assessed the density of GFAP+ astrocytes and Iba1+ innate immune cells within the lesion during remyelination. In neither case was there a significant change between samples from fasting and control animals (Figures S5B–S5E). However, we found that removal of myelin debris was improved in animals undergoing fasting (Figures S5F–S5H), suggest functional changes in phagocytic cells within the lesion and a potential mechanism contributing to the improved remyelination outcome in ADF animals (Ruckh et al., 2012Ruckh J.M.

Because dietary restriction protocols are difficult to translate into a clinical context, we asked whether the small-molecule fasting mimetic metformin might replicate the effects of fasting.

https://openalex.org/W2977502951,"The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant infections is prompting increased interest in phage-based antimicrobials. However, acquisition of resistance by bacteria is a major issue in the successful development of phage therapies. Through natural evolution and structural modeling, we identified host-range-determining regions (HRDRs) in the T3 phage tail fiber protein and developed a high-throughput strategy to genetically engineer these regions through site-directed mutagenesis. Inspired by antibody specificity engineering, this approach generates deep functional diversity while minimizing disruptions to the overall tail fiber structure, resulting in synthetic ""phagebodies."" We showed that mutating HRDRs yields phagebodies with altered host-ranges, and select phagebodies enable long-term suppression of bacterial growth in vitro, by preventing resistance appearance, and are functional in vivo using a murine model. We anticipate that this approach may facilitate the creation of next-generation antimicrobials that slow resistance development and could be extended to other viral scaffolds for a broad range of applications."

All subunits contain intracellular N and C termini, two transmembrane (TM) helices that form the pore, and an extracellular domain containing the orthosteric ATP binding site (Habermacher et al., 2016Habermacher C.

Although ATP activates each P2X receptor subtype, its affinity varies significantly, from nanomolar (P2X1,3) through low micromolar (P2X2,4) to hundreds of micromolar (P2X7). In addition, receptor subtypes have different rates of desensitization, ranging from fast (milliseconds in P2X1,3) through slow (seconds in P2X2,4) to complete lack of desensitization (P2X7) (Jarvis and Khakh, 2009Jarvis M.F.

The significantly lower affinity for ATP and complete lack of desensitization set the P2X7 receptor apart from any other P2X receptor family member. Moreover, P2X7 is the only subtype that acts as a cytotoxic receptor in multiple signaling pathways (Costa-Junior et al., 2011Costa-Junior H.M. Sarmento Vieira F. Coutinho-Silva R.

Despite the importance of P2X receptors, the molecular principles governing their pharmacology, gating, and signal transduction are incompletely understood. The cytoplasmic termini of P2X receptors are thought to play a key role in receptor desensitization (Allsopp and Evans, 2011Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J.

To date, the only structural insight into any P2X receptor cytoplasmic domain has been obtained from a minimally truncated human P2X3 (hP2X3) receptor (Li et al., 2019Li M. Wang Y. Banerjee R.

X-ray structures define human P2X(3) receptor gating cycle and antagonist action.Nature. 2016; 538: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This structure revealed how N- and C-terminal residues form a dynamic structural domain termed the “cytoplasmic cap,” the stability of which dictates the lifetime of the open pore conformation and therefore sets the rate of receptor desensitization (Mansoor et al., 2016Mansoor S.E. Lü W. Oosterheert W. Shekhar M. Tajkhorshid E. Gouaux E. X-ray structures define human P2X(3) receptor gating cycle and antagonist action.Nature. 2016; 538: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast to other P2X subtypes, P2X7 has a unique cytoplasmic domain with two additional elements (Surprenant et al., 1996Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. The cytolytic P2Z receptor for extracellular ATP identified as a P2X receptor (P2X7).Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar): a cytoplasmic cysteine-rich (C-cys) region (Allsopp and Evans, 2015Allsopp R.C.

Chem. 2015; 290: 14556-14566Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) at the end of the second transmembrane domain (TM2) that we named the C-cys anchor and an additional 120 residues in the C terminus that we named the cytoplasmic ballast. The cytoplasmic ballast, specifically, has been implicated in modulating the P2X7 receptor’s ability to undergo pore dilation and initiate cytolytic signal transduction (Cheewatrakoolpong et al., 2005Cheewatrakoolpong B. Gilchrest H. Anthes J.C. Greenfeder S. Identification and characterization of splice variants of the human P2X7 ATP channel.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Until now, no structural information has been available for either of these cytoplasmic elements. To understand the distinct functional properties of the P2X7 receptor and investigate the structure of its large and enigmatic cytoplasmic domain, we used single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to solve the structures of full-length rat P2X7 (rP2X7) in both apo (closed pore) and ATP-bound (open pore) states. Our structures suggest why the P2X7 receptor subtype has a low affinity for ATP, demonstrate that palmitoylation of residues in the C-cys anchor prevents receptor desensitization, and reveal a novel fold for the cytoplasmic ballast. Unexpectedly, we found a dinuclear zinc ion complex and a high-affinity guanosine nucleotide binding site in the cytoplasmic ballast, features whose function is still unknown but that potentially provide a new framework for future experiments to explain the unique signaling properties of P2X7 receptors (Cheewatrakoolpong et al., 2005Cheewatrakoolpong B.

To gain insight into the structure of mammalian P2X7 receptors, full-length, wild-type rat P2X7 receptor (rP2X7-WT) was reconstituted into detergent micelles for single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (Figure S1). As expected, rP2X7-WT was activated by ATP and did not undergo desensitization when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Figures S2A and S2B). The three-dimensional reconstructions of the apo (closed state; Figure 1) and ATP-bound (open state; Figures S2C–S2J) structures of rP2X7-WT were resolved to an estimated 2.9 Å and 3.3 Å, respectively (Figures S3 and S4).

Each protomer has a hydrophilic extracellular domain, two TM-spanning α helices, and intracellular termini (Figure 1). However, unlike other P2X receptor subtypes, P2X7 possesses a large cytoplasmic domain that has been visualized here for the first time in both apo (Figures 1A and 1D) and open state (Figures S2C and S2F) conformations. The three protomers intertwine by extensive domain swapping so that each protomer undergoes a relative ∼120° clockwise rotation from the extracellular domain to the TM domain, followed by a ∼120° counterclockwise rotation from the TM domain to the cytoplasmic domain (Figures 1B–1D; Figures S2D–S2F). As observed previously in the open state of hP2X3 (Mansoor et al., 2016Mansoor S.E. Lü W. Oosterheert W. Shekhar M. Tajkhorshid E. Gouaux E.

The cytoplasmic cap is located beneath the TM domain, and its formation and stability are proposed to govern the kinetics of desensitization in the fast-desensitizing hP2X3 receptor (Mansoor et al., 2016Mansoor S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2977737202,"Sleep has been implicated in both memory consolidation and forgetting of experiences. However, it is unclear what governs the balance between consolidation and forgetting. Here, we tested how activity-dependent processing during sleep might differentially regulate these two processes. We specifically examined how neural reactivations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were causally linked to consolidation versus weakening of the neural correlates of neuroprosthetic skill. Strikingly, we found that slow oscillations (SOs) and delta (δ) waves have dissociable and competing roles in consolidation versus forgetting. By modulating cortical spiking linked to SOs or δ waves using closed-loop optogenetic methods, we could, respectively, weaken or strengthen consolidation and thereby bidirectionally modulate sleep-dependent performance gains. We further found that changes in the temporal coupling of spindles to SOs relative to δ waves could account for such effects. Thus, our results indicate that neural activity driven by SOs and δ waves have competing roles in sleep-dependent memory consolidation."

Following lung injury, NE cells proliferate and generate other cell types to promote epithelial repair. Here, we show that only rare NE cells, typically 2-4 per cluster, function as stem cells. These fully differentiated cells display features of classical stem cells. Most proliferate (self-renew) following injury, and some migrate into the injured area. A week later, individual cells, often just one per cluster, lose NE identity (deprogram), transit amplify, and reprogram to other fates, creating large clonal repair patches. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor suppressors regulate the stem cells: Rb and p53 suppress self-renewal, whereas Notch marks the stem cells and initiates deprogramming and transit amplification. We propose that NE stem cells give rise to SCLC, and transformation results from constitutive activation of stem cell renewal and inhibition of deprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2979803667,"The human gut microbiome can influence health through the brain-gut-microbiome axis. Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome can influence sleep quality. Previous studies that have examined sleep deprivation and the human gut microbiome have yielded conflicting results. A recent study found that sleep deprivation leads to changes in gut microbiome composition while a different study found that sleep deprivation does not lead to changes in gut microbiome. Accordingly, the relationship between sleep physiology and the gut microbiome remains unclear. To address this uncertainty, we used actigraphy to quantify sleep measures coupled with gut microbiome sampling to determine how the gut microbiome correlates with various measures of sleep physiology. We measured immune system biomarkers and carried out a neurobehavioral assessment as these variables might modify the relationship between sleep and gut microbiome composition. We found that total microbiome diversity was positively correlated with increased sleep efficiency and total sleep time, and was negatively correlated with wake after sleep onset. We found positive correlations between total microbiome diversity and interleukin-6, a cytokine previously noted for its effects on sleep. Analysis of microbiome composition revealed that within phyla richness of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were positively correlated with sleep efficiency, interleukin-6 concentrations and abstract thinking. Finally, we found that several taxa (Lachnospiraceae, Corynebacterium, and Blautia) were negatively correlated with sleep measures. Our findings initiate linkages between gut microbiome composition, sleep physiology, the immune system and cognition. They may lead to mechanisms to improve sleep through the manipulation of the gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2977672538,"Hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most prevalent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). One pathogenic mechanism is the aberrant accumulation of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins produced by the unconventional translation of expanded RNA repeats. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens for modifiers of DPR protein production in human cells. We found that DDX3X, an RNA helicase, suppresses the repeat-associated non-AUG translation of GGGGCC repeats. DDX3X directly binds to (GGGGCC)n RNAs but not antisense (CCCCGG)n RNAs. Its helicase activity is essential for the translation repression. Reduction of DDX3X increases DPR levels in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient cells and enhances (GGGGCC)n-mediated toxicity in Drosophila. Elevating DDX3X expression is sufficient to decrease DPR levels, rescue nucleocytoplasmic transport abnormalities, and improve survival of patient iPSC-differentiated neurons. This work identifies genetic modifiers of DPR protein production and provides potential therapeutic targets for C9ORF72-ALS/FTD."
https://openalex.org/W2978100335,"Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive cation channel with widespread physiological importance; however, its role in the heart is poorly understood. Cardiac fibroblasts help preserve myocardial integrity and play a key role in regulating its repair and remodeling following stress or injury. Here we investigated Piezo1 expression and function in cultured human and mouse cardiac fibroblasts. RT-PCR experiments confirmed that Piezo1 mRNA in cardiac fibroblasts is expressed at levels similar to those in endothelial cells. The results of a Fura-2 intracellular Ca2+ assay validated Piezo1 as a functional ion channel that is activated by its agonist, Yoda1. Yoda1-induced Ca2+ entry was inhibited by Piezo1 blockers (gadolinium and ruthenium red) and was reduced proportionally by siRNA-mediated Piezo1 knockdown or in murine Piezo1+/- cells. Results from cell-attached patch clamp recordings on human cardiac fibroblasts established that they contain mechanically activated ion channels and that their pressure responses are reduced by Piezo1 knockdown. Investigation of Yoda1 effects on selected remodeling genes indicated that Piezo1 activation increases both mRNA levels and protein secretion of IL-6, a pro-hypertrophic and profibrotic cytokine, in a Piezo1-dependent manner. Moreover, Piezo1 knockdown reduced basal IL-6 expression from cells cultured on softer collagen-coated substrates. Multiplex kinase activity profiling combined with kinase inhibitor experiments and phosphospecific immunoblotting established that Piezo1 activation stimulates IL-6 secretion via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase downstream of Ca2+ entry. In summary, cardiac fibroblasts express mechanically activated Piezo1 channels coupled to secretion of the paracrine signaling molecule IL-6. Piezo1 may therefore be important in regulating cardiac remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2977721529,"Post-transcriptional mechanisms have the potential to influence complex changes in gene expression, yet their role in cell fate transitions remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that suppression of the RNA helicase DDX6 endows human and mouse primed embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with a differentiation-resistant, ""hyper-pluripotent"" state, which readily reprograms to a naive state resembling the preimplantation embryo. We further demonstrate that DDX6 plays a key role in adult progenitors where it controls the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in a context-dependent manner. Mechanistically, DDX6 mediates the translational suppression of target mRNAs in P-bodies. Upon loss of DDX6 activity, P-bodies dissolve and release mRNAs encoding fate-instructive transcription and chromatin factors that re-enter the ribosome pool. Increased translation of these targets impacts cell fate by rewiring the enhancer, heterochromatin, and DNA methylation landscapes of undifferentiated cell types. Collectively, our data establish a link between P-body homeostasis, chromatin organization, and stem cell potency."

Mealybugs are notable for containing a nested bacteria-within-bacterium endosymbiotic structure in specialized insect cells, where one bacterium, Moranella, lives in the cytoplasm of another bacterium, Tremblaya. Here we show that horizontally transferred genes on the mealybug genome work together with genes retained on the Moranella genome to produce a PG layer exclusively at the Moranella cell periphery. Furthermore, we show that an insect protein encoded by a horizontally transferred gene of bacterial origin is transported into the Moranella cytoplasm. These results provide a striking parallel to the genetic and biochemical mosaicism found in organelles, and prove that multiple horizontally transferred genes can become integrated into a functional pathway distributed between animal and bacterial endosymbiont genomes.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurs when a gene is moved from the genome of one organism to another outside of the normal processes of vertical inheritance. HGT can, in principle, occur between any two DNA-based life-forms, but most often involves either movement of genes between microorganisms (Koonin et al., 2001Koonin E.V. Makarova K.S. Aravind L.

The process of HGT in the evolution of the cellular organelles derived from bacteria—the mitochondrion and the plastid—is not disputed and is often referred to as endosymbiont gene transfer (EGT) when the transferred genes seem to originate from the ancestral organelle genome (Keeling and Palmer, 2008Keeling P.J.

The role that HGT (that is, transfer from sources other than ancestral organelle genomes) has played in the evolution of organelles is less clear, but numerous examples of HGTs from bacteria unrelated to the mitochondrial or plastid ancestor are found in eukaryotic genomes (Gray, 2015Gray M.W.

No matter their genome of origin, the proteins that are produced from these EGTs and HGTs, and that function in organelles are transported there by specific multiprotein complexes (Neupert and Herrmann, 2007Neupert W.

This history of gene loss on organelle genomes and gene gain on nuclear genomes has led to complex mosaic biochemical pathways in organelles, where genes of diverse taxonomic origin reside on different genomes, and the protein products of these genes are shuttled to different parts of the cell without strict deference to their taxonomic origins (Duchêne et al., 2005Duchêne A.-M.

These functionally verified HGT events serve as important milestones in HGT research, but none approach the complex cellular and biochemical mosaicism observed in some organelle biochemical pathways that result from EGT and HGT. Genomic work on sap-feeding insects and their nutritional endosymbiotic bacteria has revealed a few cases where the complexity of bacterial integration into host cells seems to approach that of organelles (McCutcheon, 2016McCutcheon J.P.

These bacteria provide essential nutrients to their hosts and are thus required for normal host biology and survival (Akman Gündüz and Douglas, 2009Akman Gündüz E. Douglas A.E.

Biology bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts of plant sap-sucking insects.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 155-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Many of these endosymbionts are also long-term associates of their hosts, often living exclusively in special insect cells for tens or hundreds of millions of years (Moran et al., 2005Moran N.A.

Like organelles, they are also faithfully transmitted from one host generation to the next by maternal transmission (Koga et al., 2012Koga R. Meng X.-Y. Tsuchida T. Fukatsu T.

USA. 2012; 109: E1230-E1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This strict host association has resulted in extreme levels of gene loss and genome reduction in some endosymbionts, leading to bacterial genomes that are similar to organelle genomes in terms of gene number and genome size (McCutcheon and Moran, 2011McCutcheon J.P. Moran N.A. Extreme genome reduction in symbiotic bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 10: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, Moran and Bennett, 2014Moran N.A. Bennett G.M.

In a final parallel to organelle evolution, some of the insects harboring endosymbionts with tiny genomes appear to use both native host genes and genes acquired from bacterial HGTs to fill gaps in pathways formed by endosymbiont gene loss (Husnik et al., 2013Husnik F.

One of the most complex of these insect-endosymbiont relationships is found in Planococcus citri, an insect in a group commonly referred to as mealybugs. The P. citri symbiosis exists in an unusual structure (Figure 1A), where a gammaproteobacterium (Candidatus Moranella endobia; hereafter Moranella) resides in the cytoplasm of a betaproteobacterium (Candidatus Tremblaya princeps; hereafter Tremblaya), which together exist in specialized insect cells called bacteriocytes (von Dohlen et al., 2001von Dohlen C.D.

The Tremblaya genome is extremely small and maintains only ∼120 protein coding genes, whereas the Moranella genome is comparably larger but still encodes only ∼400 protein coding genes (López-Madrigal et al., 2013López-Madrigal S.

A PG layer is an almost universal feature of bacteria and is critical for bacterial cell division, shape, and integrity (Errington, 2013Errington J. L-form bacteria, cell walls and the origins of life.Open Biol. 2013; 3: 120143Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Otten et al., 2018Otten C. Brilli M. Vollmer W. Viollier P.H. Salje J.

From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 10: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Because PG is not produced by eukaryotes but is a nearly ubiquitous feature of bacteria, it is a potent activator of the eukaryotic innate immune response, and the highly conserved PG biosynthetic pathway is the target of many antibiotics (Dziarski, 2003Dziarski R. Recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan by the innate immune system.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1793-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, Otten et al., 2018Otten C. Brilli M. Vollmer W.

Peptidoglycan recognition by the innate immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The presence of numerous HGTs involved in PG synthesis on the nuclear genome of an insect was therefore surprising. Here we test whether mealybugs can use these PG-related genes of diverse taxonomic origins and scattered genomic locations to produce a spatially and chemically coherent PG layer. The synthesis of a complete PG layer in Gram-negative bacteria can be divided into three classes of reactions based on enzyme location (Figure 1B). The first set of reactions involves the cytoplasmic synthesis of the PG precursor, a β-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharide linked to an L-alanine (L-Ala)-D-glutamic acid (D-Glu)-meso-diaminopimelic acid (mDap)-D-alanine (D-Ala)-D-Ala pentapeptide. The second set of reactions involves inner membrane-associated enzymes that flip this PG precursor into the bacterial periplasm, and the third set of reactions involves the cross-linking of precursor molecules into the growing PG matrix, as well as PG modifications such as trimming the pentapeptide to an L-Ala-D-Glu-mDap-D-Ala tetrapeptide. Our original annotation of the PG biosynthetic pathway of P. citri focused on the first two sets of reactions because the Moranella genome encoded some of the enzymes required to flip PG into its periplasm, and because the bacterial-to-insect HGTs mostly involved the first set of reactions (Husnik et al., 2013Husnik F. Nikoh N. Koga R. Ross L. Duncan R.P. Fujie M. Tanaka M. Satoh N. Bachtrog D. Wilson A.C.C. et al.Horizontal gene transfer from diverse bacteria to an insect genome enables a tripartite nested mealybug symbiosis.Cell. 2013; 153: 1567-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). But our first annotation was not complete; there were unresolved holes in the cytoplasmic part of the pathway, and we paid little attention to the third part of PG synthesis. In an effort to better understand the functional potential of this mosaic PG biosynthetic pathway, we performed a detailed reannotation of the PG-related genes in this system (Figure 1B; Table S1). Our expanded annotation indicates that a PG layer, if produced, should be comprised of the canonical crosslinked β-1,4-linked GlcNAc-MurNAc disaccharide with an L-Ala-D-Glu-mDap-D-Ala tetrapeptide (Figure 1B; Table S1). Because no genes related to PG biosynthesis are found in the Tremblaya genome, we predict that Tremblaya should not possess a PG layer. We used liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; Bern et al., 2017Bern M. Beniston R. Mesnage S. Towards an automated analysis of bacterial peptidoglycan structure.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2017; 409: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to detect the presence of PG in samples prepared from ∼1,500 pooled P. citri mealybugs. Ions matching the expected m/z values for GlcNAc and MurNAc monomers and dimers, some bound to a tetrapeptide chain (L-Ala-D-Glu-mDap-D-Ala), were identified in the first stage of MS, and the structure of these molecules was confirmed by tandem MS (Figure 2). To rule out the presence of contaminating bacteria in mealybugs as a significant source of PG signal, we performed five replicate 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing runs on age-matched insects collected from the same mealybug colony used for LC-MS/MS and a sixth sample taken from a lysate used for MS analysis. On average ∼0.61% (range of 0.0604%–4.29%) of all amplicon reads were from bacteria other than Tremblaya (76.1% of all reads) and Moranella (19.7% of all reads) (Table S2). These results suggest that bacterial contamination is an unlikely source of significant PG signal in our LC-MS/MS experiments. Although these data allow us to conclude that PG is present in the P. citri-Tremblaya-Moranella symbiosis, they provide no information on the spatial localization of this putative PG layer. We next attempted to visualize incorporation of D-Ala, a PG-specific molecule, in this symbiosis. Inspired by recent work using localization of fluorescently labeled D-Ala as a proxy for PG biosynthesis (Kuru et al., 2012Kuru E. Hughes H.V. Brown P.J. Hall E. Tekkam S.

We soaked and injected an 15N-labeled D-Ala solution onto sprouting potatoes on which the mealybugs fed (Figure S1, related to Figure 3). After a week of feeding on labeled potatoes, mealybugs were sacrificed, and the bacteriome tissue was removed and thin-sectioned onto microscope slides. The location of insect bacteriocytes, Tremblaya, and Moranella cells was first established using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy (Figures 3A and 3F). These FISH-imaged tissue sections were then subjected to nanoSIMS, where we observed strong, specific rings of enriched 15N signal exclusively at or near the periphery of all Moranella cells (Figures 3B and 3C–3E). In contrast, mealybugs grown on 15N-labeled L-Ala showed uniform label incorporation throughout the bacteriome tissue, as expected because L-Ala should be incorporated without bias into all proteins in the symbiosis (Figures 3F and 3G). We verified a Moranella periphery-specific pattern of D-Ala enrichment using bioorthogonal, Cu-catalyzed click-chemistry and fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3H; Kuru et al., 2012Kuru E. Hughes H.V.

The localization of enriched D-Ala signal at the cell periphery of Moranella, but not Tremblaya or the insect tissue, in both nanoSIMS and fluorescent microscopy is consistent with our genomic prediction that PG production should be specifically localized to the Moranella periphery, but should not exist in Tremblaya (Figure 1B). Similar patterns of D-Ala enrichment are routinely interpreted as strong evidence for PG biosynthesis in bacteria (Kuru et al., 2012Kuru E. Hughes H.V. Brown P.J. Hall E. Tekkam S.

Previous work showed involvement of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, but poor PLP1 genotype-phenotype associations suggest additional pathogenetic mechanisms. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and gene-correction, we show that patient-derived oligodendrocytes can develop to the pre-myelinating stage, but subsequently undergo cell death. Mutant oligodendrocytes demonstrated key hallmarks of ferroptosis including lipid peroxidation, abnormal iron metabolism, and hypersensitivity to free iron. Iron chelation rescued mutant oligodendrocyte apoptosis, survival, and differentiationin vitro, and post-transplantation in vivo. Finally, systemic treatment of Plp1 mutant Jimpy mice with deferiprone, a small molecule iron chelator, reduced oligodendrocyte apoptosis and enabled myelin formation. Thus, oligodendrocyte iron-induced cell death and myelination is rescued by iron chelation in PMD pre-clinical models."
https://openalex.org/W2977279678,"Cells regulate gene expression in response to salient external stimuli. In neurons, depolarization leads to the expression of inducible transcription factors (ITFs) that direct subsequent gene regulation. Depolarization encodes both a neuron's action potential (AP) output and synaptic inputs, via excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). However, it is unclear if distinct types of electrical activity can be transformed by an ITF into distinct modes of genomic regulation. Here, we show that APs and EPSPs in mouse hippocampal neurons trigger two spatially segregated and molecularly distinct induction mechanisms that lead to the expression of the ITF NPAS4. These two pathways culminate in the formation of stimulus-specific NPAS4 heterodimers that exhibit distinct DNA binding patterns. Thus, NPAS4 differentially communicates increases in a neuron's spiking output and synaptic inputs to the nucleus, enabling gene regulation to be tailored to the type of depolarizing activity along the somato-dendritic axis of a neuron."

https://openalex.org/W2978563328,"Neuromodulators bind to pre- and postsynaptic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are able to quickly change intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and Ca2+ levels, and are thought to play important roles in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discovered in human neurons an unanticipated presynaptic mechanism that acutely changes synaptic ultrastructure and regulates synaptic communication. Activation of neuromodulator receptors bidirectionally controlled synaptic vesicle numbers within nerve terminals. This control correlated with changes in the levels of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of synapsin-1. Using a conditional deletion approach, we reveal that the neuromodulator-induced control of synaptic vesicle numbers was largely dependent on synapsin-1. We propose a mechanism whereby non-phosphorylated synapsin-1 “latches” synaptic vesicles to presynaptic clusters at the active zone. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin-1 then removes the vesicles. cAMP-independent dephosphorylation of synapsin-1 in turn recruits vesicles. Synapsin-1 thereby bidirectionally regulates synaptic vesicle numbers and modifies presynaptic neurotransmitter release as an effector of neuromodulator signaling in human neurons."

Human embryonic development begins with fusion of the egg and sperm and is followed by a series of cleavages that are concurrent with the degradation of maternal transcripts and activation of the embryonic genome during the first 3 days of development. The embryo then undergoes compaction to form a morula and subsequently a blastocyst, which consists of the outer trophectoderm and inner cell mass (Dobson et al., 2004Dobson A.T. Raja R. Abeyta M.J.

Although stage-specific gene expression patterns and their upstream regulation have been explored in mouse and early human embryos, the functions of the respective maternal and paternal genomes in the transcriptional programs during preimplantation development remain unclear. Androgenetic (AG) and parthenogenetic (PG) embryos possess two paternal or maternal genomes, respectively, providing useful tools to investigate development. Previous studies have shown that the paternal and maternal contributions to the embryonic genome in mammals are not equivalent and that a diploid genome derived from only one of the two parental sexes is incapable of supporting complete embryogenesis (McGrath and Solter, 1984McGrath J. Solter D. Completion of mouse embryogenesis requires both the maternal and paternal genomes.Cell. 1984; 37: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). PG embryos tend to differentiate into embryonic cells, whereas AG embryos preferentially differentiate to form trophoblasts (Barton et al., 1984Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Norris M.L.

The divergent features of AG and PG embryos are believed to be caused by imprinted genes that are expressed only from the maternal or paternal allele (Ferguson-Smith and Surani, 2001Ferguson-Smith A.C. Surani M.A. Imprinting and the epigenetic asymmetry between parental genomes.Science. 2001; 293: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Parent-of-origin effects, where certain genes exhibit allele-specific expression (ASE), are well understood in adult cells; however, little is known about the general patterns of allelic expression in preimplantation embryos. Single-cell RNA-seq enables base-resolution analysis without any confounding effects from cell population heterogeneity. Using SNP analysis, Xue et al., 2013Xue Z. Huang K. Cai C. Cai L. Jiang C.Y.

However, recent evidence indicated that a stochastic loss of mRNAs substantially inflates estimates of allelic expression. Deng et al., 2014Deng Q. Ramsköld D. Reinius B. Sandberg R.

Methods. 2014; 11: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar suggested that detected allele-specific gene expression levels were severely affected by the high technical noise derived from single-cell RNA-seq. Thus, stringent controls or other methods are critically important for accurate allelic expression analysis in single cells. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive comparison of gene expression profiling between biparental (BI) and uniparental embryos using single-cell RNA-seq. Our integrative analyses provide a global view of the parent-of-origin effects during human preimplantation development. The cleavage behaviors of BI, AG, and PG embryos were recorded and analyzed using time-lapse microscopy as described previously (Yang et al., 2015Yang S.T. Shi J.X. Gong F. Zhang S.P. Lu C.F. Tan K. Leng L.Z. Hao M. He H. Gu Y.F. et al.Cleavage pattern predicts developmental potential of day 3 human embryos produced by IVF.Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2015; 30: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Figure S1A). BI embryos exhibited higher developmental rates to the 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula stages than AG or PG embryos (Figure S1B), and AG and PG embryos had a higher frequency of abnormal behavior than BI embryos (61.3%, 64.4%, and 28.8% for AG, PG, and BI embryos, respectively) during the first three cleavages. The risk of introducing an extra centrosome into an oocyte with fertilization by two sperm heads meant that the percentage of direct cleavage (one blastomere dividing directly into three or more cells) was higher in AG embryos than in BI or PG embryos at the first division. In contrast, the frequency of uneven blastomeres (two daughter blastomeres of unequal size after cleavage) was higher in PG embryos at the first cleavage, probably because of the absence of a centrosome (Figure S1C). Aberrant cytokinesis correlates strongly with developmental arrest and dramatically influences the expression of cytokinesis genes (Wong et al., 2010Wong C.C. Loewke K.E. Bossert N.L. Behr B. De Jonge C.J. Baer T.M. Reijo Pera R.A. Non-invasive imaging of human embryos before embryonic genome activation predicts development to the blastocyst stage.Nat.

To avoid the effects of abnormal behavior on gene expression, only embryos that underwent normal cleavage were included for RNA-seq. Interestingly, even among embryos exhibiting normal cleavage behavior, BI embryos still exhibited higher developmental potential to the morula stage than AG or PG embryos (85.2%, 64.3%, and 51.7% for BI, AG, and PG embryos, respectively). Moreover, we noticed that, from the second cleavage, AG and PG embryos began to show opposite tendencies in cell cycle progression, with the cell cycle length being shorter in AG embryos and longer in PG embryos compared with those in BI embryos. This difference became significant by the third cleavage (15.7 ± 1.8 h, 19.3 ± 2.7 h, and 17.6 ± 2.0 h for AG, PG, and BI embryos, respectively; p < 0.05; Figure S1D), suggesting opposite effects on control of the cell cycle by the respective parental genomes. To assess the gene expression patterns of BI and uniparental embryos during preimplantation development, we sequenced the transcriptomes of individual cells isolated from oocytes or embryos ranging from the 1-cell to the morula stage (Figures 1A and S1A; Table S1). In total, we obtained about 2,000 Gb of clean data from 296 single cells. Statistical analysis of our read data shows that the unique mapping rate of all samples was around 94.2% (Table S1). Random statistical analysis showed that the average pairwise correlation coefficient between two blastomeres within the same embryo type was about 0.91 (Figure S2A), which confirmed that Smart-seq2 was an accurate and reproducible method for single-cell RNA-seq. After quality control, we retained 285 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with an average of 9,184 expressed genes each (transcripts per million [TPM] ≥ 1; Table S1). Importantly for our analyses, AG embryos reconstructed from two sperm genomes would contain different sex chromosome constitutions, such as XX, XY, and YY. To exclude the effect of a YY karyotype on gene expression, we assessed the expression levels of the X- and Y-linked genes in each cell and found only XX and XY AG embryos among our analyzed samples (Figure S2B). To determine whether the gene expression profiles differed between the three types of embryos at each stage, we performed clustering of BI and uniparental embryos using principal-component analysis (PCA). In general, embryonic cells were grouped by their developmental stage, regardless of the BI or uniparental origin of individual embryos. We observed that, at the 4-cell stage, AG embryos were retained closer to the 2-cell cluster, whereas PG embryos were closer to the 8-cell stage cluster; at the 8-cell stage, PG embryos seem less developed toward the morula cluster (Figure 1B). These results indicated that abnormality in developmental progression already existed in AG and PG embryos at the 4-cell stage, although the influence of the genome of uniparental embryos on the transcriptome was not as dramatic as the stage-specific effects on gene expression. Next we analyzed genes that were differentially expressed as development progressed in BI, AG, and PG embryos, which were determined at a cutoff of p ≤ 0.01 and |log2(fold change)| ≥ 1. As indicated by previous studies (Xue et al., 2013Xue Z. Huang K. Cai C. Cai L. Jiang C.Y. Feng Y. Liu Z. Zeng Q. Cheng L.

Overall, uniparental embryos exhibited less genome activation than BI embryos at these stages, especially at the 1- and 2-cell stages. In contrast, at the 4-cell stage, we observed a dramatically increased number of transcripts in PG embryos compared with BI embryos; however, AG embryos remained transcriptionally inactive (882, 289, and 1,080 for BI, AG, and PG embryos, respectively). At the 4-cell to morula stages, there is the major wave of EGA (Goolam et al., 2016Goolam M. Scialdone A. Graham S.J.L. Macaulay I.C. Jedrusik A. Hupalowska A. Voet T. Marioni J.C. Zernicka-Goetz M.

Biol. 2013; 20: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). We observed that a larger number of genes was upregulated at the 8-cell (3,267, 3,243, and 2,496 for BI, AG, and PG embryos, respectively) and morula stages (3,010, 2,029, and 2,273 for BI, AG, and PG embryos, respectively) in the three types of embryos compared with the previous stage, suggesting a major EGA occurred in both BI and uniparental embryos. This was less pronounced in PG embryos. Moreover, the depletion of maternal transcripts had similar tendencies at the indicated stages as the activated transcripts in the three groups of embryos (Figure 1C; Table S2). Altogether, although BI, AG, and PG embryos initiated a major wave of EGA between the 4-cell and morula stages, we observed variable and overall decreased patterns of EGA and maternal transcript depletion in uniparental embryos. To gain insights into the potential functional differences of the dynamic genes among the three groups, we performed functional enrichment analysis of the genes that were up- or downregulated at each stage. From the 1- to 2-cell stages, the upregulated genes in BI embryos were enriched for the functional categories of mRNA processing, mRNA splicing, and translational initiation, indicating early RNA metabolic preparation for the late major EGA, whereas no Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment was observed in AG and PG embryos. From the 2- to 4-cell stages, positive regulation of transcription was enriched for the upregulated genes in both BI and PG embryos but absent in AG embryos, possibly accounting for the low genomic activation level in AG embryos at this stage. Interestingly, several functional categories were enriched in AG embryos at this stage, including rRNA processing, translational initiation, and SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to the membrane. Whether this is related to the accelerated cell cycle in AG embryos requires further study. As expected, the upregulated genes at the 8-cell and morula stages in BI, AG, and PG embryos shared most of the same functional categories, suggesting that the embryo-specific transcription and translation machinery had been established in both BI and uniparental embryos at the 8-cell stage. Unlike the upregulated genes, not many GO terms were enriched in downregulated genes, except in BI embryos at the 2-cell stage, where exonucleolytic mRNA catabolic process and sister chromatid cohesion terms were enriched (Figure 1D). Collectively, GO analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across various embryonic stages highlighted that, at the molecular level, functional differences were already established in uniparental embryos, which might lead to the late developmental incompetence of these embryos. To further investigate the effects of a uniparental genome on embryonic development, we examined lineage specification in BI, AG, and PG blastocysts. As expected, we observed significant differences in inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) differentiation between BI and uniparental embryos. In BI blastocysts, we observed smooth TEs, a clearly visible blastocyst cavity, and well-developed ICMs. Conversely, AG and PG blastocysts displayed major differentiation defects with no viable ICMs in AG blastocysts and only limited TE development in PG blastocysts (Figure 2A). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the number of NANOG-positive (an epiblast marker) and SOX17-positive (a primitive endoderm marker) cells was lower in AG and PG blastocysts than in BI blastocysts (Figures 2A and 2B). Moreover, the total number of cells was significantly higher in BI blastocysts than in AG and PG blastocysts (Figure 2B). These results raised the possibility that maternal and paternal genomes play distinct roles in the development of embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages. To further analyze whether a differentiation bias in uniparental embryos existed at earlier stages, we assessed cellular heterogeneity based on the gene expression profiles of BI, AG, and PG embryos. We focused on embryos where all individual cells could be collected from the same embryo and computed the correlation of the expression levels between all pairs of blastomeres within each complete embryo. After correcting for inter-embryo differences in expression levels, we identified genes that displayed significantly higher heterogeneity in expression than expected. These analyses identified 517, 475, and 401 highly variable genes in BI, AG, and PG morulae, respectively. Among these variable genes, 92 showed heterogeneity of expression in all three embryo groups (Figure 2C; Table S3). To identify the corresponding cell lineages, we applied PCA and clustering to the 92 overlapped highly variable genes. We found that BI, AG, and PG morulae all segregated into two groups. Cluster 1 included 91.5% (43 of 47), 29.5% (13 of 44), and 75% (21 of 28) of the BI, AG, and PG blastomeres, respectively. This group had a high expression of TFCP2L1, ESRRB, DNMT3L, and PTGES (Figures 2D and 2E). TFCP2L1 and ESRRB have been reported to play a critical role in maintaining mouse and human embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency by Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2. Conversely, cluster 2 comprised 8.5% (4 of 47), 70.5% (31 of 44), and 25% (7 of 28) of the BI, AG, and PG blastomeres, respectively, with high expression of GTPBP3, CHAC1, ITGA5, and KEAP1 (Figures 2D and 2E). Although the two clusters were clear in terms of the three types of embryos, BI and PG embryos were more similar at the morula stage. Interestingly, the well-known TE lineage markers (CDX2 and DAB2) as well as ICM markers (POU5F1 and NANOG) were not among the most variable genes, indicating nascent TE and ICM lineages. Instead, no groupings of cells were identified at the 4- and 8-cell stages. Taken together, our data not only revealed impaired lineage specification in uniparental embryos but also identified possible early regulators of cell differentiation in human preimplantation embryos. We postulated that the cellular and molecular differences described above between BI and uniparental embryos might be attributed to biased gene expression according to the maternal or paternal origin of individual genes. Thus, we performed comparative analyses of our BI and uniparental RNA-seq datasets to identify maternally biased expressed genes (MBGs) and paternally biased expressed genes (PBGs). To exclude the influence of maternal transcripts as well as stochastic losses of RNA species, we only focused on genes activated in preimplantation embryos and with highly biased expression in AG and/or PG embryos. We first identified up- or downregulated genes in AG (AG versus BI, p ≤ 0.01; AG versus PG, p ≤ 0.01; |log2(fold change) (AG/PG)| ≥ 1.5), and PG embryos (PG versus BI, p ≤ 0.01; PG versus AG, p ≤ 0.01; |log2(fold change) (PG/AG)| ≥ 1.5). We then defined MBGs as genes upregulated in PG embryos and/or downregulated in AG embryos, whereas PBGs were defined as genes upregulated in AG embryos and/or downregulated in PG embryos (Figure 3A; Table S4). Globally, MBGs initially appeared at the 4-cell stage, whereas PBGs preferentially appeared at the 8-cell stage (Figure 3B; Table S4). It appeared that MBGs and PBGs were not significantly enriched in any pathways; therefore, we manually curated the biological functions for MBGs and PBGs on the basis of known pathway annotations or literature. We found that the functions of MBGs were mainly in negative regulation of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling pathway, transcriptional regulation, regulation of protein ubiquitination, cytoskeleton organization, chromatin remodeling, and cell proliferation (Figure 3C). Retinoic acid (RA) is essential for the correct patterning of vertebrate embryos. Mouse embryos that lack RA synthesis abilities display early growth arrest that can be rescued by RA administration (Huang et al., 2003Huang F.J. Shen C.C. Chang S.Y. Wu T.C. Hsuuw Y.D. Retinoic acid decreases the viability of mouse blastocysts in vitro.Hum. Reprod. 2003; 18: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The PRAME family protein in MBGs acts as a dominant repressor of RAR signaling by preventing ligand-induced receptor activation and target gene transcription. Moreover, the key genes involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, including KDM4E, LEUTX, and KLF17, were downregulated in AG embryos at the 4-cell stage (Figure 3D), suggesting that insufficient reprogramming might occur and cause preferential differentiation in AG embryos. Conversely, we found that the function of PBGs was mainly in organelle organization (e.g., mitochondrion and ribosome), autophagy, cell polarity, and cell adhesion (Figure 3C). Interestingly, genes correlating with cell polarity and cell adhesion, including NF2, IGF2BP1, and CXADR, were downregulated in PG embryos at the 8-cell stage (Figure 3E), indicating that incomplete compaction possibly occurs in PG embryos, causing compromised TE differentiation. Transcription factors (TFs) play key regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological processes. To explore central factors that might contribute to the expression of MBGs and PBGs, we first investigated possible upstream TFs for MBGs and PBGs using TF-binding motif enrichment analysis. We identified a DUX4 binding motif as the most enriched motif for MBGs (AG embryo downregulated genes at the 4-cell stage) (Figure 4A). DUX4 has been reported to act as a master regulator for early embryonic development by activating hundreds of early EGA genes (Hendrickson et al., 2017Hendrickson P.G. Doráis J.A. Grow E.J. Whiddon J.L. Lim J.W. Wike C.L. Weaver B.D. Pflueger C. Emery B.R. Wilcox A.L. et al.Conserved roles of mouse DUX and human DUX4 in activating cleavage-stage genes and MERVL/HERVL retrotransposons.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In the present study, DUX4 transcripts were detected from 1- to 4-cell stages in both BI and uniparental embryos (Figure 4B). To confirm and extend these findings, we compared our data with the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of DUX4-overexpressing human ESCs (hESCs) (GEO: GSE94322) (De Iaco et al., 2017De Iaco A. Planet E. Coluccio A. Verp S. Duc J. Trono D. DUX-family transcription factors regulate zygotic genome activation in placental mammals.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Of the 212 MBGs, 60.4% (128, p < 0.01) were occupied by DUX4 in hESCs (Figure 4C). Notably, the majority of these putative DUX4 targets, including KDM4E, LEUTX, USP29, and KLF17, are essential for early development. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression levels of the representative targets (log2(TPM+1) > 3) in BI, AG, and PG embryos and found marked downregulation of these genes in AG embryos at the 4-cell stage (Figure 4D). Therefore, these findings suggested that DUX4 might play a central role in regulating expression of MBGs during human preimplantation development. Many MBG-TFs (28 of 69) were downregulated in AG embryos at the 4-cell stage, and a large number of PBG-TFs were downregulated in PG embryos at the 8-cell stage (17 of 41) or upregulated in AG embryos at the morula stage (20 of 41) (Figures 5A and S3A–S3D); therefore, we investigated candidate key regulators and then constructed transcriptional regulatory networks for MBGs and PBGs. We predicted possible target genes for these TFs with correlated activities. By doing so, we determined that EGR2, DUXA, ZNF679, ZNF479, SOX2, NANOG, and JUNB might play a critical role in MBGs at the 4-cell stage (Figure 5B). Interestingly, we found that 55.5% (71 of 128) of the identified putative DUX4 targets, including KDM4E, LEUTX, USP29, KLF17, ZSCAN5B, and CCNA1, were involved in this regulatory network and might therefore be simultaneously regulated by the above key TFs at the 4-cell stage (Figure 5C). Moreover, factors such as ZNF263, KLF3, HNF4A, and TGIF1 were the top candidate TFs for regulating the gene expression network in PBGs at the 8-cell stage (Figure 5D). In contrast, no regulatory network was identified for TFs and MBGs and/or PBGs at the morula stage, implying that they are probably downstream"

We validate GateID by purifying various cell types from zebrafish kidney marrow and the human pancreas to high purity without resorting to specific antibodies or transgenes. Purification of cell types present in heterogenous tissues is a central goal for biologists. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is the method of choice to isolate up to millions of single cells based on many cellular parameters. Over the years, flow cytometry became an important tool to study the cellular heterogeneity of many complex tissues, especially in the field of cellular immunology (reviewed by O’Donnell et al., 2013O’Donnell E.A. Ernst D.N. Hingorani R. Multiparameter flow cytometry: advances in high resolution analysis.Immune Netw. 2013; 13: 43-54Google Scholar). In a flow cytometer, light scatter parameters can be used to segregate single cells based on general cellular properties such as size and granularity. For example, hematopoietic cell types are known to occupy distinct areas in forward and side scatter space, which allows their isolation (Balla et al., 2010Balla K.M. Lugo-Villarino G. Spitsbergen J.M. Stachura D.L. Hu Y. Bañuelos K. Romo-Fewell O. Aroian R.V. Traver D.

Additionally, FACS can be used to separate single cells based on the expression of a specific protein when cells are labeled with fluorescent transgenic constructs or fluorescently coupled antibodies raised against that protein (Rodriguez et al., 2017Rodriguez E.A. Campbell R.E. Lin J.Y. Lin M.Z. Miyawaki A. Palmer A.E. Shu X. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. The Growing and Glowing Toolbox of Fluorescent and Photoactive Proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42: 111-129Google Scholar). Although demonstrated to be powerful, these purification strategies require a priori knowledge of a cell-specific marker and depend on the availability of antibodies and/or transgenic constructs. For example, purification of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is crucial to study and treat blood-related disorders. However, no HSPC-specific marker is currently available, and HSPCs can only be enriched using elaborate sorting strategies that achieve imperfect purities (Balazs et al., 2006Balazs A.B. Fabian A.J.

Similarly, the isolation of α and β cells from the human pancreas is essential for diabetes research. Despite efforts, antibody discovery has been hampered by trial-and-error methods that do not deliver pure populations (Banerjee and Otonkoski, 2009Banerjee M. Otonkoski T.

Recently, intelligent image-activated cell sorting (IACS) demonstrated the ability to perform real-time high-throughput cell microscopy analysis prior to cell sorting (Nitta et al., 2018Nitta N. Sugimura T. Isozaki A. Mikami H. Hiraki K. Sakuma S. Iino T. Arai F. Endo T. Fujiwaki Y. et al.Intelligent Image-Activated Cell Sorting.Cell. 2018; 175: 266-276.e13Google Scholar). IACS reported high specificity and sensitivity in identifying targeted populations based on parameters such as intracellular protein localization and cell-cell interaction. Although a significant instrument innovation, the use of IACS remains limited because of the need to engineer a highly complex instrument. Additionally, IACS does not eliminate the need for prior knowledge of the targeted population and reports sorting purities below 80%. Overall, no universal sorting strategy applicable in many tissues and model organisms exists, making purification of many cell types imperfect or impossible. Sorting decisions are taken based on gate combinations that select the desired population based on the scatter and fluorescence intensity values of choice. Gate placement happens manually and is therefore highly variable between samples and error prone. Several methods have been developed with the aim to automate the gating process, such as CCAST or SPADE (reviewed by Anchang and Plevritis, 2016Anchang B. Plevritis S.K. Automated population identification and sorting algorithms for high-dimensional single-cell data.bioRxiv. 2016; https://doi.org/10.1101/046664Google Scholar). Although these methods bring an automated step to the gate design, they are limited to datasets with prior knowledge of the tissue cellular composition and rely on potential markers for the cell type of choice, ignoring all other available FACS parameters. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become the method of choice to study cellular heterogeneity within complex tissues (reviewed by Choi and Kim, 2019Choi Y.H. Kim J.K.

Importantly, scRNA-seq datasets have been used to find new and more specific markers for cell types composing heterogenous tissues. For instance, human pancreatic tissue has been widely studied to discover novel markers for all cell types present in the pancreas (Baron et al., 2016Baron M. Veres A. Wolock S.L. Faust A.L.

Theis F.J. Lickert H. Böttcher A. Systematic single-cell analysis provides new insights into heterogeneity and plasticity of the pancreas.Mol. Metab. 2017; 6: 974-990Google Scholar). These datasets have also been mined for novel cell surface markers to enrich α cells to 85% purity (Muraro et al., 2016Muraro M.J. Dharmadhikari G. Grun D. Groen N. Dielen T. Jansen E. van Gurp L. Engelse M.A. Carlotti F. de Koning E.J. et al.A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas.Cell Syst. 2016; 3: 385-394.e3Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, new surface markers for human blood cell types were uncovered (Björklund et al., 2016Björklund A.K. Forkel M. Picelli S. Konya V. Theorell J. Friberg D. Sandberg R. Mjösberg J.

Lazo S. et al.Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors.Science. 2017; 356 (eaah4573)Google Scholar). Furthermore, CITE-Seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing), a method allowing transcriptome and epitope profiling in single cells, was developed to link mRNA and protein expression (Stoeckius et al., 2017Stoeckius M. Hafemeister C. Stephenson W. Houck-Loomis B. Chattopadhyay P.K. Swerdlow H. Satija R. Smibert P. Simultaneous epitope and transcriptome measurement in single cells.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 865-868Google Scholar). Overall, the large diversity of available scRNA-seq datasets and the need for better solutions to purify cell types led to the creation of CellMarker, a resource for cell type markers in many mouse and human tissues (Zhang et al., 2019Zhang X. Lan Y. Xu J. Quan F. Zhao E. Deng C. Luo T. Xu L. Liao G. Yan M. et al.CellMarker: a manually curated resource of cell markers in human and mouse.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: D721-D728Google Scholar). Although a valuable resource, cell type purification is still limited to cell types for which commercial antibodies are available or for which transgene construction is an option. To solve this challenge, we set out to devise a method that could purify cell types of choice without a priori knowledge of cell type markers and would rely on general cellular properties. To achieve this, we combined high-throughput measurements of many cellular properties by FACS with unbiased cell type identification by scRNA-seq. This allowed us to find the best cellular parameters to purify any cell type, as identified by scRNA-seq, of our tissues of interest. To achieve this goal, we developed GateID, a computational method that predicts unintuitive combinations of FACS gates to purify cell types of choice. GateID (1) uses scRNA-seq for unbiased cell type identification rather than on a limited set of known cell markers; (2) is antibody and transgene free and solely relies on general cellular properties such as, but not restricted to, cell refractive index, granularity, nuclear staining, cellular proliferation, and mitochondrial activity; and (3) offers automated gate design and placement, which eliminates manual gating strategies and corrects for biological and technical variability between experiments. Using GateID, we purified various cell types from zebrafish kidney marrow, including HSPCs, solely based on their general cellular properties. Additionally, we isolated live α and β cells from the human pancreas up to 100% purity and demonstrated that GateID-sorted cells can be used for downstream experiments, such as methylome profiling. GateID is an optimization algorithm that combines the FACS index and transcriptome information of many single cells to predict non-intuitive combinations of FACS gates capable of purifying a transcriptionally distinct cell type. Importantly, gate prediction using GateID is solely data driven and does not require a priori information about FACS gates, cell types, and cellular markers. The GateID workflow starts with generating a training dataset (TD) of the organ or tissue of interest (Figure 1, step 1). To this end, single live cells are sorted while recording index data in all available scatter and fluorescence channels (Figure 1, step 1A). Next, the transcriptome of all sorted single cells is sequenced using SORT-Seq (sorting and robot-assisted transcriptome sequencing), and the cell type composition of the organ/tissue of interest is determined (Figure 1, step 1B; Muraro et al., 2016Muraro M.J. Dharmadhikari G. Grun D. Groen N. Dielen T. Jansen E. van Gurp L. Engelse M.A. Carlotti F. de Koning E.J. et al.A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of the Human Pancreas.Cell Syst. 2016; 3: 385-394.e3Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The TD is generated by merging the index sorting parameters with the cell type information obtained by scRNA-seq for each cell (Figure 1, step 1C). After defining the desired cell type, the computational gate design occurs (Figure 1, step 2). At the core of GateID is an optimization algorithm that attempts to predict gates to obtain the maximum number of desired cells while minimizing the number of undesired cells. It iterates this procedure through all combinations of FACS channels and, subsequently, through combinations of gates to predict the best gates in terms of purity and yield (Figure 1, steps 2D and 2E; STAR Methods). Finally, the GateID-predicted gates are experimentally validated using a new sample of the organ or tissue of interest (Figure 1, step 3). Predicted gates are normalized to the new experimental dataset to correct for biological inter-individual variability and FACS technical variability (Figure 1, step 3F; STAR Methods). Single cells passing through normalized GateID gates are sorted and sequenced using scRNA-seq (Figure 1, steps 3G and 3H). The cell type composition of the GateID-enriched library is determined by clustering all cells purified by GateID gates as well as an unenriched set of cells. Using this complete dataset, the experimental purity of each GateID-enriched library is calculated. First, we focused on zebrafish whole-kidney marrow (WKM), the primary site of production of hematopoietic cells in zebrafish (Murayama et al., 2006Murayama E. Kissa K. Zapata A. Mordelet E. Briolat V. Lin H.F. Handin R.I. Herbomel P. Tracing hematopoietic precursor migration to successive hematopoietic organs during zebrafish development.Immunity. 2006; 25: 963-975Google Scholar). Their isolation relies on a limited number of antibodies, transgenic lines, or manual gating subject to high variability (Traver et al., 2003Traver D. Paw B.H. Poss K.D. Penberthy W.T. Lin S. Zon L.I. Transplantation and in vivo imaging of multilineage engraftment in zebrafish bloodless mutants.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1238-1246Google Scholar, Wittamer et al., 2011Wittamer V. Bertrand J.Y. Gutschow P.W. Traver D. Characterization of the mononuclear phagocyte system in zebrafish.Blood. 2011; 117: 7126-7135Google Scholar). To assess whether GateID could be a more attractive method, we generated a TD1 of single live WKM hematopoietic cells (DAPI−) by merging FACS index data in 12 dimensions (BD FACSJazz) and cell type information for 1,252 cells from 3 zebrafish. Using cell clustering and known markers, we identified 7 hematopoietic cell types (Carmona et al., 2017Carmona S.J. Teichmann S.A. Ferreira L. Macaulay I.C. Stubbington M.J. Cvejic A. Gfeller D.

Med. 2016; 213: 979-992Google Scholar; Figures S1A–S1C; STAR Methods) and first aimed to enrich for eosinophils. GateID predicted a purity of 79.3% and a yield of 46.9% to isolate eosinophils using a combination of two gates (Figures 2A and S1D; Table S1). We define the purity of a set of GateID gates as the number of desired cells in the gates divided by the total number of cells in the gates. Additionally, the yield of GateID is the number of desired cells in the gates divided by the number of desired cells in our tissue of interest. We verified that 46.9% of eosinophils selected by GateID-predicted gates were not representing a transcriptionally distinct population of eosinophils (Figure S1E). To experimentally validate the predicted gates, we sorted GateID-enriched and unenriched single cells from three independent WKMs (Figure 2B). Predicted gates were normalized to each new WKM to correct for inter-individual and technical variability (Figure 2B; STAR Methods). After scRNA-seq, to ensure high confidence in our cell type identification and purity estimates, we clustered all of our zebrafish GateID experiments together (WKM 1–15, TD1–3), resulting in 15,984 single cells (Figures 2C and S1F; STAR Methods). We calculated the experimental purity of all of our WKM experiments based on this full dataset. The above-mentioned eosinophil enrichment experiments achieved an experimental purity of between 68.9% and 78%, even with eosinophil content as low as 0.6% in the unenriched population (Figure 2D, barplots; n = 3). The reason why experimental purity can vary from predicted values lies in the individual variation that can be observed in both cell type composition and FACS measurements per experiment (Figures 2 and S2A). Interestingly, we observed that contaminating cells intermingled with enriched eosinophils in FACS space and were difficult to eliminate (Figure S2B). The contaminating population in all experiments consisted mainly of monocytes. This is not surprising because eosinophils and myeloid cells occupy partly overlapping FACS regions (Balla et al., 2010Balla K.M. Lugo-Villarino G. Spitsbergen J.M. Stachura D.L. Hu Y. Bañuelos K. Romo-Fewell O. Aroian R.V. Traver D. Eosinophils in the zebrafish: prospective isolation, characterization, and eosinophilia induction by helminth determinants.Blood. 2010; 116: 3944-3954Google Scholar). Importantly, enriched eosinophils from each experiment clustered with eosinophils in the unenriched population (Figure 2D, t-SNE [t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding] maps), showing that GateID-enriched cells capture the existing transcriptional variance in eosinophils from the unenriched library. Finally, to compare GateID with manual gating, we isolated eosinophils as described previously (Balla et al., 2010Balla K.M. Lugo-Villarino G. Spitsbergen J.M. Stachura D.L. Hu Y. Bañuelos K. Romo-Fewell O. Aroian R.V. Traver D. Eosinophils in the zebrafish: prospective isolation, characterization, and eosinophilia induction by helminth determinants.Blood. 2010; 116: 3944-3954Google Scholar; Figure S2C). This manual gating yielded lower enrichment compared with GateID and revealed stronger myeloid contamination (Figures S2D and S2E).Figure 2Proof of Principle: Enrichment of Zebrafish Eosinophils Using GateIDShow full caption(A) GateID-predicted gates to isolate eosinophils from unstained WKM on BD FACSJazz.

https://openalex.org/W2978153301,"In humans, disruption of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. However, the mechanism by which deficient NMD leads to neurodevelopmental dysfunction remains unknown, preventing development of targeted therapies. Here we identified novel protein-coding UPF2 (UP-Frameshift 2) variants in humans with NDD, including speech and language deficits. In parallel, we found that mice lacking Upf2 in the forebrain (Upf2 fb-KO mice) show impaired NMD, memory deficits, abnormal long-term potentiation (LTP), and social and communication deficits. Surprisingly, Upf2 fb-KO mice exhibit elevated expression of immune genes and brain inflammation. More importantly, treatment with two FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drugs reduced brain inflammation, restored LTP and long-term memory, and reversed social and communication deficits. Collectively, our findings indicate that impaired UPF2-dependent NMD leads to neurodevelopmental dysfunction and suggest that anti-inflammatory agents may prove effective for treatment of disorders with impaired NMD."
https://openalex.org/W2978440466,"Mucosal wound repair is coordinated by dynamic crosstalk between endogenous and exogenous mediators and specific receptors on epithelial cells and infiltrating immune cells. One class of such receptor‐ligand pairs involves formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) that have been shown to influence inflammatory response and repair. Here we explored the role of murine Fpr2/3, an ortholog of human FPR2/receptor for lipoxin A4 (ALX), in orchestrating intestinal mucosal repair. Compared with wild‐type (WT) mice, Fpr2/3 –/– mice exhibited delayed recovery from acute experimental colitis and perturbed repair after biopsy‐induced colonic mucosal injury. Decreased numbers of infiltrating monocytes were observed in healing wounds from Fpr2/3 –/– mice compared with WT animals. Bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that Fpr2/3 –/– monocytes showed a competitive disadvantage when infiltrating colonic wounds. Moreover, Fpr2/3 –/– monocytes were defective in chemotactic responses to the chemokine CC chemokine ligand (CCL)20, which is up‐regulated during early phases of inflammation. Analysis of Fpr2/3 –/– monocytes revealed altered expression of the CCL20 receptor CC chemokine receptor (CCR)6, suggesting that Fpr2/3 regulates CCL20‐CCR6‐mediated monocyte chemotaxis to sites of mucosal injury in the gut. These findings demonstrate an important contribution of Fpr2/3 in facilitating monocyte recruitment to sites of mucosal injury to influence wound repair.—Birkl, D., O'Leary, M.

These results suggest that Zic2 neurons integrate sensory input from cutaneous afferents with descending signals from the brain to promote corrective movements and transmit processed touch information back to the brain. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is a key waystation for processing and transmitting somatosensory information about the internal and external environment. The exteroceptive arm of the somatosensory system, which comprises specialized skin receptors and their associated sensory afferent subtypes, conveys information about touch, temperature, pruritic (itch), and painful (noxious) stimuli. This information is transmitted by specialized peripheral afferents that relay different sensory modalities and project to different dorsal horn laminae. Nociceptive and thermal information is transmitted to the superficial laminae I/II, while innocuous touch transmitted by low threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) afferents project to the LTMR recipient zone (LTMR-RZ) where they synapse with interneurons (INs) in laminae IIi–V (Abraira and Ginty, 2013Abraira V.E.

The functional analysis of INs within the LTMR-RZ is still in its infancy. Recent analysis of 11 LTMR-RZ IN populations revealed that each population receives input from at least two LTMR afferent subtypes, as well as other dorsal horn INs and corticospinal neurons, suggesting roles in integrating multiple touch modalities with descending input from higher brain centers (Abraira et al., 2017Abraira V.E.

Excitatory INs in the LTMR-RZ relaying innocuous touch contribute to the dynamic control of movement, whereas inhibitory IN populations gate and prevent innocuous stimuli from activating the nociceptive pathway (Koch et al., 2018Koch S.C.

Excitatory and inhibitory INs within the LTMR-RZ also receive noxious mechanical input and serve to modulate nociceptive information before it is relayed to supraspinal sites. Several genetically identified subpopulations of INs, including those that express CCK, have also been implicated in the development of mechanical allodynia, where touch is perceived as painful (Cheng et al., 2017Cheng L.

Most LTMRs also extend ascending axon branches, which form the so-called “direct dorsal column pathway,” a “labeled line” that transmits largely unprocessed touch information to the CNS. Tactile information is also processed and integrated within the dorsal horn LTMR-RZ by local circuit INs, with tactile information then relayed to the brain by projection neurons of the postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) and anterolateral tract. Although representing fewer than 2% of neurons in this region, these projection neurons are thought to play important roles in interpreting and relaying tactile information to the brain (Abraira and Ginty, 2013Abraira V.E.

Roughness discrimination in cats with dorsal column lesions.Brain Res. 1972; 44: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PSDC axons travel through the dorsal columns, intermingled with those of the direct pathway, to synapse with neurons in the brainstem dorsal column nuclei (DCN). However, unlike local circuit dorsal horn INs, the molecular identity of PSDC neurons has not yet been determined. We previously characterized deep lamina excitatory neurons marked by the expression of the transcription factor Zic2 and the guidance receptor EphA4 during development (Paixão et al., 2013Paixão S. Balijepalli A. Serradj N. Niu J. Luo W. Martin J.H. Klein R. EphrinB3/EphA4-mediated guidance of ascending and descending spinal tracts.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We proposed that a subpopulation of Zic2 neurons formed an ascending projection in the dorsal column and might be considered to be PSDC neurons. Zic2 neurons were surrounded by Ret+ Aβ-mechanosensory afferent terminals, raising the possibility that these neurons relay discriminative touch sensation. Functional characterization of these neurons in the adult was not possible, because Zic2 expression was rapidly extinguished after birth. Here, we have functionally characterized the Zic2 spinal neuron population. Ablation of Zic2 neurons led to reduced sensitivity to light touch and tactile discrimination. Conversely, pharmacogenetic activation of Zic2 spinal neurons increased sensitivity to tactile stimulations that promoted conditioned place aversion, indicating the negative valence of such activation. Mice lacking Zic2 spinal neurons also showed impaired fine motor control, suggesting a role for Zic2 neurons in the integration of cutaneous sensory input with descending motor signals. A subpopulation of Zic2 neurons projects to the DCN, and the selective activation of projecting Zic2 neurons leads to hypersensitivity to light touch, revealing that Zic2 projection neurons play an important role in transmitting innocuous tactile information to the somatosensory cortex by the DCN. To characterize and manipulate Zic2 neurons, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse by using the same strategy previously used for generating the Zic2::eGFP mouse (Escalante et al., 2013Escalante A. Murillo B. Morenilla-Palao C. Klar A. Herrera E.

EGFP was substituted by the tamoxifen-inducible version of Cre recombinase (CreER). Two transgenic founder lines were selected, namely, Zic2creER and Zic2creERbroad (Figures 1A and S1A). Because Zic2 expression is highly dynamic and downregulated after birth (Escalante et al., 2013Escalante A. Murillo B. Morenilla-Palao C. Klar A. Herrera E. Zic2-dependent axon midline avoidance controls the formation of major ipsilateral tracts in the CNS.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1392-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we characterized the pattern of Zic2cre-dependent recombination by comparing the signal of the Ai9 Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar) to endogenous Zic2 immunoreactivity (IR) at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), 2 days after Cre induction. The Zic2creER line showed a good overlap with Zic2 IR, especially in the medial spinal cord region in laminae III-V (Figures 1B and S1C). The Zic2creERbroad line showed a similar pattern of expression and overlapped with Zic2 IR in a larger number of neurons, with an additional population of more lateral dorsal horn neurons that lacked endogenous Zic2 IR (Figures S1B and S1C). Importantly, tdTomato expression in Zic2creER mice faithfully reported the absence of endogenous Zic2 IR in sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), whereas sporadic tdTomato cells were observed in the Zic2creERbroad line (Figures 1A and S1A). For these reasons, we mainly used the Zic2creER line and the Zic2creERbroad line to confirm our results. In postnatal spinal cords, the majority of Zic2creER;tdTomato neurons (63.8% ± 0.8%) expressed the glutamatergic dorsal horn marker Lmx1B (Cheng et al., 2004Cheng L. Arata A. Mizuguchi R. Qian Y.

Lmx1b controls the differentiation and migration of the superficial dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord.Development. 2004; 131: 3693-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Figures 1C and 1E), whereas very few (4% ± 0.6%) expressed the inhibitory marker Pax2 (Glasgow et al., 2005Glasgow S.M. Henke R.M. Macdonald R.J. Wright C.V.E. Johnson J.E. Ptf1a determines GABAergic over glutamatergic neuronal cell fate in the spinal cord dorsal horn.Development. 2005; 132: 5461-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Figures 1D and 1E). A significant proportion (28.4% ± 3.3%) expressed RORα, a marker of excitatory INs important for transmitting light touch (Bourane et al., 2015Bourane S. Grossmann K.S. Britz O. Dalet A. Del Barrio M.G. Stam F.J. Garcia-Campmany L. Koch S. Goulding M. Identification of a spinal circuit for light touch and fine motor control.Cell. 2015; 160: 503-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas Zic2creER;tdTomato constitute a smaller proportion of RORα neurons (16.9% ± 0.9%). The population showing overlap was located in the most medial region of laminae III–IV, with the Zic2+/RORα− neurons extending to more medial and deeper lamina V and the Zic2−/RORα+ INs to more lateral parts of laminae III–IV (Figures 1E, 1F,1I, and 1J). Zic2 neurons also co-localized with the lamina V markers Tcfap2β (14.8% ± 0.8%) and SatB1/2 (16% ± 2.6%) that label a population of motor synergy encoder INs (Hilde et al., 2016Hilde K.L. Levine A.J.

Neurosci. 2014; 17: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Figures 1E, 1G, 1H, and 1K–1N). Although the Zic2+/Tcfap2β+ subpopulation was largely restricted to lamina V, the Zic2+/SatB1/2+ subpopulation ranged from laminae III to V. To functionally characterize Zic2 spinal neurons, we specifically ablated Zic2 neurons in the adult spinal cord by using intersectional genetics. This was achieved by combining the Flp- and Cre-dependent Tauds-DTR allele expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) with Zic2creER and the Cdx2FlpO transgenes. Expression of Cdx2FlpO (optimized Flp) was confined to the caudal region of the mouse embryo, from mid-cervical levels in the spinal cord (Britz et al., 2015Britz O. Zhang J. Grossmann K.S. Dyck J. Kim J.C. Dymecki S. Gosgnach S. Goulding M. A genetically defined asymmetry underlies the inhibitory control of flexor–extensor locomotor movements.eLife. 2015; 4: e04718Google Scholar). We induced Cre expression in Zic2 spinal neurons at E14.5 and caused ablation of Zic2 neurons at 6 weeks postnatally by application of diphtheria toxin (DTx) (Figures 2A and 2B ). Based on the Ai14 Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter allele (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar), 60% of Zic2 neurons were ablated in the lumbar spinal cord (Figures 2C and 2D). DTx treatment seemed to equally affect all Zic2 neurons because the spatial distribution of the remaining non-ablated Zic2 neurons was similar to the distribution of the intact population (Figures S2A–S2D). A series of sensory tests was performed on Zic2-neuron-ablated mice and littermate controls carrying only one of the recombinases and the DTR transgene and having been subjected to the same DTx treatment. Zic2-neuron-ablated mice showed a specific sensory impairment in dynamic and static light mechanical stimulation of the plantar surface of the hindpaws. We detected reduced responses to dynamic and static brushing (Figures 2E and 2F) and in the sensitivity to gentle von Frey filament stimulations, which was seen as a mild increase in paw withdrawal threshold (Figures 2G and S2L). In contrast, Zic2-neuron-ablated mice displayed normal sensitivity to noxious mechanical stimuli, to heat and cold, and normal scratching responses evoked by chloroquine-induced itch (Figures 2H–2K). Similar results were obtained when we ablated neurons with the Zic2creERbroad line (Figures S2E–S2L). To obtain independent evidence that Zic2 neurons mediate tactile perception, we implemented a modified texture discrimination task (Wetzel et al., 2007Wetzel C. Hu J. Riethmacher D. Benckendorff A. Harder L. Eilers A. Moshourab R. Kozlenkov A. Labuz D. Caspani O. et al.A stomatin-domain protein essential for touch sensation in the mouse.Nature. 2007; 445: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) that measured preference for a “rough” over a “fine” chamber floor texture. Control mice were found to spend more time on the rougher surface, whereas Zic2-neuron-ablated mice reduced their preference for the “rough” floor chamber when the textural difference was less pronounced (Figures 2L–2P). The decrease of tactile perception was remarkable considering that the whiskers were still intact in these mice. In summary, these results indicate that Zic2 spinal neurons are specifically required for innocuous light touch perception and tactile discrimination. Because cutaneous sensory feedback by dorsal spinal INs contributes to fine motor movements (Bourane et al., 2015Bourane S. Grossmann K.S. Britz O. Dalet A. Del Barrio M.G. Stam F.J.

Circuits for grasping: spinal dI3 interneurons mediate cutaneous control of motor behavior.Neuron. 2013; 78: 191-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we addressed the role of Zic2 neurons in motor control. Zic2-neuron-ablated mice showed normal locomotor activity in an open field test, normal gross motor coordination assessed by the accelerating rotarod (Figures 3A–3C), and normal gait and limb coordination during treadmill walking (Figures S3A and S3B). However, when traversing a narrow elevated beam, Zic2-neuron-ablated mice displayed significantly more hindlimb slips than control mice (Figures 3D and 3E; Video S1). Similar motor deficits were observed when Zic2-neuron-ablated mice were challenged with crossing a narrow descending beam (Figures 3F and 3G; Video S2). Nearly identical results were obtained using the Zic2creERbroad line (Figures S3C–S3F). These results suggest that Zic2-neuron-mediated feedback to the motor system is required for corrective motor movements that presumably require intact tactile sensation in the hindpaws. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5MzE3NTI2ZmE2MjIwNDEyZWVjMDI3OWM4YjJlNDEzNyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3OTU5MTQ1fQ.L-yGaP_6RbEbefvw13DjKB_qMgI2OpKeqrnAX63WgZew9uv9rhNsSbh-P4-5qVyg0vL7Btk425F2VcWCetChqmXp6MTD9mIjsptTh2C6UlaecZIQviu8MNdF8Z66JLogAjNlDgUlk5mcEv6Y0V_vk7f6iUyi7YApiT4wIzLBNvKjgIQ2ijGmyYwAax2nThssJc2OcLz8VsWsRe9xydDSd5fc5-cWJpTm3p_k73EEuMpnnbIa2Z2iC0xI78EH2SsfirOJ60ipvBREtX-cLn1nAgaWsBiFm9F9iWQmB82jhTJrIOfXtnMpOhqpaylDOzNG_QoAx0mtowcrTVaGt7HT_w Download .mp4 (46.56 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

Representative Videos of Control and Zic2-Neuron-Ablated Mice Crossing a Descending 5-mm-wide Beam, Related to Figure 3 To further evaluate Zic2 neurons, we performed gain-of-function experiments, in which we acutely activated Zic2 spinal neurons with the activating designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) receptor hM3Dq (Sciolino et al., 2016Sciolino N.R. Plummer N.W. Chen Y.W. Alexander G.M. Robertson S.D. Dudek S.M. McElligott Z.A. Jensen P. Recombinase-Dependent Mouse Lines for Chemogenetic Activation of Genetically Defined Cell Types.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by using intersectional genetics (Zic2creER;Cdx2FlpO;RC::hM3Dq) (Figure 4A). The activity of the hM3Dq receptor was validated by c-Fos IR, a marker for neuronal activity. We found that c-Fos IR was increased 2 h after clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) administration in hM3Dq expression as compared to control mice (Figures 4B and 4C). As previously reported for the RC::FL-hM3Dq allele, we observed faint mCherry IR in some brain regions, especially in the cerebellum and hippocampus, where Zic2cre is normally strongly expressed. This was shown to be due to a cryptic splice acceptor in the hM3Dq cDNA and to contain only mCherry mRNA and not the mRNA-encoding mCherry-hM3Dq fusion protein (Sciolino et al., 2016Sciolino N.R. Plummer N.W. Chen Y.W. Alexander G.M. Robertson S.D. Dudek S.M. McElligott Z.A. Jensen P. Recombinase-Dependent Mouse Lines for Chemogenetic Activation of Genetically Defined Cell Types.Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; data not shown). We performed a series of sensory tests by using a genetic control group, mice carrying only one of the recombinases plus the hM3Dq allele, and a “pharmacological” control group, mice carrying both recombinases, subjected to behavioral analysis after injection with vehicle, and subsequently injected with CNO to control for drug-induced effects (Gomez et al., 2017Gomez J.L. Bonaventura J. Lesniak W. Mathews W.B. Sysa-Shah P. Rodriguez L.A. Ellis R.J. Richie C.T. Harvey B.K. Dannals R.F. et al.Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine.Science. 2017; 357: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Zic2-neuron-activated mice showed an increased withdrawal response to dynamic and static brush (Figures 4D and 4E) compared to the same group treated with vehicle or to the genetic control group, respectively, and a decrease in the von Frey paw withdrawal threshold compared to both genetic control group and pre-activation controls (Figures 4F, S4G, and S4H). Zic2-neuron-activated mice displayed normal sensitivity to mechanical pain and heat, based on withdrawal thresholds (Figures 4G and 4H), and an absence of signs of hypersensitivity to pain, such as guarding the paws (data not shown). Similar mechanical hypersensitivity was observed with the Zic2creERbroad line (Figures S4A–S4E and S4G). Activation of Zic2 neurons did not alter either gross or fine motor control (Figure S5), suggesting that the execution of the motor tasks was not disturbed by the excessive tactile sensation. To assess the emotional aspects of the induced mechanical hypersensitivity, we performed a conditioned place aversion (CPA) assay. Because most mice showed an initial preference for one of the CPA chambers, we used a biased design to test whether the activation of Zic2 neurons would decrease the animals’ preference for the initially preferred (I.P.) chamber. Mice were conditioned by pairing exposure to CNO with the I.P. chamber, alternating with exposure to vehicle in the alternative chamber (Figure 4I) (Vrontou et al., 2013Vrontou S. Wong A.M. Rau K.K. Koerber H.R. Anderson D.J. Genetic identification of C fibres that detect massage-like stroking of hairy skin in vivo.Nature. 2013; 493: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). On the test day, Zic2-neuron-activated mice showed a significant decrease in the time spent in the I.P. chamber that was paired with CNO (Figures 4J and 4K). Similar CPA results were obtained with the Zic2creERbroad line (Figure S4F). These data suggest that chemogenetic activation of Zic2 neurons is aversive and/or anxiogenic. In summary, these results indicate that activation of Zic2 spinal neurons leads to an increased sensitivity to light mechanical stimuli. Taken together with the loss of function results, Zic2 neurons seem to be both required and sufficient to transmit light touch sensation. We previously suggested that Zic2 neurons receive afferent input from mechanosensory neurons (Paixão et al., 2013Paixão S. Balijepalli A. Serradj N. Niu J. Luo W. Martin J.H. Klein R. EphrinB3/EphA4-mediated guidance of ascending and descending spinal tracts.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In view of the function of Zic2 neurons in touch sensation, we sought to further analyze their afferent inputs. We performed retrograde monosynaptic tracing by using the EnvA pseudotyped GFP rabies virus (SADΔG-GFP) (Wickersham et al., 2007Wickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J.O. Mori T. Finke S.

Little is known about the effect on classroom behaviour. Students from nine secondary schools (n = 60, M age = 13.2±1.0y) were observed via momentary time sampling for a 30 minute period, in both a traditionally furnished and arranged classroom and a flexible learning space containing a variety of furniture options to accommodate different pedagogical approaches and learning styles. The teaching approaches in both conditions were documented. In traditional classrooms the approach was predominantly teacher-led and in the flexible learning space it was student-centred. Students in flexible learning spaces spent significantly more time in large group settings (d = 0.61, p = 0.001), collaborating (d = 1.33, p = 0.001), interacting with peers (d = 0.88, p = 0.001) and actively engaged (d = 0.50, p = 0.001) than students in traditional classrooms. Students also spent significantly less class time being taught in a whole class setting (d = -0.65, p = 0.001), engaged in teacher-led instruction (d = -0.75, p = 0.001), working individually (d = -0.79, p = 0.001), verbally off-task (d = -0.44, p = 0.016), and using technology (d = -0.26, p = 0.022) than in traditional classrooms. The results suggest that the varied, adaptable nature of flexible learning spaces coupled with the use of student-centred pedagogies, facilitated a higher proportion of class time interacting, collaborating and engaging with the lesson content. This may translate into beneficial learning outcomes in the long-term."

This work provides a unique resource to decipher the complex combinatorial rules governing DC-Th cell communication and guide their manipulation for vaccine design and immunotherapies. Cell-cell communication involves the exchange of molecular signals produced by a given cell and transmitting an effect through specific receptors expressed on target cells. This process requires integration of multiple communication signals of different nature during homeostatic or stress-related responses. For example, differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells into mature myeloid or lymphoid blood cells requires the collective action of multiple cytokines, growth factors, and Notch ligands (Balan et al., 2018Balan S. Arnold-Schrauf C. Abbas A. Couespel N. Savoret J. Imperatore F. Villani A.C. Vu Manh T.P. Bhardwaj N. Dalod M. Large-Scale Human Dendritic Cell Differentiation Revealing Notch-Dependent Lineage Bifurcation and Heterogeneity.Cell Rep. 2018; 24: 1902-1915.e6Google Scholar). In the context of stress, multiple signals need to be integrated by innate and adaptive immune cells, including cytokines, growth factors, inflammatory mediators, and immune checkpoints (Chen and Flies, 2013Chen L. Flies D.B. Molecular mechanisms of T cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 227-242Google Scholar, Macagno et al., 2007Macagno A. Napolitani G. Lanzavecchia A. Sallusto F. Duration, combination and timing: the signal integration model of dendritic cell activation.Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 227-233Google Scholar). In most studies, these communication molecules have been studied as individual stimuli to a target cell by gain- and loss-of-function experiments. This provides important knowledge regarding the downstream effects of the signals but prevents us from widely addressing their function in various contexts of other co-expressed communication signals. Context dependency is an important aspect of verbal language communication that can directly affect the meaning of individual words but also modify the logic of syntactic rules (Cariani and Rips, 2017Cariani F. Rips L.J. Conditionals, Context, and the Suppression Effect.Cogn. Sci. (Hauppauge). 2017; 41: 540-589Google Scholar, Kintsch and Mangalath, 2011Kintsch W. Mangalath P. The construction of meaning.Top. Cogn. Sci. 2011; 3: 346-370Google Scholar). Similarly, context dependencies may dramatically affect the function of biologically active communication signals. For example, we have shown that 90% of the transcriptional response to type I interferon in human CD4 T cells depends on the cytokine context (T helper 1 [Th1], Th2, or Th17; Touzot et al., 2014Touzot M. Grandclaudon M. Cappuccio A. Satoh T. Martinez-Cingolani C. Servant N. Manel N. Soumelis V. Combinatorial flexibility of cytokine function during human T helper cell differentiation.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3987Google Scholar). Other studies have identified major context-dependent functions of immune checkpoints, such as OX40-ligand (Ito et al., 2005Ito T. Wang Y.H. Duramad O. Hori T. Delespesse G.J. Watanabe N. Qin F.X. Yao Z. Cao W. Liu Y.J. TSLP-activated dendritic cells induce an inflammatory T helper type 2 cell response through OX40 ligand.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1213-1223Google Scholar), and regulatory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (Ivanov et al., 2006Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R.

A critical function for transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin 23 and proinflammatory cytokines in driving and modulating human T(H)-17 responses.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 650-657Google Scholar). These studies suggest that communication molecules function as words of a complex language with grammar defining combinatorial rules of co-expression and mutual influence of one signal over the function (meaning) of another signal. Three levels of biological complexity need to be integrated to decipher those combinatorial rules: (1) the multiplicity of input communication signals to include as many possible contextual effects; (2) communication signals at their naturally occurring concentrations; and (3) a large number of output responses in target cells, reflecting the effect of cell-cell communication quantitatively and qualitatively. Those three levels create a bottleneck in deciphering cell-cell communication. Here we developed an integrative approach combining (1) coupled protein-level measurement of multiple communication signals and output response molecules in target cells; (2) a multivariate mathematical modeling strategy enabling us to infer the input-output relationships for individual signals, taking into account the context and configuration of all other signals; and (3) experimental validation of model-derived hypotheses. We applied this framework to decipher human dendritic cell (DC)-Th cell communication, which potentially involves over 70 individual molecular stimuli (Chen and Flies, 2013Chen L. Flies D.B. Molecular mechanisms of T cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 227-242Google Scholar), including cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members, integrins, nectins, Notch ligands, and galectins (Tindemans et al., 2017Tindemans I.

T helper cell differentiation more than just cytokines.Adv. Immunol. 2011; 109: 159-196Google Scholar). These molecules can all be expressed by DCs and function as communication signals to T cells (hereafter called Th stimuli). They can be measured at the protein level by highly specific assays to optimize biological relevance. By using this unbiased data-driven approach, we could capture the simultaneous effects of large numbers of DC-T cell communication signals in naturally occurring patterns and expression levels. Our systems-level model revealed novel emergent and context-dependent mechanisms controlling Th cell differentiation. A similar framework can be applied to systematically decipher the communication of other cell types. To induce a broad range of DC molecular states expressing various patterns of communication signals, human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) and primary blood CD11c+ DCs (bDCs), were activated for 24 h with a diversity of DC-modulating signals (hereafter called DC perturbators). These included 14 distinct stimuli that were grouped in three categories reflecting various physiopathological contexts: (1) the endogenous factors interferon β (IFN-β), GM-CSF, TSLP, and PGE2; (2) the Toll-like receptor ligands lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (a Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] agonist), PAM3CSK4 (a TLR1 and 2 agonist), Curdlan (a Dectin1 agonist), zymosan (a TLR2 and Dectin1 agonist), R848 (a TLR7 and 8 agonist), poly(I:C) (a TLR3 agonist), and aluminum potassium sulfate (Alum, an NLRP3 inflammasome inducer); and (3) the whole pathogens heat-killed Candida albicans (HKCA), heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM), heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA), heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae (HKSP), and influenza virus (flu). These 14 DC perturbators were used in distinct doses and combinations to further increase the diversity of DC communication molecules and downstream functional effects (Table S1). In each independent experiment, we included a medium condition as a negative control and LPS (100 ng/mL) and/or zymosan (10 μg/mL) as positive controls. A total of 66 perturbators were used on MoDCs and 16 on bDCs, totaling 82 distinct “DC conditions” (C1–C82; Table S1). Under each DC condition, we measured 36 DC-expressed molecules that influence Th cell differentiation in at least one published study (STAR Methods) and can be measured with a highly specific antibody-based assay. Twenty-nine were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at the DC surface (Figure S1A), and 7 were measured in the 24-h DC culture supernatant (STAR Methods). Following 24-h culture under each of the 82 DC perturbation conditions, the same DC batch was used to stimulate naive CD4 T cells in a heterologous co-culture system. On day 6 of co-culture, we measured Th cell expansion fold (Exp Fold) and a total of 17 distinct Th cytokines broadly representing the spectrum of Th cell output responses (STAR Methods). In total, we produced a unique dataset of coupled measurements of DC-derived Th stimuli and Th response cytokines from 428 independent observations from 44 independent donors (Figure 1A; Table S2). We asked whether our systematic DC stimulation strategy could generate important variations in the expression of individual DC-derived Th stimuli. All Th stimuli were expressed over at least three logs (Figure 1B) with high coefficients of variation (>0.44; Figure 1C). Interleukins had higher variability (104–105) and high coefficients of variation from 2.72 for interleukin-12 (IL-12)p70 (IL-12) to 1.43 for IL-6. CD11a had a wide expression range (104) but the smallest coefficient of variation (0.44), with values distributed around the mean (Figure 1C). Hence, we were able to generate highly variable expression patterns for all Th stimuli. We sought to identify conserved and specific patterns of Th stimuli in response to standard DC perturbators. We compared the expression levels of DC-derived Th stimuli under three conditions belonging to distinct classes of microbes—LPS (100 ng/mL, bacteria), zymosan (10 μg/mL, fungi), and flu (1×, Viruses)—that were used across at least 17 MoDC biological replicates (Figure 1D). Medium MoDCs (negative control) expressed lower levels of activation-associated communication molecules (Figures 1D and S1B). We confirmed previous findings, validating our experimental system: (1) zymosan induced specifically IL-10 and IL-23, (2) flu induced a large amount of IL-28α, and (3) LPS and zymosan induced a large amount of IL-12 (Figures 1D and S1B). In addition, we identified novel specific inductions of DC-derived Th stimuli: zymosan-treated MoDCs expressed the highest levels of CD54 and PVR, flu-treated MoDCs specifically induced ICOSL, and LPS-treated MoDCs induced the highest levels of CD30L and CD83 (Figure 1D). Specificity of expression of a given signal for a given DC stimulation was determined using Wilcoxon statistical test (Figure S1B). Hence, standard DC perturbators induced specific patterns of Th stimuli. Next we aimed to assess the spectrum of DC communication states, as defined by their expression pattern of communication signals, across the 82 DC conditions. We computed the mean expression of biological replicates for each DC-derived Th stimulus and performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering to identify classes of the most similar conditions (C1–C82, y axis) and DC-derived Th stimuli (x axis) (Figure 2A). This revealed five groups of DC conditions (Figure 2B). Each of the four standard DC conditions (Figure 1D) belonged to a different group (Figure 2A). Group 1 was defined by high expression of adhesion molecules such as CD18, ICAM-2, ICAM-3, and CD29 and low levels of co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines with the exception of high IL-28a. Group 2 showed low expression for most DC-derived Th stimuli but high levels of integrins, VISTA and B7H3, suggesting a capacity to interact with T cells and transmit co-inhibitory signals. Group 3 showed a complementary pattern, lack of group 1- and group 2-specific molecules, and intermediate or high levels of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, 4-1BBL, and OX40L. This suggested potent T cell stimulating functions. Group 4 exhibited high levels of molecules from the B7 and TNF superfamilies, such as CD80, CD86, PDL1, PDL2, and CD40, but intermediate or low cytokine levels. In contrast, group 5 showed the highest level of cytokines and molecules of the B7 and TNF superfamilies (Figure 2B). Next we sought to analyze intra-cluster heterogeneity. We selected three pairs of perturbators most closely related as defined by Euclidian distance (C32 [MoDC HKLM, MOI 1] and C33 [MoDC HKCA, MOI 1], C47 [bDC LPS, 100 ng/mL] and C48 [bDC HLKM, MOI 1], and C61 [MoDC R848, 1 μg/mL] and C62 [MoDC PAM3, 10 μg/mL]) and compared them regarding expression of the 36 DC-derived Th stimuli (Figure 2C). C32 and C33 did not exhibit significant differences in CD80 and CD86 expression, reflecting equal levels of DC activation. They were statistically different only for IL-6, with levels ranging from complete absence in C33 to over 1 ng/mL in C32 (Figure 2C). In contrast, the pairs C47/C48 and C61/C62 showed significant differences for multiple Th stimuli. C47 expressed significantly more CD86, PDL1, and IL-1 than C48. On the contrary, C48 expressed higher levels of 4-1BBL. C61 and C62 showed marked differences in CD70 and IL-12 (higher in C61) and OX40L (higher in C62) levels. Hence, each DC condition expressed unique combinations of DC-derived Th stimuli, suggesting different communication potential with CD4 T cells. An unsupervised Gaussian mixture model showed that the highest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value corresponded to 82 groups, confirming that each DC condition induced a unique profile of the 36 communication molecules (Figure 2D). Using principal-component analysis (PCA), we showed that neither the date of the experiment nor the donor batch had a major effect on clustering (Figure S1C; STAR Methods). We characterized the diversity of CD4 T cell output responses, as assessed by Th cytokine profiles, following co-culture of naive CD4 T cells with activated DCs across the 82 conditions described previously. Th cytokines exhibited important variations across the 428 observations (Figure 3A). Some cytokines, such as IL-2, TNF-α, GM-CSF, TNF-β, and IL-3, were always detected (Figure S2A).Figure S2Mathematical Description and Statistical Analysis of Th Cytokine Profiles, Related to Figure 3Show full captionA) Table showing three key mathematical parameters of the Exp Fold and the 17 Th derived cytokines.

Expression data were logged transformed and scaled so as μ represents the mean and σ the SD of the expression of a given communication molecule across the whole dataset (n = 428). To identify Th subset signatures, we compared cytokine expression under our four standard conditions: medium (negative control), LPS, zymosan, and flu. The Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F were induced predominantly in zymosan MoDCs. LPS MoDCs induced mixed Th1, Th2, and Th9 responses characterized by high IFN-γ, IL-13, IL-3, and IL-9 compared with medium. Flu MoDCs induced the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-31 (Figures 3B and S2B). These results indicate that, under the LPS, zymosan, and flu conditions, each DC state induced a distinct set of Th cytokine responses corresponding to prototypical Th signatures or mixed Th profiles. We asked whether Th cytokine responses would reveal distinct patterns or a continuum of responses mirroring each of the DC communication states (Figure 2A). We performed hierarchical Pearson clustering on our 18 distinct Th-derived variables across the entire 82 DC-activating conditions (Figure 3C). This revealed 6 distinct groups, although intra-group heterogeneity was evident in almost all groups. Interestingly, DC perturbation conditions (C1–C82) did not appear in the same order compared with DC communication signal clustering (Figure 2A), indicating that closely related patterns of DC-derived Th stimuli did not necessarily induce the closest patterns in Th cytokine responses. Group 1 was dominated by production of IL-10, IL-22, IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-31, IL-13, and IL-4 (Figure S2C). Group 2 was the most heterogeneous and included the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 co-expressed with variable levels of the Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) cytokines (Figure S2C). Group 3 expressed IL-21, IFN-γ, and IL-17F but no or low IL-17A, suggesting the possibility of differential regulatory mechanisms (Figure S2C). Group 4 was dominated by the Th17 cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F, group 5 by IL-22, and group 6 by IL-2. Distinct sets of DC perturbation conditions and, hence, patterns of DC-derived communication molecules were associated with each of these groups (Figure 3C). This was the first suggestion of specific rules underlying input-output relationships in DC-Th communication. Because of intra-group heterogeneity, we asked whether most correlated conditions within the same cluster would differ from each other (Figure 3D). C12 and C33 were associated to different levels in IL-17F, whereas C42 and C47 were different in IL-2 and C46 and C49 were different in IL-6 and GM-CSF levels (Figure 3D). As for the DC dataset, we found that 82 was the best number of groups in our Th-derived dataset, based on a Gaussian mixture model (Figure 3E). This suggested that a single DC profile of communication molecules would induce a unique set of Th cytokines. Having generated distinct patterns of DC-derived communication signals associated with a diversity of induced CD4 T cell cytokine responses, the question of their relationship appeared to be critical to decipher DC-Th communication. Given the complexity of the dataset and the lack of clear hypotheses concerning the majority of DC-derived Th stimuli, we applied an unsupervised mathematical modeling strategy (Figure 4A). The MultiVarSel strategy with stability selection performed similarly as the internal positive control and better than other methodologies tested (Figure S3A; STAR Methods). Therefore, we applied MultiVarSel to the modeling of our experimental data (Figure 4A). This methodology takes into account the dependencies that may exist among Th cell cytokines and combines Lasso criterion and stability selection to select associations between DC-derived signals (inputs) and Th cytokines (outputs) (STAR Methods). Our multivariate model identified a large number of significant positive (red) and negative (blue) associations of the 36 DC-derived Th stimuli with the 17 Th-derived cytokines (Figure 4B). White squares represent the absence of significant association (Figure 4B). The frequency of selection obtained for each input-output association is provided in Figure S3B. Our mathematical model revealed (1) the effect of each DC communication signal on Th output responses and (2) the critical regulators for each Th cytokine. For example, negative regulators of IL-10 were OX40L, 4-1BBL, IL-12, TNF-α, CD58, VISTA, Galectin-3, CD80, CD29, IL-1, ICAM-3, SLAMF3, IL-28α, and CD83, and positive regulators were Jagged-2, PDL1, IL-10, CD11a, HLA-DR, ICOSL, CD100, CD30L, CD18, ICAM-2, and CD86 (Figure 4B). Hence, the model can predict IL-10 production by responding Th cells for any DC, given the expression level of these molecules. It allows simulating loss or gain of function of an input. Similar insight can be obtained for each of the 17 Th cytokine responses, which may be explained by a combination of DC-derived communication signals. We used computational cross-validation to evaluate the error of prediction of our model (Figure 4C). For all Th cytokines, the multivariate outperformed the best univariate model (Figure S3C). We ranked Th cytokines based on their prediction errors; the Th variables best explained by our model were IL-6, IL-17F, Exp Fold, and IL-3 (Figure 4C). To address DC type specificity in model performance, we calculated the cross-validation error for each Th output of the MoDC and bDC dataset, respectively. Our model predicted equally well the majority of the outputs for the two DC types (Figure S3D). For a few outputs, mostly IL-22 and TNF-β, the model was more error prone in bDCs than MoDCs (Figure S3D). Interestingly, a higher prediction error was found for TNF-β in 5 of 118 observations (Figure S3E), where TNF-β levels were very high (range, 6.7–22.2). This suggested that a TNF-β-promoting input signal might be involved in those 5 cases but not included in our model. For IL-22, more observations had a higher prediction error in bDCs compared with MoDCs, but the prediction error range and distributions were similar, suggesting that the input-output relationship was conserved (Figure S3E). We performed hierarchical clustering for both DC and T cell-derived variables to identify co-regulations between Th outputs. We retrieved relevant clusters of Th cytokines belonging classically to the same Th subset (Figure 4B). The Th2-related cytokines IL-13, IL-31, IL-5, IL-4, IL-10, and GM-CSF were found in the same cluster, suggesting that their induction would be controlled by similar mechanisms. IL-17A and IL-17F were also in the same cluster, implying that the model associated them with closely related DC communication signals (Figure 4B). Surprisingly, our model closely related IL-9 expression to IL-17A and IL-17F, suggesting common regulators. It also clustered IL-22 closer to the Th2 than to the Th17 cytokines. IL-21 was associated with the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ (Figure 4B). We systematically compared our model results with the literature as a knowledge-based validation but also novelty assessment. We screened 178 relevant articles (STAR Methods) and extracted information regarding specific molecular control of a given Th cytokine by DC-derived signals measured in our model (Table S3). We computed a validation score based on the number of articles identifying the same associations than our model (STAR Methods). IL-12 ranked as the top DC communication signal for which our model predictions globally recapitulated existing knowledge (8 of 13 predicted associations). Among other known associations, IL-23 was positively associated with IL-17A and IL-17F, IL-10 was positively associated with IL-10 and negatively with IFN-γ, and CD40 was positively associated with IFN-γ. However, the model also predicted 290 associations that were not described previously. Putative novel regulators were identified for all Th outputs (Table S4). The robustness of each prediction could be estimated by the value of the coefficient and by the frequency of detection of the association (Table S4). Examples of high scores were B7H3 and CD83 association with IL-4, 4-1BBL association with IL-9, ICOSL association with IL-13, and OX40L negative association with IL-22 (Table S4). Overall, literature knowledge was retrieved for 80 distinct input-output relationships presented in our model (Figure 4B); 56 were in agreement with our model, representing a global literature validation score of 70%. We performed systematic experimental validation by selecting a subset of target inputs and systematically measuring the Th outputs selected by our model. We assessed the novelty of each validated prediction (Table S3). First we addressed systematic validations of model predictions by blocking experiments (Figure 5A). We performed double in silico knockout for CD80 and CD86 under the three conditions—LPS (100 ng/mL), flu (1×), and zymosan (10 μg/mL) MoDCs—in which CD80 and CD86 were highly expressed and predicted an effect on 15 distinct Th outputs (Figure 5B), 11 of which were successfully experimentally validated (STAR Methods). The positive role of CD80 and CD86 on IL-3 and IL-31, to our knowledge, have not been described elsewhere. The predictions we failed to validate were for IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and TNF-α (Figure S4A), all predicted to be decreased by CD80/CD86.Figure S4Complementary Th Secretion Profiles of the Tested Conditions for Systematic Model Validation, Related to Figure 5Show full captionA) Fold change of the cytokine concentration estimated versus experimentally measured for the four indicated cytokines. n = 6 independent donors B) Mean cytokine concentration and SD indicated for each condition. n = 6 C) Mean cytokine concentration and SD indicated for each condition. n = 6 D) and E) Mean cytokine concentration and SD indicated for each condition. n = 6 F) Boxplot of the coefficient and stability selection frequencies in the two conditions: True (validated predictions) and False (not validated), Wilcoxon test.

We show that focal activation of MCtx corticobulbar neurons evokes behaviorally relevant concurrent movements of the forelimb, jaw, nose, and vibrissae. The projections from different locations in MCtx form gradients of boutons across premotor nuclei spinal trigeminal pars oralis (SpVO) and interpolaris rostralis (SpVIr). Furthermore, retrograde viral tracing from muscles that control orofacial actions shows that these premotor nuclei segregate their outputs. In the most dramatic case, both SpVO and SpVIr are premotor to forelimb and vibrissa muscles, while only SpVO is premotor to jaw muscles. Functional confirmation of the superimposed control by MCtx was obtained through selective optogenetic activation of corticobulbar neurons on the basis of their preferential projections to SpVO versus SpVIr. We conclude that neighboring projection neurons in orofacial MCtx form parallel pathways to distinct pools of trigeminal premotor neurons that coordinate motor actions into a behavior."

Currently, no drug is able to cure breast cancer‐associated bone metastasis. In this study, we focused on statins that are known to inhibit cholesterol production and act as antitumor agents. After an initial potency screening of 7 U.S. Food and Drug Administration‐approved statins, we examined pitavastatin as a drug candidate for inhibiting tumor and tumor‐induced bone loss. In vitro analysis revealed that pitavastatin acted as an inhibitor of tumor progression by altering stress to the endoplasmic reticulum, down‐regulating peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ, and reducing Snail and matrix metalloproteinase 9. In bone homeostasis, it blocked osteoclast development by suppressing transcription factors c‐Fos and JunB, but stimulated osteoblast mineralization by regulating bone morphogenetic protein 2 and p53. In a mouse model, pitavastatin presented a dual role in tumor inhibition in the mammary fat pad, as well as in bone protection in the osteolytic tibia. In mass spectrometry‐based analysis, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were linked to lipid metabolism and cholesterol synthesis were elevated in mice from the tumor‐grown placebo group. Notably, pitavastatin‐treated mice reduced specific VOCs that are linked to lipid metabolites in the mevalonate pathway. Collectively, the results lay a foundation for further investigation of pitavastatin's therapeutic efficacy in tumor‐induced bone loss, as well as VOC‐based diagnosis of tumor progression and treatment efficacy.—Wang, L., Wang Y., Chen, A., Teli, M., Kondo, R.

https://openalex.org/W2978327561,"Adiponectin (APN), an adipocyte‐derived adipokine, has been shown to limit lung injury originating from endothelial cell (EC) damage. Previously we reported that obese mice with low circulatory APN levels exhibited pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction. This study was designed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pulmonary endothelium‐dependent protective effects of APN. Our results demonstrated that in APN –/– mice, there was an inherent state of endothelium mitochondrial dysfunction that could contribute to endothelial activation and increased susceptibility to LPS‐induced acute lung injury (ALI). We noted that APN –/– mice showed decreased expression of mitochondrial biogenesis regulatory protein peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ coactivator 1‐α (PGC‐1α) and its downstream proteins nuclear respiratory factor 1, transcription factor A, mitochondrial, and Sirtuin (Sirt)3 and Sirt1 expression in whole lungs and in freshly isolated lung ECs from these mice at baseline and subjected to LPS‐induced ALI. We further showed that treating APN _/_ mice with PGC‐1α activator pyrroloquinoline quinone enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and function in lung endothelium and attenuation of ALI. These results suggest that the pulmonary endothelium‐protective properties of APN are mediated, at least in part, by an enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis through a mechanism involving PGC‐1α activation.—Shah, D., Torres, C., Bhandari, V.

The PlGF mAb promotes (but recombinant protein disrupts) EC barrier function, thus affecting the barrier‐forming protein levels, membrane distribution, and EC monolayer impedance by the electrical cell‐impedance sensing system, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining. RNA sequencing‐based transcriptome analysis identified the up‐regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the antioxidant defense protein by PlGF blockade. The PlGF and PlGF/VEGF dimers (but not VEGF‐A) down‐regulated the protein expression of glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and peroxiredoxin (PRDX). G6PD inhibition and gene silencing (small interfering RNA) abolished the beneficial effects of PlGF inhibition on EC barrier function and PRDX3/6 protein expression. VEGF receptor (VEGFR)1 or VEGFR2 blockade prevented the inhibitory effect of PlGF on G6PD protein expression and EC barrier function. The PRDX6 played dual roles in EC barrier function through glutathione peroxidase and phospholipase A 2 activity. In sum, PlGF negatively regulates EC barrier function through the activation of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 and the suppression of the G6PD/PPP and the antioxidant pathways.—Huang, H., Lennikov, A., Saddala, M.

One of these sensors, Sestrin-2, functions as an intracellular sensor of cytosolic leucine and inhibitor of mTORC1 activity. Genetic studies of Sestrin-2 have confirmed its critical role in regulating mTORC1 activity, especially in the case of leucine starvation. Sestrin-2 is known to be transcriptionally controlled by several mechanisms; however, the post-translational proteolytic regulation of Sestrin-2 remains unclear. Here, we explored how Sestrin-2 is regulated through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Using an unbiased screening approach of an siRNA library targeting ubiquitin E3 ligases, we identified a RING-type E3 ligase, ring finger protein 186 (RNF186), that critically mediates the Sestrin-2 ubiquitination and degradation. We observed that RNF186 and Sestrin-2 bind each other through distinct C-terminal motifs and that Lys-13 in Sestrin-2 is a putative ubiquitin acceptor site. RNF186 knockdown increased Sestrin-2 protein levels and decreased mTORC1 activation. These results reveal a new mechanism of E3 ligase control of mTORC1 activity through the RNF186-Sestrin-2 axis, suggesting that RNF186 inhibition may be a potential strategy to increase levels of the mTORC1 inhibitor Sestrin-2.

During nutrient availability, mTORC1 phosphorylates several key signaling proteins, such as P70S6K, 4E-BP1, and ULK1, working to activate anabolic processes and inhibit processes such as autophagy (3Saxton R.A.

Ubiquitination is a major cellular mechanism to degrade proteins, often through the proteasome (13Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev.

This process entails the stepwise shuttling of the small protein ubiquitin to target substrates. This process is accomplished in an enzymatic cascade ending with a family of proteins called ubiquitin E3 ligases. E3 ligases play the critical role in identifying and binding the substrate protein fated for ubiquitination. Research has shown that ubiquitination controls various aspects of development and disease (14Rape M. Ubiquitylation at the crossroads of development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 (28928488): 59-7010.1038/nrm.2017.83Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our group and others have noted distinct mechanisms of E3 ligase control of disease, such as lung innate immunity and fibrosis, and of mTORC1 activity (15Lear T. McKelvey A.C. Rajbhandari S.

E3 ligases are also a growing field for therapeutic targeting and inhibition (18Zheng N. Shabek N. Ubiquitin ligases: structure, function, and regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86 (28375744): 129-15710.1146/annurev-biochem-060815-014922Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether Sestrin-2 was subject to ubiquitin E3 ligase–mediated degradation and the effect of this control on mTORC1 activity. Here, we report the mechanistic study of Sestrin-2 ubiquitination and degradation by the RING E3 ligase RNF186. We observed that Sestrin-2 has a short half-life in Beas-2b cells that is prolonged by inhibiting the proteasome or the ubiquitination cascade. We used unbiased high-throughput screening of Sestrin-2-GFP–expressing cells with a library of siRNA-targeting ubiquitin proteins and E3 ligases to uncover the E3 ligase RNF186 as a regulator of Sestrin-2 stability. RNF186 silencing prolongs Sestrin-2 stability, whereas RNF186 expression accelerated Sestrin-2 degradation. RNF186 ubiquitinates and binds Sestrin-2 through specific domains. Silencing of RNF186 leads to decreased mTORC1 activity, potentially through increased Sestrin-2 protein abundance. This study adds a new mechanism for control of nutrient sensing through protein ubiquitination and suggests that RNF186 may be a potential target for inhibition to increase the level of the mTORC1 inhibitor Sestrin-2. We first investigated the stability of Sestrin-2 in human primary airway epithelial Beas-2B cells. Cycloheximide (CHX) time course revealed that endogenous Sestrin-2 has a half-life of around 4 h, which is prolonged with proteasomal inhibition by MG132 (Fig. 1A). Treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin did not increase Sestrin-2 protein stability. MG132 treatment also resulted in a time-dependent increase in endogenous Sestrin-2 level (Fig. 1B). Whereas the proteasome is the end point for most protein degradation, the ubiquitination pathway is a major upstream mechanism controlling proteins fated for proteasomal degradation. Co-treatment of Beas-2B cells with CHX and the ubiquitin E1 inhibitor MLN7243 resulted in enhanced Sestrin-2 stability, suggesting a role for ubiquitin control of Sestrin-2 stability (19Hyer M.L. Milhollen M.A. Ciavarri J. Fleming P. Traore T. Sappal D. Huck J. Shi J. Gavin J. Brownell J. Yang Y. Stringer B. Griffin R. Bruzzese F. Soucy T. et al.A small-molecule inhibitor of the ubiquitin activating enzyme for cancer treatment.Nat. Med. 2018; 24 (29334375): 186-19310.1038/nm.4474Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Expression of HA-tagged ubiquitin with CHX treatment led to Sestrin-2 degradation, which was also prevented with proteasomal inhibition (Fig. 1D). Ubiquitin is often assembled in polymeric chains upon proteins to be degraded; this polyubiquitination is a canonical signal for degradation (13Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (9759494): 425-47910.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.425Crossref PubMed Scopus (6880) Google Scholar). Sestrin-2 pulldown in the presence of MG132 displayed an extensive high-molecular weight ubiquitin signal, characteristic of polyubiquitination (Fig. 1E). These polyubiquitin chains have the capacity to assemble different linkage types, forming a cellular code (20Komander D. Rape M. The ubiquitin code.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81 (22524316): 203-22910.1146/annurev-biochem-060310-170328Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). We used the UbiCREST assay to unravel the specific polyubiquitin chain type assembled on Sestrin-2. UbiCREST utilizes the differential reactivity of deubiquitinase enzymes for specific polyubiquitin linkage types (21Hospenthal M.K. Mevissen T.E.T. Komander D. Deubiquitinase-based analysis of ubiquitin chain architecture using ubiquitin chain restriction (UbiCRest).Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 (25633630): 349-36110.1038/nprot.2015.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We observed that Sestrin-2 assembles predominately Lys-48 and -63 polyubiquitin chains, as evidenced by the degradation of Sestrin-2 polyubiquitin signal upon treatment with deubiquitinases specific for these linkage types (Fig. 1F). Ubiquitin E3 ligases are the critical substrate-recognition mechanism of the ubiquitination pathway. To understand the mechanism of Sestrin-2 degradation, we prepared a stable Sestrin-2-GFP–expressing cell line and utilized an RNAi library targeting proteins involved in ubiquitination (E1, E2, E3, etc.) to screen for Sestrin-2 regulators. Sestrin-2-GFP cells were transfected with the siRNA library, and GFP fluorescence was measured after 72 h and ranked by median absolute deviation Z-score. We observed several key regulators of Sestrin-2 stability (Fig. 2A). Specifically, the ubiquitin E3 ligases RNF186 and PRFP19 resulted in potent Sestrin-2-GFP signal relative to control siRNA (Fig. 2B). Top hits from the screen were evaluated by immunoblotting, and RNF186 knockdown resulted in increased SESN2 protein signal (Fig. 2C). Further, RNF186 expression resulted in dose-dependent decrease in Sestrin-2 protein (Fig. 2D). In contrast, mutation of a key residue within the RNF186 active site, His-60 to Trp (22Fujimoto K. Kinoshita M. Tanaka H. Okuzaki D. Shimada Y. Kayama H. Okumura R. Furuta Y. Narazaki M. Tamura A. Hatakeyama S. Ikawa M. Tsuchiya K. Watanabe M. Kumanogoh A. Tsukita S. Takeda K. Regulation of intestinal homeostasis by the ulcerative colitis-associated gene RNF186.Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10 (27381925): 446-45910.1038/mi.2016.58Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), led to an inability to decrease Sestrin-2 protein (Fig. 2E). Beas-2B cells were treated with siRNA against RNF186 prior to CHX chase, and we observed that RNF186 knockdown resulted in prolonged Sestrin-2 stability relative to control siRNA (Fig. 2F). Conversely, RNF186 overexpression led to accelerated Sestrin-2 degradation in CHX chase (Fig. 2G). Finally, co-expression of RNF186 with ubiquitin and Sestrin-2 in an in vivo ubiquitination assay resulted in increased polyubiquitination signal detected from Sestrin-2 pulldown, suggesting that RNF186 facilitates the ubiquitination of Sestrin-2 (Fig. 2H). To further examine the mechanism of the RNF186/Sestrin-2 interaction, we conducted reductionist mapping experiments to find the critical protein motif for binding. We prepared RNF186 deletion mutants (Fig. 3A), synthesized the protein fragments in vitro, and exposed them to immunoprecipitated Sestrin-2 in binding assays. We observed that the RNF186 ΔC27 mutant lost binding with Sestrin-2, and upon further deletion mapping, we observe that the C10–20 region of RNF186 is critical for Sestrin-2 binding (Fig. 3, B and C). We also prepare deletion mutants of Sestrin-2 encompassing critical protein domains (Fig. 3D). Sestrin-2 mutants lost binding with RNF186 with the ΔC173 mutant (Fig. 3E). Further mapping studies show that the key region for RNF186 engagement exists between residues 308 and 380 of Sestrin-2 (Fig. 3F). Substrates are ubiquitinated through a covalent isopeptide bond between ubiquitin's C terminus and an acceptor amino acid on the substrate. The key substrate amino acid is often lysine (23Akutsu M. Dikic I. Bremm A. Ubiquitin chain diversity at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 (26906419): 875-88010.1242/jcs.183954Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We sought to identify the critical ubiquitin acceptor lysine site within Sestrin-2. Previous ubiquitin proteomics studies detected a ubiquitinated peptide corresponding to Sestrin-2 Lys-13 (24Udeshi N.D. Svinkina T. Mertins P. Kuhn E. Mani D.R. Qiao J.W. Carr S.A. Refined preparation and use of anti-diglycine remnant (K-ɛ-GG) antibody enables routine quantification of 10,000s of ubiquitination sites in single proteomics experiments.Mol. Cell.

To confirm this, we prepared Sestrin-2 point mutants and co-expressed them with RNF186 in Beas-2B cells. Sestrin-2 K13R mutant demonstrated resistance to RNF186 expression relative to WT (Fig. 3G). Further, Sestrin-2 K13R mutant displayed a prolonged half-life in CHX time course (Fig. 3H). As a negative control, mutation of nonubiquitin-associated Sestrin-2 lysine (K452R) did not confer protection from degradation (Fig. 3I). We next sought to explore the effect of the RNF186-Sestrin-2 axis on downstream mTORC1 signaling. As a leucine sensor, Sestrin-2 acts to inhibit mTORC1 activity by interacting with GATOR2 and preventing its downstream regulation of the Rag GTPases (5Wolfson R.L. Chantranupong L. Saxton R.A. Shen K. Scaria S.M. Cantor J.R. Sabatini D.M. Sestrin2 is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.Science. 2016; 351 (26449471): 43-4810.1126/science.aab2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of Sestrin-2 is most potent during leucine starvation. SESN2 silencing in Beas-2B cells led to increased mTORC1 activity as measured by phosphorylation of P70S6K (Thr-389) (Fig. 4, A–C). This effect persists even during cellular leucine starvation. Silencing of RNF186 led to increased SESN2 protein relative to control (Fig. 4, D and E). Of note, RNF186 knockdown led to decreased mTORC1 activity relative to control (Fig. 4F). As a complementary assay, we utilized LC3-GFP-RFP reporter cells to measure the effect of RNF186 and SESN2 interaction. This autophagic tool exploited the instability of GFP at low pH to create a reporter sensitive to lysosomal maturation. The LC3 construct also has constitutively cleaved RFP fusion protein, serving as a loading control. The ratio of GFP/RFP is a surrogate for autophagic flux in a cell (25Kaizuka T. Morishita H. Hama Y. Tsukamoto S. Matsui T. Toyota Y. Kodama A. Ishihara T. Mizushima T. Mizushima N. An autophagic flux probe that releases an internal control.Mol.

As autophagy is an end point of mTORC1 regulation, we utilized this tool as a readout for mTORC1 activity. We knocked down SESN2 and RNF186 in Beas-2B cells that stably express LC3-GFP-RFP reporter prior to leucine starvation, fixation, and automated microscopy. We observed control siRNA during leucine starvation, resulting in a 70% decrease in GFP/RFP ratio relative to baseline, consistent with previous studies on the effect of amino acid starvation on autophagic flux (Fig. 5, A and B) (25Kaizuka T. Morishita H. Hama Y. Tsukamoto S. Matsui T. Toyota Y. Kodama A. Ishihara T. Mizushima T. Mizushima N. An autophagic flux probe that releases an internal control.Mol.

SESN2 knockdown resulted in a significantly higher GFP/RFP ratio, suggesting less autophagic flux (Fig. 5, A and C). Interestingly, RNF186 silencing decreased the GFP/RFP further, suggestive of increased autophagic flux (Fig. 5, A and D). These assays suggest that the RNF186/Sestrin-2 axis plays a role in regulating cellular nutrient sensing and metabolic flux. E3 ligases are increasingly appreciated regulators of nutrient sensing and mTORC1 activity (17Jiang Y. Su S. Zhang Y. Qian J. Liu P. Control of mTOR signaling by ubiquitin.Oncogene. 2019; 38 (30705402): 3989-400110.1038/s41388-019-0713-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown the GATOR1 subunit DEPDC5 to be potently regulated by the Cullin-3 substrate receptor KLHL22 (26Chen J. Ou Y. Yang Y. Li W. Xu Y. Xie Y. Liu Y. KLHL22 activates amino-acid-dependent mTORC1 signalling to promote tumorigenesis and ageing.Nature. 2018; 557 (29769719): 585-58910.1038/s41586-018-0128-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our data show that RNF186 plays a similar role in targeting Sestrin-2 for ubiquitination and degradation, which in turn affects mTORC1 activity and downstream autophagic flux. Dysfunction of nutrient sensing is recognized as a hallmark of aging; better understanding of the regulation of nutrient sensing will afford new potential targets for inhibition and intervention (27López-Otín C. Blasco M.A. Partridge L. Serrano M. Kroemer G.

We observed that mutation of a critical residue within the RING domain impaired RNF186’s ability to degrade Sestrin-2 (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of RNF186 drives its effect on Sestrin-2 (22Fujimoto K. Kinoshita M. Tanaka H. Okuzaki D. Shimada Y. Kayama H. Okumura R. Furuta Y. Narazaki M. Tamura A. Hatakeyama S. Ikawa M. Tsuchiya K. Watanabe M. Kumanogoh A. Tsukita S. Takeda K.

We observed that RNF186 and Sestrin-2 binding was lost upon the deletion of a 72-residue region between amino acid 308 and 380 of the Sestrin-2 C terminus (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, this same region has been described as key for regulating mTORC1 activity and for binding leucine (residues 374–377) (6Saxton R.A. Knockenhauer K.E. Wolfson R.L. Chantranupong L. Pacold M.E. Wang T. Schwartz T.U. Sabatini D.M.

Future studies are needed to investigate the distinct mechanism of RNF186/Sestrin-2 interaction and whether leucine plays a role. Lys-48 polyubiquitination is the canonical signal for proteasomal degradation and has been reported as a predominant linkage type among cellular polyubiquitin chains (31Kim W. Bennett E.J. Huttlin Edward L. Guo A. Li J. Possemato A. Sowa M.E. Rad R. Rush J. Comb M.J. Harper J.W. Gygi S.P. Systematic and quantitative assessment of the ubiquitin-modified proteome.Mol.

Through the UbiCREST assay, we observed Sestrin-2 polyubiquitination with Lys-48 linkages, consistent with previous studies in neuronal cells (32Kumar A. Shaha C. RBX1-mediated ubiquitination of SESN2 promotes cell death upon prolonged mitochondrial damage in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2018; 446 (29294217): 1-910.1007/s11010-017-3267-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We also observed that Sestrin-2 contains polyubiquitin chains with Lys-63 linkages. This linkage type has been implicated in several processes, notably cellular trafficking (33Swatek K.N. Komander D. Ubiquitin modifications.Cell Res. 2016; 26 (27012465): 399-42210.1038/cr.2016.39Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether Sestrin-2 ubiquitination plays a nondegradation role in its cellular localization. mTORC1 plays an important role in lung epithelia and disease. Research has suggested that mTORC1 activity plays a pathogenic role in epithelia during acute lung injury (34Hu Y. Lou J. Mao Y.Y. Lai T.W. Liu L.Y. Zhu C. Zhang C. Liu J. Li Y.Y. Zhang F. Li W. Ying S.M. Chen Z.H. Shen H.H. Activation of MTOR in pulmonary epithelium promotes LPS-induced acute lung injury.Autophagy. 2016; 12 (27658023): 2286-229910.1080/15548627.2016.1230584Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, mTOR-driven signaling affects the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis in fibroblasts (35Romero Y. Bueno M. Ramirez R. Álvarez D. Sembrat J.C. Goncharova E.A. Rojas M. Selman M. Mora A.L. Pardo A. mTORC1 activation decreases autophagy in aging and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and contributes to apoptosis resistance in IPF fibroblasts.Aging Cell. 2016; 15 (27566137): 1103-111210.1111/acel.12514Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One study suggested Sestrin-2 inhibition to be protective in a mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (36Wempe F. De-Zolt S. Koli K. Bangsow T. Parajuli N. Dumitrascu R. Sterner-Kock A. Weissmann N. Keski-Oja J. von Melchner H. Inactivation of sestrin 2 induces TGF-β signaling and partially rescues pulmonary emphysema in a mouse model of COPD.Dis. Model.

In order to assess compound activity against non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we developed a method to detect the bactericidal activity of novel compounds within 7 days. Our method uses incubation at low pH in order to induce a non-replicating state. We used a strain of M. tuberculosis expressing luciferase; we first confirmed the linear relationship between luminescence and viable bacteria (determined by colony forming units) under our assay conditions. We optimized the assay parameters in 96-well plates in order to achieve a reproducible assay. Our final assay used M. tuberculosis in phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 4.5 exposed to compounds for 7 days; viable bacteria were determined by luminescence. We recorded the minimum bactericidal concentration at pH 4.5 (MBC4.5) representing >2 logs of kill. We confirmed the utility of the assay with control compounds. The ionophores monensin, niclosamide, and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone and the anti-tubercular drugs pretomanid and rifampicin were active, while several other drugs such as isoniazid, ethambutol, and linezolid were not."
https://openalex.org/W2979083693,"Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS binding to a variety of glutamate receptors. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 to mGluR8) can act excitatory or inhibitory, depending on associated signal cascades. Expression and localization of inhibitory acting mGluRs at inner hair cells (IHCs) in the cochlea are largely unknown. Here, we analyzed expression of mGluR2, mGluR3, mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8 and investigated their localization with respect to the presynaptic ribbon of IHC synapses. We detected transcripts for mGluR2, mGluR3, and mGluR4 as well as for mGluR7a, mGluR7b, mGluR8a, and mGluR8b splice variants. Using receptor-specific antibodies in cochlear wholemounts, we found expression of mGluR2, mGluR4, and mGluR8b close to presynaptic ribbons. Super resolution and confocal microscopy in combination with 3-dimensional reconstructions indicated a postsynaptic localization of mGluR2 that overlaps with postsynaptic density protein 95 on dendrites of afferent type I spiral ganglion neurons. In contrast, mGluR4 and mGluR8b were expressed at the presynapse close to IHC ribbons. In summary, we localized in detail 3 mGluR types at IHC ribbon synapses, providing a fundament for new therapeutical strategies that could protect the cochlea against noxious stimuli and excitotoxicity.-Klotz, L., Wendler, O., Frischknecht, R., Shigemoto, R., Schulze, H., Enz, R.

The objectives of this research works were to estimate the prevalence and determinants of intestinal parasitic infection among family members of known intestinal parasite infected patients. Methods and materials A comparative cross-sectional study design was implemented in the urban and rural settings of Mecha district. The data were collected from August 2017toMarch 2019 from intestinal parasite infected patient household members. Epi-info software was used to calculate the sample size, 4531 household members were estimated to be included. Data were collected using interview technique, and collecting stool samples from each household contact of intestinal parasite patients. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the prevalence of intestinal parasites among known contacts of intestinal parasite patients/family members. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the determinant factors of intestinal parasitic infection among family members. Results The prevalence of intestinal parasite among household contacts of intestinal parasite-infected family members was 86.14% [95% CI: 86.14% - 87.15%]. Hookworm infection was the predominant type of infection (18.8%). Intestinal parasitic infection was associated with sex, environmental sanitation, overcrowding, personal hygiene, residence, substandard house, role in the household, source of light for the house, trimmed fingernails, family size, regular handwashing practice. Protozoa infection was associated with habit of ingesting raw vegetable, playing with domestic animals, water source and the presence of household water filtering materials. Conclusion High prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection was observed among household contacts of primary cases."
https://openalex.org/W2978388498,"Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (CADs) participate in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation; abnormal fatty acid oxidation is associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders. We decipher the impact of short-chain CAD (SCAD) on adiposity and insulin resistance. BALB/cBy strain mice derived from BALB/c strain are deficient in SCAD activity because of a spontaneous deletion in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (Acads) gene. Adiposity, lipogenesis, and insulin sensitivity were compared in BALB/c and BALB/cBy mice subjected to high-fat diets (HFDs). A whole hepatic transcriptome profiling experiment with microarrays was performed to evaluate the mechanisms by which SCAD deficiency protects against insulin resistance. Acads-deficient mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance as compared with control mice. Reduced obesity results from decreased triglyceride content due to activation of AMPK in liver that would reduce hepatic content of malonyl-CoA, resulting in decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Improved insulin sensitivity was associated with reduced diacylglycerol content commensurate with reduced PKC-ε activity and increased protein kinase B (AKT) activation in liver and skeletal muscle. Additionally, Acads-deficient mice displayed significantly higher expression of the endoplasmic chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, which was further associated with the AKT activation in the primary hepatocytes. Modulation of SCAD expression may therefore be a novel therapeutic approach to manage and prevent obesity and related metabolic diseases, such as diabetes.-Chen, Y., Chen, J., Zhang, C., Yang, S., Zhang, X., Liu, Y., Su, Z.

For example, eRNAs were shown to enhance enhancer-promoter looping formation (28Li W. Notani D. Ma Q. Tanasa B. Nunez E. Chen A.Y. Merkurjev D. Zhang J. Ohgi K. Song X. Oh S. Kim H.S. Glass C.K.

Therefore, how PU.1 regulates enhancers and how eRNAs participate in gene regulation remain to be determined. One of the key characteristics of myeloid cells such as macrophages is rapid and robust production of inflammatory cytokines in response to microbial stimulation. Enhancers and promoters of these genes are in poised status, harboring active histone marks and transcriptional machinery that is waiting to be activated immediately by extracellular signals (31Kaikkonen M.U.

Among those cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β (derived from the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β gene product) is a potent inflammatory cytokine that is rapidly induced by activated Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR4, activated by the Gram-negative bacterial component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). PU.1 is crucial for priming enhancers and robust pro-IL-1β (herein referred to as IL-1β) transcription in macrophages (33Marecki S. Riendeau C.J. Liang M.D. Fenton M.J.

In human macrophages, PU.1 is crucial for establishing poised promoter architecture and, particularly, looping between the promoter and a remote enhancer located about −3,000 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) of IL-1β gene (36Yang Z.

Although both promoter and enhancer elements are expected to be similar in mice, the distal regulatory elements and mechanism of PU.1 in regulating IL-1β transcription in mice are less well-understood. To examine the detailed mechanisms of PU.1 in programming IL-1β transcription, we used the murine melanocyte cell line B16BL6 (B16). Melanocytes, best known for their role in skin and hair pigmentation, are differentiated from melanoblasts that are originated from pluripotent neural-crest cells (38Lin J.Y. Fisher D.E. Melanocyte biology and skin pigmentation.Nature. 2007; 445 (17314970): 843-85010.1038/nature05660Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). These cells express various innate immune receptors, such as TLRs, and exhibit similar phagocytic, antigen-presenting, and inflammatory response capabilities with macrophages (39Gasque P. Jaffar-Bandjee M.C. The immunology and inflammatory responses of human melanocytes in infectious diseases.J.

Unlike melanocytes, we found that B16 cells lacked PU.1 and failed to produce IL-1β mRNA by TLR stimulation. However, ectopic expression of PU.1 led these cells to express IL-1β. We identified a novel enhancer located ∼10 kbp from the IL-1β TSS. Binding of PU.1 in the enhancer induced nucleosome depletion, enhancer-promoter looping, and H3K27ac. The PU.1-dependent enhancer-promoter looping and H3K27ac were independently required for subsequent signal-dependent and co-dependent events: NF-κB recruitment and further H3K27ac, both of which were required for the eRNA and subsequent IL-1β mRNA transcription. Human melanocytes and melanoma cells were shown to express TLRs, and activation of these receptors induces expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β (40Mattei S. Colombo M.P. Melani C. Silvani A. Parmiani G. Herlyn M. Expression of cytokine/growth factors and their receptors in human melanoma and melanocytes.Int. J.

Unexpectedly, B16 mouse melanoma cells failed to express IL-1β mRNA in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), LPS, and CpG dinucleotides, which are TLR2, -3, -4, and -9 ligands, respectively (Fig. 1A). However, these cells activated ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-κB in response to LPS (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these cells are defective in processing signaling downstream to these pathways. Lineage-determining (pioneering) transcription factors, such as C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, PU.1, and Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), play key roles in programming myeloid cells for their characteristics in expressing cytokines (42Medzhitov R. Horng T. Transcriptional control of the inflammatory response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9 (19859064): 692-70310.1038/nri2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined expression of these transcription factors in these cells. Based on RT-qPCR analysis, these cells constitutively expressed C/EBPβ and RUNX1, but not C/EBPα and PU.1 (Fig. S1). Consistent with these results, Western blotting also failed to detect PU.1 and C/EBPα proteins in these cells (Fig. 1C). However, in B16 cells transfected with C/EBPα and PU.1, robust transcription of IL-1β mRNA was detected in response to TLR2, -4, and -9 ligands (Fig. 1A) without affecting the levels of ERK, p38, and NF-κB activation (Fig. 1B). Because C/EBPα, together with PU.1, was shown to be involved in establishing monocyte-specific enhancers (43Jin F. Li Y. Ren B. Natarajan R. PU.1 and C/EBPα synergistically program distinct response to NF-κB activation through establishing monocyte specific enhancers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Unexpectedly, PU.1 alone promoted IL-1β mRNA expression to the same extent as detected in cells expressing both PU.1 and C/EBPα (Fig. 1D). Ectopic expression of PU.1 was also shown to induce macrophage colony–stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) expression, which is involved in reprogramming nonmyeloid lineage cells into macrophage-like cells (11Laiosa C.V.

As expected, ectopic expression of PU.1 together with or without C/EBPα induced expression of M-CSFR mRNA at low levels (Fig. 1E, left). In cells transfected with PU.1 + C/EBPα, M-CSF induced low levels of IL-1β mRNA expression at basal state; however, the extent of IL-1β mRNA induction by LPS was not affected by M-CSF treatment (Fig. 1E, right). These data suggest that PU.1 programs B16 cells to express IL-1β mRNA in response to TLR activation through a mechanism independent of M-CSF. PU.1 was shown to remodel promoters and, particularly, distal regulatory elements of cell-specific and signal-dependent genes (8Heinz S. Benner C. Spann N. Bertolino E. Lin Y.C. Laslo P. Cheng J.X.

These regions (hereafter referred to as E1 for the enhancer located ∼2 kbp upstream and E2 for ∼10 kbp upstream of IL-1β TSS) were also very high in H3K4me1, but low in histone H3 Lys-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), signals (top two panels). Particularly, these H3K27ac signals were unique to macrophages and not found in other nonmyeloid cell types (bottom panel). Within and proximal to these regions, five putative PU.1-binding sites (GGAAGTG (45Pham T.H. Minderjahn J. Schmidl C. Hoffmeister H. Schmidhofer S. Chen W. Längst G. Benner C. Rehli M.

PU.1 was also shown to recruit the histone acetyltransferases cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and the related p300 to specific genomic regions (46Janknecht R. Hunter T.

https://openalex.org/W2977670155,"Abstract T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with a dismal prognosis in patients with resistant or relapsed disease. Although NOTCH is a known driver in T-ALL, its clinical inhibition has significant limitations. Our previous studies suggested that NRARP, a negative regulator of Notch signaling, could have a suppressive role in T-ALL. Here, we report that NRARP levels are significantly increased in primary T-ALL cells suggesting that NRARP is not sufficient to block NOTCH oncogenic signals. Interestingly, although NRARP overexpression blocks NOTCH1 signaling and delays the proliferation of T-ALL cells that display high levels of Notch1 signaling, it promotes the expansion of T-ALL cells with lower levels of Notch1 activity. We found that NRARP interacts with lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and potentiates Wnt signaling in T-ALL cells with low levels of Notch. Together these results indicate that NRARP plays a dual role in T-ALL pathogenesis, regulating both Notch and Wnt pathways, with opposite functional effects depending on Notch activity. Consistent with this hypothesis, mice transplanted with T-cells co-expressing NOTCH1 and NRARP develop leukemia later than mice transplanted with T-NOTCH1 cells. Importantly, mice transplanted with T-cells overexpressing NRARP alone developed leukemia with similar kinetics to those transplanted with T-NOTCH1 cells. Our findings uncover a role for NRARP in T-ALL pathogenesis and indicate that Notch inhibition may be detrimental for patients with low levels of Notch signaling, which would likely benefit from the use of Wnt signaling inhibitors. Importantly, our findings may extend to other cancers where Notch and Wnt play a role."
https://openalex.org/W2979588334,"Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the gamma (30–80 Hz) range is related to a variety of sensory and cognitive processes which are frequently impaired in schizophrenia. Auditory steady-state response at 40-Hz (40-Hz ASSR) is utilized as an index of gamma activity and is proposed as a biomarker of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, the link between ASSRs and cognitive functions is not clear. This study explores a possible relationship between the performance on cognitive tasks and the 40-Hz ASSRs in a controlled uniform sample of young healthy males, as age and sex may have complex influence on ASSRs. Twenty-eight young healthy male volunteers participated (mean age ± SD 25.8±3.3) in the study. The 40-Hz click trains (500 ms) were presented 150 times with an inter-stimulus interval set at 700–1000 ms. The phase-locking index (PLI) and event-related power perturbation (ERSP) of the ASSR were calculated in the 200–500 ms latency range, which corresponds to the steady part of the response. The Psychology Experiment Building Language (PEBL) task battery was used to assess five cognitive subdomains: the Choice response time task, the Stroop test, the Tower of London test, the Lexical decision task and the Semantic categorisation task. Pearson‘s correlation coefficients were calculated to access the relationships; no multiple-test correction was applied as the tests were explorative in nature. A significant positive correlation was observed for the late-latency gamma and the mean number of steps in the Tower of London task reflecting planning and problem-solving abilities. These findings support the concept that 40-Hz ASSR might highlight top-down mechanisms which are related to cognitive functioning. Therefore, 40-Hz ASSRs can be used to explore the relationship between cognitive functioning and neurophysiological indices of brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W2977505253,"When we perform a movement we generally have a clear distinction between which parts of the world constitute our body and which parts do not. However, how the sense of ownership over our body supports movement is not yet fully understood. We aimed to see whether a sense of ownership over the hand supports the performance of rapid hand movements. In three experiments (n = 48, n = 30, n = 24), we presented participants with congruent and incongruent visuotactile and visuoproprioceptive information regarding their own hand. In keeping with previous experiments, multisensory disintegration resulted in a reduction in the subjective sensation of ownership over the hand, as reflected in questionnaire responses. Following sensory stimulation, participants were required to rapidly abduct their index finger whilst the movement was tracked. We examined the hypothesis that, should a sense of ownership over the limb be necessary for generating rapid movements with that limb, reaction time would increase when hand ownership was reduced, whilst the acceleration and velocity of the movement would decrease. We observed that reductions in own hand ownership did not interfere with rapid index finger abduction, suggesting that the motor system may not be reliant on a subjective sense of ownership over the body in order to generate movement."
https://openalex.org/W2977277001,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease that can infect deer, elk and moose. CWD has now been detected in 26 states of the USA, 3 Canadian provinces, South Korea, Norway, Sweden and Finland. CWD continues to spread from endemic areas, and new foci of infections are frequently detected. As increasing numbers of cervids become infected, the likelihood for human exposure increases. To date, no cases of CWD infection in humans have been confirmed, but experience with the BSE zoonosis in the United Kingdom suggests exposure to CWD should be minimized. Specifically, hunters, meat processors and others in contact with tissues from potentially CWD-infected cervids need a practical method to decontaminate knives, saws and other equipment. Prions are notoriously difficult to inactivate, and most effective methods require chemicals or sterilization processes that are either dangerous, caustic, expensive or not readily available. Although corrosive, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is widely available and affordable and has been shown to inactivate prion agents including those that cause scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In the current study, we confirm that bleach is an effective disinfectant for CWD prions and establish minimum times and bleach concentrations to eliminate prion seeding activity from stainless steel and infected brain homogenate solutions. We found that a five-minute treatment with a 40% dilution of household bleach was effective at inactivating CWD seeding activity from stainless-steel wires and CWD-infected brain homogenates. However, bleach was not able to inactivate CWD seeding activity from solid tissues in our studies."
https://openalex.org/W2977641897,"The vascular endothelium acts as a selective barrier between the bloodstream and extravascular tissues. Intracellular [Ca2+]i signaling is essential for vasoactive agonist-induced stimulation of endothelial cells (ECs), typically including Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it is known that interactions of Ca2+ and cAMP as ubiquitous messengers are involved in this process, the individual contribution of cAMP-generating adenylyl cyclases (ACs), including the only soluble AC (sAC; ADCY10), remains less clear. Using life-cell microscopy and plate reader-based [Ca2+]i measurements, we found that human immortalized ECs, primary aortic and cardiac microvascular ECs, and primary vascular smooth muscle cells treated with sAC-specific inhibitor KH7 or anti-sAC-small interfering RNA did not show endogenous or exogenous ATP-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. Of note, a transmembrane AC (tmAC) inhibitor did not prevent ATP-induced [Ca2+]i elevation in ECs. Moreover, l-phenylephrine-dependent constriction of ex vivo mouse aortic ring segments was also reduced by KH7. Analysis of the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) pathway revealed reduced IP3 receptor phosphorylation after KH7 application, which also prevented [Ca2+]i elevation induced by IP3 receptor agonist adenophostin A. Our results suggest that sAC rather than tmAC controls the agonist-induced ER-dependent Ca2+ response in ECs and may represent a treatment target in arterial hypertension and heart failure.-Mewes, M., Lenders, M., Stappers, F., Scharnetzki, D., Nedele, J., Fels, J., Wedlich-Söldner, R., Brand, S.-M., Schmitz, B., Brand, E.

https://openalex.org/W2979882851,"The partograph has been endorsed by World Health Organization (WHO) since 1994 which presents an algorithm for assessing maternal and foetal conditions and labor progression. Monitoring labour with a partograph can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes such as prolonged labor, emergency C-sections, birth asphyxia and stillbirths. However, partograph use is still very low, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs). In Bangladesh the reported partograph user rate varies from 1.4% to 33.0%. Recently, an electronic version of the partograph, with the provision of online data entry and user aid for emergency clinical support, has been tested successfully in different settings. With this proven evidence, we conducted and operations research to test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an e-partograph, for the first time, in 2 public hospitals in Bangladesh.We followed a prospective crossover design. Two secondary level referral hospitals, Jessore and Kushtia District Hospital (DH) were the study sites. All pregnant women who delivered in the study hospitals were the study participants. All nurse-midwives working in the labor ward of study hospitals were trained on appropriate use of both types of partograph along with standard labour management guidelines. Collected quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS 23 statistical software. Discrete variables were expressed as percentages and presented as frequency distribution and cross tabulations. Chi square tests were employed to test the association between exposure and outcome variables. Potential confounding factors were adjusted using multivariate binary logistic regression methods. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b).In total 2918 deliveries were conducted at Jessore DH and 2312 at Kushtia DH during one-year study period. Of them, 1012 (506 in each facility) deliveries were monitored using partograph (paper or electronic). The trends of facility based C-section rates was downwards in both the hospitals; 43% to 37% in Jessore and from 36% to 25% in Kushtia Hospital. There was a significant reduction of prolonged labour with e-partograph use. In Kushtia DH, the prolonged labour rate was 42% during phase 1 with the paper version which came down to 29% during phase-2 with the e-partograph use. The similar result was observed in Jessore DH where the prolonged labour rate reduced to 7% with paper partograph from the reported 30% prolonged labour with e-partograph. The e-partograph user rate was higher than the paper partograph during both phases (phase 1: 3.31, CI: 2.04-5.38, p < .001 and in phase 2: 15.20 CI: 6.36-36.33, p < .001) after adjusting for maternal age, parity, gestational age, religion, mother's education, husband's education, and fetal sex.The partograph user rate has significantly improved with the e- partograph and was associated with an overall reduction in cesarean births. Use of the e-partograph was also associated with reduced rates of prolonged labour. This study has added to the growing body of evidence on the positive impact of e-partograph use. We recommend implementing e-partograph intervention at scale in both public and private hospitals in Bangladesh.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03509103."
https://openalex.org/W2979944376,"The purpose of this study was to measure central macular thickness in an unprecedented number of cynomolgus monkeys. Macular thickness was measured with Heidelberg spectral-domain OCT in 320 eyes of healthy and treatment-naïve cynomolgus monkeys (80 males and 80 females). The macula was successfully measured in all 320 eyes. Macular thickness was not significantly different between the sexes. The mean central macular thickness was 244 μm (+/- 21 μm). Macular thicknesses in the quadrants were 327 +/-17 μm (temporal inner), 339 +/- 17 μm (inferior inner), 341 +/- 14 μm (superior inner), 341 +/-18 μm (nasal inner), and 299 +/- 20 μm (temporal outer), 320 +/- 16 μm (superior outer), 332 +/-23 μm (inferior outer), and 337 +/-18 μm (nasal outer). Highly significant differences between the nasal and temporal quadrants were detected. This study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of retinal thickness measurements in healthy cynomolgus monkeys. The present findings indicate that the macula is thicker in cynomolgus monkeys than in humans and provide important normative data for future studies."

However, as it is linked to an increased infection risk, appropriate vaccination is required. The study aimed at investigating the vaccination status of patients receiving Anti-TNF therapy and physicians' perceptions of and views about vaccinating these patients.A sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach was used. The study comprised a quantitative, retrospective drug utilization review for determining institutional consumption of Anti-TNF therapy and an assessment of vaccination status in patients prescribed Anti-TNF therapy to audit physicians' adherence to Anti-TNF therapy-related vaccination recommendations. Patient data from electronic medical records (EMRs) obtained from tertiary care hospitals between September 2015 and September 2017 were used. Further, a qualitative study using a phenomenographic approach with semi-structured interviews of 12 physicians was carried out to explore the physicians' perceptions, views, and recommendations of vaccinating patients who are undergoing Anti-TNF therapy and identifying factors that may cause poor adherence to vaccination recommendations.Forty-three of 310 patients receiving Anti-TNF therapy were vaccinated. Infliximab was the most frequently prescribed agent, accounting for 96.7% of total orders. Eight of the 12 physicians stated that they were aware of vaccination guidelines and seven viewed pre-Anti-TNF therapy vaccination as essential because of the high infection risk and claimed to incorporate it in their daily practice. Barriers to adherence included ignorance of recommendations, workload, vaccine unavailability, and advanced disease state.Although the recommendations published by professional medical societies emphasized the importance of vaccination before initiating Anti-TNF therapy, few patients were vaccinated. Medical administration in hospitals should develop policies, procedures, and guidelines for vaccination; implement education programs for physicians and patients and procure vaccines in a timely way to improve their use."
https://openalex.org/W2977910016,"The tick- and transfusion-transmitted human pathogen Babesia microti infects host erythrocytes to cause the pathologic symptoms associated with human babesiosis, an emerging disease with worldwide distribution and potentially fatal clinical outcome. Drugs currently recommended for the treatment of babesiosis are associated with a high failure rate and significant adverse events, highlighting the urgent need for more-effective and safer babesiosis therapies. Unlike other apicomplexan parasites, B. microti lacks a canonical lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but instead expresses a unique enzyme, B. microti LDH (BmLDH), acquired through evolution by horizontal transfer from a mammalian host. Here, we report the crystal structures of BmLDH in apo state and ternary complex (enzyme-NADH-oxamate) solved at 2.79 and 1.89 Å. Analysis of these structures reveals that upon binding to the coenzyme and substrate, the active pocket of BmLDH undergoes a major conformational change from an opened and disordered to a closed and stabilized state. Biochemical assays using wild-type and mutant B. microti and human LDHs identified Arg99 as a critical residue for the catalytic activity of BmLDH but not its human counterpart. Interestingly, mutation of Arg99 to Ala had no impact on the overall structure and affinity of BmLDH to NADH but dramatically altered the closure of the enzyme's active pocket. Together, these structural and biochemical data highlight significant differences between B. microti and human LDH enzymes and suggest that BmLDH could be a suitable target for the development of selective antibabesial inhibitors.-Yu, L., Shen, Z., Liu, Q., Zhan, X., Luo, X., An, X., Sun, Y., Li, M., Wang, S., Nie, Z., Ao, Y., Zhao, Y., Peng, G., Ben Mamoun, C., He, L., Zhao, J.

https://openalex.org/W2979250812,"Folates are vital cofactors for the regeneration of S‐adenosyl methionine, which is the methyl source for DNA methylation, protein methylation, and other aspects of one‐carbon (C1) metabolism. Thus, folates are critical for establishing and preserving epigenetic programming. Folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) is known to play a crucial role in the maintenance of intracellular folate levels. Therefore, any modulation in FPGS is expected to alter DNA methylation and numerous other metabolic pathways. To explore the role of polyglutamylation of folate, we eliminated both isoforms of FPGS in human cells (293T), producing FPGS knockout (FPGS ko ) cells. The elimination of FPGS significantly decreased cell proliferation, with a major effect on oxidative phosphorylation and a lesser effect on glycolysis. We found a substantial reduction in global DNA methylation and noteworthy changes in gene expression related to C1 metabolism, cell division, DNA methylation, pluripotency, Glu metabolism, neurogenesis, and cardiogenesis. The expression levels of NANOG , octamer‐binding transcription factor 4, and sex‐determining region Y‐box 2 levels were increased in the mutant, consistent with the transition to a stem cell‐like state. Gene expression and metabolite data also indicate a major change in Glu and GABA metabolism. In the appropriate medium, FPGS ko cells can differentiate to produce mainly cells with characteristics of either neural stem cells or cardiomyocytes.—Srivastava, A. C., Thompson, Y.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of current tobacco use and identify associated factors among Rwandans aged 15-34 years.This study involved secondary analysis of existing data from the nationally representative WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance of non-communicable diseases (STEPS) conducted in 2013 to explore the prevalence of tobacco use and its associated factors in Rwanda. Data of 3,900 youth participants (15-34 years old) who had been selected using multistage cluster sampling during the survey was analyzed. The prevalence of current smoking along with socio-demographic characteristics of the sample were determined and multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify independent factors associated with current tobacco use.The prevalence (weighted) of current tobacco use (all forms) was 8% (95%CI: 7.08-9.01). The prevalence was found to be significantly higher among males, young adults aged 24-34, youth with primary school education or less, those from Southern province, people with income (work in public, private organizations and self-employed) and young married adults. However, geographical location i.e. urban (7%) and rural (8%) settings did not affect prevalence of tobacco use. Factors that were found to be associated with current tobacco use through the multivariate analysis included being male, aged 25 years and above, having an income, and residing in Eastern, Kigali City and Southern Province compared to Western province.The association between smoking and socio-demographic characteristics among Rwandan youth identified in this study provides an opportunity for policy makers to tailor future tobacco control policies, and implement coordinated, high-impact interventions to prevent initiation of tobacco use among the youth."
https://openalex.org/W2977939914,"Insect damage on trees can severely affect the quality of timber, reduce the fecundity of the host and render it susceptible to fungal infestation and disease. Such pathology weakens or eventually kills the host. Infestation by two insect woodborer species (a moth and a beetle) is causing mortality of Sonneratia alba, a wide-ranging pioneer mangrove species of the Indo-Pacific. Establishing the infestation mechanism of the two insect woodborer species is an initial and essential step towards understanding their ecological role in the mangroves and in determining sustainable management priorities and options. Our main objectives were to investigate the infestation mechanism employed by the two insect woodborers which infest S. alba trees, to establish the occurrence of secondary infestation by endophytic fungi in the infested S. alba branches, and to explore a control management option to the woodborer infestation. We conducted an external inspection of infested branches in two large embayments in Kenya, Gazi Bay and Mida Creek, and by splitting infested branches we determined the respective internal infestation mechanisms. Infested wood samples from Gazi Bay and Mida Creek were incubated at 28±1°C for 3–5 days to establish the presence of fungi. A survey was conducted in both Gazi Bay and Mida Creek to ascertain the presence of ants on S. alba. The infestation characteristics of the two insect woodborer species were different. It took 6–8 months for the beetle to kill a branch of 150 cm—200 cm long. For the moth to kill a branch, it depended upon several factors including the contribution by multiple species, other than the moth infestation alone. A total of 15 endophytic fungal species were identified. Two ant species Oecophylla longipoda and a Pheidole sp. inhabited 62% and 69% respectively of sampled S. alba trees in Gazi Bay whereas only Pheidole sp. inhabited 17% of the sampled S. alba trees in Mida Creek. In summary, we have documented the time it takes each woodborer species to kill a branch, the infestation mechanism of the two insect woodborers, and we hypothesized on the role of two ant species. The presence of several different fungal species was ascertained, and we discussed their possible role in the infested wood. Our results cannot unambiguously associate the woodborers and identified fungi. We recommend further studies to investigate the presence or absence, and if present, the nature of fungi in the gut of the woodborers."

https://openalex.org/W2978090457,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by the expansion of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney, which impair the function of kidney and eventually leads to end-stage renal failure. It has been previously demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of prothymosin α (ProT) induces the development of PKD; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used a mouse PKD model that sustains kidney-specific low-expression of Pkd1 to illustrate that aberrant up-regulation of ProT occurs in cyst-lining epithelial cells, and we further developed an in vitro cystogenesis model to demonstrate that the suppression of ProT is sufficient to reduce cyst formation. Next, we found that the expression of ProT was accompanied with prominent augmentation of protein acetylation in PKD, which results in the activation of downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. The pathologic role of STAT3 in PKD has been previously reported. We determined that this molecular mechanism of protein acetylation is involved with the interaction between ProT and STAT3; consequently, it causes the deprivation of histone deacetylase 3 from the indicated protein. Conclusively, these results elucidate the significant role of ProT, including protein acetylation and STAT3 activation in PKD, which represent potential for ameliorating the disease progression of PKD.-Chen, Y.-C., Su, Y.-C., Shieh, G.-S., Su, B.-H., Su, W.-C., Huang, P.-H., Jiang, S.-T., Shiau, A.-L., Wu, C.-L.
