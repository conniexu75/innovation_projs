https://openalex.org/W2073060641,"The sorptive properties of natural estuarine colloids were investigated, with the herbicides atrazine and linuron used as model pollutants. Linear Freundlich adsorption constants for atrazine and linuron were 1850 and 6750, respectively. These high values indicate that natural colloids have the potential to be important substrates in the transport of hydrophobic contaminants in aquatic environments."
https://openalex.org/W4236358778,"Flowage differentiation is an experimentally demonstrable process capable of causing crystal and chemical fractionation in nature. It is a mechanism for forming olivine-rich rocks in a vertical or steeply dipping position without prior concentration on a flat floor. It explains the field observation that the chilled margin of a mafic intrusion may not be a representative sample of the average composition of the parent magma. In contrast to previous hypotheses of origin for composite dikes, it causes fractionation during and as a result of a single movement of magma rather than by multiple injections."
https://openalex.org/W2081952670,"The shell of the free-swimming veliger larval stage of the common North American oyster Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791) is composed of aragonite. This composition contrasts with that of the adult shell, which is composed mainly of calcite, the rhombohedral allomorph of calcium carbonate, and minor amounts of aragonite."

https://openalex.org/W2054210988,"The Western Boundary Undercurrent is a high-velocity, contour-following bottom current that flows southwesterly on the U.S. Atlantic continental margin. A high-velocity core of the Western Boundary Undercurrent is delineated by an analysis of underlying sediments, which are characterized by coarse particle sizes and efficiently aligned magnetic grains in a zone from 4440 meters at the base of the rise to 5200 meters on the adjacent abyssal plain."

https://openalex.org/W2079232507,"Hermit crabs explore empty gastropod shells by touching, rolling, and probing them before choosing one for a home. This component of shell selection behavior was examined in Pagurus hirsutiusculus hirsutiusculus (Dana) with binary choice tests between natural shells and accurate replicas of the shells with different chemical compositions. The results show that calcium emanating from the surface of shells is responsible for the behavior. Sensitivity to calcium may be a factor that enables the hermit crab to locate partially buried shells and discriminate empty shells from ones housing living gastropods or from small pebbles."

https://openalex.org/W2003538178,"In the nearly 30 years of my acquaintance with La Jolla Bay, near San Diego, California, I have seen many changes in the colors of its waters Some of those changes have occurred from hour to hour, from day to day and from season to season. Those observed most commonly and frequently have resulted from physical and chemical causes or from various combinations of those categories of causes. For example, a calm sea not only differs in color from a rough sea but the differences change according to the position of the observer, the time of day, and the inclusions in the masses of water. Now and then, but rather rarely, a peculiar coloration (or discoloration) ranging from faint light brown to deep red has been seen. In La Jolla Bay the causes of the conspicuous occurrences of these particular colors have been dinoflagellates, Prorocentrum micans Ehr. if before mid-summer Gonyaulax polyedra Stein if after mid-summer. Both of these kinds of microscopic plants are so small that two or three hundred can be enclosed in a drop of water without crowding, but when their numbers reach millions"

https://openalex.org/W2060768856,"Laboratory experiments suggest that a convective regime characterized by two length scales of motion is a reasonable model for circulations in the earth's upper mantle. The flows of largest horizontal scale represent a likely plate-driving mechanism, required by some theories of plate tectonics. It is also suggested that the small-scale circulations could influence the chemical evolution of the mantle by extracting primitive mantle material that is otherwise entrained in the large-scale flow."

https://openalex.org/W2000388557,Dechlorination of some organic chloramines with aqueous sulfite solutions does not take place instantaneously as previously assumed. Field dechlorination times on the order of hours for some compounds that are found in chlorinated effluents appear likely on the basis of laboratory studies. These chlorinated compounds are not detected by standard analytical methods in the presence of sulfite ion.

Polyphenoloxidase promotes the conversion, but studies with heat-inactivated tissue indicate that the reaction can proceed without enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1970385682,The suitability of soils for the disposal of radioactive strontium waste products is determined in part by the amount and properties of calcium carbonate in the soil. Analyses of the strontium ion concentrations in the effluent solution of soil columns and x-ray diffraction patterns suggest that a fraction of the strontium ions is precipitated as strontium carbonate.
