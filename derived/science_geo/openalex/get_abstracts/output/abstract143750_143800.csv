https://openalex.org/W1600814660,"Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species."

https://openalex.org/W2061824022,"We adapted the technique of intrinsic signal imaging to visualize how odorant concentration and structure are represented spatially in the rat olfactory bulb. Most odorants activated one or more glomeruli in the imaged region of the bulb; these optically imaged responses reflected the excitation of underlying neurons. Odorant-evoked patterns were similar across animals and symmetrical in the two bulbs of the same animal. The variable sensitivity of individual glomeruli produced distinct maps for different odorant concentrations. Using a series of homologous aldehydes, we found that glomeruli were tuned to detect particular molecular features and that maps of similar molecules were highly correlated. These characteristics suggest that odorants and their concentrations can be encoded by distinct spatial patterns of glomerular activation."

https://openalex.org/W2132319307,"Neuroimaging studies have revealed an association between word generation and activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) that is attentuated with item repetition. The experiment reported here examined the effects of repeated word generation, under conditions in which completion was either decreased or increased, on activity measured during whole-brain echoplanar functional magnetic resonance imaging. Activity in left IFG decreased during repetition conditions that reduced competition but increased during repetition conditions that increased competition; this pattern was contrasted to repetition effects observed in other cortical areas, specifically regions of left temporal cortex. The increase in left IFG activity, which is not predicted by a simple semantic retrieval account of prefrontal function, is consistent with the hypothesis that left IFG subserves the selection of semantic knowledge among competing alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W1611957532,"Although cell migration is crucial for neural development, molecular mechanisms guiding neuronal migration have remained unclear. Here we report that the secreted protein Slit repels neuronal precursors migrating from the anterior subventricular zone in the telencephalon to the olfactory bulb. Our results provide a direct demonstration of a molecular cue whose concentration gradient guides the direction of migrating neurons. They also support a common guidance mechanism for axon projection and neuronal migration and suggest that Slit may provide a molecular tool with potential therapeutic applications in controlling and directing cell migration."

https://openalex.org/W2096369647,"Formation of the normal mammalian cerebral cortex requires the migration of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons from an extracortical origin, the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). Mechanisms guiding the migratory direction of these neurons, or other neurons in the neocortex, are not well understood. We have used an explant assay to study GABAergic neuronal migration and found that the ventricular zone (VZ) of the LGE is repulsive to GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, the secreted protein Slit is a chemorepellent guiding the migratory direction of GABAergic neurons, and blockade of endogenous Slit signaling inhibits the repulsive activity in the VZ. These results have revealed a cellular source of guidance for GABAergic neurons, demonstrated a molecular cue important for cortical development, and suggested a guidance mechanism for the migration of extracortical neurons into the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2037515617,"The vertebrate olfactory system utilizes odorant receptors to receive and discriminate thousands of different chemical stimuli. An understanding of how these receptors encode information about an odorant's molecular structure requires a characterization of their ligand specificities. We employed an expression cloning strategy to identify a goldfish odorant receptor that is activated by amino acids-potent odorants for fish. Structure-activity analysis indicates that the receptor is preferentially tuned to recognize basic amino acids. The receptor is a member of a multigene family of G protein-coupled receptors, sharing sequence similarities with the calcium sensing, metabotropic glutamate, and V2R class of vomeronasal receptors. The ligand tuning properties of the goldfish amino acid odorant receptor provide information for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying olfactory coding."
https://openalex.org/W2059877177,"Glial progenitors colonize the CNS widely in the perinatal period, but the pathways and mechanisms of migration are not well understood. We investigated the migration of progenitors from the neonatal rat forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) by labeling them in vivo with a retrovirus encoding green fluorescent protein and visualizing movements by time lapse microscopy in slices. Cells within the dorsolateral SVZ moved in an undirected fashion but migrated radially and tangentially after emigration into white matter, cortex, and striatum. Cells in the striatal SVZ migrated parallel to the ventricular surface. During migration, elongation of the leading process and nuclear translocation were independent or linked. Orthogonal turning involved either cessation of cell body movement and formation of a new leading process or continuous cell body movement and bending of the leading process."
https://openalex.org/W2054806352,"To determine the function of VGF, a secreted polypeptide that is synthesized by neurons, is abundant in the hypothalamus, and is regulated in the brain by electrical activity, injury, and the circadian clock, we generated knockout mice lacking Vgf. Homozygous mutants are small, hypermetabolic, hyperactive, and infertile, with markedly reduced leptin levels and fat stores and altered hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and agouti-related peptide (AGRP) expression. Furthermore, VGF mRNA synthesis is induced in the hypothalamic arcuate nuclei of fasted normal mice. VGF therefore plays a critical role in the regulation of energy homeostasis, suggesting that the study of lean VGF mutant mice may provide insight into wasting disorders and, moreover, that pharmacological antagonism of VGF action(s) might constitute the basis for treatment of obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2010619824,"At the end of each molt, insects shed the old cuticle by performing preecdysis and ecdysis behaviors. Regulation of these centrally patterned movements involves peptide signaling between endocrine Inka cells and the CNS. In Inka cells, we have identified the cDNA and gene encoding preecdysis-triggering hormone (PETH) and ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH), which activate these behaviors. Prior to behavioral onset, rising ecdysteroid levels induce expression of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ETH gene in Inka cells and evoke CNS sensitivity to PETH and ETH. Subsequent ecdysteroid decline is required for peptide release, which initiates three motor patterns in specific order: PETH triggers preecdysis I, while ETH activates preecdysis II and ecdysis. The Inka cell provides a model for linking steroid regulation of peptide hormone expression and release with activation of a defined behavioral sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1987159148,We show that neurons that underlie rhythmic patterns of electrical output may be identified by optical imaging and frequency-domain analysis. Our contrast agent is a two-component dye system in which changes in membrane potential modulate the relative emission between a pair of fluorophores. We demonstrate our methods with the circuit responsible for fictive swimming in the isolated leech nerve cord. The output of a motor neuron provides a reference signal for the phase-sensitive detection of changes in fluorescence from individual neurons in a ganglion. We identify known and possibly novel neurons that participate in the swim rhythm and determine their phases within a cycle. A variant of this approach is used to identify the postsynaptic followers of intracellularly stimulated neurons.

https://openalex.org/W1964403443,"Rod-specific photoreceptor dystrophies are complicated by the delayed death of genetically normal neighboring cones. In transgenic (Tg) swine with a rod-specific (rhodopsin) gene mutation, cone photoreceptor physiology was normal for months but later declined, consistent with delayed cone cell death. Surprisingly, cone postreceptoral function was markedly abnormal when cone photoreceptor physiology was still normal. The defect was localized to hyperpolarizing cells postsynaptic to the middle wavelength-sensitive cones. Recordings throughout postnatal development indicated a failure of cone circuitry maturation, a novel mechanism of secondary cone abnormality in rod dystrophy. The results have implications for therapy for human retinal dystrophies and raise the possibility that rod afferent activity plays a role in the postnatal maturation of cone retinal circuitry."
