https://openalex.org/W1982337820,"Stem cells, which regenerate tissue by producing differentiating cells, also produce cells that renew the stem cell population. Signals from regulatory microenvironments (niches) are thought to cause stem cells to retain self-renewing potential. However, the molecular characterization of niches remains an important goal. In Drosophila testes, germ line and somatic stem cells attach to a cluster of support cells called the hub. The hub specifically expresses Unpaired, a ligand activating the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling cascade. Without JAK-STAT signaling, germ line stem cells differentiate but do not self-renew. Conversely, ectopic JAK-STAT signaling greatly expands both stem cell populations. We conclude that the support cells of the hub signal to adjacent stem cells by activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby defining a niche for stem cell self-renewal."

https://openalex.org/W2165983349,"Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a zinc finger transcription factor of unknown function. Here, we show that the KLF6 gene is mutated in a subset of human prostate cancer. Loss-of-heterozygosity analysis revealed that one KLF6 allele is deleted in 77% (17 of 22) of primary prostate tumors. Sequence analysis of the retained KLF6 allele revealed mutations in 71% of these tumors. Functional studies confirm that whereas wild-type KLF6 up-regulates p21 (WAF1/CIP1) in a p53-independent manner and significantly reduces cell proliferation, tumor-derived KLF6 mutants do not. Our data suggest that KLF6 is a tumor suppressor gene involved in human prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2073090260,"Although neuroimaging studies confirm the frontal lobe's involvement in language processes and auditory working memory1,2, the cellular and network basis of these functions is unclear. Physiological studies of the frontal lobe in non-human primates have focused on visual working memory and auditory spatial processing in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC)3,4, although the candidate PFC areas for non-spatial acoustic processing lie in the ventrolateral PFC (areas 12 and 45), which receives afferents from physiologically5,6 and anatomically7,8 defined auditory cortex. We recorded neuronal responses from ventrolateral PFC to auditory cues in awake monkeys under controlled conditions and report that the macaque ventrolateral PFC contains an auditory responsive domain in which neurons show responses to complex sounds, including animal and human vocalizations."

https://openalex.org/W2070815227,"In the primary visual cortex (V1), nearby neurons are tuned to similar stimulus features, and, depending on the manner and time scale over which neuronal signals are analyzed, the resulting redundancy may mitigate deleterious effects of response variability. We estimated information rates in the short–time scale responses of clusters of up to six simultaneously recorded nearby neurons in monkey V1. Responses were almost independent if we kept track of which neuron fired each spike but were redundant if we summed responses over the cluster. Redundancy was independent of cluster size. Summing neuronal responses to reduce variability discards potentially useful information, and the discarded information increases with cluster size."
https://openalex.org/W2021565569,"Previous global estimates of the human impact on terrestrial photosynthesis products depended heavily on extrapolation from plot-scale measurements. Here, we estimated this impact with the use of recent data, many of which were collected at global and continental scales. Monte Carlo techniques that incorporate known and estimated error in our parameters provided estimates of uncertainty. We estimate that humans appropriate 10 to 55% of terrestrial photosynthesis products. This broad range reflects uncertainty in key parameters and makes it difficult to ascertain whether we are approaching crisis levels in our use of the planet's resources. Improved estimates will require high-resolution global measures within agricultural lands and tropical forests."

https://openalex.org/W2039666046,"Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL, MIM-144250) is a common, multifactorial and heterogeneous dyslipidemia predisposing to premature coronary artery disease and characterized by elevated plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, or both. We identified a mutant mouse strain, HcB-19/Dem (HcB-19), that shares features with FCHL, including hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, elevated plasma apolipoprotein B and increased secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The hyperlipidemia results from spontaneous mutation at a locus, Hyplip1, on distal mouse chromosome 3 in a region syntenic with a 1q21-q23 FCHL locus identified in Finnish, German, Chinese and US families. We fine-mapped Hyplip1 to roughly 160 kb, constructed a BAC contig and sequenced overlapping BACs to identify 13 candidate genes. We found substantially decreased mRNA expression for thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip). Sequencing of the critical region revealed a Txnip nonsense mutation in HcB-19 that is absent in its normolipidemic parental strains. Txnip encodes a cytoplasmic protein that binds and inhibits thioredoxin, a major regulator of cellular redox state. The mutant mice have decreased CO2 production but increased ketone body synthesis, suggesting that altered redox status down-regulates the citric-acid cycle, sparing fatty acids for triglyceride and ketone body production. These results reveal a new pathway of potential clinical significance that contributes to plasma lipid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2046359764,"Bacterial surface appendages called pili and needle-like filaments are associated with protein and/or DNA transfer to recipient plant, human, or bacterial cells during pathogenesis or conjugation. Although it has long been suspected that pili function as a conduit for protein or DNA transfer, direct evidence has been lacking. The Hrp pilus of Pseudomonas syringae is assembled by the type III secretion system. We used an in situ immunogold labeling procedure to visualize the extrusion of an effector protein, AvrPto, from the tip of the Hrp pilus, providing direct evidence that a bacterial pilus can function as a conduit for protein delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2076980233,"RelA and RelB are two members of the NF-κB family that differ structurally and functionally. While RelA is regulated through its cytosolic localization by inhibitor proteins or IκB and not through transcriptional mechanisms, the regulation of RelB is poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that stimuli (TNF or LPS) lead within minutes to the nuclear translocation of RelA, but require hours to result in the nuclear translocation of RelB. The delayed nuclear translocation of RelB correlates with increases in its protein synthesis which are secondary to increases in RelB gene transcription. RelA is alone sufficient to induce RelB gene transcription and to mediate the stimuli-driven increase in RelB transcription. Cloning and characterization of the RelB 5′ untranslated gene region indicates that RelB transcription is dependent on a TATA-less promoter containing two NF-κB binding sites. One of the NF-κB sites is primarily involved in the binding of p50 while the other one in the binding and transactivation by RelA and also RelB. Lastly, it is observed that p21, a protein involved in cell cycle control and oncogenesis known to be regulated by NF-κB, is upregulated at the transcriptional level by RelB. Thus, RelB is regulated at least at the level of transcription in a RelA and RelB dependent manner and may exert an important role in p21 regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1984862011,"An increasing number of experimental chemotherapeutic agents induce apoptosis by directly triggering mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP). Here we examined MMP induced by lonidamine, arsenite, and the retinoid derivative CD437. Cells overexpressing the cytomegalovirus-encoded protein vMIA, a protein which interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocator, were strongly protected against the MMP-inducing and apoptogenic effects of lonidamine, arsenite, and CD437. In a cell-free system, lonidamine, arsenite, and CD437 induced the permeabilization of ANT proteoliposomes, yet had no effect on protein-free liposomes. The ANT-dependent membrane permeabilization was inhibited by the two ANT ligands ATP and ADP, as well as by recombinant Bcl-2 protein. Lonidamine, arsenite, and CD437, added to synthetic planar lipid bilayers containing ANT, elicited ANT channel activities with clearly distinct conductance levels of 20+/-7, 100+/-30, and 47+/-7 pS, respectively. Altering the ATP/ADP gradient built up on the inner mitochondrial membrane by inhibition of glycolysis and/or oxidative phosphorylation differentially modulated the cytocidal potential of lonidamine, arsenite, and CD437. Inhibition of F(0)F(1)ATPase without glycolysis inhibition sensitized to lonidamine-induced cell death. In contrast, only the combined inhibition of glycolysis plus F(0)F(1)ATPase sensitized to arsenite-induced cell death. No sensitization to cell death induction by CD437 was achieved by glucose depletion and/or oligomycin addition. These results indicate that ANT is a target of lonidamine, arsenite, and CD437 and unravel an unexpected heterogeneity in the mode of action of these three compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2002639317,"In mammals, DNA is methylated at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides. Properly regulated methylation is crucial for normal development1,2. Inappropriate methylation may contribute to tumorigenesis by silencing tumor-suppressor genes3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 or by activating growth-stimulating genes11,12,13. Although many genes have been identified that acquire methylation and whose expression is methylation-sensitive14,15, little is known about how DNA methylation is controlled16. We have identified a DNA sequence that regulates establishment of DNA methylation in the male germ line at Rasgrf1. In mice, the imprinted Rasgrf1 locus is methylated on the paternal allele within a differentially methylated domain (DMD) 30 kbp 5′ of the promoter. Expression is exclusively from the paternal allele in neonatal brain17. Methylation is regulated by a repeated sequence, consisting of a 41-mer repeated 40 times, found immediately 3′ of the DMD. This sequence is present in organisms in which Rasgrf1 is imprinted18. In addition, DMD methylation is required for imprinted Rasgrf1 expression. Together the DMD and repeat element constitute a binary switch that regulates imprinting at the locus."

https://openalex.org/W2080065789,"In anaerobic organisms, the decarboxylation of pyruvate, a crucial component of intermediary metabolism, is catalyzed by the metalloenzyme pyruvate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) resulting in the generation of low potential electrons and the subsequent acetylation of coenzyme A (CoA). PFOR is the only enzyme for which a stable acetyl thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)–based free radical reaction intermediate has been identified. The 1.87 Å–resolution structure of the radical form of PFOR from Desulfovibrio africanus shows that, despite currently accepted ideas, the thiazole ring of the ThDP cofactor is markedly bent, indicating a drastic reduction of its aromaticity. In addition, the bond connecting the acetyl group to ThDP is unusually long, probably of the one-electron type already described for several cation radicals but not yet found in a biological system. Taken together, our data, along with evidence from the literature, suggest that acetyl-CoA synthesis by PFOR proceeds via a condensation mechanism involving acetyl (PFOR-based) and thiyl (CoA-based) radicals."

https://openalex.org/W2322149805,"MEKs, which operate within the ERK cascade, shuttle into the nucleus, but are rapidly exported from this location, forming an apparent cytosolic distribution both before and after stimulation. Two different mechanisms have been proposed for the nuclear translocation of MEKs. One of them involves a constant and non-regulated shuttling of MEKs into the nucleus operating both before and after mitogenic stimulation. The other mechanism seems to require the activity of MEKs and is facilitated in response to mitogenic stimulation. Here we show that these two mechanisms may coexist in the same cells. We found that leptomycin B (LMB), a potent inhibitor of nuclear export, induces a nuclear accumulation of MEKs, and this was significantly facilitated by stimulation of LMB-treated cells with EGF, TPA and peroxovanadate. The EGF-stimulated, but not the LMB-induced translocation was attenuated by MEK inhibitors and by using inactive forms of MEK1. We also show that LMB slightly activates the ERK cascade, but this activity only partially induces the nuclear accumulation of MEKs in cells treated by LMB alone. Thus, MEKs translocate into the nucleus by a combination of non-regulated and stimulated processes that contribute to the nuclear translocation of MEKs either in resting cells or upon mitogenic stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2322513981,"E7 is the major transforming protein of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is implicated in the development of cervical cancer. The transforming activity of E7 has been attributed in part to its interaction with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour suppressor; however, the Rb interaction alone is not sufficient for transformation by E7. In a screen for cellular targets of HPV E7, we identified the Ski interacting protein, Skip, as a new interacting partner of E7. We show that HPV-16 E7 associates with Skip via sequences in its carboxy terminal region, and the evolutionarily conserved proline rich sequences (PRS) of the SNW domain of Skip. E7 functionally targets Skip in vivo and inhibits its transcriptional activation activity. Two transformation defective mutants of E7 were identified that failed both to bind Skip and to inhibit its transcriptional activity. These results suggest that inhibition of Skip function may contribute to cell transformation by HPV-16 E7."

https://openalex.org/W2315714745,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in the maintenance of genetic integrity. p53 possesses 3'-->5' exonuclease activity, however, the significance of this function in DNA replication process remains elusive. It was suggested that 3'-->5' exonuclease activity of p53 may provide a proofreading function for DNA polymerases. In order to better understand the significance of this activity, the purified wild-type recombinant p53 was further evaluated for substrate specificity and for contribution to the accuracy of DNA synthesis. p53-associated 3'-->5' exonuclease displays 3' terminal nucleotide excision from RNA/DNA template-primer using ribosomal RNA as a template. The data demonstrate that p53 is highly efficient in removing a terminal mispair. Analysis of mispair excision opposite the template adenine residue shows that p53 catalyzes 3' terminal mismatch excision with a specificity of A : G>A : A>A : C. Hence, the observed specificity of mismatch excision indicates that p53 exonucleolytic proofreading preferentially repairs transversion mutations. The influence of the p53 on the accuracy of DNA synthesis was determined with exonuclease-deficient human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), a key enzyme in the life cycle of the virus, that contributes significantly to the low accuracy of proviral DNA synthesis. Using an in vitro biochemical assay with recombinant purified HIV-1 RT, p53 and defined RNA/DNA or DNA/DNA template-primers, two basic features related to fidelity of DNA synthesis were studied: the misinsertion and mispair extension. The misincorporation of non-complementary deoxynucleotides into nascent DNA and subsequent mispair extension by HIV-1 RT were substantially decreased in the presence of p53 with both RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA template-primers. In addition, the productive interaction between polymerization (by HIV-1 RT) and exonuclease (by p53) activities was observed; p53 preferentially hydrolyzes mispaired 3'-termini, permitting subsequent extension of the correctly paired 3'-terminus by HIV-1 RT. Taken together the data demonstrate that preferential excision of mismatched nucleotides by 3'-->5' exonuclease activity of wild-type p53 enhances the fidelity of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT in vitro, thus providing a biochemical mechanism to reduce mutations caused by incorporation of mismatched nucleotides. The fact that p53 is reactive with both RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA template-primers raises an interesting possibility of the existence of functional cooperation between p53 and HIV-1 RT in cytoplasm during the reverse transcription process, which may be important for maintaining HIV genomic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2312625880,"Dysregulated cell motility is one of the major characteristics of invasion and metastatic potentials of malignant tumor cells. Here, we examined the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell motility of two human renal carcinoma cell lines, ACHN and VMRC-RCW. Scattering and migration was induced in ACHN in an HGF-dependent manner, whereas they were maintained in VMRC-RCW even in the absence of HGF. In VMRC-RCW, HGF receptor (HGFR) tyrosine kinase was constitutively active, and sequence analysis showed N375S, A1209G and V1290L mutations. However, transfection experiments using porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells demonstrated that no single mutation or combination of two or three mutations caused HGF-independent constitutive activation. Conversely, the expressed amount of receptor protein had a pivotal role in the basal kinase activity. With respect to downstream signaling molecules of HGFR in ACHN or VMRC-RCW, the Ras-MAPK pathway was downregulated, whereas phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) was not further activated by HGF-treatment in VMRC-RCW cells. The PI3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002 strongly inhibited spontaneous migration of VMRC-RCW. One transfected PAE cell line with massive overexpression of HGFR demonstrated scattered morphology and increased PI3-kinase activity in association with increased motility, which was partially inhibited by LY294002. Taken together, our results indicate that the overexpression of HGFR causes increase in cellular motility and PI3-kinase shows the important contribution on the increased motility of renal carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089342377,"Human ovarian cancer cells and tissues were examined for the presence or absence of a 42-bp splicing variant of ERCC1 gene, and for a possible functional role of this 42-bp sequence. This specific sequence exists in exon I, the 5′-UTR of the gene. Loss of this 42-bp sequence was associated with increased ERCC1 mRNA expression, in an assessment of 121 ovarian cancer specimens (p2<10−6). In cells in tissue culture, the absence of the 42-bp segment was associated with a twofold increased ability to drive transcription in a Luciferase reporter system. Protein can be demonstrated in ovarian cancer cells based on EMSA analysis. Computer analysis shows that this 42-bp sequence contains several binding sites, including a core-binding domain for protein RFX1, transcriptional repressor. These preliminary results lay the groundwork in determination of potential roles for a negative regulatory element in NER repair pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2318540498,"Development of strategies for prevention of breast cancer development requires an understanding of the effects of mammary oncogenes on mammary cells at early stages in neoplastic transformation. As mammary oncogenes wnt-1 and int-2 affect different signal transduction pathways, we investigated their effects on established mouse mammary epithelial cell lines (MMECLs) reflecting early stages in tumorigenesis. Normal interactions between beta-catenin and E-cadherin were abrogated in all three immortalized MMECLs and the cells lacked beta-catenin-mediated transactivation activity, detectable using a reporter assay, suggesting that alterations in cell adhesion may be very early events in mammary tumorigenesis. Immortalized FSK4 and EL12 cells and hyperplastic TM3 cells were stably transfected with expression vectors encoding wnt-1 or int-2 or the control vector, and drug-selected pooled cells from each line were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to express the transfected oncogene; this expression persisted in the cells analysed in vitro and in vivo. Resultant phenotypic changes depended both on the oncogene and the target mammary cell line. In FSK4 cells, expression of wnt-1 or int-2 resulted in proliferative changes in vitro, including reduced contact inhibition, increased beta-catenin expression, and decreased p53 transcriptional activity, but neither oncogene conferred upon those cells the ability to produce tumors in vivo. EL12 cells were highly refractory to the effects of both oncogenes, with the only measurable changes being increased E-cadherin levels induced by both oncogenes and increased proliferation of the int-2-transfected cells in the absence of serum. Parental TM3 cells were phenotypically similar to wnt-1- or int-2-transfected FSK4 cells and displayed an increased rate of proliferation in vitro and markedly increased tumorigenicity in vivo following transfection with int-2 but not with wnt-1. These results suggest that wnt-1 signaling is redundant in the hyperplastic TM3 cells and indicate that wnt-1-induced effects in the immortalized FSK4 and EL12 cells were not sufficient to mediate a tumorigenic phenotype. This study showed that the wnt-1 and int-2 oncogenes have similar but distinguishable effects on immortalized MMECLs and that the genetic background of the mammary cells greatly influences the consequences of oncogene expression at early stages of cell transformation."
