https://openalex.org/W2069598734,"Expression of a truncated activin type II receptor, which blocks signaling by activin, neuralizes explants of embryonic cells that would otherwise become epidermal cells. This neuralization is direct and does not require the presence of mesoderm. The induced neural tissue expresses general molecular markers of the central nervous system as well as an array of neural markers along the anteroposterior axis. In the context of the whole embryo, expression of this truncated activin receptor diverts prospective ectoderm and endoderm to a neural fate. We propose that inhibition of the activin type II receptor signaling causes the cells of Xenopus embryos to adopt a neural fate. These results, along with previous experiments performed in Drosophila, suggest that the formation of the nervous system in vertebrates and invertebrates occurs by a common strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1982310237,"We have purified and characterized a modified peptide pheromone that accumulates in culture medium as B. subtilis grows to high density. This pheromone is required for the development of genetic competence. When added to cells at low density, the pheromone induces the premature development of competence. The peptide moiety of the pheromone matches nine of the last ten amino acids predicted from a 55 codon open reading frame, comX. comX and comQ, the gene immediately upstream of comX, are required for production of the pheromone. Response to the pheromone requires the comP-comA two-component regulatory system and the oligopeptide permease encoded by spo0K. Spo0K could transport the pheromone into the cell, or function as a receptor, binding the pheromone and sending a transmembrane signal, leading to activation of the ComA transcription factor and induction of competence development."
https://openalex.org/W2050582521,"Following encounter with antigen, the immunoglobulin genes in B lymphocytes undergo somatic hypermutation. Most nucleotide substitutions are introduced into a region flanked by the V gene promoter and intron enhancer. Experiments described here using transgenic mice revealed that the V kappa promoter does not contain specific signals since hypermutation was retained on substituting it by a beta-globin promoter. However, both the kappa intron and kappa 3' enhancer regions were found to be essential for full hypermutation. This dependence of hypermutation on both enhancers contrasts with transgene expression in hybridomas in which only the 3' enhancer (and not the intron enhancer) is necessary to achieve high mRNA levels. The results show that full hypermutation depends on multiple elements, removal of some of which may drastically impair but not totally abolish the process."
https://openalex.org/W2123321976,"Abstract Abnormalities of zinc homeostasis occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a dementia characterized by the aggregation of A beta in the brain, and in Down syndrome, a condition characterized by premature AD. We studied the binding of Zn2+ to a synthetic peptide representing residues 1-40 (A beta 1-40), as well as other domains of A beta. Two classes of Zn2+ binding were identified by 65Zn2+ labeling: highly specific pH-dependent high affinity (K(a) = 107 nM) binding, and lower affinity (K(a) = 5.2 microM) binding. Gel filtration chromatography identified monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric A beta species. Zinc induced a marked loss of A beta solubility upon chromatographic analysis. This was attributed to precipitation onto the column glass, which contains aluminosilicate, and was confirmed by the observation of zinc-accelerated precipitation of A beta by kaolin, a hydrated aluminum silicate suspension. Zinc binding also increased A beta resistance to tryptic cleavage at the secretase site, indicating that a small (<3 microM) increase in brain Zn2+ concentration could significantly alter A beta metabolism. We propose that elevated brain interstitial zinc levels may increase A beta adhesiveness and interfere with A beta catabolism. Consequently, abnormalities of regional zinc concentrations in the brains of patients with AD or Down syndrome may contribute to A beta amyloidosis in these disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2166153628,"Mdj1p, a novel member of the DnaJ family, is a heat shock protein that is associated with the inner membrane of mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Disruption of the MDJ1 gene resulted in a petite phenotype, loss of mitochondrial DNA, and inviability at 37°C. Import of precursor proteins was not affected by a lack of Mdj1p, but folding of newly imported proteins was markedly impaired. The efficiency of refolding of a tester protein, dihydrofolate reductase, was significantly reduced in mitochondria lacking Mdj1p after incubation at elevated temperature. We conclude that Mdj1p is an important mitochondrial chaperone that participates in the folding of newly imported proteins and in the protection of proteins against heat denaturation and aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W2050054880,"In C. elegans, the glp-1 gene encodes a membrane receptor that is required for anterior cell fates in the early embryo. We report that GLP-1 protein is localized to anterior blastomeres in 2- to 28-cell embryos. By contrast, glp-1 mRNA is present in all blastomeres until the 8-cell stage. Furthermore, the glp-1 3' untranslated region can restrict translation of a reporter mRNA to anterior blastomeres. Therefore, the translation of maternal glp-1 mRNA is temporally and spatially regulated in the C. elegans embryo. The regulation of maternal glp-1 mRNA has striking parallels to the regulation of maternal hunchback mRNA in the Drosophila embryo. Thus, the establishment of embryonic asymmetry in diverse organisms may involve conserved mechanisms of maternal mRNA regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2004118662,"THE Rab GTPases are key regulators of vesicular transport1–6. A fraction of Rab proteins is present in the cytosol, bound with GDP, complexed to a protein termed GDI7–10. Rab9 is localized prim-arily to late endosomes, where it aids the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors to the trans-Golgi network11. It has been proposed that Rab proteins are delivered to specific membranes by GDI, and that this process is accompanied by the exchange of bound GDP for GTP1–3. In addition, Rab localization requires carboxy-terminal prenylation and specific structural determinants12–14. Here we describe the reconstitution of the selec-tive targeting of prenylated Rab9 protein onto late endosome mem-branes and show that this process is accompanied by endosome-triggered nucleotide exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2059071932,"The sigma F factor establishes cell type-specific gene transcription during sporulation in B. subtilis. sigma F is negatively regulated by SpollAB, which forms complexes with sigma F or SpollAA. ATP and its nonhydrolyzable analogs stimulate the formation of the SpollAB.sigma F complex, whereas ADP stimulates the formation of the SpollAB.SpollAA complex. Which protein SpollAB associates with is determined by the concentrations of the two nucleotides, on which basis we propose a partner-switching model for the regulation of sigma F: [formula: see text] Consistent with this model, SpollAA reverses SpollAB-mediated inhibition of sigma F-directed transcription in a manner that depends on ADP. Cell-specific activation of sigma F could be due to an alteration in adenosine nucleotide levels in one cell of the sporangium."
https://openalex.org/W1840935595,"Abstract The human progesterone receptor (hPR) exists in two distinct forms in most cells, hPR-A and hPR-B. Both receptor isoforms exhibit distinct biological functions and demonstrate a cell- and promoter-specific ability to regulate gene transcription. Interestingly, in cell contexts where PR-A is transcriptionally inactive, it acts as a progesterone-dependent inhibitor of estrogen receptor function. Coexpression of the human estrogen receptor with the A form (but not the B form) of the human progesterone receptor resulted in a ligand-dependent inhibition of estrogen receptor-mediated gene transcription. The antiprogestins RU486 (MIfepristone) and ZK98299 (Onapristone) and related antiprogestins were all effective noncompetitive inhibitors of the estrogen receptor in this assay as none of these compounds interacted directly with the estrogen receptor. This observation may explain in part the observed tissue-specific antiestrogenic effects of RU486 and further indicates that the antiestrogenic activities of antiprogestins may be intrinsic to their biological function. This important new information defines novel activities of progesterone receptor ligands and may alter the way in which we define progesterone receptor modulators for future clinical applications. In addition, these data reveal that the A form of the progesterone receptor plays a key role in modulating estrogen receptor function in cells where both receptors are expressed."

https://openalex.org/W1578927156,"Most proteoglycans bear either chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate chains linked to serine residues at Ser-Gly attachment sites on the core protein. However, only a fraction of proteins with Ser-Gly sites exhibit glycosaminoglycan chains. A variable proportion of these sites may be glycanated, and an unknown mechanism distinguishes whether these sites are for chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate. To evaluate the core protein features that determine whether and where chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate will be linked, we have studied mouse syndecan-1, a transmembrane proteoglycan that is invariably glycanated and can contain both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains. The extracellular domain of the syndecan-1 core protein contains five Ser-Gly sites, three clustered near its N terminus and two adjacent to the transmembrane domain near its C terminus. We have established the distribution of glycosaminoglycans on these attachment clusters. In contrast to the C-terminal cluster, the N-terminal cluster was always glycanated, suggesting that this domain of the core protein contains sequences responsible for the invariable attachment of glycosaminoglycan chains. Solely chondroitin sulfate was found on the C-terminal cluster. This cluster contains the sequences EGSGE and ETSGE, both estimated to be on the protein surface in a hydrophilic environment. Heparan sulfate was found solely on the N-terminal cluster, which also bears some chondroitin sulfate. This cluster contains the sequences FSGSGTG and DGSGD, the former estimated to be in a hydrophobic pocket and the latter, similar to the sequence on the C-terminal cluster, in an exposed hydrophilic region. This glycosaminoglycan distribution was identical on mouse syndecan-1 produced by either mouse epithelial (NMuMG) or hamster mesenchymal (CHO) cells, suggesting that site-specific attachment of glycosaminoglycans is independent of cell type. These results implicate a cellular mechanism that distinguishes among the potential sites and attaches the correct glycosaminoglycan type unambiguously. Thus, structural elements of the core protein other than the Ser-Gly attachment sites determine if a site will be glycanated and, if so, whether with chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1586844122,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictor yet identified. This peptide plays an important role in the regulation of arterial tone, in part through its interaction with endogenous vasodilator compounds. To understand the interactions of endothelin with the vasoactive prostaglandins (PGs), we determined the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI2), and thromboxane A2 on ET-1 synthesis and secretion from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and on ET-1 action in aortic smooth muscle cells. Both PGE2 and PGI2 (vasodilator prostaglandins) caused an approximately 40% inhibition of basal ET-1 secretion and a 50% inhibition of serum-stimulated ET-1 secretion in a dose-related and time course fashion. In contrast, the vasoconstrictor prostaglandin, thromboxane A2, had no effect on ET-1 secretion. PGE2 and PGI2 similarly inhibited the basal production of new ET-1 protein (translation) by 40-50% and inhibited the basal steady-state mRNA expression of ET-1 in bovine aortic endothelial cells by 60-70%. Both prostaglandins also caused an approximately 55% inhibition of ET-1 transcription, as shown by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter studies. PGE2 and PGI2 strongly stimulated cGMP generation; both the PG stimulation of cGMP and the inhibition of ET-1 secretion and translation were reversed by LY83583, a general inhibitor of cGMP generation. The PG-induced inhibition of ET-1 secretion and translation was also reversed by KT5823, an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, but not by (Rp)-adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate, an inhibitor of protein kinase A activation. PGE2 and PGI2 also inhibited both basal and ET-1-stimulated DNA synthesis in aortic smooth muscle cells by approximately 45% through a cGMP-dependent mechanism. Therefore, two endogenous PGs, known to be important vasodilators in vivo, significantly inhibit the transcription, translation, secretion, and action of ET-1. We propose that the vasodilator action of the PGs results, in part, from their ability to inhibit the production of this potent vasoconstrictor."
https://openalex.org/W1567149755,"Intracellular proteolytic processing of human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein precursor (gp160) is an essential step for virus infectivity. Northern blot analysis provided evidence that furin and PC1, but not PC2, are expressed in the CD4+ human lymphoblastoid H9 cell line, suggesting the possible participation of these convertases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp160 proteolytic processing. Purified PC1 and furin cleaved specifically in vitro gp160 into gp120 (HIV-I SU) and gp41 (HIV-I TM). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the produced gp41 (HIV-I TM) demonstrated that the cleavage occurred within the sequence Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg decreases Ala-Val-Gly-Ile, which is identical to the bond cleaved in vivo. Transition state analog peptides were designed and tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit the PC1- or furin-mediated gp160 cleavage. The best inhibitor was decanoyl-Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg-psi [CH2NH]-Phe-Leu-Gly-Phe-NH2."
https://openalex.org/W1500516478,"Although some previous studies have suggested that triglyceride, a major core lipid, plays a key role in the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins from HepG2 cells, other reports have indicated the importance of cholesteryl ester, another core lipid. We attempted to better define the roles of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester in the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins from HepG2 cells by determining the effects of Sandoz 58-035, a potent acyl-CoA acyltransferase inhibitor, which significantly inhibits cholesteryl synthesis, and Triacsin D, a potent fatty acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor, which significantly inhibits triglyceride synthesis, on the secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Sandoz 58-035 (2 micrograms/ml) decreased very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)-stimulated cellular cholesteryl ester content by 60-80%, and blocked oleate-stimulated cholesteryl ester synthesis by 100%, but did not decrease VLDL- or oleate-stimulated apolipoprotein B secretion. Triacsin D (12.5 microM), which significantly inhibited VLDL and oleate stimulation of triglyceride synthesis, without affecting cholesteryl ester synthesis, blocked the stimulation of apolipoprotein B secretion by both agents. In HepG2 cells transfected with 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase cDNA, cholesteryl ester synthesis and mass were increased by 100%, but apolipoprotein B secretion was unaffected. Sandoz 58-035 decreased cholesteryl ester synthesis significantly but did not decrease apolipoprotein B secretion from this cell line. When these transfected cells were incubated with oleate, apolipoprotein B secretion increased; Triacsin D blocked this effect. Finally, sphingomyelinase treatment (which shifts cholesterol from plasma membranes to intracellular pools) increased cholesteryl ester synthesis 4-5-fold, but apolipoprotein B secretion was unaffected. Changes in cellular cholesteryl ester synthesis or mass did not affect the intracellular degradation of newly synthesized apolipoprotein B, but changes in triglyceride synthesis were always associated with corresponding changes in the intracellular degradation of apolipoprotein B. In conclusion, neither long term nor short term changes in cholesteryl ester synthesis or mass regulate the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein from HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1479888957,"Antibodies have been raised against synthetic peptides derived from the predicted primary sequence of the human cocaine- and antidepressant-sensitive norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET). One antibody (N430), raised and purified against a putative intracellular human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) epitope, detects hNET expression in a stably transfected cell line (LLC-NET) by indirect immunofluorescence only in the presence of detergent, while no immunoreactivity is observed in either the parental cells (LLC-PK1) or in LLC-NET cells incubated with preimmune sera or peptide absorbed antibody. N430 immunoblots of LLC-NET cell extracts reveal two major immunoreactive hNET species in these cells, migrating at 80 and 54 kDa, respectively. Pulse-chase N430 immunoprecipitation studies confirm that the 54-kDa species is a transient, glycosylated intermediate of a longer lived, more highly glycosylated protein with an apparent M(r) of 80,000. In contrast, a 54-kDa species is the primary hNET product in vaccinia virus T7-infected HeLa cells, transiently transfected with hNET cDNA. PNGase F digestion of extracts prepared from LLC-NET- and hNET-transfected HeLa cells convert all immunoreactive species to a 46-kDa form, equivalent to that observed following incubation of whole cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. As transiently transfected HeLa and stable LLC-NET cells exhibit a pharmacologically similar NE transport activity, it appears likely that the additional glycosylation evident in the stable line does not contribute significantly to antagonist sensitivity. On the other hand, NE transport and antagonist ([125I]RTI-55) binding assays on whole LLC-NET cells treated with tunicamycin reveal a pronounced reduction in NE transport activity and hNET membrane density paralleled by an inability of NET proteins to replenish the higher M(r) hNET pool. These findings suggest an obligate role for N-linked glycosylation in hNET biosynthetic maturation, stability, and functional expression. In summary, N430 antibody is a useful tool for the visualization and characterization of hNET gene products and has permitted the first direct evaluation of biosynthetic steps leading to functional catecholamine transporter expression."
https://openalex.org/W1489872162,"Beryllium fluoride (BeFx) has been widely used as a phosphate analogue in nucleotide-binding proteins. It was found to bind tightly to F- but not G-actin (Combeau C., and Carlier M. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17429-17436) and to affect the three-dimensional structure of filaments by stabilizing the subdomain 2 region of the actin promoter (Orlova, A., and Egelman, E. H. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 227, 1043-1053). In this work we examined the BeFx-induced structural and functional changes in G- and F-actin by using proteolysis, chemical modifications, ATPase, and in vitro motility assays. The results of proteolysis studies show that BeFx binds also to MgADP-G-actin and renders its subdomain 2 region more similar to that in MgATP-G-actin. This is manifested in enhanced subtilisin and decreased tryptic digestions in subdomain 2 of G-actin. BeFx had a strong effect on the proteolysis of MgADP-F-actin: both the tryptic and subtilisin digestions in subdomain 2 were completely inhibited. Significant protection against proteolysis in this region was observed even at 1:14 molar ratios of BeFx to actin indicating cooperative effects on the structure of the actin filament. A similar although milder effect of phosphate on the proteolysis of F-actin suggests that BeFx acts as a phosphate analogue in this system. BeFx also induces changes in the subdomain 1 region of F-actin. This is revealed via reduced rates of Cys-374 alkylation with 7-diethylamino-3-(4'-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin and an increased subtilisin cleavage near the C terminus of actin in the presence of BeFx. The BeFx-induced structural changes in actin have little effect on its interactions with myosin. BeFx inhibits only slightly the actin-activated ATPase activity of S1 by decreasing Vmax without affecting KM. Additionally, the binding of BeFx to actin does not change the sliding velocity of actin filaments in the in vitro motility assays. The BeFx-induced specific and distinct changes in G- and F-actin point to the dynamic nature of actin structure and the local differences between monomeric and polymeric forms of actin."
https://openalex.org/W1483200187,"Intracellular Ca2+ pump expression and Ca2+ pool function are shown to be closely associated with growth and proliferation of DDT1MF-2 hamster smooth muscle cells. The Ca2+ pump blocker thapsigargin induces sustained Ca2+ pool emptying and entry of cells into a quiescent G0-like state (Short, A. D., Bian, J., Ghosh, T. K., Waldron, R. T., Rybak, S. L., and Gill, D. L. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 4986-4990). Using DDT1MF-2 cells growth-arrested by exposure to 3 microM thapsigargin for 24 h, treatment with 20% serum for 6 h without thapsigargin induced expression of functional Ca2+ pump protein detected as a 110-kDa thapsigargin-sensitive phosphorylated intermediate; 2.5% serum treatment resulted in no functional pump expression. Western analysis revealed only a slight serum-induced increase in total Ca2+ pump protein. New functional Ca2+ pump protein could be detected within 1 h of high serum treatment of thapsigargin-arrested cells, increasing over a 6-h period and correlating with the appearance of new Ca2+ pools. Induction of Ca2+ pools required serum at 10% or higher; no pools appeared with 5% serum or less. Significantly, high serum was required for only a brief but precise period of time. Exposure of thapsigargin-arrested cells to a 45-min pulse of 20% serum followed by continued culture in 2.5% serum was sufficient for full induction of new functional Ca2+ pump protein and Ca2+ pools; in contrast, no pumps or pools were detected after a 30-min serum pulse. A 40-min high serum pulse resulted in arrested cells reentering the cell cycle, synthesizing DNA, and resuming normal proliferation; in contrast, 35 min of serum treatment resulted in cells remaining totally quiescent. The results provide important evidence for the necessity of functional endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps in serum-induced cell growth and reflect a remarkably precise signaling period during which quiescent cells become committed to a progression of events including Ca2+ pump expression, Ca2+ pool function, reentry into the cell cycle, and cell division."
https://openalex.org/W67329060,"Incubation of C6-2B rat glioma cells with UDP or UTP resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase in the accumulation of inositol phosphates. In contrast, ATP, ADP, and analogs of these nucleotides known to be effective agonists at P2U-, P2X-, P2Y-, P2T-, and P2Z-purinergic receptors all had no effect on inositol phosphate levels in C6-2B cells. Pyrimidine nucleotides stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation with an order of potency of UDP > 5-BrUTP > UTP > dTDP > UDP glucose. K0.5 values for UDP, 5-BrUTP, and UTP were 2.3 +/- 0.5, 9 +/- 3, and 57 +/- 10 microM, respectively. A similar uridine nucleotide selectivity was observed for arachidonic acid release presumably occurring as a consequence of activation of phospholipase A2. Cross-desensitization and additivity experiments indicated that UDP and UTP interact with the same population of receptors. The effect of uridine nucleotides on inositol phosphate accumulation was inhibited markedly by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. UDP also caused a guanine nucleotide-dependent increase in inositol lipid hydrolysis in streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells. Taken together these results describe the existence of a novel uridine nucleotide receptor that is not activated by adenine nucleotides. This receptor is pharmacologically distinct from the previously described P2U- and other P2-purinergic receptors, and likely is a member of a new class of receptors for extracellular nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1558513743,"Semliki Forest virus encodes a small protein, known as 6K, that is associated with cellular membranes in the infected cells. This protein has been cloned and expressed in an inducible manner using pET vectors in Escherichia coli cells. Two different plasmids have been utilized; either the 6K gene is placed directly under the T7 promoter (pET3-6K) or the lac operator is located between the T7 promoter and the 6K gene (pET11-6K). In both systems, efficient synthesis of the 6K protein is achieved by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside plus rifampicin. The synthesis of the 6K protein is very toxic for E. coli causing increased membrane permeability and cell lysis as shown by alterations in permeability to either choline or hygromycin B. These results indicate that the togavirus 6K is a membrane-active protein that shows structural and functional similarities to poliovirus 3A protein. The function that the 6K protein could play during the virus replication cycle is discussed in the light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2108116425,"The import receptor MOM72 constitutes part of the protein translocation machinery of the outer mitochondrial membrane, the receptor-general insertion pore complex. The protein contains a membrane anchor at the NH2 terminus and a large cytosolic domain. In yeast and Neurospora crassa the cytosolic domain comprises about 570-580 amino acid residues. The cytosolic domain of yeast MOM72 was purified after expression in Escherichia coli as a homogeneous monomeric protein. It can recognize precursor proteins as demonstrated by its ability to compete for binding and import into the mitochondria and to physically interact with preproteins. A subset of preproteins including the ADP/ATP carrier and the phosphate carrier interact with very high affinity, precursors that are known to be targeted via MOM72. Thus, the cytosolic domain of MOM72 plays a critical function in the recognition of preproteins by directly binding to precursor proteins and thereby facilitating their targeting to mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1665045511,"The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau promotes microtubule assembly and has been implicated in the development of axonal morphology. To study the effect of phosphorylation and substrate modulation on tau's distinct activities to promote growth of existing microtubules and nucleation of new ones, we phosphorylated bacterially expressed human tau by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the absence or presence of heparin, an acidic substrate modulator. We found that heparin increased phosphorylation of tau by a factor of more than 2 and produced tau bands with decreased electrophoretic mobility. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of tau in the absence or presence of heparin similarly reduced tau's activity to promote microtubule growth, whereas tau's activity to promote microtubules was suppressed much more after phosphorylation in the presence of heparin. Using recombinant tau fragments we showed that heparin-induced phosphorylation caused a specific shift in electrophoretic mobility indicative of a change in tau's conformation. By aminoterminal sequencing of a tau fragment starting at residue 154 we provide evidence that phosphorylation of serine 156 is responsible for this mobility shift and for the effect on tau's nucleation activity. We conclude that tau's activities to promote growth of existing microtubules and nucleation of new ones are differentially affected by the phosphorylation of specific tau residues. Regulation of the phosphorylation state by substrate modulation may play an important role in regulating tau's function."
https://openalex.org/W1493478619,"The B cell surface receptor CD22 binds several sialoglycoproteins containing sialic acid in alpha 2,6 linkage, on the surface of B and T lymphocytes. Because lymphocytes adhere tightly to fibroblasts transfected with CD22 cDNA, it would appear reasonable to suggest that regulatory mechanisms might have evolved which prevent undesired CD22-mediated leukocyte aggregation. Here we provide evidence for the existence of at least one mechanism that might regulate CD22 interaction with ligands on adjacent cells. We demonstrate that sialylation of CD22 by beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase abrogates CD22-mediated lymphocyte adhesion, and that adhesion can be restored by removal of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid residues from the CD22 molecule. Taken together, our results suggest that alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase can both promote and inhibit CD22-ligand interactions. These observations provide the first direct evidence that receptor-ligand interactions mediated by an Ig superfamily molecule are under the control of a specific glycosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1582697652,"Chromogranin A is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+)-binding protein suggested to be responsible for the Ca2+ storage function of the secretory vesicle, which has been identified as a major inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. Moreover, chromogranin A has recently been shown to interact with the vesicle membrane at the intravesicular pH of 5.5 and to be released from it at a near physiological pH of 7.5 (Yoo, S. H. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 8213-8219). In the present study, chromogranin A is shown to interact with several integral membrane proteins of secretory vesicles at pH 5.5 but not at pH 7.5. One of the chromogranin A-interacting membrane proteins had a mass of 260 kDa and reacted with the IP3 receptor antibody. This result suggested not only the existence of the IP3 receptor in the vesicle membrane but also the existence of direct communication between chromogranin A and the IP3 receptor. In addition, the pH-dependent interaction of chromogranin A with integral membrane proteins implies an important role for chromogranin A in the sorting process of the vesicle membrane proteins during vesicle biogenesis in the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W2050246772,"Transcriptional initiation at bacteriophage T4 late promoters is activated from enhancer-like distal sites by the T4 gene 44, 62, and 45 DNA polymerase accessory proteins (gp44, gp62, and gp45, respectively). Enhancement is ATP hydrolysis-dependent and requires protein tracking along DNA. The structural analysis of the enhanced transcription initiation complex shows gp45 located at the upstream end of this promoter complex in the vicinity of its transcriptional coactivator, the T4 gene 33 protein. The ATP-cleaving gene 44 protein-gene 62 protein complex serves as the assembly factor for gp45, but does not stably associate with the enhanced promoter complex. Transcriptional enhancement quantitatively favors, but does not qualitatively change, DNA strand separation in the transcription bubble. A model of the transcriptional activation that rationalizes its DNA-tracking and activation-polarity properties is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1603795405,"We have analyzed the effect of thyroid hormone (T3) on SERCA2 gene expression using fetal chicken primary cardiac myocytes and C2C12 skeletal muscle cells in culture. Northern blot analysis of both cell types demonstrated that T3 induced a 3-fold accumulation of SERCA2 mRNA compared with cells grown in medium lacking T3. We have engineered deletion constructs containing various lengths of the 5'-flanking region from the rabbit SERCA2 gene which we have cloned previously (Zarain-Herzberg, A., MacLennan, D. H., and Periasamy, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4670-4677). A stable transfectant in C2C12 containing a chimeric SERCA2/CAT gene construct including -254 base pairs (bp) of SERCA2 5'-flanking region showed increased transcription activity upon the addition of 50 nM T3. We have analyzed the expression of several deletion constructs spanning 1,102 bp of the 5'-up-stream sequence of the SERCA2 gene by functional expression assays. Transient coexpression of the T3 receptor alpha 1 with various SERCA2/CAT deletion constructs showed trans-activation of chimeric constructs containing more than -267 bp, indicating that a thyroid hormone-responsive element was localized, at least in part, to the region -267 to -72 bp. T3 receptor-DNA binding assays demonstrated binding of the rat T3 receptor alpha 1 to a fragment containing a proposed T3 response element located between position -254 and -72 in the 5'-flanking region of the SERCA2 gene."

Here, we have further examined the contribution of the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and the catalytically active, luminal domain of GnTI in medial-Golgi localization, by analyzing the localization of hybrid molecules stably expressed in murine cells. In contrast to wild-type GnTI, which was efficiently localized to the medial-Golgi and not detected at the cell surface, hybrid molecules containing any two of the three domains of GnTI were localized to the medial-Golgi and were also present at low levels at the cell surface. Hybrid molecules containing only the transmembrane domain or the luminal domain of GnTI showed partial Golgi retention together with an increased level of cell surface expression compared with molecules containing two GnTI domains. The cytoplasmic tail independently was unable to retain reporter sequences to the Golgi but increased the ability of constructs containing either the luminal or transmembrane domain of GnTI to localize to the Golgi apparatus. Therefore, all three domains of GnTI contribute significantly to medial-Golgi localization. Furthermore, GnTI hybrid molecules showing increased cell surface expression were more readily extracted in a low salt buffer, suggesting that Golgi localized GnTI differs in physicochemical properties from cell surface GnTI. Based on an aggregation model of localization, we propose that Golgi retention of these hybrid molecules is mediated by the interaction of their GnTI domains with the corresponding domains of endogenous glycosyltransferase aggregates within the Golgi membranes of the transfected cell."
https://openalex.org/W1530071333,"The 300-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor cycles between the trans Golgi network and late endosomes, and between the plasma membrane and early endosomes, to deliver lysosomal enzymes to prelysosomes. Mannose 6-phosphate receptor trafficking requires structural determinants present in the cytoplasmic domain. However, when this domain was joined with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the epidermal growth factor receptor, it was not sufficient to direct this chimera to late endosomes and the trans Golgi network (Dintzis, S. M., and Pfeffer, S. R. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 77-84). These findings suggested a role for extracellular and/or transmembrane domains in mannose 6-phosphate receptor trafficking. We describe here the construction and expression of chimeric receptors comprised of mannose 6-phosphate receptor extracellular and transmembrane sequences joined with cytoplasmic domain sequences derived from the human epidermal growth factor receptor or the human low density lipoprotein receptor. The chimeras were stable proteins which were efficiently endocytosed and competent to bind a mannose 6-phosphate-containing ligand. Antibody binding assays and indirect immunofluorescence showed that the chimeras containing the mannose 6-phosphate receptor extracellular domain colocalized with mannose 6-phosphate receptors in intracellular compartments. These experiments suggest that the presence of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor extracellular domain may interfere with the rapid recycling of receptors from early endosomes to the cell surface and detain receptors within endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1547919954,"A phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) was solubilized from the isolated nuclei of rat ascites hepatoma AH7974 cells by ultrasonication in 2 M KCl. The extract was then subjected to five steps of column chromatographies in the order of Sephacryl S-300, phosphocellulose, Mono Q, Mono S, and Superose 6. Four forms of PLC (tentatively designated as N1, N2, N3, and N4) were purified 440-1400-fold. N1, N2, N3, and N4 showed apparent molecular masses of 85, 83, 80, and 88 kDa, respectively, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N1 cross-reacted with the antibody against the delta 1 isoform, while the other three forms did not cross-react with any of the antibodies against PLC-delta 1, -gamma 1, -gamma 2, and -beta 1. They hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) but did not show any activities against phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. They showed the same optimal pH:pH 6.5 for PI hydrolysis and pH 7.0 for both PIP and PIP2 hydrolyses. They absolutely required Ca2+ for activity, with optimal concentrations of 10(-3)-10(-5) M for PIP and 10(-4)-10(-5) M for PIP2. For PI hydrolysis, N1, N2, and N3 required a Ca2+ concentration higher than 10(-2) M whereas N4 revealed significant activity even at 10(-5) M Ca2+ concentrations. Two forms of plasma membrane PLC and three forms of cytosolic PLC were purified from AH7974 cells by the same procedure as for nuclear PLC. Comparative study with these three groups revealed that all of the purified PLC isoforms shared similar enzymological properties except N4, which showed an exceptionally high affinity to Mono S column and was active at low concentrations of Ca2+ for PI as substrate. Furthermore, when PLC isoforms of nuclei from adult resting rat liver were compared with those from regenerating rat liver after partial hepatectomy, a PLC isoform corresponding to N4 of AH7974 cells was found only in regenerating liver nuclei. From these results, it was suggested that the nuclei of growing liver cells possessed a unique form of PLC (N4)."
https://openalex.org/W1494788431,"Thrombomodulin (TM) binds thrombin to form a complex that activates the plasma anticoagulant zymogen protein C. TM is an integral membrane glycoprotein that contains a chondroitin sulfate moiety. Interaction with thrombin involves both the protein component of TM, specifically the growth factor-like repeats 4-6 (TM 4-6), and chondroitin sulfate. Removal of chondroitin sulfate decreases the affinity for thrombin approximately 10-fold and shifts the Ca2+ dependence of protein C activation from simple saturation at > or = 500 microM Ca2+ to a distinct optimum at approximately 100 microM Ca2+. Thrombin possesses two regions of high positive charge, anion binding exosites 1 and 2. Anion binding exosite 1 interacts with the growth factor region of TM while exosite 2 is involved in binding prothrombin activation fragment 2 or heparin. We demonstrate that recombinant TM, truncated at the membrane-spanning domain, or TM 4-6 can bind thrombin when fragment 2 is present either covalently attached (meizothrombin des-fragment 1) or in reversible association. With meizothrombin des-fragment 1, the Ca2+ dependence of protein C activation is independent of the presence of the chondroitin sulfate on TM. At 0.27 mM Ca2+, TM containing chondroitin sulfate binds thrombin (Kd(app) = 0.3 nM) approximately 45 times tighter than meizothrombin des-fragment 1 (Kd(app) = 14 nM). However, the chondroitin-free form binds thrombin (Kd(app) = 2.4 nM) only approximately 4 times tighter than meizothrombin des-fragment 1 (Kd(app) = 9.4 nM). These studies suggest that occupancy of anion binding exosite 2 by either chondroitin sulfate or fragment 2 alters thrombin conformation resulting in the altered Ca2+ dependence of protein C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1562021961,"Labeled transcripts of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) cDNA were rapidly degraded in incubations with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). In contrast, a transcript of superoxide dismutase cDNA was stable in control incubations. A transcript of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of IL-1 alpha was rapidly degraded while that of the 5'-UTR and coding region was stable. This degradative activity was present in the post-ribosomal supernatant. Degradation of the 3'-UTR transcript was inhibited by the addition of a large excess of an 80-base RNA containing four AUUUA repeats, but not by the same RNA without such repeats. This suggested that AUUUA motifs were responsible for the instability of the 3'-UTR transcript. The 80-base RNA did not act as a competitive substrate for a nuclease since it was not degraded. Partial transcripts of IL-1 alpha 3'-UTR were incubated with RRL to localize instability determinants. Transcripts containing at least three clustered AUUUA motifs were rapidly degraded, while transcripts containing four scattered AUUUA motifs were stable. To study the mechanism of RNA degradation, the RRL was passed through an affinity column that retained AUUUA-binding proteins. The flow-through or the fraction eluted from such a column were inactive, but the two fractions together degraded the 3'-UTR transcript. This indicated that proteins bound by the affinity column did not have nuclease activity but targeted this RNA for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1510321210,"Mas70p is an integral membrane protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is targeted and inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane in an N(in)-Ccyto orientation by its NH2-terminal 29-amino acid signal anchor sequence. Recently, we demonstrated that the signal anchor was capable of mediating homo-oligomerization of a fusion protein, pOMD29, in the outer membrane in vitro (Millar, D. G., and Shore, G. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18403-18406). Consistent with this finding, we show here that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Mas70p signal anchor is capable of independent membrane insertion and dimerization with pOMD29. To further map the oligomerization domain in the signal anchor sequence, a deletion mutant of pOMD29 that lacks amino acids 2-10 was constructed. This protein, pOMD29 delta 2-10, efficiently participated in dimer formation following import, indicating that dimerization was mediated by the putative membrane spanning segment (amino acids 11-29). This segment is predicted to form an alpha-helix that has an alanine-rich face and contains multiple copies of a pentapeptide dimerization motif that is widespread among members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Substitution of the alanine residues in one of these copies with isoleucine, producing a potentially bulkier contact surface, resulted in a protein which was targeted and inserted into the outer membrane but failed to assemble into dimers. Taken together, these results identify a structural feature of the signal anchor transmembrane domain that is important for oligomerization but is not required for targeting and membrane insertion."
https://openalex.org/W1533255714,"The human papillomavirus type 16 is associated with anogenital cancer. Transcription of the viral transforming genes E6 and E7 is under the control of an epithelial cell type-specific enhancer. In the enhancer core, we have identified a regulatory element that is recognized by a novel nuclear factor named MSPF (methylation-sensitive papillomavirus transcription factor). Mutating the MSPF binding site strongly affects the enhancer activity. The MSPF recognition sequence 5'-ATGCGNNNNCGCCT-3' contains two CpG dinucleotides, potential targets for 5-cytidine methylation. DNA recognition by MSPF is strictly methylation-sensitive, since introduction of 5-methylcytidine into either CpG abolishes complex formation. Moreover, CpG methylation of the MSPF binding site suppresses the activity of the enhancer and of the MSPF enhanson subfragment in vivo. In the cervical carcinoma cell line CaSki, which has integrated multiple transcriptionally inactive human papilloma virus 16 genomes, a few of the viral genomes are methylated at the MSPF binding site. These findings suggest that viral transcription can be suppressed by methylation of the regulatory region, an event that prevents binding of the cellular transcription factor MSPF."
https://openalex.org/W1547173256,"Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes the addition of myristate to the amino-terminal glycine residue of a number of eukaryotic proteins. In this report, a simple and rapid purification as well as the properties of this enzyme from bovine spleen is described. Using combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on SP-Sepharose fast flow, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, and Superose 12 (HR/30) gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography, the enzyme was purified 1475-fold with a high yield. Under native conditions, the enzyme exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa, whereas under denaturing conditions the enzyme represented an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa, suggesting that spleen NMT is a monomeric protein. The NMT activity could be greatly activated to severalfold with the use of Tris-HCl buffer. Kinetic properties indicated that spleen NMT had an apparent low Km for pp60src and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate as compared with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the M2 gene segment of reovirus type 3-derived peptides. Bovine spleen NMT was potently inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by NIP71 (a bovine brain NMT inhibitory protein) with a half-maximal inhibition of 0.816 microgram/ml. Results of this study along with the existing knowledge on NMT indicate that the activity of enzyme resides in a single polypeptide chain of molecular mass between 50 and 68 kDa."

https://openalex.org/W1495142138,"The 4-kDa beta-amyloid protein that forms fibrillar deposits in Alzheimer's diseased brains is derived from a large precursor, the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP). Recently, it has been reported that beta-amyloid is normally produced and secreted by cultured mammalian cells. In our studies involving recombinant expression of beta-APP, increased yields of beta-amyloid were associated with expression of aberrant beta-APP molecules. Deletion mutations within the beta-amyloid domain, incorrect beta-APP isoform expression in fibroblasts or neuronal cells, or excess amounts of beta-APP all led to increases in beta-amyloid production. Aberrant beta-APP appears to be diverted from the secretory pathway and then degraded to beta-amyloid."
https://openalex.org/W1503687795,"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) stimulation of renal epithelial cells elicits a large increase in apical membrane osmotic water permeability (Pf) produced by the fusion of water channel containing vesicles with the apical membrane. Removal of ADH stimulation results in retrieval of apical water channels into a specialized non-acidic endosomal compartment. Previous studies (Sabolic, I., Wuarin, F., and Shi, L. B. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 119, 111-122) have shown that water channel containing papillary endosomes labeled with fluorescein-dextran can be isolated from rat renal papilla. We have utilized small particle flow sorting methodology to both monitor and improve upon the purification of these water channel containing endosomes (WCV). Flow cytometry analysis on a vesicle-by-vesicle basis demonstrates that WCV are homogeneous with respect to entrapped fluorescein-dextran, the apical membrane enzyme marker leucine amino peptidase and ultrastructural morphology. WCV do not acidify their luminal contents after addition of Mg-ATP but contain abundant functional water channels (Pf0.28 cm/s at 23 degrees C) as determined by stopped flow fluorimetry. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis shows that purified WCV are composed of 20 major protein bands. To determine the identity of WCV water channels, WCV proteins were probed with affinity purified antisera recognizing two renal water channel proteins. These include Aquaporin-CHIP found in the proximal tubule and thin descending limb of Henle and the candidate ADH water channel protein WCH-1 or Aquaporin- (AQP) CD present in the ADH-responsive epithelial cells of the collecting duct. These data reveal that WCV contained little or no AQP-CHIP protein. In contrast, WCV are highly enriched for AQP-CD protein. Together, these data define the protein composition of the papillary WCV and link directly the presence of functional apical membrane water channels with the presence of the AQP-CD protein."
https://openalex.org/W1558269979,"Abstract In order to elucidate mechanisms involved in striated muscle contractile protein isoform expression, we have defined regulatory elements in the cardiac actin gene necessary for postnatal expression at the level of transcript accumulation in the heart and hindlimb muscles of transgenic mice. During this developmental period in the rodent, cardiac actin expression essentially remains constant in the heart, but declines significantly in skeletal muscle. We determined that a 13-kilobase human cardiac actin gene fragment contains sufficient information to direct this maturation-based developmental expression, as well as striated muscle-specific and high level expression. We localized an element responsible for maturation-based down-regulation in the 3' flank of the gene between approximately 950 and 2120 base pairs downstream of the polyadenylation site. Furthermore, we determined that -800 base pairs of 5'-flanking DNA, which contains multiple MyoD1 binding sites, as well as serum response element and AP1 binding sites, can account for striated muscle-specific expression, but not high level expression. Findings indicate that sequence(s) responsible for high level expression of the gene must be located within the body of the gene. We conclude that the human cardiac actin gene contains distinct sequences which confer developmental, tissue-specific, and high level expression."
https://openalex.org/W1523642899,"The oxidative half-reaction of the two-protein enzyme, p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida, has been studied by absorbance stopped-flow techniques. The formation of three flavin-oxygen intermediates, the anionic and protonated forms of the flavin hydroperoxide (intermediates I and I) and the hydroxyflavin (intermediate III), was observed during the course of the oxygen reaction with the reduced flavoprotein-coupling protein complex. The flavin hydroperoxide, which is formed in a second-order reaction with oxygen, is in rapid equilibrium with the aromatic substrate, p-hydroxyphenylacetate. Due to this rapid equilibrium, p-hydroxyphenylacetate effectively competes with other ligands, such as p-chlorophenylacetate and p-aminophenylacetate and proceeds through the hydroxylation pathway. Furthermore, dehydration of intermediate III is subjected to severe inhibition in the presence of excess p-hydroxyphenylacetate, similar to the observations made with phenol hydroxylase. A reaction mechanism for the oxidative half-reaction in the presence of the aromatic substrate, p-hydroxyphenylacetate, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1568311228,"The transcriptional activation of high cysteine chorion genes in the follicular cells of the silkworm Bombyx mori occurs at the end of oogenesis and coincides with the appearance of a chorion promoter DNA binding factor, BCFI, in follicular cell nuclei. Follicular cells of vitellogenic and choriogenic follicles that do not express high cysteine chorion genes contain high levels of a latent form of BCFI in their cytoplasm. The abundance of the cytoplasmic factor, termed cBCFI, is dramatically reduced during late choriogenesis, coincident with the appearance of factor BCFI in the nucleus and the transcriptional activation of high cysteine genes. Mobility shift assays performed with partially proteolyzed nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of follicular cells, DNA binding assays carried out in the presence of anti-BCFI antibodies, and electrophoretic analyses of the proteins present in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of follicular cells and recognized by the same antibodies suggest that factor cBCFI represents a covalently modified version of BCFI. The DNA-binding sites of BCFI and cBCFI include a core sequence, AGATAA, but, while this sequence is sufficient for specific binding of BCFI, it only constitutes part of the DNA-binding site of cBCFI. Dephosphorylation of cBCFI results in a change of its binding specificity to that of BCFI. The cytoplasmic sequestration of cBCFI appears to be mediated by a phosphorylation-dependent, reversible association of this factor with an ancillary cytoplasmic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1482529115,"The aromatic hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor is a cytosolic protein that binds halogenated ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and nonhalogenated ligands such as 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) and benzo[a]pyrene. The best characterized biological response mediated by the Ah receptor is induction of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1). Photoaffinity labeling of the Ah receptor has been reported only with halogenated ligands such as TCDD and some of its iodinated derivatives. In this study, photolabeling of the Ah receptor was achieved with the nonhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon [3H]MC. Sources of Ah receptor were the mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa-1c1c9 and the human colon adenocarcinoma line LS180. Cytosolic fractions either were used in a crude form or were enriched by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. These then were incubated with [3H]MC, irradiated with UV light (> 300 nm), precipitated with acetone, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The yield of photoadduct formation was lower with [3H]MC (approximately 1%) compared with [3H]TCDD (3.5%) in Hepa-1c1c9 cells. The same was true in LS180 cells, i.e. the yield was 0.2% for [3H]MC versus 5.48 +/- 0.26% for [3H]TCDD. The relative molecular mass of the [3H]MC-labeled receptor estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 94,600 +/- 2,400 (mean +/- S.E.) for Hepa-1c1c9 cells and 113,600 +/- 3,200 for LS180 cells; these are the same molecular masses as determined by photolabeling with [3H]TCDD. In velocity sedimentation assays of mouse cytosol, [3H]MC binds specifically to two cytosolic proteins: the 4 S carcinogen-binding protein and the Ah receptor (9 S). However, no photolabeling of the 4 S protein was detected in our experiments. [3H]MC photolabeling of the human Ah receptor from LS180 cells was detected only in experiments using enriched cytosolic preparations. In addition to the 95-kDa ligand-binding subunit, a specifically radiolabeled protein of 164,900 +/- 5,800 kDa was also detected in Hepa-1c1c9 cytosol photolabeled with [3H]MC, suggesting cross-linking, by MC, of another subunit of the multimeric Ah receptor complex to the ligand-binding subunit. Immunochemical analysis showed that the ligand-binding subunit of the Ah receptor is one component of the 165-kDa complex. The other protein in the complex could not be identified with antibodies to the heat shock proteins hsp90 or hsp70 or with antibodies to the p59 protein or Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein. The identity and function of the protein that becomes cross-linked to the ligand-binding subunit require further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1527348254,"The H(+)-ATPase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe belongs to the group of transport ATPases which displays two main conformational states, E1 and E2 (P-type ATPase). In this report, we show that, as in the case of other P-type ATPase, the purified enzyme exhibits a p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity which can be completely inhibited by vanadate. In aqueous medium, p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis proceeds at only 0.5% of the rate of ATP hydrolysis, and both activities can be stimulated 3- to 4-fold by decreasing the pH from 7.5 to 6.5. Addition of the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (10-40%), which has been shown to favor the E2 conformation, stimulates the p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity but inhibits the ATPase activity. At pH 7.5, the Km for p-nitrophenyl phosphate decreases when dimethyl sulfoxide is present. In the presence of 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, the phosphatase activity can be inhibited by ATP (K(i) 300 microM) or by P(i) (K(i) 1 mM). The H(+)-ATPase incorporated into liposomes retains pNPPase activity, but it does not support H+ transport. Gel electrophoresis reveals that the pattern of H(+)-ATPase cleavage by trypsin changes when vanadate, Me2SO, or both compounds are present in the medium, regardless of the pH used during trypsinization. We propose that p-nitrophenyl phosphate is hydrolyzed by a H(+)-ATPase conformation distinct from that which hydrolyzes ATP, most probably an E2-like form. We also suggest that, in addition to the E1-E2 transition, the enzyme activity can be regulated by protons at another step of the catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1560061534,"This study was carried out to further characterize the RGD-dependent cell adhesion activity which was previously observed in the vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) (Loeser, R. F., and Wallin, R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9459-9462). We have found that this cell adhesion activity can be completely removed from the 10-kDa MGP by gel filtration over Sephacryl S-200-HR. The higher molecular weight contaminants removed by the gel filtration step display potent cell adhesion activity. The additional evidence previously adduced in support of the putative cell adhesion activity of MGP is that heat decarboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxyglutamate residues in MGP abolished the adhesion activity. The heat decarboxylation conditions used, however, appear to cause other chemical changes in proteins in addition to decarboxylation, as evidenced by the fact that the cell adhesion activity of fibronectin, which is not a vitamin K-dependent protein, is also destroyed by this procedure. The present evidence that the putative cell adhesion activity of MGP is caused by contaminating higher molecular weight cell adhesion proteins accounts for two apparent anomalies in the previously reported cell adhesion activity of MGP, the failure of antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 19 residues of bovine MGP to inhibit the cell adhesion activity of the intact, 79-residue bovine protein, and the potent inhibition of the cell adhesion activity of MGP by a synthetic peptide containing an RGD sequence, even though MGP does not contain this sequence."
