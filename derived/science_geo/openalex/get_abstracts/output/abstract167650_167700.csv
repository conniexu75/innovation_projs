The stimulatory lectin-like NKG2D receptor8,9,10,11,12,13 is expressed by NK cells, activated CD8+ T cells and by activated macrophages in mice11. Several distinct cell-surface ligands that are related to class I major histocompatibility complex molecules have been identified11,12,13,14, some of which are expressed at high levels by tumour cells but not by normal cells in adults11,13,15,16. However, no direct evidence links the expression of these ‘induced self’ ligands with tumour cell rejection. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the murine NKG2D ligands Rae1β or H60 in several tumour cell lines results in potent rejection of the tumour cells by syngeneic mice. Rejection is mediated by NK cells and/or CD8+ T cells. The ligand-expressing tumour cells induce potent priming of cytotoxic T cells and sensitization of NK cells in vivo. Mice that are exposed to live or irradiated tumour cells expressing Rae1 or H60 are specifically immune to subsequent challenge with tumour cells that lack NKG2D ligands, suggesting application of the ligands in the design of tumour vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W1807494075,"Rim1 was previously identified as a Rab3 effector localized to the presynaptic active zone in vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that C. elegans unc-10 mutants lacking Rim are viable, but exhibit behavioral and physiological defects that are more severe than those of Rab3 mutants. Rim is localized to synaptic sites in C. elegans, but the ultrastructure of the presynaptic densities is normal in Rim mutants. Moreover, normal levels of docked synaptic vesicles were observed in mutants, suggesting that Rim is not involved in the docking process. The level of fusion competent vesicles at release sites was reduced fivefold in Rim mutants, but calcium sensitivity of release events was unchanged. Furthermore, expression of a constitutively open form of syntaxin suppressed the physiological defects of Rim mutants, suggesting Rim normally acts to regulate conformational changes in syntaxin. These data suggest Rim acts after vesicle docking likely via regulating priming."

https://openalex.org/W1544255648,"In their famous 1927 experiment, Davisson and Germer observed the diffraction of electrons by a periodic material structure, so showing that electrons can behave like waves. Shortly afterwards, Kapitza and Dirac predicted that electrons should also be diffracted by a standing light wave. This Kapitza-Dirac effect is analogous to the diffraction of light by a grating, but with the roles of the wave and matter reversed. The electron and the light grating interact extremely weakly, via the 'ponderomotive potential', so attempts to measure the Kapitza-Dirac effect had to wait for the development of the laser. The idea that the underlying interaction with light is resonantly enhanced for electrons in an atom led to the observation that atoms could be diffracted by a standing wave of light. Deflection of electrons by high-intensity laser light, which is also a consequence of the Kapitza-Dirac effect, has also been demonstrated. But the coherent interference that characterizes wave diffraction has not hitherto been observed. Here we report the diffraction of free electrons from a standing light wave-a realization of the Kapitza-Dirac effect as originally proposed."

Multimerization of TNFRs can lead to recruitment of TRAFs (TNFR-associated factors) by the receptors resulting in activation of kinases and transcription factors, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Signal transduction triggered by TNF-α also induces an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have been suggested to play a role in NF-κB activation, which is thought to promote cell survival. However, oxidation of proteins and lipids by ROS can also result in apoptosis. The processes generating intracellular ROS and the mechanism(s) regulating the cellular redox status have not been fully elucidated. We investigated whether TRAFs play a role in controlling intracellular ROS levels. Our results indicate that recruitment of TRAFs to the plasma membrane of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells is crucial for activation of signaling pathways, which regulate ROS production in mitochondria. TRAF-mediated changes in ROS levels enhanced NF-κB activation but were not dependent on NF-κB-inducing kinase. Consistent with its anti-apoptotic function, Bcl-xL interfered with TRAF-mediated ROS generation but not NF-κB activation. Taken together, our results suggest a novel role of TRAFs in signal transduction pathways triggered by TNFR-related proteins, which balance cell survival and apoptosis by regulating the electron transport in mitochondria.

TNFR family members have been shown to regulate proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells (for review, see Refs. 1Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

TNFR-I (CD120a, TNFR p55, TNFR p60) and Fas (CD95, Apo-1) are two death domain-containing TNFR-related proteins, which after engagement by their ligands or cross-linking with antibodies trigger apoptotic pathways by recruitment of the intracellular adapter proteins TRADD (TNFR-associated death domain protein) and/or FADD/Mort-1 (Fas-associated death domain protein/mediator of receptor-induced toxicity) (3Boldin M.P.

Receptor-induced multimerization of FADD leads to caspase activation, which causes degradation of specific target proteins and, thereby, damage of the cell integrity (5Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Members of the TNFR family lacking a death domain including TNFR-II, CD30, Ox40, and 4-1BB cannot interact with TRADD or FADD but do recruit TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 2 to the plasma membrane (7Rothe M.

The adapter protein TRAF2 is involved in signaling pathways, which regulate cell survival (for review, see Ref. 11Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Effector molecules of TRAF-mediated signaling include protein kinases such as NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which can activate the transcription factors nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP1). Both transcription factors can antagonize apoptotic processes by increasing transcription of pro-survival genes (12Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

Previous studies have shown that TNF-α alters the redox status of cells (15Ginn-Pease M.E. Whisler R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 346-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar, 17Piette J. Piret B. Bonizzi G. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.P. Legrand-Poels S. Bours V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1237-1245PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α homo- and heterotrimers are ligands of several members of the TNFR superfamily, which activate NF-κB (18Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar). Various other stimuli that result in NF-κB activation can also increase intracellular ROS levels, and Schreck and colleagues (16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar) have suggested that NF-κB activation may require elevated levels of ROS. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction pathways linking cell surface receptors to sites of intracellular ROS generation. Both the requirement of intracellular ROS for activation of downstream target proteins and the mechanisms of ROS generation are subjects of ongoing research. This study addresses the role of TRAF proteins in regulating the increase of intracellular ROS levels upon receptor cross-linking. Treatment of cells with TNF-α and overexpression of constitutively active forms of TNFR-related proteins both resulted in increased intracellular ROS levels. Signaling triggered by TNFR-I, which does not recruit TRAFs directly to its cytoplasmic domain, can cause increases levels of intracellular ROS in the absence of exogenous TRAFs. In contrast, TNFR-related proteins including TNFR-II, CD30, 4-1BB, and Ox40, which have been shown to trigger TRAF-mediated signal transduction cascades, depend on soluble TRAF molecules in the cytoplasm to trigger ROS production. Studies with chemical inhibitors of ROS production and with cells either lacking a functional respiratory chain (ρ0 cells) or expressing Bcl-xL suggest that TNFR-related receptors regulate the cellular redox status by signal transduction pathways, which involve the electron transport chain in mitochondria. For all experiments the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (ATCC) or HEK293 ρ0 cells, which contain mitochondria but lack an intact respiratory chain, were used. HEK293 ρ0 cells were generated by incubating wild-type HEK293 cells in medium containing ethidium bromide (25 ng/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and uridine (50 μg/ml) (19King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by Ca3(PO4)2 precipitation of the appropriate plasmids according to standard protocols (20van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 105 cells/well were seeded on six-well plates, and 6 h before transfection medium was changed. If not described otherwise, cells were co-transfected with 65 ng of expression plasmids (pcDNA3) containing the coding sequence of TRAF2 and of various chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domain of CD28 and the cytoplasmic domain of TNFR-related proteins. For co-expression of NIK, 60 ng of pcDNA3 encoding NIK was used (kind gift of Dr. David Wallach). For co-expression of A20, 60 ng of pcDNA3[FLAG-A20] was used (kind gift of Dr. Richard Ulevitch). Eight hours after transfection, the medium was changed. Twenty-four hours after transfection, surface expression of CD28-chimeric proteins was analyzed by FACS using phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody 37.51 specific for mouse CD28 (PharMingen) or the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). After lysis, soluble and insoluble fractions of the lysates were separated by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 6,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The soluble fractions were used to analyze NF-κB activity by luciferase assay and ROS levels by fluorometry. TRAF2 levels were analyzed in both detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by Western blot. To determine NF-κB activity in cells, luciferase assays were performed as described previously (9Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with 65 ng of either a NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid containing two canonical κB sites (pGL2[2xNF-κB]) (21Klug C.A. Gerety S.J. Shah P.C. Chen Y.Y. Rice N.R. Rosenberg N. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 678-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or a control plasmid lacking the κB sites (pGL2), 65 ng of β-galactosidase expression plasmid (as internal transfection efficiency control), receptor and TRAF expression constructs. The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 400 ng/transfection by adding pcDNA3 plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in reporter lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). After precipitation of detergent-insoluble components of the lysates by centrifugation, luciferase assays were performed with aliquots of the lysates and analyzed by luminometry according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). β-Galactosidase reactions were performed with the same lysates, and luciferase data were normalized to account for variations in transfection efficiency. NF-κB activation was calculated by dividing the relative light units measured after transfection with pGL2[2xNF-κB] by relative light units measured after transfection with pGL2. Transfections were done in triplicate, and the data shown are representative of at least three experiments. Eight hours after transfection of HEK293 cells or HEK293 ρ0 cells, the medium was changed, and 24 h after transfection the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) or in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 8.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Soluble and insoluble fractions of the lysates were separated as described above. The pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer. Twenty-five percent of the soluble fractions and the complete corresponding insoluble fractions were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and TRAF2 in the distinct samples was quantitated by Western blotting. For TRAF2 detection, a 1:5,000 dilution of a TRAF2-specific polyclonal rabbit Ab (C-20, Santa Cruz) was used as primary antibody. Primary Ab binding was detected using a 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Santa Cruz), followed by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Intracellular ROS generation was assessed using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes). Cells were plated on Petri dishes and incubated with 10 μm dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) under various conditions described in the text and figure legends. ROS in the cells cause oxidation of DCFH-DA, yielding the fluorescent product 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The DCF fluorescence was measured either in intact cells using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) or after lysing cells in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) in the supernatant of cell lysates, which had been centrifuged to remove debris, using a spectrofluorometer (excitation, 500 nm; emission, 530 nm). Data were normalized to values obtained from mock-treated controls. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells by lysing them in a hypotonic solution (10 mmKCl, 10 mm HEPES, protease mixture inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, freshly added) prior to centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Subsequently, the pellet was suspended in buffer containing 400 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.8. To perform electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the supernatant was diluted with two volumes of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 25% glycerol (v/v), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1.5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.8. DNA binding reactions were performed at room temperature in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of calf thymus DNA, 50,000 dpm labeled probe, 10% glycerol, and 5 μg of nuclear extracts in a volume of 25 μl at pH 7.8. The probe was labeled as described previously (22Chandel N.S. Trzyna W.C. McClintock D.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The specificity of NF-κB DNA binding activity was determined by supershift analysis with Ab specific for the p65 subunit of NF-κB. All reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. TNF-α has been shown previously to cause increased ROS levels in cells expressing TNFR at their cell surface (16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of TNF-α on the redox status of HEK293 cells, cells incubated with soluble human TNF-α and DCFH-DA were analyzed by FACS. DCFH-DA is a membrane-permeable fluorescent dye, which can be used to analyze intracellular ROS levels. DCFH becomes trapped inside cells after cleavage of its acetate groups by cellular esterases. DCFH-DA has been shown to become oxidized by nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide but is not directly oxidized by either superoxide or free hydroxyl radicals (23Rao K.M. Padmanabhan J. Kilby D.L. Cohen H.J. Currie M.S. Weinberg J.B. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 51: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). As shown previously, oxidization of DCFH-DA to DCF by intracellular ROS results in increased fluorescence of the dye, which can be detected by imaging methods described under “Experimental Procedures” (25Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work, analysis of epithelial HEK293 cells incubated with DCFH-DA and treated with TNF-α for 6 h revealed a small but significant increase of DCF fluorescence when compared with control cells cultured in the absence of TNF-α, indicating increased intracellular ROS levels in response to TNF-α (Fig. 1 A). To accurately quantify the changes in ROS levels caused by TNF-α, HEK293 cells were incubated with DCFH-DA, lysed, and analyzed by fluorometry. Compatible with the responses detected by FACS analysis, intracellular ROS levels determined by fluorometry were significantly elevated in the presence of TNF-α (Fig. 1 B). In all subsequent experiments, ROS levels of cell lysates were analyzed by fluorometry and changes in comparison to mock-treated samples are indicated. The higher affinity of soluble TNF-α for TNFR-I compared with TNFR-II and lack of detectable TNFR-II expression on HEK293 cells suggested a role of TNFR-I in regulating ROS levels of cells (8Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 26Pennica D. Lam V.T. Mize N.K. Weber R.F. Lewis M. Fendly B.M. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test if multimerization of TNFR-II could also trigger changes of intracellular ROS levels, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression constructs encoding human TNFR-II and TRAF2. Overexpression of TNFR-II and TRAF2 results in ligand-independent multimerization of TNFR-II on the cell surface and induces TRAF-mediated signaling events (8Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 27Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As seen after TNF-α-induced multimerization of endogenous TNFR, signaling induced by overexpressed TNFR-II and TRAF2, but not TRAF2 alone, also led to increased levels of intracellular ROS (Fig. 1 C). Incubation of HEK293 cells expressing endogenous TNFR-I and overexpressing TNFR-II with TNF-α resulted in an additional increase of intracellular ROS levels (data not shown). In contrast to TNFR-I, TNFR-II lacks a death domain in its cytoplasmic domain, and signaling triggered by TNFR-II is thought to promote cell activation and survival (28Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 83: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Other members of the TNFR subfamily lacking a death domain include CD30, Ox40 (CD134), and 4-1BB (CDw137) (1Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 113-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). To compare downstream events triggered by these TNFR-related proteins and to avoid differences in receptor-induced signaling caused by different affinities for their ligands, we utilized chimeric receptor molecules as described previously (9Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, we constructed chimeric receptors containing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of mouse CD28 and the cytoplasmic domains of TNFR-related molecules, such as CD30, 4-1BB, and Ox40. CD28 is expressed as dimer on the cell surface linked by a cysteine-cysteine bond in the extracellular domain of the monomeric receptor chains. As seen after engagement of full-length TNFR by their respective ligands, forced dimerization of the cytoplasmic tails of CD30, Ox40, and 4-1BB by fusion to the extracellular and transmembrane domain of CD28 results in signaling events, such as NF-κB activation (9Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct comparison of the cell surface expression levels of the distinct receptors by FACS using an antibody specific for the extracellular domain of CD28 showed similar transfection efficiencies and expression levels of all receptors independent of TRAF2 expression (Fig.2 A). As we have shown previously, signaling triggered by TNFR-related molecules causes intracellular redistribution of TRAF2, which leads to accumulation of TRAF2 in a detergent-insoluble fraction of cellular lysates. Despite similar expression levels, the distinct chimeric receptors caused significant quantitative differences in TRAF2 levels in detergent-soluble and -insoluble cellular fractions (27Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 936-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test if these constitutively active chimeric forms of these TNFR-related molecules have an effect on intracellular ROS levels, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding TRAF2 and either a tailless CD28 mutant as control or a chimeric CD28 molecule containing the cytoplasmic domains of CD30, 4-1BB, or Ox40. Although expression of TRAF2 in the absence of receptor signaling had no detectable effect on the cellular redox status, TRAF2-mediated signal transduction triggered by the cytoplasmic domains of CD28-CD30, CD28-Ox40, or CD28–4-1BB resulted in significantly increased intracellular ROS levels (Fig.2 B). Taken together, these findings suggest a role of ROS in TRAF-mediated signal transduction pathways downstream of TNFR-related proteins. The cytoplasmic domains of TNFR-II, CD30, 4-1BB, and Ox40 lack a death domain and, therefore, cannot interact with TRADD. However, all of these receptors can recruit TRAF proteins to their cytoplasmic domains (9Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gedrich R.W.

The HEK293 cells used for all our experiments did not contain any detectable levels of endogenous TRAF2 (Fig. 5 D, lanes 1 and3). TRAF2 overexpression in the absence of receptor signaling was not sufficient to induce an increase in ROS levels (Fig.2, B and C) or to trigger NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 B). Similar to results obtained with full-length TNFR-II (Fig. 1 C), co-expression of TRAF2 and chimeric mutants of CD28-CD30, CD28-Ox40, or CD28–4-1BB caused significantly increased ROS levels in cells (Fig. 2,B and C). Although sufficient to trigger NF-κB activation (9Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Duckett C.S. Gedrich R.W. Gilfillan M.C. Thompson C.B.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of constitutively active CD28 chimera of CD30, Ox40, or 4-1BB in the absence of exogenous TRAF2 did not result in detectable changes of intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 2, Band C). Although engagement of TNFR-I by TNF-α resulted in significantly increased ROS levels in the absence of exogenous TRAF in these cells (Fig. 1 B), changes of ROS levels by constitutively active CD28-CD30, CD28–4-1BB, and CD28-Ox40 were only detectable in the presence of exogenous TRAF2 (Fig. 2, B andC). The molecular differences responsible for this finding are currently under further investigation.Figure 3NF-κB-inducing kinase is not required for TRAF-mediated increase of intracellular ROS levels. Cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding TRAF2 and the indicated proteins: mock, CD28Δtail;CD30, chimeric CD28-CD30 receptor; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; NIKAA/KK, NIK mutant lacking kinase activity (33Malinin N.L.

A, 24 h after transfection of triplicate samples, changes of intracellular ROS were analyzed as described in Fig. 1 C. B, NF-κB activation was analyzed as described previously (9Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 1 million cells were transfected with expression constructs of TRAF2 and the indicated cDNAs as well as luciferase reporter constructs either lacking NF-κB binding sites in their promoter or containing two canonical NF-κB consensus binding sites. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega), and analyzed using the Promega luciferase kit according to the manufacturer's manual.

TRAF2DN lacks the RING finger structure and functions as dominant negative TRAF molecule, which interferes with TRAF-mediated signaling events in vitro and in vivo (8Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 9Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Duckett C.S.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Expression of TRAF2DN alone or in the presence of chimeric TNFR-related proteins had no effect on intracellular ROS levels (data not shown). Consistent with the inhibitory effect of TRAF2DN on NF-κB activation triggered by TNFR-related molecules, co-expression of TRAF2DN, TRAF2, and chimeric CD28-CD30, CD28–4-1BB, or CD28-Ox40 receptors resulted in a significantly decreased induction of intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, regulation of the cellular redox status by TNFR-related proteins is mediated, at least in part, by TRAF proteins and depends on the N-terminal Ring finger domain of the adapter protein, which is also critical for other TRAF-mediated signaling events. The interaction of NIK with TRAF2 has been suggested to result in activation of NIK and, subsequently, NF-κB (33Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). However, analysis of animals lacking a functional NIK, such as the alymphoplasia (aly) mouse and the NIK−/− mouse, indicates that NIK plays a role in chemokine signaling and immune functions of hematopoietic cells but is not essential for NF-κB activation triggered by TNF-α (34Shinkura R.

We observed a higher level of isotopic and mass cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages labeled with [3H]cholesterol/acetyl low density lipoprotein (where cholesterol accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes) compared with cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol with 10% fetal bovine serum, suggesting that late endosomes/lysosomes act as a preferential source of cholesterol for ABCA1-mediated efflux. Consistent with this idea, macrophages from Niemann-Pick C1 mice that have an inability to exit cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes showed a profound defect in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. In contrast, phospholipid efflux to apoA-I was normal in Niemann-Pick C1 macrophages, as was cholesterol efflux following plasma membrane cholesterol labeling.

Cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by HDL is thought to involve a “passive” process that may be diffusion-mediated or may involve an interaction of HDL with scavenger receptor B-I (SR-BI) (12Rothblat G.H.

Transfection of ABCA1 in 293 cells reveals a predominant cell surface localization and suggests a direct interaction of ABCA1 with apoA-I (11Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The primary activity of ABCA1 appears to be the translocation of phospholipid at the plasma membrane rather than direct interaction with cholesterol (15Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J.

Phospholipid-apoA-I complexes formed by ABCA1 may promote cholesterol efflux in a secondary fashion perhaps involving distinct areas of the plasma membrane (15Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R.

This may involve specific plasma membrane domains that derive cholesterol from intracellular stores. The nature of intracellular sites that potentially donate cholesterol to the plasma membrane for ABCA1-mediated efflux is also unclear. Niemann-Pick C (I and II) molecules play an essential role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking, particularly in the exit of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes (18Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E.

Earlier studies suggested a defect in cholesterol efflux to phospholipid vesicles in NPC1 fibroblasts (22Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), but the specific role of NPC1 in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux has not been investigated. The ABCA1 gene is up-regulated by cellular cholesterol loading (23Langmann T. Klucken J. Reil M. Liebisch G. Luciani M.F. Chimini G. Kaminski W.E. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this effect is increased gene transcription mediated by the oxysterol-activated transcription factor liver X receptor (LXR) acting in a complex with retinoid X receptor (RXR) at a site on the proximal promoter of the ABCA1 gene (24Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). While studying cholesterol efflux from macrophages that had been treated with the LXR/RXR ligands 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid to up-regulate ABCA1, we noticed a marked discrepancy between the magnitude of ABCA1 expression and the resulting stimulation of cholesterol efflux, depending on the method of cellular cholesterol labeling. This led to an investigation of the hypothesis that ABCA1 stimulates cholesterol efflux preferentially from a pool of cholesterol found in late endosomes/lysosomes. This hypothesis has been evaluated by comparing cholesterol efflux under different labeling conditions and supported by the demonstration of a profound defect in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I using macrophages from NPC1 mice. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to obtain a fragment of the murine ABCA1 cDNA. Murine ABCA1 and β-actin antisense riboprobes were prepared by in vitro transcription using murine ABCA1 β-actincDNA plasmid constructs. The protected hybrid fragments for ABCA1 and β-actin were 290 and 160 base pairs, respectively. Ribonuclease protection assay was performed as described (25Chen W. Silver D.L. Smith J.D. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30794-30800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μg of total RNA were hybridized with 5 × 105 cpm ABCA1 and β-actinriboprobes at 48 °C overnight in 30 μl of a buffer consisting of 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 80% formamide. The hybridization mixture was digested with 20 units of T2 ribonuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 5 μl of RNA loading buffer. The protected RNA hybrid fragments were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel and subjected to autoradiography. For immunoblot analysis of ABCA1, peritoneal macrophages were washed and scraped in PBS and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Postnuclear supernatants from cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples containing the indicated amounts of protein were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol in gel loading buffer, fractionated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using an anti-ABCA1 antiserum (Novus, Littleton, CO) and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, model 300A). Human low density lipoprotein (LDL, 1.006<d<1.063) and high density lipoprotein (HDL2, 1.063<d<1.125) were isolated from plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation. Acetyl LDL (AcLDL) was prepared as described (26Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) was purchased from Biodesign International (Saco, ME). Homozygous NPC1 were produced by intercrossing BALB/cNctr-npc1N/+(BALB-npc1N/+) mice (stock number 003092; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated from NPC1 and wild type (wt) littermates by peritoneal lavage with PBS 3 days after intraperitoneal injection with 1 ml of 3.85% thioglycollate (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). The isolated cells were plated onto 24-well plates and allowed to adhere by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies). After removal of nonadherent cells by washing with PBS, the cells were further incubated for 2 days and then used for cholesterol labeling and efflux experiments. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were labeled with [3H]cholesterol carried by one of three delivery agents to investigate cholesterol efflux from different pools: (a) AcLDL (late endosomes/lysosomes pool); (b) 10% FBS/DMEM (recycling endosomes pool); and (c) 5 mmmethyl-β-cyclodextrin (plasma membrane pool). For procedure a, cells were labeled overnight by 1 μCi/ml [1,2-3H(N)]-cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in DMEM, 0.2% BSA supplemented with 50 μg/ml AcLDL. LXR/RXR ligands 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (final concentration, 10 μm) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (final concentration, 10 μm) (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) were added during the labeling to induce ABCA1 expression. After the labeling, the cells were washed with PBS and equilibrated with DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 1 h. Efflux was then performed as described below. For procedure b, the cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in 0.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were then equilibrated overnight in DMEM, 0.2% BSA with or without the LXR/RXR ligands 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid. After washing, the cells were used for efflux experiments. For procedure c, the cells were first treated with the ligands 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid in DMEM, 0.2% BSA overnight to induce ABCA1. Then the medium was replaced by 5 mm methyl β-cyclodextrin:cholesterol at molar ration 8:1 ([3H]cholesterol, 1 μCi/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were used for efflux step. After labeling and equilibration, the cells were incubated by 10 μg/ml purified human apoA-I or 15 μg/ml human HDL2 in 0.5 ml of DMEM, 0.2% BSA with or without the LXR/RXR ligands for 4 h. Then medium was collected and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and cholesterol crystal, and radioactivity in an aliquot of supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were finally lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, 0.1% SDS and the radioactivity in an aliquot was determined. Cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percentage of the radioactivity released from the cells into the medium relative to the total radioactivity in cells and media. The cells in 6-well plates were [3H]cholesterol labeled by procedure a as described above. After 4 h of incubation with 10 μg/ml apoA-I (see Fig. 2) or 15 μg/ml human HDL2 (see Fig. 6), medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide and 0.1% SDS. Lipids were extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1). The organic residue was dissolved in 0.5% Triton X-100. Cholesterol was determined enzymatically (Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA).

To determine whether this resulted in an increase in functional ABCA1 protein, we measured cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in mouse peritoneal macrophages cells treated with the LXR/RXR ligands 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid. This treatment resulted in a marked up-regulation of ABCA1 mRNA (not shown) and protein levels (Fig.1 A) and an increase in cholesterol efflux (Fig. 1 B) as anticipated (27Venkateswaran A.

Surprisingly, the level of cholesterol efflux was about 2.5-fold higher in activated cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol AcLDL compared with cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS (Fig. 1 B, compare bars 4 and 2), despite comparable levels of ABCA1 expression (Fig. 1 A; note that ABCA1 protein appears as a doublet for unknown reason). AcLDL is internalized by the scavenger receptor A and accumulates primarily in late endosomes and lysosomes (28Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie J.E. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2001Google Scholar), whereas the [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS method appears to preferentially label recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (29Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These findings suggested the hypothesis that ABCA1 might preferentially stimulate cholesterol efflux from late endosomes/lysosomes rather than from cellular cholesterol pools labeled by [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS. To further explore this idea, cholesterol mass and isotopic efflux to apoA-I were measured in cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS, with [3H]cholesterol/AcLDL, or with [3H]cholesterol/cyclodextrin. In the latter procedure, the cells are labeled briefly (15 min) with cyclodextrin:cholesterol (8:1, molar ratio), and the radiolabel is thought to reside mostly in the plasma membrane (30Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Cruz J.C. Sugii S. C. Yu Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These experiments showed greater isotopic and mass efflux of cholesterol in activated cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol/AcLDL, compared with cells labeled in either of the other two ways (Fig. 2), consistent with the idea that the late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol pool is a preferential source for cholesterol efflux by ABCA1. Activation of LXR/RXR did result in a marked increase in isotopic and mass cholesterol efflux from cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol/cyclodextrin, suggesting that the plasma membrane cholesterol also contributes significantly to ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. However, for the [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS labeling method, isotopic efflux was only slightly increased by LXR/RXR activation, whereas cholesterol mass efflux was increased in a similar fashion to [3H]cholesterol/cyclodextrin-labeled cells. This finding could arise if the radiolabel was primarily present in pools of cholesterol inaccessible to ABCA1 (i.e.recycling endosomes) (29Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), whereas cholesterol mass efflux reflected efflux from the plasma membrane where cholesterol would be unlabeled by this method. To further explore the hypothesis that late endosomes/lysosomes represent a preferred source of cholesterol for ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, we next carried out efflux studies using macrophages from Niemann-Pick C1 mice, which have a defect in trafficking of cholesterol out of late endosomes (32Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cholesterol loading was carried out using [3H]cholesterol/AcLDL. Compared with macrophages from wild type mice, there was a profound decrease in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in NPC1 macrophages, especially following induction of ABCA1 (Fig.3 A). Measurements of ABCA1 mRNA and protein revealed similar levels of induction in control and NPC1 macrophages (not shown). In earlier studies, Liscum et al. (22Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) reported that human NPC1 fibroblasts had a moderate defect in cholesterol efflux to small unilamellar vesicles; this was manifested as a delay in cholesterol efflux that became normal following longer incubation periods. However, a time course study revealed a profound 3–4-fold decrease in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in NPC1 macrophages that was not ameliorated by prolonged incubation (Fig. 3 B). If ABCA1 preferentially stimulates cholesterol efflux from late endosomes/lysosomes, then it might be anticipated that there would be a less pronounced defect in cholesterol efflux in NPC1 cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS. Accordingly, using this labeling method, basal cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was similar in wild type and NPC1 cells, and efflux was only moderately decreased in NPC1 macrophages compared with wild type macrophages following LXR/RXR activation (Fig. 3 C). Following plasma membrane labeling with [3H]cholesterol/cyclodextrin, there were identical levels of cholesterol efflux in NPC1 and wild type cells (Fig. 3 D). These experiments suggest that both lysosomal and plasma membrane cholesterol pools serve as a source of cholesterol for ABCA1 and that the lysosomal pool requires the activity of the NPC1 molecule. ABCA1 is thought to act as a phospholipid flippase at the plasma membrane (15Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 16Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This activity may lead to the formation of phospholipid-apoA-I complexes that secondarily stimulate cholesterol efflux from a distinct region of plasma membrane (15Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 17Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We measured phospholipid efflux to apoA-I in NPC1 and wt macrophages. Phospholipid efflux was stimulated following activation of LXR/RXR, but there was no defect in phospholipid efflux in NPC1 cells (Fig.4). This indicates that the primary action of ABCA1, i.e. formation of phospholipid-apoA-I complexes, is intact in NPC1 cells. Cholesterol efflux to HDL2 was also significantly decreased in NPC1 cells loaded with [3H]cholesterol/AcLDL (Fig.5) or by the [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS method (not shown). Because HDL2 does not interact with ABCA1 (11Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), this indicates a defect in cholesterol efflux via pathways not mediated by ABCA1. Interestingly, cholesterol efflux via HDL2 was also induced by LXR/RXR activation (Fig. 5). This suggests the presence of other LXR/RXR target genes in the HDL2-mediated efflux pathway. Because apolipoprotein E (apoE) was recently identified as an LXR/RXR target (33Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J. Joseph S.B. Wilpitz D.C. Kast H.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that increased cholesterol efflux might be due to increased apoE synthesis by mouse peritoneal macrophages. However, LXR/RXR activation similarly increased cholesterol efflux to HDL2 in macrophages from apoE knock-out mice (not shown), eliminating this possibility. The ability of HDL2 to stimulate increased cholesterol efflux following LXR/RXR activation was also confirmed by cholesterol mass measurements, which indicated primarily an increase in HDL2 free cholesterol (Fig. 6). SR-BI neutralizing antibodies (34Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) did not affect cholesterol efflux mediated by HDL2 in either basal or LXR/RXR-stimulated conditions (not shown). Our findings suggest that phospholipid-apoA-I complexes formed by ABCA1 initially stimulate cholesterol efflux from regions of the plasma membrane that preferentially utilize cholesterol deposited by modified LDL in late endosomes/lysosomes rather than cholesterol deposited at other intracellular sites. The equilibration of cell surface cholesterol with these intracellular sites requires the activity of the NPC1 molecule and could perhaps also involve trafficking of the ABCA1 molecule itself (35Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). ABCA1 is markedly less efficient in stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells that have been labeled with [3H]cholesterol, 10% FBS, which probably primarily labels recycling endosomes (29Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). A profound defect in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in NPC1 mutant macrophages may be an important factor explaining our recent observations showing an increase of atherosclerosis in apoE knock-out/NPC1 mutant mice, compared with apoE knock-out control mice. 2N. Sharma, G. Kuriakose, D. Zhang, I. Tabas, R. J. Deckelbaum, A. R. Tall, and C. L. Welch, submitted for publication. Massive cholesteryl ester accumulation in TD macrophages indicates that ABCA1 has an essential role in mediating cholesterol efflux from these cells. It is likely that cholesterol from a variety of sources, including effete red cells and modified forms of LDL, is taken up by macrophages eventuating in delivery to late endosomes/lysosomes. Our studies are consistent with the idea that apoA-I/ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux plays an essential role in removing cholesterol from these intracellular sites. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. Intracellular trafficking of apoA-I has been reported in macrophages, and this process appears to be defective in TD (36Schmitz G. Assmann G. Robenek H. Brennhausen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The trafficking of apoA-I has been suggested to have a role in mediating cholesterol efflux (37Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies using fluorescence confocal microscopy have revealed trafficking of ABCA1 itself between the cell surface and intracellular sites including late endosomes/lysosomes but not recycling endosomes (35Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that apoA-I bound to ABCA1 trafficks directly to late endosomes/lysosomes and somehow mediates cholesterol efflux from these sites. However, it is notable that ABCA1 effectively stimulates efflux of plasma membrane cholesterol, as deduced from a recently developed plasma membrane labeling procedure (30Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Cruz J.C. Sugii S. C. Yu Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and that this process is normal in NPC1 mutant macrophages (Fig. 3 D). Moreover, phospholipid efflux to apoA-I is unaffected in NPC1 mutant cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that trafficking of ABCA1 to late endosomes/lysosomes is not required for formation of phospholipid-apoA-I complexes. An alternative explanation is that phospholipid-apoA-I complexes are formed by ABCA1 at the cell surface and that these complexes then stimulate cholesterol efflux from specialized regions of the plasma membrane that preferentially obtain cholesterol from intracellular sources derived from late endosomes/lysosomes rather than recycling endosomes. We propose a model in which cholesterol trafficks from late endosomes/lysosomes to the trans-Golgi in a process requiring the activity of NPC1 (38Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 39Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E37-E38Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Once cholesterol has arrived in the Golgi, it may be formed into cholesterol/sphingolipid complexes, which give rise to cell surface cholesterol-enriched microdomains or rafts. These plasma membrane domains could then act as a preferential source of cholesterol for ABCA1-mediated efflux. This could explain why mass and isotopic efflux following AcLDL labeling is even greater than following general plasma membrane labeling with cyclodextrin. This model is not necessarily inconsistent with recent data, suggesting that ABCA1 stimulates cholesterol efflux from non-raft regions of the plasma membrane (41Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), because there could be several different types of cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the plasma membrane. Following entry of lipoprotein cholesterol into late endosomes and lysosomes, NPC1 has an essential role in allowing cholesterol to gain access to the ABCA1 efflux pool (Fig. 3). Liscum et al. (22Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) reported a delay in cholesterol efflux to unilamellar vesicles in fibroblasts from NPC1 patients. However, with time the efflux became normal. In contrast, the apoA-I stimulated cholesterol efflux in NPC1 mutant mouse macrophages was profoundly reduced at all time points (Fig. 3 B). Recently, it has been shown that following labeling of NPC1 mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells with3H-cholesteryl ester LDL, early time points of cholesterol efflux to cyclodextrin show no or little defect (31Cruz J.C. Sugii S. C. Yu Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 42Cruz J.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, after the initial appearance at the plasma membrane and subsequent internalization to an intracellular pool, cholesterol shows delayed trafficking back to the plasma membrane and poor activation of acyl-CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase in (ACAT) NPC1 mutant cells. This has led to the proposal that NPC1 acts on an intracellular pool of cholesterol that is derived from the plasma membrane and is in equilibrium with ACAT. Whether NPC1 is acting in late endosomes/lysosomes (43Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), our studies suggest that this pool of cholesterol represents an important source of cholesterol for ABCA1-stimulated efflux. Recently, Leventhal et al. (45Leventhal, A. R., Chen, W., Tall, A. R., and Tabas, I. (2001)J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar) have found a defect in basal cholesterol efflux to apoA-I in acid sphingomyelinase-deficient macrophages. These studies suggest that endososomal/lysosomal sphingomyelin accumulation leads to cholesterol sequestration and, thus, defective cholesterol trafficking and efflux. The present findings extend these observations by providing direct evidence that the late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol pool represents the preferred source of cholesterol for ABCA1-mediated efflux. Also, consistent with the present findings, Kojima et al. (46Kojima K. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Murakami I. Suzumori K. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) recently reported that progesterone suppressed apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid release in human fibroblasts. Progesterone has been reported to sequester cholesterol in lysosomes and block cholesterol trafficking to plasma membrane similar to the effects of the NPC1 mutation (47Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Patterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23797-23805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these earlier studies (45Leventhal, A. R., Chen, W., Tall, A. R., and Tabas, I. (2001)J. Biol. Chem., in press.Google Scholar, 46Kojima K. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Murakami I. Suzumori K. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys.

Our findings that NPC1 mutant macrophages have a prominent defect in cholesterol efflux from the late endosomal/lysosomal pool but only a moderate decrease in efflux from recycling endosomal pool (Fig. 3,A and C) may explain some earlier in vivo work showing that de novo synthesized cholesterol or cholesterol entering cells through the HDL/SR-BI pathway can be metabolized and excreted normally, whereas LDL-derived cholesterol becomes sequestered in the lysosomal compartment and is metabolically inactive in NPC1 mutant mice (48Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1278-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Labeling of cholesterol by DMEM, 10% FBS might mimic more closely the trafficking of de novo synthesized cholesterol or cholesterol derived from the HDL/SR-BI pathway, whereas labeling by AcLDL is similar to LDL cholesterol trafficking to lysosomes. The HDL2-mediated cholesterol efflux pathway, distinct from that mediated by ABCA1 (12Rothblat G.H. Mahlberg F.H. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1091-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), was also defective in NPC1 cells. An intriguing, unexpected observation was the finding that macrophage cholesterol efflux to HDL2 was increased by treatment with LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 5), suggesting a novel efflux process unrelated to ABCA1, SR-BI, or apoE. The mechanism of HDL2-mediated cholesterol efflux appears quite distinct from apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux. Thus, apoA-I binds and interacts with ABCA1 to mediate cholesterol efflux, whereas HDL2 is inactive in this regard (11Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). HDL can stimulate cholesterol efflux by interacting with SR-BI (13Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y.

Tall, unpublished data. and SR-BI neutralizing antibodies had no effect on the LXR/RXR-induced cholesterol efflux to HDL2. These findings suggest that there is a novel molecular target of LXR/RXR activation in the cholesterol efflux pathway to HDL2. This may well have physiological importance because differences in overall HDL levels between different subjects, such as male/female differences, are primarily due to different HDL2 levels, whereas HDL3 levels are relatively constant in the population (51Tall A.R.

We found that expression of wild-type p21 (p21WT), not mutant p21 (p21PCNA−) lacking the interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), caused G2 cell cycle arrest in p53-deficient DLD1 colon cancer cell line after the DNA damage by treatment with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II). We also found that p21WT was associated with Cdc2/cyclin B1 together with PCNA. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PCNA interacted with Cdc25C at the G2/M transition, and this interaction was abolished when p21WTwas expressed presumably due to the competition between p21WT and Cdc25C in the binding to PCNA.

The fidelity of genomic replication during DNA synthesis and cell division is ensured by checkpoint controls that prevent cell cycle progression when the DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication is detected (1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). Thus, checkpoint loss would result in genomic instability and has been implicated in carcinogenesis (2Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In fact, the p53 tumor suppressor gene, a major gatekeeper of cell cycle checkpoints, is mutated in a large fraction of human cancers (3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6712) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest in G1 caused by DNA damage or cellular senescence is mediated by p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, that is under the transcriptional control of p53 (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although cells deficient in p21 proliferate normally, they are unable to maintain stable G2 arrest and initiate cell death program when exposed to DNA-damaging agents such as irradiation and anti-cancer drugs (5Bunz F.

For example, p21 mRNA in human fibroblasts show bimodal periodicity with peaks in G1 and G2/M (7Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar) and that p21 protein reaccumulates in the nucleus at the onset of mitosis (8Dulic V. Stein G.H. Far D.F. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell.

The role of PCNA in cell cycle regulation is suggested by the fact that polymerase δ is regulated by cell cycle proteins (17Hindges R. Hubscher U. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 345-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, PCNA was shown to interact with various Cdk-cyclin complexes (11Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 16Prosperi E. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Szepesi A. Gelfand E.W. Lucas J.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PCNA may act as a platform for multiple protein-protein interactions involved in replication, repair, recombination, and cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, the PCNA protein levels increased steadily through the entire cell cycle period and remained high at G2/M (19Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Thus, PCNA may also be involved in G2 cell cycle control. The G2 checkpoint has been extensively studied in the fission yeast and is known to involve a number of proteins including Cdc2/cyclin B, Cdc25, 14-2-3, Wee1, Chk1, Cds1/Rad53, and DNA damage sensor proteins (20Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 91: 865-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 21Russell P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 399-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, Cdc25, a dual phosphatase for Cdc2, plays a central role in the G2checkpoint by controlling the phosphorylation status, thus its kinase activity, of Cdc2 (22Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 23Russell P. Nurse P.

In human cells, there are three Cdc25 homologues, Cdc25A, -B, and -C (25Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-968PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sadhu K. Reed S.I.

Because the activity of Cdc25C is induced at the onset of mitosis and regulates Cdc2/cyclin B1, it is regarded as a major regulator of the G2 checkpoint, besides the fact that Cdc25C has the highest homology with the yeast Cdc25. Cdc2 is subject to multiple levels of regulation including periodic association with cyclin B, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation (35Moreno S. Hayles J. Nurse P.

Wee1 is activated by upstream kinases, Chk1 or Cds1 (45Boddy M.N. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Science. 1998; 280: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 46O'Connell M.J.

However, a small amount of Cdc25 was shown to reside in the nucleus at interphase, and moreover, most of Cdc25 stays in the nucleus throughout cell cycle in some cells (46O'Connell M.J. Raleigh J.M. Verkade H.M. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 47Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, an additional mechanism is required to ensure the inactivation of Cdc2-cyclin B complex by preventing coincidental contacts with Cdc25. In this study, we attempted to examine the role of p21 in G2/M transition particularly in G2 DNA damage checkpoint by utilizing the p53-deficient human colon cancer cell lines inducibly expressing the wild-type or the mutant p21PCNA−lacking the interaction with PCNA. We demonstrate evidence that p21PCNA− cannot confer cell cycle arrest at G2upon DNA damage, and we suggest that the p21 may interfere with the interaction between PCNA and Cdc25 thus preventing Cdc25 from the activation of Cdc2. The possible role of PCNA as a platform for regulatory protein-protein interactions for the cell cycle regulation is discussed. Most of the chemicals including hygromycin, tetracycline, and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP) were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-HA (F-7), anti-PCNA (PC-10), anti-cyclin B1 (GNS1), anti-Cdc2 p34 (clone 17), anti-Cdk7 (C-14), and anti-cyclin H (FL-323) mouse monoclonal antibodies and anti-Cdc25C rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Biotin-conjugated anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from PharMingen (San Jose, CA). Secondary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Parental DLD1 human colon carcinoma cell line constitutively expresses very low levels of endogenous p21 because of mutations of both alleles of p53 (p53−/−) (60Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). DLD1 cell lines containing exogenous genes for wild-type (WT) or mutant (PCNA−) p21 proteins tagged with HA epitope were as described (9Cayrol C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The p21PCNA− mutant contains amino acid substitutions (M147A, D149A, and F150A) to abolish the interaction with PCNA specifically. Expression of p21 in these cells is under the tight control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter and can be induced by eliminating tetracycline (Tet) from the culture medium (“Tet-OFF” system). These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (IBL, Maebashi, Japan), 4 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 μg/ml tetracycline in a 5% CO2 incubator. Subcloning of these cell lines was repeatedly done in selective medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Western blotting and flow cytometry was performed to ensure that ∼90% of the cells expressed p21 when tetracycline was eliminated. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity to CDDP among parental DLD1, DLD1 p21WT, and DLD1PCNA−cells. Expression of p21 and cell cycle analysis were performed by flow cytometry with FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) with the program CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson) (61Kobayashi K. Matsumoto S. Morishima T. Kawabe T. Okamoto T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3978-3984PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of p21 protein expression, DLD1 cells (5 × 106) were trypsinized, washed with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, resuspended in TPBS (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (F-7) for 60 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 0.5 μg/ml ribonuclease A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were then washed three times with TPBS, stained with propidium iodide (Sigma), and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TPBS containing 200 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI). The cell cycle status of the cells was determined as described previously (24Suganuma M. Kawabe T. Hori H. Funabiki T. Okamoto T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5887-5891PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were collected, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in Krisham's solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 50 μg/ml PI, 20 μg/ml ribonuclease A, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40) prior to flow cytometric analysis. DLD1 cells (2 × 106) were collected, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μm okadaic acid, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) according to the method described previously (62Uranishi H. Tetsuka T. Yamashita M. Asamitsu K. Shimizu M. Itoh M. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13395-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with either biotin-conjugated anti-PCNA antibody or anti-HA antibody (for detecting p21) for immunoprecipitation at 4 °C for 1.5 h with gentle rotation. Twenty μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and further incubated for 1 h. The beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Antibody-bound complexes were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked in TPBS including 2% non-fat milk 4 °C overnight, probed with various primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with TPBS, and probed with the secondary antibody for 40 min at room temperature. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal; Pierce). Repeated subcloning of cells, DLD1 p21WT and DLD1 p21PCNA−, was carried out to enrich cell lines conditionally expressing wild-type or mutant (PCNA−; in which the PCNA-interacting amino acid residues were mutated) p21, respectively. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, levels of p21 protein expression in these cells were virtually null in the presence of tetracycline but became readily detectable when tetracycline was eliminated from the culture medium. In Fig.1 B, cells were fixed and p21 expression was examined by flow cytometry. Upon induction, p21 protein expression was detected in 94% of DLD1p21WT and in 87% of DLD1p21PCNA−cells. Fig. 1 C demonstrates the effects of the p21 expression on cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by flow cytometry. In the absence of p21 expression, the cell cycle distribution was similar for both cell lines. For example, in DLD1p21WT ∼49.3, 15.0, and 35.7% of cells were in G1, S, and G2phases, respectively (Fig. 1 C). When p21WTexpression was induced in DLD1 cells, a striking decrease in the number of cells in S phase (1.8%) was observed, whereas the majority of cells accumulated at G1 (39.6%) or G2/M (58.6%). On the other hand, p21PCNA− expression did not significantly change the cell distribution (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). These findings confirmed those by Cayrol et al. (9Cayrol C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) that p21 was involved in the cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2/M through binding to PCNA. To examine the effects of p21 expression on the DNA damage-induced G2 cell cycle arrest, DLD1 p21WTand DLD1 p21PCNA− cells were treated with CDDP (12 μg/ml) for 1 h, and p21 proteins were induced by removing Tet, and the cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2 A, because most of the cells were accumulated at G2/M 48–72 h after the DNA damage induced by CDDP, we induced p21 expression by Tet withdrawal (“− Tet”) at 48 h after the CDDP treatment. Cells not expressing p21 or expressing p21 mutant progressed into G1, and significant numbers of cells underwent cell death (detected as cells in sub-G1). Fig. 2 B indicates that 48 h after the DNA damage ∼74% of cells expressing p21WTentered G2/M, and these cells remained in G2/M at 120 h. On the other hand, cells not expressing p21 or expressing p21 mutant immediately progressed into G1. For example, although ∼87% of DLD1 cells expressing p21PCNA− entered G2/M at 48 h after the DNA damage, only 50% of the cells were detected at G2/M at 120 h. Similar observations were obtained with cells not expressing p21. These observations indicate that p21 is involved in the DNA damage-induced G2 cell cycle arrest and that the ability of p21 to bind PCNA is crucial. It is known that p21 not only inhibits Cdk4/cyclin D1 and Cdk6/cyclin D2 in G1checkpoint but also inhibits Cdc2/cyclin B1 during the G2/M transition at least in vitro (63Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). We then examined if p21 associates with PCNA at the G2/M transition together with Cdc2/cyclin B1. In Fig. 3, DLD1 cells were treated with CDDP for 1 h, and expression of either wild type (p21WT) or mutant (p21PCNA−) was induced at 48 h after the DNA damage. The interaction of p21 with the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex and PCNA at the DNA damage G2checkpoint was examined by immunoprecipitation (with anti-HA antibody detecting p21WT and p21PCNA−) followed by Western blotting (with antibodies to PCNA, cyclin B1, and Cdc2). As demonstrated in Fig. 3 B (left panel), p21WT coimmunoprecipitated PCNA, Cdc2, and cyclin B1 when cells were arrested at G2/M transition due to CDDP-induced DNA damage, indicating the formation of p21WT-PCNA-Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex in cells arrested at G2/M. Interestingly, although Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex interacts with p21PCNA− at the G2/M transition (72 h after DNA damage) (Fig. 3, right panel), cells could not maintain the G2/M arrest (Fig. 2 B). In these cells, cyclin B1 was proteolytically degraded and cells entered M and then progressed to G1 (120 h after DNA damage) (Fig.3 B, right panel). These findings suggest that in order for p21 to induce the cell cycle arrest at G2 in response to DNA damage, the interaction of p21 with PCNA is crucial. Because p21 was previously shown to inhibit CAK-mediated Cdc2 phosphorylation and promote cell cycle arrest at G2/M (10Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Vallenius T. Rijksen G. Makela T.P. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30638-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we also examined the interaction of p21 with cyclin H and Cdk7 (CAK). However, neither cyclin H nor Cdk7 was coimmunoprecipitated with p21 (Fig.3 B). During the cell cycle interphase, Wee1HU inactivates Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex by phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr-15 (64Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), which is subsequently activated by Cdc25 through dephosphorylation at Tyr-15 when cells enter mitosis (65King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that, in human cells, the Cdc25C-mediated activation of Cdc2/cyclin B1 would occur at the nascent DNA following the completion of DNA synthesis or DNA repair, and actions of p21 and Cdc25C would be exclusive. We then examined whether Cdc25C associates with PCNA in the absence of p21, and the PCNA binding of p21 and that of Cdc25C are mutually exclusive (Fig.4). This possibility was also prompted by a previous report by Saha et al. (66Saha P. Eichbaum Q. Silberman E.D. Mayer B.J. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4338-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that p21 and Cdc25A competitively bind to Cdk2 presumably at the G1-S transition. In Fig. 4, DNA damage was induced in DLD1 cells, and expression of either wild type (p21WT) or mutant (p21PCNA−) was induced as in Fig. 3. The cell lysate was analyzed for the protein-protein interaction by immunoprecipitation (with anti-PCNA antibody) followed by Western blotting to detect the PCNA-associated p21 and Cdc25C. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 (left panel), Cdc25C was detected in the PCNA complex when p21 was not induced (+ Tet). Cdc25C was coimmunoprecipitated with PCNA in the absence of DNA damage, i.e. in the absence of p21 (data not shown). In the presence of p21WT, PCNA coimmunoprecipitated p21WT but not Cdc25C. However, when p21PCNA−was expressed, PCNA coimmunoprecipitated Cdc25C irrespective of the presence of p21PCNA−, indicating that p21 and Cdc25C interact with the same region of PCNA. We have explored the role of p21 in the G2 DNA damage checkpoint using p53-deficient cells in which p21WT or p21PCNA− was complemented. Our findings clearly indicate the crucial role of p21 in the G2 checkpoint upon DNA damage and that the interaction of p21 with Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex is mediated by PCNA. We assume that the p21-PCNA interaction is probably required for recognition of the repaired DNA. Because the p21-PCNA interaction appeared to be mutually exclusive with the Cdc25C-PCNA interaction at G2/M transition, p21 may prevent the incorporation of Cdc25C into the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex and thus induce cell cycle arrest at G2. In fact, the formation of ternary complex involving p21, PCNA, and Cdc2/cyclin B1 at G2 was previously demonstrated (7Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y.

Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) independently showed the formation of p21-Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex and inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity at G2. Moreover, we observed that cells failed to arrest at G2/M because of the absence of functional p21 and underwent cell death (Fig. 2). In agreement with this finding, Bunz et al. (5Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) demonstrated with cells defective for p53 or p21 genes that γ-irradiation induced cell death associated with the lack of cytokinesis after entering into M phase, again indicating the crucial importance of p21 for the maintenance of the G2/M arrest. Expression of p21 is transcriptionally regulated by p53 upon DNA damage or cellular senescence and is known to induce cell cycle arrest at G2 as well as at G1 by inhibiting Cdc2 (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar, 68Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to the binding with Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex, p21 is also shown to bind PCNA (70Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). PCNA acts as an auxiliary factor for DNA polymerase δ and stimulates DNA replication (71Kelman Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). It was shown that p21 inhibited PCNA-dependent DNA replication in vitro by binding to PCNA through its PCNA-interacting region (11Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar,12Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 72Waga S.

Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We found that DLD1 p21PCNA−, expressing a mutant p21 defective for the interaction with PCNA, could not arrest at G2/M checkpoint even after DNA damage (Fig. 2). Thus, it is possible that, through the interacting with PCNA, p21 inhibits DNA synthesis and maintains G2/M arrest. These findings also suggest an important role for PCNA as a platform for the interaction of various cell cycle regulator proteins that occur adjacently to the nascent DNA or the repaired DNA. Among these proteins, p21, Fen1 (flap endonuclease 1), and xeroderma pigmentosum G are known to contain similar sequences (called PIP box) that interact with PCNA (74Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It was shown that Fen1 and p21 compete for binding to the same site of PCNA (75Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similarly, xeroderma pigmentosum G and p21 were shown to compete for the PCNA binding at least in vitro(76Gary R. Ludwig D.L. Cornelius H.L. MacInnes M.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24522-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We also found a similar PCNA-binding motif in Cdc25C (Fig.5 A). It is thus conceivable that competitive binding among PCNA-interacting proteins plays an important role in the coordinated DNA replication and repair. Although further studies are needed, it is likely that p21 inhibits cell cycle progression to mitosis by regulating the Cdc25C interaction with the Cdc2/cyclin B1 (Fig. 5 B). Considering that fact that PCNA forms a stable homotrimer when it binds to DNA upon DNA synthesis and possibly DNA repair, it remains to be clarified whether these protein-protein interactions with PCNA can occur concomitantly to some extent or are mutually exclusive."

However, the relationship between its accumulation and pathogenesis is still unclear. Recently, we reported that overexpression of α-synuclein affects Elk-1 phosphorylation in cultured cells, which is mainly performed by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). We further examined the relationship between MAPK signaling and the effects of α-synuclein expression on ecdysone-inducible neuro2a cell lines and found that cells expressing α-synuclein had less phosphorylated MAPKs. Moreover, they showed significant cell death when the concentration of serum in the culture medium was reduced. Under normal serum conditions, the addition of the MAPK inhibitor U0126 also caused cell death in α-synuclein-expressing cells. Transfection of constitutively active MEK-1 resulted in MAPK phosphorylation in α-synuclein-expressing cells and improved cell viability even under reduced serum conditions. Thus, we conclude that α-synuclein regulates the MAPK pathway by reducing the amount of available active MAPK. Our findings suggest a mechanism for pathogenesis and thus offer therapeutic insight into synucleinopathies.

It has seven incomplete repeats of 11 amino acids with a core of KTKEGV at the amino terminus, whereas the carboxyl terminus has no known structural elements. Although its function is still unclear, there is accumulating evidence that α-synuclein is the main structural component of the insoluble filaments that form the Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease (PD)1 as well as those of dementia with Lewy bodies (2Baba M.

Protein aggregation and filament formation are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. the neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease and the neuronal intranuclear inclusions observed in polyglutamine diseases). The formation of these disease-specific amyloid structures is thought to play certain roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (7Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Thus, α-synuclein might play an important role in PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and MSA, which are all classified as synucleinopathies (8Dickson D.W. Lin W. Liu W.K. Yen S.H. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Galvin J.E. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Arch. Neurol. 2001; 58: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Although most cases of these diseases are sporadic and do not involve mutations in the α-synuclein gene, it has been shown that A30P and A53T mutations in the α-synuclein gene can cause a rare familial form of Parkinson's disease (10Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M.

Thus, the features of these mutant gene products might differ from wild type (WT) α-synuclein. In vitro generated α-synuclein, especially that of the A53T mutant, forms aggregates under certain conditions in a nucleation-dependent manner (12Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J.

Aggregate formation has been attributed to a unique sequence within α-synuclein that is not shared by its homologues β-synuclein and γ-synuclein (17Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have shown that mice and flies made to overexpress α-synuclein within their neurons develop a neurological disorder that mimics Parkinson's disease (18Masliah E. Rockenstein E.

These findings give rise to the idea that, in synucleinopathies, abnormal mitochondrial stress might lead to cell death. Although knowledge about the aggregate formation of α-synuclein is accumulating, its exact function is still unknown. It has been reported that α-synuclein shares a functional homology with 14-3-3 protein and binds to MAPK (26Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also reported that α-synuclein directly binds ERK2 and forms a complex with Elk-1, which is also an ERK2 substrate (27Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further analyze the functional relationship between α-synuclein and MAPKs, we generated inducible stable cell lines of α-synuclein and studied their properties. In the present study, we report that α-synuclein inhibits MAPK signaling and accelerates cell death following serum reduction. Moreover, this phenomenon can be partially reversed by the introduction of constitutively active MEK-1. All reagents and chemicals were purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), except as otherwise noted. All experiments were done at least three times unless otherwise noted. All statistical analysis was performed using Stat View J5.0, and significances were determined by the Bonferroni/Dunn test. α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein cDNA were amplified from the human cDNA library. Known human mutations of α-synuclein were generated using polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: A30P sense (5′-ctcttttgtctttcctggtgcttctgccacaccctg-3′) and antisense (5′-cagggtgtggcagaagcaccaggaaagacaaaagag-3′) and A53T sense (5′-ggagtggtgcatggtgtgacaacagtggctgagaag-3′) and antisense (5′-cttctcagccactgttgtcacaccatgcaccactcc-3′). Truncated α-synucleins were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: N (1–74) forward (5′-gaagctagcaccatggtggctgctgctgagaaaacc-3′) and reverse (5′-gtacgtcgacttacacacccgtcaccactgctcc-3′) and C (78) forward (5′-gaagctagcaccatggcccagaagacagtggagggga-3′) and reverse (5′-gtacgtcgacttaggcttcaggttcgtagtcttgataccc-3′). Mouse ERK2 cDNA was obtained from the RIKEN gene bank (Wako-shi, Saitama, Japan). The mouse constitutively active MEK-1 mutant (S218D,S221D) cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Goto (University of Tokyo). For mammalian cell expression, α-, β-, and γ-synuclein were subcloned into a pCI vector (Promega, Madison, WI) or a pIND (SP1)-hygro vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Constitutively active MEK-1 was subcloned to pcDNA4/Myc-His (Invitrogen). For recombinant protein generation, ERK2 was subcloned to pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). neuro2a and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) plus 10% adult bovine serum (BIO Whittaker, Walkersville, MD) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For generation of stable cell lines, neuro2a cells were co-transfected with pVgRXR (Invitrogen) and a pIND (Sp1)-hygro vector containing wild type, A30P mutant, or A53T mutant α-synuclein and selected in 100 μg/ml of zeocin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) and 25 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Clones showing the highest level of α-synuclein expression and the tightest regulation by immunoblot analysis were chosen for further study. Clones were named Nmock, Nwt, NA30P, and NA53T, following transfection of their cDNAs. Each experiment was done with several clones to confirm the results. For cDNA transfection, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 3 μl of Transfast reagent (Promega)/1 × 104 cells suspended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). After 1 h of incubation, medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the appropriate concentration of serum. To evaluate cell viability, cells were grown under 0.5% serum-reduced conditions for an indicated length of time. MC36 antibodies were generated by injecting the α-synuclein-specific sequence, MPVDPSSEAYEMPSE peptide, into rabbits and through affinity purification using a peptide-bound column. Cultured cells, plated onto a Lab-TEK chamber slide 2 well (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL), were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and followed by permeabilization with 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Chamber slides were then incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and incubated overnight with primary antibody MC36 diluted in PBS (1:1000) at 4 °C. The slides were then washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa flour 488 anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) diluted in PBS (1:500). The slides were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS with 10 mm n-propyl gallate and observed using an Olympus SV-300 confocal microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were lysed with PBS containing Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 20 mmNa3VO4, and 10 mm NaF. For SDS-PAGE, protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). 40 μg/lane was run on a 5/20% gradient or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in 5% skim milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), washed, and incubated overnight with primary antibody (anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-SAPK/JNK, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK, anti-MEK-1/2, anti-phospho-MEK-1/2, anti-phospho-MKK-3/6, anti-phospho-SEK-1 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-calcineurin (1:1000) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, NY), anti-β-actin (1:5000) (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), anti-GST (1:5000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), anti-SAPK/JNK (1:1000) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), anti-c-FOS (1:1000) (Geneka Biotechnology, Montréal, Québec, Canada), anti-β-synuclein, anti-γ-synuclein (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-α-synuclein (N-19) (1:1000), anti-MKP-1 (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or MC36 diluted in TBST (1:3000)). Following this, the membrane was washed, incubated for 1 h in 1:3000 peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBST, washed, and visualized using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subconfluent Nmock, Nwt, NA30P, and NA53T cells in 9-cm culture plates, induced with 1 μmponasterone A (Invitrogen) over 48 h, were harvested, washed once with PBS, and lysed on ice for 30 min with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1% Triton X-100). The lysate was then centrifuged (20,000 ×g, 15 min), and the supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.) bound with 3 μl of preimmune serum or 1 μg of S1 antibody (27Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 10 μl of protein G. Then the supernatant was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Each sample was then washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, washed once with PBS, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Cells incubated with 1 μm of ponasterone A for 48 h were grown in 1% serum for 8 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Peprotech EC, London, United Kingdom), 10 μg/ml anisomycin, or 20 J/m2 of UV exposure using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For immunoblot of the phosphorylated proteins and RNA preparation, cells were harvested after 15 min of stimulation. For immunoblot of the c-Fos protein, cells were harvested after 1 h of stimulation. BL21 (DE3) pLysS containing pGEX-6P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and pGEX-6P α-synuclein (wild type) were cultured and induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed and sonicated and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the supernatant, which was then washed three times with HNTG buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete). Then 10 μl of either GST or GST α-synuclein-bound beads was added to ∼10% of the cell lysate from subconfluent neuro2a cells within the 9-cm cultured plate for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were then washed three times with HNTG buffer and once with PBS and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and followed and immunoblotted. 100 ng of recombinant GST-ERK2, generated by inducing BL21 cells containing pGEX6P ERK2, was incubated with 40 μg of cell lysate from Nmock, or NA53T cells at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP). Its aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using a TACS apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), as described by the manufacturer. DNA ladder was detected by following a previously outlined protocol (28Ishizawa M. Kobayashi Y. Miyamura T. Matsuura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). MTT assay was performed following the standard method (29Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46516) Google Scholar). 2 × 104 cells grown in 500 μl of medium were added to 50 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT and incubated for 4 h. After incubation, 500 μl of 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol was added and mixed, and the OD at 570 nm was measured using an ARVO 1420 multilabel counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). 50 μg of the total RNA obtained from Nmock, Nwt, NA30P and A53T cells using Trizol (Life Technologies), was run on 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia). The membrane was then probed with a digoxigenin-labeled (digoxigenin high prime DNA labeling kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) c-fos (exon 4 probe digested with AccI and AvaI) or 18 S RNA probe and visualized by chemiluminescence as indicated by the manufacturer. First we investigated whether the overexpression of α-synuclein affects cell viability in neuro2a cells. Cells were transfected with WT α-synuclein and both of the α-synuclein mutants (A30P and A53T). MTT assays were performed after 48 h of transfection. As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, the transient overexpression of WT, A30P mutant, and A53T mutant α-synuclein in transfected cells in 10% serum significantly reduced cell viability. To examine whether this phenomenon was specific to neuro2a cells, we performed a similar experiment with human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. However, HEK293 cells did not show a change in cell viability with α-synuclein transfection (data not shown). To confirm that the reduction of cell viability was not simply due to an overexpression of the proteins, we transfected the α-synuclein N-terminal fragment, the C-terminal fragment, the β-synuclein, and the γ-synuclein to observe the effects. N-terminal α-synuclein and γ-synuclein transfection significantly reduced cell viability, whereas transfection of C-terminal α-synuclein and β-synuclein had no effect on cell viability (Fig. 1, C and D). To further investigate the mechanism by which decreased cell viability results from α-synuclein expression, we constructed stable neuro2a cell lines with an ecdysone-inducible system. Cells were stably co-transfected with a pVgRXR and pIND (Sp1)-hygro vector containing WT, A30P mutant, and A53T mutant α-synuclein. The cells became capable of expressing α-synuclein upon the addition of ponasterone A to their culture medium. Fig.2 A shows the expression patterns of α-synuclein in ponasterone A-treated cells. Each α-synuclein-carrying clone showed a similar expression pattern after being induced. Expression of α-synuclein was detected after 24 h of induction with 1 μm of ponasterone A and increased with time. However, cells that were not induced also expressed a small amount of α-synuclein due to leakage (Fig. 2 B). α-Synuclein expression was observed by immunocytochemistry (Fig.2 C). We then measured the cell viability of these cell lines by MTT assay. Cells grown in 10% serum did not show a significant difference in cell viability upon the addition of 1 μm ponasterone A (Fig.3 A). However, when grown in 0.5% serum, the viability of cells expressing α-synuclein was significantly reduced, as judged by the MTT assay, with 1 μm ponasterone A treatment (Fig. 3 B). Under serum-reduced conditions, the ratio of surviving cells was determined by trypan blue staining, and significant cell death was observed (Fig.3 C). TUNEL staining also showed a significant increase in TUNEL-positive α-synuclein-expressing cells (Fig. 3, D andE). DNA extracted from serum-reduced, ponasterone A-treated NA53T cells showed a typical DNA ladder (Fig. 3 F). Since serum reduction can cause a down-regulation of MAPK signaling in cells, we focused on MAPK pathway abnormalities and screened the phosphorylation status of the molecules involved in MAPK pathways. We found that, in α-synuclein-expressing cells, phosphorylated forms of MAPKs, such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK, were all reduced even under normal serum conditions (Fig. 4 A), whereas phosphorylated MAPKK levels, including those of phosphorylated MEK-1, MKK-3/6, and SEK-1, were similar among the cells. Phosphatases, such as MKP-1, MKP-2, and calcineurin, also showed no difference in expression levels among the cells. Cells that were not induced showed no variation in the phosphorylation status of their MAPKs (data not shown). To clarify the relationship between α-synuclein expression and MAPK suppression, NA53T cells were induced with various concentrations of ponasterone A, and the amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4 B, an increase in α-synuclein expression caused a reduction in phosphorylated ERK1/2. Next, we estimated the activity of MAPK by incubating recombinant ERK2 with cell lysates from α-synuclein-expressing cells. Fig.4 C shows that the cell lysate of ponasterone A-treated NA53T cells cultured in normal serum showed a significant decline in ERK2 phosphorylation activity compared with the cell lysate of Nmock cells. We then investigated the interaction between α-synuclein and MAPKs. As shown in Fig.5 A, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and SAPK/JNK co-immunoprecipitated with α-synuclein from ponasterone A-induced Nwt cells. Moreover, GST pull-down assay of cell lysate from neuro2a cells using GST-α-synuclein WT confirmed the binding of α-synuclein with p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK (Fig. 5 B). We next examined the response of MAPKs to extracellular stimuli. Similar responses were observed among those cells that were not treated with ponasterone A upon stimulation after 8 h of exposure to serum that had been reduced to 1% (Fig.6 A). Cells incubated with 1 μm ponasterone A for 48 h were grown for 8 h in 1% serum and stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF, 10 μg/ml anisomycin, or 20 J/m2 UV exposure. As shown in Fig. 6 B, cells expressing α-synuclein showed an increase in MEK-1 phosphorylation after EGF stimulation but did not show an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as determined by immunoblotting. Northern blotting revealed that they also lacked c-fos gene expression. A decreased expression of c-Fos protein was also confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6 C). Stimulation by anisomycin activated MKK-3/6 and SEK-1 (data not shown), but phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 6 B) and SAPK/JNK (data not shown) was not observed. UV stimulation caused phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in Nmock and Nwt cells but not in NA30P and NA53T cells. To confirm that suppression of the MAPK pathway results in a decrease in cell viability, Nmock, Nwt, NA30P, and NA53T cells were induced with ponasterone A and incubated with the MEK inhibitor U0126 in 10% serum. As shown in Fig.7 A, the MTT assay of Nwt, NA30P, and NA53T cells treated with 10 μm U0126 and 1 μm ponasterone A showed a significant decrease in their viability. Cells that were not treated with ponasterone A showed no significant change in cell viability even with U0126 treatment (data not shown). To recover MAPK phosphorylation in α-synuclein-expressing cells, we used constitutively active MEK-1 to phosphorylate inactive ERK1/2. neuro2a cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged constitutively active MEK-1 cultured in 0.5% serum overnight showed increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 compared with an empty vector (Fig.7 B). As can be seen in Fig. 7 C, even when α-synuclein is induced and serum is reduced to 0.5%, constitutively active MEK-1 can increase the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in Nmock, Nwt, NA30P, and NA53T cells. We investigated the effect of constitutively active MEK-1 on cell viability and found that constitutively active MEK-1 can partially restore cell viability in α-synuclein-expressing cells under serum-reduced conditions (Fig.7 D). To examine the effects of MEK-1 in a transient system, we co-transfected neuro2a cells cultured in 10% serum with α-synuclein and constitutively active MEK-1. As shown in Fig. 7 E, constitutively active MEK-1 can restore cell viability, even in a transient system. In this study, we first found that transient overexpression of α-synuclein affects the cell viability of neuro2a cells, as measured by an MTT assay. This effect was only observed with α-synuclein and not its homologue β-synuclein, and its N-terminal portion seemed to play a more important role than that of the C-terminal portion. To evaluate this in detail, we generated stable inducible α-synuclein and β-synuclein cell lines. When cultured under normal serum conditions, the cells showed no change, even with induction by ponasterone A. This result seemed rather contradictory to the results of the transient transfection study. However, we thought that a low level of α-synuclein might be expressed without induction due to unavoidable leakage, thereby conferring some resistance to cells under normal serum conditions. When α-synuclein was induced and the serum concentration was reduced, significant cell death was observed in Nwt, NA30P, and NA53T cells, compared with Nmock cells. In cultured cells, a reduction in the concentration of serum within the medium results in a down-regulation of the MAPK pathway. This transmits a survival signal from a cell's surface receptor to its nucleus via the phosphorylation of various proteins (30Hill C.S. Treisman R.

Thus, we investigated the status of MAPKs within cells and found that α-synuclein-expressing cells have less phosphorylated MAPK than control cells under normal serum conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, not only the phosphorylation of classical MAPK ERK1/2, but also the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK, is attenuated by overexpression of α-synuclein. In our inducible cell lines, suppression of MAPK phosphorylation increased as the level of α-synuclein expression increased. This supports the idea that overexpression of α-synuclein affects the phosphorylation status of MAPK. Induction of α-synuclein decreased MAPK phosphorylation as well as c-fos gene expression when attempts were made to stimulate these through exposure to extracellular agents, such as EGF, anisomycin, and UV light (31Hodge C.

In arterial sections from the systemic and pulmonary circulation, CREB content was high in proliferation-resistant medial subpopulations of smooth muscle cells and low in proliferation-prone regions. In vessels from neonatal calves exposed to chronic hypoxia, CREB content was depleted and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation was accelerated. Induction of quiescence by serum deprivation in culture led to increased CREB content. Highly proliferative SMC in culture were observed to have low CREB content. Exposure to proliferative stimuli such as hypoxia or platelet-derived growth factor decreased SMC CREB content. Assessment of CREB gene transcription by nuclear run-on analysis and transcription from a CREB promoter-luciferase construct indicate that CREB levels in SMC are in part controlled at the level of transcription. Overexpression of wild type or constitutively active CREB in primary cultures of SMC arrested cell cycle progression. Additionally, expression of constitutively active CREB decreased both proliferation and chemokinesis. Consistent with these functional properties, active CREB decreased the expression of multiple cell cycle regulatory genes, as well as genes encoding growth factors, growth factor receptors, and cytokines.

The lumen of blood vessels is lined with endothelial cells, which communicate with the underlying medial cell layer. For many years, the arterial media was considered to be made-up of a homogeneous population of smooth muscle cells (SMC)1arising from a common lineage. Thus the diverse activities of contraction, proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production were thought to reflect SMC response to either normal or pathological stimuli. Vascular remodeling is the compensatory response of the vasculature to stress or injury. Under pathological circumstances (hypoxia, mechanical injury, hyperlipidemia, and oxidative stress), SMC in the intimal and medial compartments of the arterial wall become proliferative, migratory, and produce excess matrix proteins. This switch in SMC phenotype is termed phenotypic modulation and is considered to play a key pathogenic role in atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension. While the stimuli for SMC activation are well known, the molecular events, which permit activation of SMC, remain poorly understood. Cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) promote SMC quiescence invitro and in vivo. β-Adrenergic stimulation of cAMP signaling is important for SMC quiescence and contractile function under normal conditions. It is believed that cAMP acts as a gate to prevent SMC mitogenic response to growth factors in the intact vessel wall (1Owens G.R. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar, 2Owens G.K. Vernon S.M. Madsen C.S. J. Hyperten. 1996; 14: S55-S64Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3Iyengar R.

One important nuclear target of cyclic nucleotide signaling is the transcription factor CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein. CREB is a widely expressed DNA-binding protein and it is a downstream target of cAMP (and in some reports cGMP). Classically, the CREB functional state is regulated by phosphorylation on serine 133, which permits binding to the co-activator protein CREB-binding protein (CBP) and leads to gene regulation (11Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Numerous CREB kinases and phosphatases have been identified which determine the CREB phosphorylation state (12Finkbeiner S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated that CREB is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and neuronal survival. Thus CREB may be a target of cyclic nucleotide signaling that is important for determination of SMC phenotype. We hypothesized that CREB could function as a molecular determinant of smooth muscle cell fate. In this article we demonstrate a strong link between CREB content and proliferative capacity in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active CREB blocked mitogen- and serum-stimulated proliferation and chemokinesis. Active CREB also decreased the expression of a number of cell cycle and mitogenic genes, providing a potential mechanism for the impact of CREB on SMC behavior. Pulmonary hypertension was induced in newborn male Holstein calves by placing animals at 1 day of age in a hypobaric chamber with barometric pressure of 445 mm Hg (which is equivalent to an elevation of 4300 m). This exposure has previously been reported to produce severe neonatal pulmonary hypertension with characteristic hemodynamic and structural changes (13Stenmark K.R. Fasules J. Hyde D.M. Voelkel N.F.

Age-matched controls were kept indoors at ambient altitude (1500 m, 640 mm Hg). Animals were sacrificed at 14 days of age (n = 3 of each age, hypoxic and control) and tissue samples were isolated immediately. All animal studies were performed after review and approval of the University of Colorado and Colorado State University Animal Care and Use Committees. Freshly isolated arterial rings (∼1.0 cm long) from the main and the right or left main pulmonary arteries (MPA) and portions of lung tissue were taken from 14-day-old calves with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension as well as from age-matched control animals (n = 3 in each group). In addition, specimens of aortic arch were obtained from each animal at the same level and distance from the heart as for MPA. For immunofluorescence analysis, arterial rings from the neonatal calves were cut in half and both sectors of the artery were then processed. Arterial segments were embedded in O.C.T. Compound (Miles Inc., Kankakee, IL), frozen slowly in cold hexane to prevent tissue fracturing, and stored at −70 °C until use. Fixed tissues were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4 μm thickness. Frozen tissue samples were cut at 5 μm, air-dried, fixed in absolute acetone for 5 min at room temperature, and processed for immunofluorescence staining as further described. For indirect single-label horesradish peroxidase staining, acetone-fixed lung tissue sections were incubated in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% calf serum) for 5–10 min and then incubated with polyclonal antibodies to CREB for 1 h at room temperature. Immune complexes were visualized using Vectastain ABC Peroxidase kit and DAB reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Controls were performed in which primary antibodies were replaced by nonimmune calf serum. Photomicrographs were made with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a 35-mm camera on Kodak Royal Gold 200 film. For double-label immunofluorescence staining, the antibodies were applied to MPA sections in the following order: staining with Ki-67 antibody was accomplished first using a Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody, then staining with polyclonal CREB antibodies was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibodies. Digital images were made on a Nikon Axiophot microscope equiped with a chilled CCD video camera. Digital images were captured to a Macintosh G3 computer, and contrast enhanced in Adobe Photoshop to cover the full 8-bit range of the image. The monochrome images were pseudocolored by loading into RGB color channels. Immunofluorescence staining of aortic sections was performed using monoclonal SMMS-1 antibodies recognizing both SM-1 and SM-2 smooth muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms, but not nonmuscle isoforms, as previously reported (18Frid M.G. Moiseeva E.P. Stenmark K.R. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Multiple phenotypically distinct SMC populations exist in the adult and developing bovine pulmonary arterial media in vivo (18Frid M.G. Moiseeva E.P. Stenmark K.R. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 19Frid M.G. Dempsey E.C. Durmowicz A.G. Stenmark K.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-CREB antibodies were employed at 1:100 dilution (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Horse anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa-488 green fluorescence dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to biotin (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA), and streptavidin conjugate with Alexa-594 red fluorescence dye were applied at dilutions recommended by the suppliers. Double-label immunofluorescence staining of SM-myosin heavy chains and CREB was performed as follows. Acetone-fixed tissue sections were preincubated in full calf serum as a blocking solution for 20 min at room temperature, and then incubated with a mixture of monoclonal anti-SM-myosin SMMS-1 and polyclonal anti-CREB antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were incubated with a mixture of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at room temperature. The staining was accomplished by incubation with Streptavidin-Alexa-594. Finally, fluorescently labeled tissue sections were embedded with VectaShield mounting medium with DAPI (blue fluorescence dye) (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Controls were performed in which primary antibodies were omitted or replaced by nonimmune mouse and/or rabbit serum. Fluorescence staining was examined using a Nikon Optiphot epifluorescence photomicroscope. Colored photomicrographs were taken on Ektachrome 160T film. Segments of the MPA (proximal to its bifurcation) and aortic arch were used for cell isolation. These vascular segments were cut open and mechanically stripped of adventitia. To ensure complete removal of the adventitia, a thin portion of the outermost media was also discarded. Endothelium was removed by gentle scraping of the luminal surface of the vessel with a scalpel blade. The arterial media was then separated into three previously described layers: 1) a very thin subendothelial layer; 2) an intermediate-thickness middle-media layer; and 3) a thick outer layer. We found that these three medial layers could be mechanically separated from one another because of distinct mechanical properties of each layer, apparently due to specific patterns of cell arrangement and elastic lamellar distribution. After separation of the media into three layers, cells were grown from the subendothelial and middle media layer by explant (17Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Tissue explants were maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum. Since our goal was to obtain pure subpopulations of smooth cells we selectively isolated individual cell colonies with a distinct, although uniform, morphological appearance from primary culture using cloning cylinders. We then examined expression of smooth muscle-specific markers in each isolated cell subpopulation. Only cell subpopulations with uniform morphological appearance and uniform patterns of expression of smooth muscle markers were selected for the proposed experiments. To isolate individual cell colonies growing from tissue explants in primary culture, cloning cylinders (5- 10 mm in diameter, greased on the bottom) were placed over each cell colony of interest. Cells within the ring were trypsinized and transferred to a 24-multiwell plate for expansion. All studies will be carried out using cells at passages 1- 8. Cell cultures will be tested for mycoplasma contamination using a Gen-Probe Mycoplasma T. C. Rapid Detection System (GenProbe Inc.). For experiments, SMCs were seeded at ∼500,000 cells/10-cm plate. Control cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and incubated under 20% O2 and 5% CO2 (balance N2 and trace atmospheric gasses). Cells subjected to hypoxia were grown in the same medium, but placed in sealed, plexiglass chambers flushed with a mixture of gases containing 3% O2 and 5% CO2. For low serum conditions, cells were transferred to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. Rat aortic SMC were isolated from aortic tissue harvested from eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Aortic tissue was minced and cells released by collagenase dissociation (7000 units/ml in MEM Eagle's medium). Dissociated SMC were plated on 35-mm tissue culture-treated culture dishes. Each preparation yielded ∼20 plates of rat aortic SMC. Cells were maintained in growth medium and passaged as described for bovine SMC above. The majority of the cell culture studies were performed in both bovine SMC and rat aortic SCM, as results were similar only bovine aortic SMC results are presented with the exception of the cDNA array analysis presented in Fig. 6. Following experimental treatment, SMC are harvested by scraping in Laemmli sample buffer, and extracts are sonicated and boiled. Protein concentrations of samples were assessed by Bradford protein assay, and 40 μg of cellular protein fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins are electrophoretically transferred to nylon membranes, equivalence of protein loading was assessed by staining of membrane-bound proteins by Ponceau stain, and subsequently probed with protein-specific primary antisera. Immunologically identified proteins are recognized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, species-specific IgG and CDP-Star Enhanced Chemiluminescence (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Autoradiographic results are quantified densitometrically using a Fluor-S MultiImager and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Bovine pulmonary and aortic SMCs were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For assays, cells were grown in normal medium or in medium containing only 0.1% fetal calf serum for 48 h prior to harvesting. Approximately 8 × 106 cells were used for each data point. Cell harvest, nuclei recovered, and nuclear run-ons were performed as previously described (20Wheat W.H. Roesler W.J. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5881-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The full-length open reading frame for CREB-327, bound to nitrocellulose, was used to recover 32P-labeled CREB RNA from the reactions. Bovine pulmonary and aortic SMCs were transfected using Superfect Transfection reagent (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's specifications. SMCs were transfected with a plasmid containing the full-length (−1264 to +51) CREB gene promotor linked to firefly luciferase gene (the generous gift of William W. Walker, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburg, PA) or the control plasmid pCIS-CK (Stratagene; identical to the CREB promoter construct but lacking CREB promoter elements). Transfection efficiencies were determined by co-transfecting the cells with a plasmid containing the enhancerless herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene promoter linked to Renilla luciferase, whose activity is measured subsequent to the activity of the firefly enzyme using the Dual Luciferase Assay System by Promega (Madison, WI) on a Turner Designs TD 20/20 luminometer. Early passage cultures (P1-P5) of either bovine or rat aortic SMC cells are plated in 6-well culture dishes at a density of 1.4 × 105cells/cm2 and maintained in medium containing 10% serum for 18 h. Transfection is performed using LipofectAMINE Plus Transfection Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) as described by the manufacturer. In addition to specific chimeric promoter-luciferase plasmid constructs, SMC cells are co-transfected with a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase reporter plasmid construct (RSV-β-gal). The LipofectAMINE Plus:DNA mixture plus serum containing medium is left on cells for 3 h. The cells are allowed to recover in fresh medium with 10% serum overnight. SMC cells are subsequently serum-starved in 1 × MEM (minimal essential medium containing 1 × nonessential amino acids and 0.4 mmglutamine) for 24 h. Agonist treatment is performed in 1 × MEM for durations of 4–24 h, and cells are subsequently extracted in 1 × Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) for analysis of reporter gene expression. Luciferase reporter activity is corrected for differences in transfection efficiency, cell number, and extract recovery, using β-galactosidase activity determined in the same cellular extract. Subendothelial bovine aortic SMC were stably transfected with muristerone-inducible WT CREB and grown to confluence. This construct has been described in previously published work (21Klemm D.

SMC were subsequently exposed to serum at 0.1 or 10% with and without exposure to muristerone to induce CREB expression. Cells were fixed in ice-cold ethanol and stained with propidium iodide. Cell cycle was assessed by fluorescence flow cytometry. Results are expressed as cells in stages S + G2M, relative to cells in stages G0 − G1. SMC were grown to confluence and serum deprived for 4 or 7 days in MEM containing 0.1% FBS. RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of total RNA was separated on agarose gels and transferred on Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) by capillary transfer in 20 × SSC. The blot was hybridized with full size CREB probe labeled with Prime-It RT Labeling Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 42 °C overnight. Hybridization solution contained 1 × hybridization solution (Sigma) and 50% formamide. After hybridization, the blot was washed twice with low stringency wash solution (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) and twice with high stringency solution (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 42 °C (15 min each). Autoradiography was performed with a 20-h film exposure. To generate recombinant adenovirus, wild type or mutated CREB cDNAs were subcloned into p95ACCMVpLpASR vector downstream of a CMV promoter. The plasmid VP16-CREB was designed to generate VP16-CREB containing C-terminal FLAG epitope. A fragment encoding VP16-CREB-FLAG was generated by PCR using Pfu-turbo polymerase (Promega Corp.). This insert was subcloned into theHindIII/BamHI site of the adenovirus-transfer vector downstream of a CMV promoter (p95ACCMVpLpASR). The complete VP16-CREB-FLAG coding sequence was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Expression of VP16-CREB protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Function was confirmed by infection of HEK 293 cells co-transfected with pCREluc reporter plasmid (Stratagene). A similar strategy was used to generate wild type CREB and dominant-negative KCREB chimeric plasmid constructs. For construction of the adenovirus transfer chimeric plasmid for production of the constitutively active CREB-DIEDML (DCREB) adenovirus, the DCREB cDNA was excised from the plasmid pRc/RSV-sCREB which was subsequently subcloned as a HIII/XbaI fragment into the adenovirus transfer vector (p95ACCMVpLpASR). Chimeric CREB-adenovirus transfer plasmids were co-transfected with right-arm viral DNA into HEK 293 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. Full cytopathic effect was observed 7–14 days after transfection. At this stage cells were disrupted to release the virus by cycles of freeze-thawing. HEK 293 cells were infected with series of virus dilutions followed by an overlay with 1.5% agarose. Single plaques were observed 4–10 days after infection. Plaques of each recombinant virus were collected (6–12 for each construct), amplified, and the expression of recombinant proteins confirmed by Western blot analysis. A second round of plaque purification was performed and recombinant adenoviruses amplified and subsequently purified by centrifugation in CsCl2 gradient. All constructs were created using the same adenoviral DNA backbone. Each virus also has a FLAG tag for assessment of expression in infected cells. Experiments were performed to determine the number of cells that were actively expressing recombinant proteins following adenoviral infection. SMCs were plated 7 × 104 cells per well on sterile coverslips in 24-well plates. The next day cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus (1.4 × 108 m.o.i.; equivalent to 1 × 109 m.o.i. per 400,000 cells), expressing different CREB mutants or β-galactosidase as a control. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with antibodies that recognize FLAG epitope (Sigma; 1:400 dilution). Cells were washed and subsequently treated with DAPI for nuclear staining and Cy3 donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:100 dilution (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for FLAG epitope detection. Results indicate that 42–70% of cells in these cultures expressed visually detectable FLAG peptide in cells infected with the same m.o.i. of different CREB-FLAG adenovirus constructs (data not shown). When cells were infected with an adenoviral construct expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), more than 90% of cells were infected. The observation that infection and expression of recombinant proteins at a rate less than 100% of cells indicates that the impact of these proteins on SMC behavior may actually be understated by these experiments. SMC were transiently transfected with a CREluc reporter construct (Stratagene) and a control plasmid containing a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase gene (under control of the CMV promoter) using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 12 h recovery in 10% serum, cells were placed in serum-reduced medium (MEM + 0.1% fetal bovine serum) and were infected with 300 μl of crude adVP16CREB. After 24 h of virus exposure, medium was changed to remove virus and incubation continued for 24 h. Cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. SMC were cultured as described above, incubated in serum-reduced medium for 24 h, then infected as indicated with recombinant adenoviruses encoding either VP16CREB or β-galactosidase. During the final 24 h of incubation, half of each cell treatment group was exposed to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) at a final concentration of 0.1 nm. During the final 3 h of the 24 h ± PDGF treatment, 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine were added to the cultures. Cells were assayed for thymidine incorporation by standard methods. Results are expressed as 3H-dpm/μg of protein. Chemokinetic behavior of SMC cells, defined as nondirected migration of SMC in response to a chemical stimulus, was assessed using a 24-well micro-Boyden chamber apparatus (Transwell Apparatus, Costar, Corning, NY). Chemotactic compounds, such as PDGF, are diluted in serum-free medium and added to the lower chamber of the apparatus. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filter with 8-mm pores were coated with a Type I collagen. Trypsinized cells were resuspended in serum-free medium containing either chemotactic compounds or vehicle, and plated at a density of 30,000 cells per well in a volume of 100 μl. After 15 min to allow for cell attachment, PDGF was added to the bottom chamber of half the wells at a final concentration of 0.1 nm. Cells were allowed to migrate for 3 h, and were then fixed and stained using Dif Quik solutions (Dade Behringer, Newark, DE). Once dry, the cells on the plating surface were swabbed away and the remaining migrating cells on the membrane underside were counted. Data is expressed as fold-stimulation of chemokinesis by PDGF with data sets collected as cells migrating per microscopic field. SMC were cultured and infected with either adBetaGal or adVP16CREB as described above. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Single-strand cDNA probes were generated from total RNA using [32P]dATP and reagents and protocols provided byCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). These probes were used for hybridization with separate Rat cDNA Array membranes using protocols and reagents provided by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Arrays were subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C using Kodak Lightning Plus Screens. Scanned arrays were analyzed using Atlas Image Software, comparing relative intensities of specific cDNA “spots” which were corrected for differences in the relative intensities of housekeeping genes between membranes prior to analysis. Three separate array analyses were performed with probes generated from RNA resulting from 2 different experiments. Results for cDNAs depicted below are the mean of these three separate determinations. Data is presented as mRNA content in adVP16CREB-treated cells relative to mRNA content in adBetaGal-treated cells. Under basal conditions, little to no SMC proliferation is occurring in the vessel, yet there are cell medial populations with strikingly different proliferative potential. Frid et al. (19Frid M.G.

Because the proteasome is the major intracellular proteolytic system involved in the removal of altered proteins, the effect of intracellular glycation on proteasome function has been analyzed in human dermal fibroblasts subjected to treatment with glyoxal that promotes the formation of Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine adducts on proteins. The three proteasome peptidase activities were decreased in glyoxal-treated cells as compared with control cells, and glyoxal was also found to inhibit these peptidase activities in vitro. In addition, the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a crucial enzyme for the regulation of the intracellular redox status, was dramatically reduced in glyoxal-treated cells. Further analysis was performed to determine whether glycated proteins are substrates for proteasome degradation. In contrast to the oxidized glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, both Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine- and fluorescent-glycated enzymes were resistant to degradation by the 20 S proteasome in vitro, and this resistance was correlated with an increased conformational stability of the glycated proteins. These results provide one explanation for why glycated proteins build up both as a function of disease and aging. Finally,Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine-modified proteins were found to be ubiquitinated in glyoxal-treated cells suggesting a potential mechanism by which these modified proteins may be marked for degradation.

The end result of this process is the formation of several forms of advanced glycation/glycoxidation end products (AGE)1 that alter the structure and function of proteins. Glycation and glycoxidation are well known to occur in the extracellular compartment during aging and in pathologies such as diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (3Araki N. Ueno N. Chakrabarti B.

Weiss M.A. Monnier V.M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 105: 221-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, the glycation process is more complex due to the fact that glycation agents can be generated not only by the catabolism of sugars but also by lipid, amino acid, as well as ascorbate metabolism (2Miyata T. van Ypersele de Strihou C. Kurokawa K. Baynes J.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 7Verbeke P. Clark B.F. Rattan S.I. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Nε-Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) and fluorescent AGE, such as pentosidine, are two forms of AGE known to accumulate in cells during aging (6Sell D.R. Primc M. Schafer I.A. Kovach M. Weiss M.A. Monnier V.M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 105: 221-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Ling X. Sakashita N. Takeya M. Nagai R. Horiuchi S. Takahashi K. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1591-1606PubMed Google Scholar). CML brings additional negative charge to the glycated protein, whereas pentosidine and cyclic AGE formation leads to intra/intermolecular cross-links. In contrast to the complex network of antioxidant defenses that limit the deleterious effects of oxidation on macromolecules (9Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3074) Google Scholar), the cellular defenses against other post-translational damage such as glycation have not been extensively studied (10Thornalley P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111–112: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 11Abordo E.A. Minhas H.S. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Indeed, no specific proteolytic pathway has been shown to degrade cytosolic AGE. Because these structures are present in aggregates of cross-linked proteins called AGE-pigment-like fluorophores, mainly accumulating in lysosomes during aging (8Ling X. Sakashita N. Takeya M. Nagai R. Horiuchi S. Takahashi K. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1591-1606PubMed Google Scholar, 12Horie K. Miyata T. Yasuda T. Takeda A. Yasuda Y. Maeda K. Sobue G. Kurokawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Etlinger J.D. Maturana J. Weitman D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and proteasome activity is impaired in kidney and liver of rats during diabetes, a condition that favors glycated protein formation (17Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Ruiz M.C. Cabiscol E. Prat J. Bellmunt M.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The proteasome is the main cytosolic proteolytic complex responsible for the degradation of damaged protein and general protein turnover (18Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 19Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome, which is ubiquitin and ATP-independent, is involved in 70–80% of the selective recognition and degradation of the mildly oxidized proteins in the cytosol (19Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 20Davies K.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome, formed upon association of the 19 S regulatory complex with the 20 S catalytic core, has also been proposed to play a role in oxidized protein degradation in ubiquitin and ATP-dependent pathways (21Taylor A. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). An age-related decline of the peptidase activities of both the 20 S and 26 S proteasome has been reported in cells and tissues during aging in rat (23Conconi M. Szweda L.I. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Friguet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Shibatani T. Nazir M. Ward W.F. J. Gerontol. Biol.

Trebilcock G.U. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 192: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Petropoulos I. Conconi M. Wang X. Hoenel B. Bregegere F. Milner Y. Friguet B. J.

Gerontol. 2000; 35: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reported decrease of the 20 S proteasomal activity may explain, at least in part, the accumulation of highly oxidized and aggregated proteins in the cytosol of cells observed during aging (30Friguet B. Bulteau A.L. Chondrogianni N. Conconi M. Petropoulos I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been demonstrated that 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) cross-linked proteins, as well as lipofuscin/ceroid fluorescent pigments, act as inhibitors of the proteasome (31Friguet B. Stadtman E.R. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21639-21643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Friguet B. Szweda L.I.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which may also contribute to the accumulation of these damaged proteins in aged cells. In this study, the fate of the proteasome has been evaluated after treatment of human dermal fibroblasts with the carbonyl compound glyoxal under conditions that promote the formation of CML-modified proteins (34Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 35Niwa H. Takeda A. Wakai M. Miyata T. Yasuda Y. Mitsuma T. Kurokawa K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The status of the cytosolic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) has also been investigated because it is the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway that catalyzes the formation of NADPH, important for the maintenance of intracellular redox balance (36Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Martini G. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Preville X. Salvemini F. Giraud S. Chaufour S. Paul C. Stepien G. Ursini M.V.

Med. 2000; 29: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated previously that G6PDH activity is decreased with age (39Agarwal S. Sohal R.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1994; 75: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), is affected by oxidation, and that the oxidized enzyme is susceptible to proteolysis by the 20 S proteasome in vitro (40Friguet B. Szweda L.I. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, the susceptibility of CML- and fluorescent AGE-modified G6PDH to degradation by the 20 S proteasome has been investigated. In contrast to the oxidized protein, both the CML- and fluorescent AGE-modified enzymes were resistant to degradation by the 20 S proteasome. To explain the observed resistance of glycated protein to proteolysis by the 20 S proteasome, we have investigated several structural parameters of CML- and fluorescent AGE-G6PDH as compared with the oxidized and native forms by using biophysical characterization. G6PDH from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was purchased from Worthington. Casein fluorescein isothiocyanate (38 μg of FITC/mg of protein) was purchased from Sigma. If not specified otherwise, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of highest analytical grade available. Rabbit anti-CML polyclonal antibody raised against CML-modified bovine serum albumin was provided by Dr. H. Bakala (Université Denis Diderot, Paris 7). Rabbit immune sera raised against 20 S rat proteasome were obtained from Assay Research (Silver Spring, MD) as described previously (23Conconi M. Szweda L.I. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Friguet B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from M. Moreau (Inserm U505, Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris 6) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Two days after seeding, cells were treated with 0.25 mm glyoxal for 1 week. The medium was changed every 2 days. Cells remaining viable during incubation were determined by their ability to exclude trypan blue, and the viability of untreated and glyoxal-treated cells was about the same (more than 99%). Cells were collected, suspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, supplemented with 50 mm NaCl, 500 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol and sonicated 5 times for 5 s at 4 °C. Cellular debris and organelles were removed from the crude extract by centrifugation for 1 h at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described previously (27Petropoulos I. Conconi M. Wang X. Hoenel B. Bregegere F. Milner Y. Friguet B. J. Gerontol. 2000; 55: B220-B227Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to measure the amount of CML-modified protein in glyoxal-treated fibroblasts. Purification of CML-modified proteins was achieved using a CNBr-activated Sepharose column coupled with polyclonal anti-CML antibodies. Crude cellular extracts were loaded on the column previously equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4, and then washed with the same buffer. The CML-modified proteins were eluted with 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.8, and the fractions were immediately neutralized with 2m Tris-HCl, pH 8. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was then processed utilizing polyclonal anti-CML antibody (1/1000) and anti-ubiquitin antibody (1/500) (Dako, Trappes, France). CML-modified G6PDH was prepared by reductive methylation of G6PDH (41Reddy S. Bichler J. Wells-Knecht K.J. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 mg of G6PDH was incubated with 45 mmglyoxylic acid and 150 mm sodium cyanoborohydride for 24 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. Fluorescent AGE-modified G6PDH was prepared using the procedure of Grandhee and Monnier (42Grandhee S.K. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11649-11653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. G6PDH (6 mg) was incubated with 100 mm ribose and 1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 9.0. After 1 week of incubation at 37 °C, samples were diluted 10 times with PBS, pH 7.4, and dialyzed twice for 24 h against the same buffer. Total cyclic fluorescent AGE were characterized by fluorescence analysis (excitation, 370 nm; emission, 440 nm) in a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorimeter (Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France), and pentosidine content was measured using the method from Odetti et al. (43Odetti P. Fogarty J. Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 153-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (Bio-Rad), and the samples were stored at −20 °C. Metal-catalyzed oxidation of the enzyme was achieved as described previously (32Friguet B. Szweda L.I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Prior to use, the various forms of G6PDH were chromatographed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. The eluted fractions were concentrated by using a Centricon-30 system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The enzymatic reaction was performed at 25 °C by incubating 25, 50, or 75 ng of the different forms of G6PDH diluted in 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl in the presence of 10 mmNADP+ and 100 mm glucose 6-phosphate. G6PDH activity was determined by following the appearance of NADPH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm for 5 min. G6PDH activity in crude cellular extracts was determined by the same method using 250 μg of protein. Assaying G6PDH activity in biological samples is complicated by the presence of endogenous 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, the second enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that also produces NADPH. Therefore, the activity of G6PDH was determined after inactivation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase by maleimide at a final concentration of 5 mm (44Deutsch J. Bergmeyer H.V. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VCH Publishers, Deerfield Beach, FL1983: 190-197Google Scholar). 20 S proteasome was purified from human placenta according to the procedure described previously (40Friguet B. Szweda L.I. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (45Kroll M. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Friguet B. Conconi M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 689-698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Peptidase activities of the proteasome were assayed using fluorogenic peptides, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amidomethylcoumarin (LLVY-AMC) for the chymotrypsin-like activity,N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-amidomethylcoumarin (LSTR-AMC) for the trypsin-like activity, andN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide (LLE-NA) for the peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activity as described previously (27Petropoulos I. Conconi M. Wang X. Hoenel B. Bregegere F. Milner Y. Friguet B. J. Gerontol. 2000; 55: B220-B227Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The mixture, containing 20 μg of crude homogenate total protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was incubated at 37 °C with the appropriate peptide substrate (LLVY-AMC at 25 μm or LLE-NA at 150 μm or LSTR-AMC at 40 μm) in a final volume of 200 μl. Enzymatic kinetics were conducted in a temperature-controlled microplate fluorimetric reader (Fluostar Galaxy, bMG, Stuttgart, Germany). Excitation/emission wavelengths were 350/440 nm and 340/410 nm for aminomethylcoumarin and β-naphthylamine, respectively. Proteasome activities were determined as the difference between total activity and the remaining activity of the crude extract in the presence of 20 μm proteasome inhibitorN-Cbz-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132). For inactivation experiments, 2 μg of purified proteasome were incubated with various concentrations of glyoxal for 30 min at room temperature. After preincubation, proteasome peptidases activities were determined as described above. The proteasome amount was estimated by Western blot analysis of cytosolic extracts. 20 μg of total proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot experiments were then performed using anti-20 S proteasome polyclonal antibody (1/2500). Proteolysis of the various forms of G6PDH at different concentrations was achieved in the presence of 0.3 μm of purified 20 S proteasome at 37 °C in PBS, pH 7.4. At different times, a 20-μl aliquot was removed and submitted to a 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant containing the released peptides was neutralized by adding 100 μl of 2 m potassium borate, pH 10. The amount of amino groups was determined after addition of fluorescamine (3 mg/ml in acetone) by measuring the emission intensity of the fluorescent derivatives (excitation, 375 nm; emission, 475 nm). Proteolysis of FITC-casein (50 μg/ml) was performed with 0.3 μmproteasome at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 18 μm of the various forms of G6PDH. At different times, a 20-μl aliquot was removed and processed as described above. The proteolysis rate was estimated by measuring the emission intensities of FITC fluorescent peptides at 515 nm (excitation at 495 nm). The various forms of G6PDH (at 0.4 μm) were incubated with 100 μm ANSA in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, and 100 mm KCl at 37 °C for 30 min. The fluorescence emission spectrum from 430 to 600 nm (excitation at 370 nm) was recorded for ANSA alone and for ANSA in the presence of the different forms of G6PDH in a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorimeter (Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). Fluorescence increase occurring upon binding of ANSA to protein was obtained after subtraction of the emission spectrum of ANSA alone. Native and modified forms of the protein were diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. CD spectra were recorded in a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter (Longjumeau, France) at 20 °C, using 1-cm or 0.1-mm path length cells for the near (250–320 nm) and far (190–260 nm) UV analysis, respectively. Each spectrum results from averaging five successive individual scans with a 0.5-nm step and an integration time of 2 s per step. Buffer contribution was eliminated by subtraction of the corresponding spectrum acquired under the same conditions. 0.02 μm native, oxidized or CML-modified G6PDH was incubated at 45 °C in 50 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl. At the indicated times, 50 μl of the mixture was added to 900 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, at 25 °C to terminate the thermal inactivation, and the residual activity was measured as described above. Denaturation was performed by incubating 0.3 μm of the different forms of G6PDH in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, with increasing concentration of urea (from 0 to 8 m). The mixture was gently stirred for 3 h at 20 °C. At each urea concentration, the fluorescence emission spectrum (300–450 nm, excitation 290 nm) of the samples was determined. The native enzyme fraction was obtained from the ratio F − Fd/Fn −Fd and plotted as a function of urea concentration.F is the fluorescence at 320 nm of the sample at a given concentration of urea; Fn and Fd are the fluorescence intensities (320 nm) of the sample at 0 m and 8 m urea, respectively. The effects of intracellular glycation on proteasome peptidase activities were analyzed in primary cultures of human dermal fibroblasts treated for 1 week with 0.25 mm glyoxal. These conditions induced the formation of CML-modified proteins without affecting cell viability. Indeed, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with anti-CML polyclonal antibody, intracellular CML-protein adducts exhibited a 5-fold increase in the treated cells as compared with the control cells (data not shown). The three main proteasome peptidase activities, chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase activities, were monitored in cellular extracts of treated and untreated fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all three activities decreased significantly in the glyoxal-treated cells as compared with the control cells. To determine whether the observed decline in the proteasome peptidase activities was due to a decreased proteasome content, the amount of proteasome was estimated by Western blot analysis of cellular extracts, using an anti-proteasome polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1 A). No change in proteasome content was detected in treated cells indicating that the loss of proteasome activity is likely due to an alteration of proteasome function. To determine whether the observed decline of proteasome activity could be explained by direct inactivation of the 20 S proteasome by glyoxal, peptidase activities were assayed after incubation of purified proteasome with various concentrations of this compound. The results presented in Fig. 1 B indicate that all three proteasome peptidase activities were inhibited with 0.1 mm glyoxal and to a higher extent with increasing concentrations. To examine whether CML-modified proteins are substrates for ubiquitin conjugation, an immunopurification of the crude extracts from glyoxal-treated and control cells was achieved on an anti-CML polyclonal antibody affinity column. After elution, the purified proteins were submitted to Western blot analysis using anti-CML and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As shown in Fig.2, the major bands corresponding to CML-modified proteins are also ubiquitinated, indicating these proteins may be marked for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Among cytosolic enzymes that may be targets for glyoxal-induced modification, the fate of G6PDH was investigated because this enzyme has an essential lysine residue in its active site. Moreover, it plays a critical role in maintenance of intracellular redox status, and this enzyme is a well characterized model for the effects of various forms of modifications on susceptibility to proteasome degradation. We observed a 60% loss in G6PDH activity in glyoxal-treated cells defining this enzyme as a target for glyoxal-induced inactivation and also as a good model for further investigation of glycated protein degradation by the proteasome. Because CML-modified and fluorescent AGE-modified proteins are known to accumulate with age, these glycated forms of G6PDH were prepared and used to assess their susceptibility to proteolysis by the 20 S proteasome in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oxidatively modified G6PDH was also prepared to be used as a positive control. The formation of CML on protein was revealed by immunoblotting experiments using anti-CML antibodies. Amino acid analysis indicates a loss of 4 lysines in the CML-modified G6PDH and a loss of 9 lysines plus 4 arginines in the fluorescent AGE-modified form (data not shown). Pentosidine content (2.25 nmol/mg of enzyme) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography analysis, and the presence of other cyclic AGE structures was detected by spectrofluorometry. No intermolecular cross-links were detected after SDS-PAGE indicating that this modified G6PDH exhibits only pentosidine or other cyclic AGE cross-links within the same polypeptide (data not shown). The activities of both oxidatively modified and CML-modified G6PDH declined 50%, whereas the fluorescent AGE-modified form was completely inactivated. The rates of proteolysis for the native and modified forms of G6PDH were determined by monitoring the appearance of small peptides containing free amino groups generated after incubation of the various forms of G6PDH with purified 20 S proteasome (Fig.3 A). This method has been validated previously for native and modified G6PDH because it has been established that the loss of up to 13 lysines (upon modification by HNE) per molecule of G6PDH did not affect the values of the rates of proteolysis (31Friguet B. Stadtman E.R. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21639-21643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously, treatment of the enzyme with metal-catalyzed oxidation resulted in an increase in susceptibility to proteasome-mediated degradation (40Friguet B. Szweda L.I. Stadtman E.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CML-modified protein was degraded to the same extent as the native protein, whereas the fluorescent AGE-modified form was more resistant to proteolysis than the native form. Kinetic parameters for degradation of the various forms of G6PDH (Table I) were calculated from direct linear plots (not shown) according to the representation of Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden (46Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). The apparentK M for the CML-modified G6PDH was almost the same as for the native enzyme ("
https://openalex.org/W1661756785,"We report the first study of the dynamics of point defects, mono and di-vacancies, in a confined 2-D colloidal crystal in real space and time using digital video microscopy. The defects are introduced by manipulating individual particles with optical tweezers. The diffusion rates are measured to be $D_{mono}/a^{2}\cong3.27\pm0.03$Hz for mono-vacancies and $D_{di}/a^{2}\cong3.71\pm0.03$Hz for di-vacancies. The elementary diffusion processes are identified and it is found that the diffusion of di-vacancies is enhanced by a \textit{dislocation dissociation-recombination} mechanism. Furthermore, the defects do not follow a simple random walk but their hopping exhibits memory effects, due to the reduced symmetry (compared to the triangular lattice) of their stable configurations, and the slow relaxation rates of the lattice modes."

FTDP-17 is an autosomal-dominant disorder related to Alzheimer's disease. Symptoms of FTDP-17 include personality changes, reduced speech, and dementia. In late stages, memory loss occurs, and the disease becomes virtually indistinguishable from Alzheimer's disease (7Wilhelmsen K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Increased inclusion of exon 10 results in an elevated level of tau protein containing an additional fourth microtubule-binding domain (the 4R isoform) relative to tau protein containing only three microtubule-binding domains (the 3R isoform). Increased inclusion of tau exon 10 is tightly correlated with the disease phenotype, and overproduction of 4R tau is sufficient for disease (10Clark L.N. Poorkaj P. Wszolek Z. Geschwind D.H.

Here we report the application of antisense oligonucleotides to reverse the inclusion of tau exon 10 into mRNA as observed in FTDP-17 patients. Modified antisense oligonucleotides directed against either splice junction of exon 10 efficiently corrected its inclusion into tau mRNA. The oligonucleotides elicited a physiological effect by reducing the level of tau protein containing the microtubule-binding domain encoded by exon 10, and as a consequence the cytoskeleton morphology was altered. The use of antisense oligonucleotides will be useful to study the physiological role of specific tau isoforms in disease and cellular differentiation, and it might provide a novel therapeutic strategy to treat FTDP-17 and other tauopathies. COS-1 green monkey kidney cells (ATCC entry CRL-1650) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Rat PC12 cells (ATCC entry CRL-1721) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 2.5 g/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were split every other day at a ratio of about 2:3. A Pasteur pipette was used to deaggregate cell clusters. Rat AR42J pancreatic acinar cells (ATCC entry CRL-1492) were grown in F-12/Ham medium, 10% fetal calf serum. All oligonucleotides were 2′-O-methyl-oligoribonucleotides, contained a phosphorothioate backbone, and were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Identical results were obtained with oligonucleotides from either Operon Technologies or from Hybridon: E10α, 5′-UAUCUGCACCUUUGGUAG-3′; E10β, 5′-UGAAGGUACUCACACUGCCGC-3′; rat E10β, 5′-CGACAGUACUCACACUGCCUC-3′. Twenty hours prior to the experiment, 1.2 × 106 cells were plated on a 60-mm Petri dish. For co-transfection of the tau minigene and oligonucleotides into COS-1 cells, GenePorter lipofection reagent was used according to the manufacturer's protocol using a DNA/GenePorter ratio of 1:3. Typically, 21 μl of GenePorter reagent in 2 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were used per sample. 2 ml of 20% fetal bovine serum medium were added 5 h later. For transfection of PC12 cells, electroporation was used. Electroporation resulted in significantly higher efficiency of oligonucleotide uptake as assayed by monitoring uptake of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. For electroporation, a single-cell suspension was made by resuspending cells in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and forcing them several times through a 25 × 58-inch syringe needle. 0.4 ml of cell suspension in serum-free medium at 6 × 106 cells/ml was electroporated in a 2-mm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) using a BTX electroporator (five pulses, 150 V, 4 ms, 3-s interval). DNA concentration was adjusted to 20 μg with salmon sperm carrier DNA. Samples were cultured in about 3.5 ml of serum-free medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum afterward. RNA was extracted using the RNAWiz phenol extraction kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were scraped from plates 20 h post-transfection in 1 ml of cold PBS and spun down for 4 min at ∼2000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of RNAWiz. Precipitated and washed RNA pellets were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and concentrations were measured using a spectrophotometer. RNA was treated with 1 unit of RQ1 DNase for 30 min, and DNase was heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. PerkinElmer Life Sciences murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) 18-mer first strand primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for reverse transcription. The reverse transcription reaction was set up to contain 1–5 μg of RNA in 0.5 mm dNTP (Life Technologies), 5 μm oligo(dT)18 (Life Technologies), 5 mm MgCl2 in a 16-μl volume. The reaction was preincubated for 3 min at 80 °C, cooled to 42 °C, and spun down. 10× PCR buffer, 20 units of RNase Inhibitor (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 50 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were added to give a volume of 20 μl. The reaction was incubated for 60 min at 42 °C. Reverse transcriptase was heat-inactivated at 92 °C for 10 min. For the PCR reaction, 5 μl of the RT reaction, 200 μm dNTP, 1 μm of each primer, 10× Pfu buffer, and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) were used. PCR was performed (1 min at 94 °C; 36 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 60 °C; 1 min at 72 °C; 10 min at 72 °C) on a Hybaid Express thermal cycler. Primers for amplification of tau minigne constructs were located in the TAT splice donor and acceptor of pSBL3b of the Exon Trapping System (Life Technologies). The primers were SD2 (5′-GTGAACTGCACTGTGACAAGC-3′) and SA4 (5′-CACCTGAGGAGTGAATTGGTCG-3′), and the lengths of amplified products were 246 bp (10+) and 153 bp (10−). For amplification of endogenous tau from PC12 cells or AR42J cells, primers tauex9 (5′-CTGAAGCACCAGCCAGGAGG-3′) and tauex13 (5′-TGGTCTGTCTTGGCTTTGGC-3′) located in exon 9 and 13, as described by Grover et al. (21Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), were used. The length of the amplified products was 367 bp (10+) and 297 bp (10−). PCR conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95 °C; 42 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C; 40 s at 60 °C; 1 min at 72 °C; 10 min at 72 °C. For probing of splicing of exons 1 and 4, primers tauex1 (5′-CCC GCC AGG AGT TTG ACA CAAT) and tauex4 (5′-GGC CAC TCG AGC TTG ACTCA) were used. PCR conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95 °C; 42 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 50 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C; 10 min at 72 °C. The length of the amplified products was 365 nucleotides for the isoform including exons 2 and 3, 268 nucleotides for the isoform including exon 2 only, and 180 nucleotides for the isoform without exon 2 or 3. The linear range for PCR conditions was tested in pilot experiments with wild type and −1 tau minigenes in the range of 20–40 cycles and with endogenous tau from PC12 cells in the range of 25–45 cycles, and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The linear ranges were 28–38 cycles for tau minigenes and 32–42 cycles for rat tau. All subsequent reactions were carried out within the linear range. Samples were separated on 2% agarose gels containing 0.5‰ ethidium bromide. Data were recorded using a Gelprint 2000i CCD imaging system and quantitated with NIH Image. Proteins were extracted essentially as described by Janke et al. (25Janke C. Beck M. Holzer M. Bigl V. Arendt T. Brain Res. 2000; 5: 231-242Google Scholar). PC-12 cells (1.2 × 106 per sample) were used, and the homogenization step was omitted. Dephosphorylation was performed for 4 h at 67 °C using 18 units/ml alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equal amounts of protein were separated on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) with a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis and Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell. Membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-tau-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1:500 in PBS, 2% milk, 0.1% Tween) followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1:1000 in PBS, 2% milk, 0.1% Tween) for 60 min at room temperature. The signal was visualized using the Amersham ECL or ECL plus Western blotting detection kits and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands were quantitated on a FluorChem system (Alpha Innotech). A42J cells were grown on coverslips and transfected as described for COS-1 cells. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed for 12 min in fresh 3.7% paraformaldehyde in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were rinsed in PBS and incubated for 60 min with anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma), 1:500 in PBS. Coverslips were then rinsed three times for 8 min each in PBS and incubated for 60 min with rabbit anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories), 1:250 in PBS. Cells were rinsed three times for 8 min each and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS-SP confocal microscope using a × 100, 1.4 NA objective. Excitation was at 488 nm, and emission was detected between 525 and 575 nm. Single optical sections of 500-nm nominal thickness were collected. Phase images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope equipped with a MicroMax cooled CCD camera and Metamorph Imaging software. Raw images are shown. We sought to correct inclusion of exon 10 into tau mRNA by use of antisense oligonucleotides. Our approach was to introduce into cells 2′-O-methyl-oligoribonucleotides containing sequence complementary to the 3′ or 5′ splice site of exon 10 (Fig.1, a and c). In contrast to unmodified phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides, 2′-O-methyl-modified antisense oligonucleotides do not promote RNase H-mediated RNA degradation but rather form stable RNA-DNA hybrids (26Lamond A.I. Sproat B. Ryder U. Hamm J. Cell. 1989; 58: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our rationale was that the oligonucleotides prevent access of the splicing machinery to the splice junction and in this way may block the inclusion of the protected tau exon 10 into the mRNA (Fig. 1, a and c). To test whether antisense oligonucleotides targeted to tau exon 10 sequences were capable of altering the splicing behavior of tau exon 10, we used a previously characterized minigene system that recapitulates to a large extent the behavior of exon 10 in the context of the full-length tau gene (21Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The splicing pattern of exon 10 in the minigene was analyzed by RT-PCR on total RNA isolated 24 h after transfection of the minigene into COS-1 cells (Fig. 1 b). As expected, expression of the wild-type exon 10 minigene in COS-1 cells resulted in predominant exclusion of exon 10 (Fig. 1 b) (21Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The fraction of the 10+ tau isoform was 0.27 ± 0.08 (Fig.1 b). In contrast, similar to the situation in FTDP-17 patients, expression of exon 10 containing a single point mutation at position −1 resulted in predominant inclusion of exon 10 (21). The fraction of the 10+ tau isoform was now increased to 0.87 ± 0.06 (Fig. 1 b). Similar results were obtained with mutants at positions +3 and +14 (data not shown; Ref. 21Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing (data not shown). To test whether antisense oligonucleotides could reverse the inclusion of the mutant exon 10, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with exon 10 minigene containing the −1 mutation and increasing concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide E10α or E10β, targeted to the 5′ or 3′ splice junction of exon 10, respectively (Fig. 1 c). Both oligonucleotides prevented inclusion of exon 10 efficiently (Fig. 1,d and f). A half-maximal effect was achieved at 5–10 nm for either oligonucleotide (Fig. 1, dand f). A previously observed PCR band representing 10−/10+ heteroduplex of roughly constant intensity running below the 10+ band was observed in all samples and was not included in the quantitation (21Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The exclusion of exon 10 was oligonucleotide sequence-specific, since oligonucleotides containing the same nucleotide composition but in random order had no effect on exon 10 inclusion at concentrations up to 200 nm (Fig. 1, e and g). The fact that the RNA levels in control cells not treated with oligonucleotide and cells treated with concentrations of up to 200 nmoligonucleotide were identical confirms that the oligonucleotides did not act through an RNA degradation mechanism (Fig. 1, d ande). E10β contains a single mismatch to −1 tau at position 7. To assess whether this mismatch reduced the effectiveness of the oligonucleotide, we tested E10β on tau minigenes containing point mutation in position +3, which, similar to the −1 mutation, is also located toward the center of E10β or, alternatively, a tau minigene with a point mutation in position +14, which is just outside of the E10β target region (21Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). E10β was equally efficient in preventing the inclusion of exon 10 into either one of these mutated tau minigenes (Fig. 1 h). We conclude that a single mismatch in E10β to −1 tau does not significantly affect its inhibitory efficiency. To ensure that this effect was specific to the tau minigene and was not due to changes in the global splicing pattern in COS-1 cells caused by the presence of the oligonucleotides, the effect of E10α and E10β on the alternative splicing pattern of a minigene containing the adenovirus 2 E1A transcript was analyzed (Fig.2). E1A contains a single 3′ acceptor splice site but multiple upstream donor sites, which give raise to 9, 10, 12, and 13 S mRNAs (Fig. 2 a) (27Cáceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 28Bourgeois C.F. Popielarz M. Hildwein G. Stevenin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7347-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When COS-1 cells were co-transfected with E1A and either one of the antisense oligonucleotides, neither oligonucleotide had any effect on E1A splicing products (Fig. 2, b and c). Furthermore, neither oligonucleotide had any effect on a minigene containing the alternatively spliced fibronectin-EDI exon (29Kornblihtt A.R. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P. Srebrow A. Werbajh S. Muro A.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, the results demonstrate that antisense oligonucleotides complementary to tau exon 10 splice junctions effectively prevent inclusion of exon 10 during the splicing reaction, that this effects occurs in a oligonucleotide sequence-specific manner, and that the effect on tau exon 10 splicing is gene-specific. We next sought to test whether antisense oligonucleotides can also force exclusion of tau exon 10 in the context of the endogenous transcript. To this end, we used rat neuronal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. PC12 cells express predominantly the 10+ isoform and were thus useful to test whether modified oligonucleotides could shift the predominant form to the 10− isoform (30Smith C.J. Anderton B.H. Davis D.R. Gallo J.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The predominant inclusion of exon 10 in rat tau is most likely due to three nucleotide changes near the 5′ splice site, which resemble stem-loop-disrupting mutations in human tau (21Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15134-15143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of E10α or rat E10β. RatE10β is identical to E10β, except that it contains three nucleotide changes to make it fully complementary to the rat sequence. The alternative splicing pattern of rat tau mRNA was analyzed 24 h after transfection by RT-PCR using primers in exons 9 and 11 (Fig.3 a). As in the minigene system, both antisense oligonucleotides effectively excluded exon 10 from the tau mRNA (Fig. 3, b and d). A half-maximal effect was achieved at ∼1.5 μm for both E10α and rat E10β. Compared with the minigene system, the required concentrations were significantly higher due to lower transfection efficiency of PC12 cells with oligonucleotides (data not shown). Control antisense oligonucleotides of the same base composition as E10α or rat E10β, but in random order, had no effect on tau splicing at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 3, c and e). E10β targeted against the human tau gene had a 2–3-fold lower inhibitory activity than rE10β (data not shown). To test whether the effect of the antisense oligonucleotides was specific to tau exon 10, we probed the splicing pattern of the alternatively spliced exons 2 and 3 in tau using primers located in exons 1 and 4 (Fig. 4 a). Neither E10α nor rat E10β had any effect on the splicing pattern of exons 2 and 3 in endogenous tau (Fig. 4, b andc). Similarly, neither oligonucleotide had any effect on alternative splicing of the ARP3β gene, encoding an actin-related protein (31Jay P. Berge-Lefranc J.L. Massacrier A. Roessler E. Wallis D. Muenke M. Gastaldi M. Taviaux S. Cau P. Berta P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2921-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results show that inclusion of tau exon 10 in the context of its endogenous pre-mRNA is effectively prevented by the presence of antisense oligonucleotides, that this effects occurs in an oligonucleotide sequence-specific manner, and that the effect on tau exon 10 splicing is specific and has no effect on other alternative splicing events in the same gene. To probe whether the effect of antisense oligonucleotides was restricted to the RNA or was translated into a change in the relative levels of 3R and 4R protein isoforms, we performed Western blotting. PC12 cells were transfected with either a control oligonucleotide of scrambled sequence or either E10α or rat E10β. Cells were grown for 48 h and tau proteins isolated using several precipitation steps and dephosphorylated as previously described (25Janke C. Beck M. Holzer M. Bigl V. Arendt T. Brain Res. 2000; 5: 231-242Google Scholar). All six tau protein isoforms were detected using the phosphorylation-independent anti-tau-1 antibody. As expected, three pairs of bands were detected in PC12 cells (Fig.5 a). In each pair, the upper band represents the 4R isoform, and the lower band represents the 3R isoform (4Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 428-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 25Janke C. Beck M. Holzer M. Bigl V. Arendt T. Brain Res. 2000; 5: 231-242Google Scholar). The three pairs correspond to the isoforms containing exons 2 and 3 together, exon 2 only, or neither exon 2 nor exon 3. Exon 3 alone is never included (4Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 428-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In cells treated with control oligonucleotides, the 4R isoform was predominant in each pair (Fig.5 a). In contrast, treatment of PC12 cells with E10α or rat E10β resulted in the increased accumulation of the 3R isoform in all pairs as indicated by the appearance of the lower bands (Fig.5 a). Quantitative analysis of Western blots demonstrated that the relative decrease in 4R isoform varied from about 3-fold for the +2+3 isoform to about 15-fold for the +2−3 isoform (Fig.5 b). These results suggest that treatment with antisense oligonucleotides increased the relative amount of 3R protein in PC12 cells. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, and functional differences between the 3R and the 4R isoform have been reported, although"

Human neutrophil apoptosis, a process that regulates the fate and numbers of these potentially histotoxic cells in inflammatory sites, is profoundly delayed by the cell-permeable analog of cyclic AMP, dibutyryl-cAMP. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying cyclic AMP-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis, and we show that cyclic AMP inhibits loss of mitochondrial potential occurring during constitutive neutrophil apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cyclic AMP also suppresses caspase activation in these inflammatory cells. Despite increasing protein kinase A activity, this kinase is unlikely to mediate the effect of cyclic AMP on apoptosis because blockade of protein kinase A activation did not influence the survival effects of cyclic AMP. Further investigation of the signaling mechanism demonstrated that the delay of apoptosis is independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK activation. Our results suggest cyclic AMP delays neutrophil apoptosis via a novel, reversible, and transcriptionally independent mechanism. We show that proteasome activity in the neutrophil is vitally involved in this process, and we suggest that a balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins plays a key role in the powerful ability of cyclic AMP to delay neutrophil death.

Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to inflamed sites in response to infection and, following phagocytosis of the invading organism, release a variety of toxic granule contents into the phagolysosome containing the engulfed microorganisms (1Haslett C.

Academic Press, London1994: 223-243Google Scholar). The neutrophil normally has a short life span, and senescent neutrophils must be prevented from releasing their cytotoxic cell contents into the surrounding milieu because such liberation will lead to local tissue damage. To avoid this undesirable and inappropriate response, the neutrophil undergoes a regulated process of programmed cell death or apoptosis (3Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M.

Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar). In addition, the mitochondria play a central role through their ability to integrate anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic signals from Bcl-2 family members with coordinated activation of downstream caspases and nucleases (12Green D.R.

In many cell types it has been documented that apoptosis is accompanied by an early dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) with increased permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane allowing release of apoptosis-inducing factors such as cytochrome c (12Green D.R.

Neutrophils are thought to contain very few mitochondria, and it has not yet been fully established whether they have the capacity to play a functional role in regulation of neutrophil apoptosis (15Pryde J.G.

Although the apoptotic program in neutrophils is an intrinsic cell process, the rate of apoptosis can be altered dramatically by a number of agents (17Ward C. Dransfield I. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In particular, we and others (18Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I.

Hematol. 1998; 26: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that elevated levels of the second messenger cyclic AMP can prolong neutrophil longevity by delaying apoptosis.The cyclic AMP-dependent signaling transduction pathway is a multienzyme cascade that regulates a diverse array of biological processes. Specific ligation of appropriate G-protein-coupled receptors followed by adenylate cyclase activation leads to the production of cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP then binds to cytoplasmic protein kinase A, a tetrameric structure composed of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits, resulting in dissociation of the C subunits and subsequent phosphorylation of target proteins (21Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Although most components of this signaling cascade are well characterized, the molecular mechanisms underlying cyclic AMP-mediated modulation of apoptosis remain to be elucidated. The signaling mechanism(s) used by cyclic AMP to control these events is (are) likely to be complex and cell type-specific. For example, in contrast to the profound delay in the engagement of the apoptotic process in neutrophils (18Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Biochem. Biophys.

The signaling mechanism determining this ability to differentially influence apoptosis in diverse cell types remains to be elucidated.In the present study we show that elevated cyclic AMP inhibits activation of caspase-3 and loss in mitochondrial potential (ΔΨm) when neutrophils are aged in vitro,i.e. effects that appear to be associative rather that causative. Although we could demonstrate that cyclic AMP rapidly elevates endogenous PKA1activity in cultured neutrophils, blockade of PKA activation did not influence the observed delay in neutrophil apoptosis induced by cyclic AMP elevation. We also show that cyclic AMP elevation delays neutrophil apoptosis via a transcriptionally independent and reversible pathway, which does not require PI 3-kinase and MAPK activity. Together these data point to a novel mode of action for the major retardation of neutrophil apoptosis induced by cyclic AMP elevation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGranulocyte Isolation and CultureNeutrophils were purified from the peripheral blood of normal donors by dextran sedimentation (Sigma) followed by centrifugation on discontinuous PercollTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradients as described previously (25Haslett C.

Cells were cultured in flat-bottomed Falcon flexible wells (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% (v/v) autologous serum. As an index of necrosis, cell membrane integrity was assessed by the ability of cells to exclude the vital dye trypan blue (Sigma). Under all experimental conditions, greater than 99% of the cells consistently excluded trypan blue.Assessment of Granulocyte ApoptosisMorphologyCells were cyto-centrifuged, fixed in methanol, stained with Diff-QuikTM Gamidor Ltd. (Abingdon, Oxon, UK), and counted using oil immersion microscopy to determine the proportion of cells with distinctive apoptotic morphology (3Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J.

At least 500 cells were counted per slide with the observer blinded to the experimental conditions. The results were expressed as the mean percent apoptosis ± S.E.Annexin V BindingA separate and independent assessment of apoptosis was performed by flow cytometry using annexin V binding (annexin V-FLUOS, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to measure phosphatidylserine exposure on the surface of apoptotic cells. A working solution of annexin V-FLUOS was made from stock annexin V-FLUOS (0.1 μg/μl) diluted 1:3000 in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) supplemented with 2.5 mm CaCl2. Neutrophils (20 μl of 5 × 106/ml) were added to 200 μl of the working solution of annexin V-FLUOS before being assessed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) and analyzed on associated CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) software. All experiments were performed at least three times unless otherwise indicated.Measurement of PKA ActivityPKA activity was measured using Promega's SignaTECTTM cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA) Assay System, which utilizes biotinylated Kemptide (LRRASLG), a peptide substrate derived from the in vivo substrate pyruvate kinase. Neutrophils (5 × 106 cells) were preincubated with control buffer or 10 μm H89 (Calbiochem) for 1 h in PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+ (or for 19 h in DMEM Iscove's with 10% autologous serum) at 37 °C before being stimulated with 0.2 mm Bt2cAMP or 1 μm PGE2 (both from Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following one wash in ice-cold PBS, neutrophils were resuspended in 0.5 ml of cold extraction buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma)). The lysates were centrifuged (5 min at 4 °C; 14,000 × g) and the supernatants retained. The PKA reaction mixture consisting of 5 μl of 5× PKA Assay Buffer, 5 μl of cyclic AMP (0.025 mm), 5 μl of PKA-biotinylated peptide substrate (0.5 mm), 5 μl of [γ-33P]ATP mixture (5 μl of 0.5 mm ATP and 0.05 μl of [γ-33P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) 10 μCi/μl) was mixed gently and preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min (Promega, Southampton, UK). A control reaction without substrate was performed to determine background counts. The PKA activity reaction was initiated by adding 5 μl of the lysates to the reactants and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 12.5 μl of Termination Buffer to each sample (Promega, Southampton, UK). Aliquots (10 μl) from each terminated reaction sample were spotted onto prenumbered SAM2TM membrane squares (Promega, Southampton, UK). The SAM2TM membrane squares containing the spotted samples were then washed 1 time for 30 s with 200 ml of 2 m NaCl (Sigma) followed by 3 washes for 2 min with 200 ml of 2 m NaCl and then 4 washes for 2 min with 200 ml of 2 m NaCl in 1% H3PO4. Finally the Membrane squares were quickly washed in deionized water before being allowed to dry. PKA activity was measured by scintillation counting.Measurement of Mitochondrial DissipationChanges in mitochondrial potential were measured in neutrophils following stimulation using JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazocarbocyaniniodide (Molecular Probes), a cationic dye that exhibits potential dependent accumulation in mitochondria indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green (525 nm) to red (590 nm) (27Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial depolarization is therefore indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence intensity ratio. JC-1 (10 μg/ml) was diluted in PBS from stock JC1 (5 mg/ml in Me2SO) and added to neutrophils (1 × 106/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. Neutrophil mitochondria labeled with JC-1 were examined by confocal fluorescent microscopy together with TO-PRO-3 (1 μm) (Molecular Probes) (28Van Hooijdonk C.A Glade C.P. Van Erp P.E. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to assess neutrophils with necrotic morphology. Alternatively, neutrophils labeled with JC-1 were assessed by flow cytometric analysis using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) and analyzed on associated CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) software. Non-apoptotic neutrophils were removed using immunomagnetic separation with sheep anti-mouse IgG-Dynabeads (Dynabeads M-450, Dynal, Mersyside, UK) coated with the murine anti-neutrophil antibody 3G8 (anti-CD16; a gift from Dr. J. Unkeless, Mount Sinai Medical School, New York). Cells were mixed with washed antibody-coated magnetic beads on a rotary mixer at 4 °C for 20 min, and the beads removed magnetically by two 3-min stationary magnetic contacts (Dynal Magnetic Particle Concentrator, MPC-1) to yield an apoptotic neutrophil preparation. After purification, the apoptotic neutrophils were labeled with JC-1 as described previously.Western BlottingHuman neutrophils (5 × 106/ml) were cultured with or without Bt2cAMP (0.2 mm) at 37 °C for various time points as detailed under “Results.” Cytoplasmic extracts were then prepared from equivalent numbers of cells (10 × 106 cells). To minimize problems with proteolysis, lysates were prepared using methods normally used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay preparations (26Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G.

Samples were loaded onto a 12.5% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide mini-gel under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 60 V for 1 h before overnight incubation at 4 °C with an antibody specific to caspase-3 (catalog number 65906E, PharMingen). After washing, blots were incubated with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:2000 and developed using a commercial chemiluminescence detection system (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Further MaterialsFurther specific materials were obtained as follows: (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS, PD98059, SB203580, and cycloheximide (Calbiochem); lactacystin and epoxomicin (Affiniti, Mamhead, UK); and LY294002 (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, UK).Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using the Student'st test or by analysis of variance with comparisons between groups made using the Newman-Keuls procedure. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05.DISCUSSIONHuman neutrophils undergo apoptosis, a process that is centrally important in the resolution of inflammation. It has been shown previously that cyclic AMP is an important regulator of neutrophil apoptosis (18Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Parvathenani L.K. Buescher E.S. Chacon-Cruz E. Beebe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6736-6743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Ottonello L. Gonella R. Dapino P. Sacchetti C. Dallegri F. Exp. Hematol. 1998; 26: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar), yet little is known of the signaling mechanism by which by cyclic AMP controls neutrophil cell death. The studies herein have established that cyclic AMP acts upstream of caspase-3 activation to inhibit the apoptotic pathway in neutrophils. For the first time, it was also demonstrated that neutrophils contain a small but significant number of mitochondria, which exhibit a loss of membrane potential during constitutive apoptosis, which can be delayed by cyclic AMP elevation. We are currently investigating whether loss of mitochondrial membrane potential occurs before other indices of apoptosis in neutrophils, such as phosphatidylserine exposure and nuclear condensation. This would help ascertain whether loss of mitochondrial potential during neutrophil apoptosis, shown to trigger apoptosis in other cell types, has a similar function in neutrophils and whether Bt2cAMP can directly affect loss of mitochondrial potential to delay neutrophil apoptosis.It has been suggested that PKA plays an important role in cyclic AMP-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis (18Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Parvathenani L.K. Buescher E.S. Chacon-Cruz E. Beebe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6736-6743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Ottonello L. Gonella R. Dapino P. Sacchetti C. Dallegri F. Exp. Hematol. 1998; 26: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that cyclic AMP analogs, which selectively activate type I PKA, attenuate neutrophil apoptosis, compared with analogs that preferentially activate type II PKA suggesting that that type I PKA is necessary and sufficient to mediate the cyclic AMP-induced delay in human neutrophil apoptosis (19Parvathenani L.K. Buescher E.S. Chacon-Cruz E. Beebe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6736-6743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We suggest, alternatively, that PKA activation by cyclic AMP is not responsible for the major apoptosis-retarding influences of cyclic AMP in neutrophils. Indeed, we have demonstrated directly that cyclic AMP elevation in neutrophils stimulates an increase in PKA activity, which is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors. Importantly, however, blockade of PKA was not sufficient to reverse the anti-apoptotic effect of cyclic AMP, implying that this molecule has little or no role in the cyclic AMP signaling pathway responsible for delay of neutrophil apoptosis.Previous publications (18Rossi A.G. Cousin J.M. Dransfield I. Lawson M.F. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Parvathenani L.K. Buescher E.S. Chacon-Cruz E. Beebe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6736-6743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have implicated a role for PKA in cyclic AMP regulation of neutrophil apoptosis using concentrations of H89 greater than 10 μm. The specificity of H89 at these concentrations is questionable, and it has been published (47Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3919) Google Scholar) that H89 may inhibit several other kinases, some with potency similar to or greater than that for PKA. We propose that failure to directly measure PKA activity together with the use of high and possibly nonspecific concentrations of H89 could have led to misinterpretation of previous data. We have demonstrated that 10 μm H89 is sufficient to block PKA activity for extended culture periods and is active in the presence of autologous serum. The failure therefore of both H89 and (Rp)-8-Br-cAMPS, a highly specific inhibitor of PKA, to reverse cyclic AMP-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis points to a novel signaling pathway used by cyclic AMP to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis, which is independent of PKA activation.There have been a few studies reporting PKA-independent effects of cyclic AMP; however, little has been elucidated of the alternative signaling pathways downstream of cyclic AMP. Pharmacological blockade of the MAPK and PI 3-kinase signaling cascades in this study suggest that neither of these signaling pathways are likely to be important in the cyclic AMP-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis. There has been interest in the discovery that cyclic AMP can bind specifically to and activate small guanine nucleotide exchange factors which, when bound by cyclic AMP, activate the small Ras-like GTPase, Rap1 (48DeRooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 49Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The biological function of Rap1 is still unclear, but it has been proposed that activation of this small GTPase may feed into MAPK signaling pathways (50Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As an approach to establishing if Rap1 has a role in cyclic AMP-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis, we have blocked Rap1 activity using the Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which has been reported to inhibit specifically the small GTPases Rap1, Ras, and Rac (51Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have tested GGTI-286, a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor, which blocks geranylgeranylation required by Rap1 to achieve its mature, biologically active form (52Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26770-26773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus our preliminary experiments suggest that Rap1 is not involved in cyclic AMP-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis (data not shown): however, this area of research is still under investigation. Our studies are in accord with a very recent publication that demonstrates that cyclic AMP-dependent inhibition of interleukin-5 from human T lymphocytes is not mediated by PKA or by the Rap1 signaling pathway (53Staples K.J. Bergmann M. Tomita K. Houslay M.D. McPhee I. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. Newton R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2074-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Regulation of neutrophil apoptosis is thought to depend on the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic death factors expressed in the cell (17Ward C. Dransfield I. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 54Akgul C. Moulding D.A. Edwards S.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Neutrophils contain death regulator proteins, including Bax and Bad, and also express some members of the anti-apoptotic family such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 (17Ward C. Dransfield I. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 54Akgul C. Moulding D.A. Edwards S.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that neutrophil longevity may be prolonged by the synthesis of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl-1 (55Moulding D.A. Quale J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that cyclic AMP effects are mediated by such a mechanism in the retardation of neutrophil apoptosis since we have demonstrated that cyclic AMP-mediated delay of neutrophil apoptosis does not require gene transcription. Furthermore, “wash out” experiments have revealed that retardation of neutrophil apoptosis is rapidly lost when Bt2cAMP is removed from culture, even after incubation periods that should permit new protein synthesis.Together, these data suggest a mechanism whereby cyclic AMP does not stimulate production of a survival protein but may alternatively induce post-transitional modifications in the neutrophil to promote survival. One potential mechanism for cyclic AMP-mediated retardation of neutrophil apoptosis may involve cyclic AMP specifically targeting a death protein(s) to the proteasome for degradation. We have demonstrated that blockade of proteasome activity results in a dramatic loss of the pro-survival effect of cyclic AMP. We speculate that cyclic AMP may be involved in the post-translational modification of a death protein, which targets the neutrophil proteasome. If cyclic AMP stimulation is removed or proteasome activity is blocked, then the accumulation of a death protein(s) would be predicted to permit the constitutive death pathway of neutrophils to be reconstituted. Further characterization of proteasome activity in this signaling pathway and possible death protein targets of cyclic AMP are currently under investigation.In conclusion, cyclic AMP delays neutrophil apoptosis via a novel, reversible, and transcriptionally independent mechanism.

The thromboxane A2(TXA2) mimetic U46619 rapidly activated both small GTPases independently of integrin αIIbβ3activation. U46619, which leads to the activation of G12/G13 and Gq did not induce Rac activation in Gαq-deficient platelets but was able to activate Rho, to stimulate actin polymerization and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate formation, and to induce shape change. Rac activation by U46619 in wild-type platelets could be blocked by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ and was partially sensitive to apyrase and AR-C69931MX, an antagonist of the Gi-coupled ADP receptor. Cyclic AMP, which completely blocks platelet function, inhibited the U46619-induced activation of Gq and G12/G13 as well as of Rac and Rho. In contrast, cGMP, which has no effect on platelet shape change blocked only activation of Gq and Rac. These data demonstrate that Rho and Rac are differentially regulated through heterotrimeric G-proteins. The G12/G13-mediated Rho activation is involved in the shape change response, whereas Rac is activated through Gq and is not required for shape change. Cyclic AMP and cGMP differentially interfere with U46619-induced Rho and Rac activation at least in part by selective effects on the regulation of individual G-proteins through the TXA2receptor.

The mechanisms by which Rho and Rac become activated through G-protein-coupled receptors in platelets are unclear. Receptors activated by thrombin or thromboxane A2 (TXA2) couple to Gq and G12/G13. In addition, thrombin but not TXA2 is able to induce activation of Gi in platelet membrane fractions (18Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J.

TXA2 and thrombin are unable to induce phospholipase C activation as well as platelet aggregation and secretion in the absence of Gαq, whereas induction of platelet shape change through the activation of G12/G13 appears to be basically unaffected (18Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar,22Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate by direct determination of Rho and Rac activation that both small GTPases become rapidly activated by TXA2 in an integrin αIIbβ3-independent manner. We used platelets from Gαq-deficient mice to show that Rho and Rac are differentially regulated. Rho activation occurs through G12/G13 and is involved in processes underlying platelet shape change, including PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation. In contrast, Rac activation is mediated by Gq and is not required for shape change. Cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP differentially interfere with Rac and Rho activation in platelets at least in part by affecting receptor-mediated activation of Gq and G12/G13.

Anti-Rac monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-RhoA monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antisera against G-protein α-subunits have been described previously (21Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All other reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise indicated. Y-27632 was kindly provided by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Saitama, Japan). Whole blood was collected from normal and Gαq-deficient mice (129/Sv × C57BL/6) anesthetized with pentobarbital by puncturing the inferior vena cava with syringes containing acid citrate dextrose (1/9 volume). The blood from 3–4 Gαq-deficient mice and wild-type mice was pooled for each platelet experiment. Blood was diluted with half the volume of Hepes-Tyrode’s buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) containing 0.35% human serum albumin, and platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation for 8 min at 250 × g at 37 °C. Thereafter, prostacyclin at a final concentration of 500 nmwas added to the platelet-rich plasma, and platelets were pelleted twice by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 37 °C. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode’s buffer at a density of 1 × 109 platelets per milliliter in the presence of 0.02 unit/ml of the ADP scavenger apyrase (adenosine-5′-triphosphate diphosphohydrolase) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For inositol lipid analysis, platelets were labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate during 50 min in a phosphate-free washing buffer (pH 6.5) at 37 °C. 32P-Labeled platelets were then washed once in the same buffer and finally suspended at a final concentration of 1 × 109 cells/ml (pH 7.3). Optical aggregation experiments were conducted in a two-channel aggregometer (Chronolog). The amount of activated cellular Rho and Rac was determined by precipitation with a fusion protein consisting of GST and the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-RBD) or the Rac-binding domain of PAK1 (PBD) as described (11Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 24Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Platelets were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and clarified cell lysates were incubated with GST-RBD or GST-PBD (20 μg of beads) at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. The bead pellet was finally suspended in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. RhoA and Rac were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and GTPases were detected using a specific monoclonal antibody against RhoA and Rac. SDS-PAGE of photolabeled proteins was performed on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Photolabeled membrane proteins were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. Blotting of membrane proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, processing of immunoblots, and detection of immunoreactive proteins by chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany) have been described previously (23Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped, and the cytoskeleton was immediately extracted by adding one volume of ice-cold twice-concentrated cytoskeleton buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 as described previously (25Grondin P.

After 10 min at 4 °C, the cytoskeleton was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and a fraction of the supernatant was taken as a control. Pellets were washed once in cytoskeleton buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 and once with the same buffer without Triton X-100. Cytoskeleton and a fraction of the post-spin supernatants as well as of the initial lysate were then immediately prepared for SDS-PAGE. Reactions were stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (1/1, v/v) containing 0.4 nHCl, and lipids were immediately extracted following the modified procedure of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43301) Google Scholar, 28Gratacap M.P. Payrastre B. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Biol.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 lipids were immediately deacylated by 20% methylamine and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography on a Whatman Partisphere 5 SAX column (Whatman International Ltd., UK) as described previously (28Gratacap M.P.

Isolated platelets were preincubated under the indicated conditions. Thereafter, platelets were incubated in the absence or presence of U46619 (5 μm) for 5 s at 37 °C and then fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde, 3.75% glutaraldehyde, 0.06 mm cacodylate buffer, and 3.4 mm CaCl2. The fixed platelets were suction-filtered onto Nucleopore polycarbonate filters (0.45 μm), which had been preincubated with 10 μg/ml polylysine. Filters were washed three times with 0.9% NaCl and dehydrated stepwise in aqueous ethanol. After exchange of ethanol for hexadimethyldisilazane, samples were air-dried and sputtered with gold. Scanning electron microscopy was carried out on a Zeiss-Gemini instrument using a beam voltage of 5 kV. After a preincubation of platelets for 20 min with or without Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS (cAMP) (100 μm) or 8-pCPT-cGMP (cGMP) (1 mm), platelet membranes were prepared and photolabeled as described (21Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell membranes (50–100 μg of protein per assay tube) were incubated at 30 °C in a buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). After 3 min of preincubation in the absence and presence of receptor agonist, samples were incubated for another 15 min with 10–20 nm[α-32P]GTP azidoanilide (130 kBq per tube). [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide was synthesized and purified as described (29Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 286-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Samples were washed, dissolved in labeling buffer, and irradiated as described (21Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Photolabeled membranes were pelleted, and proteins were predenatured in SDS. Solubilized membranes were preabsorbed with Protein A-Sepharose beads, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described (23Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human as well as wild-type and Gαq-deficient mouse platelets were incubated with the TXA2 mimeticU46619, and activation of Rho and Rac was investigated after different incubation times using the pull-down assays based on GST-Rho-binding domain or GST-Rac-binding domain fusion proteins (11Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 24Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Stimulation of human and mouse platelets by U46619 led to a very rapid and sustained activation of Rho and Rac, which reached a maximum a few seconds after addition of the stimulus (Fig.1, A and B). In contrast, no activation of Rac was observed in Gαq-deficient platelets stimulated by U46619 (Fig.1 B). However, in the absence of Gαq the TXA2 analogue still induced a Rho activation with a time course indistinguishable from that observed in wild-type platelets (Fig. 1 A). Quantification of precipitated Rho and of Rho in the lysates by densitometric analysis of immunoblots demonstrated that the amount of activated Rho in Gαq-deficient platelets exposed to U46619 was the same as that observed in wild-type platelets and amounted to about 10% of the total Rho (data not shown). These data indicate that the Gq-mediated pathway is not required for Rho activation in platelets. Gαq-deficient platelets do not show any aggregation and secretion in response to U46619 (22Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Thus, the sustained Rho activation observed in Gαq-deficient platelets is obviously independent of integrin αIIbβ3activation and feedback effects of secreted stimuli. To test whether Rac activation was dependent on integrin αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation, we pretreated platelets with the GP IIb/IIIa antagonist SR 121566A (30Herault J.P. Peyrou V. Savi P. Bernat A. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as with the anti-GP IIb/IIIa antibody JON/A (31Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Rackebrandt K. Gessner J.E. Zirngibl H. Blood. 2000; 96: 2520-2527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which completely inhibited aggregation induced by U46619 (Fig.2 A). Rac activation by U46619in mouse platelets was not affected by pretreatment of platelets with GP IIb/IIIa blocking agents (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, blockade of integrin αIIbβ3 in human platelets by the peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) had no effect on both Rho and Rac activation (Fig. 2 C). These data demonstrate that the rapid activation of Rho and Rac after platelet activation occurs independently of integrin outside-in-signaling. The lack of Rac activation in the absence of Gαqindicates that the Gq-mediated pathway is upstream of Rac. Rac activation by U46619 required an increase in the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, because it was strongly inhibited by pretreatment of platelets with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM and the phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor RO-31-8220 or the extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA (Fig. 3, A and B). To test whether an increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration would induce Rac activation, we incubated cells withA23187. Ionophore treatment resulted in a robust activation of Rac (Fig. 3 C). The dependence of Rac activation on Gq, PLC, and Ca2+ suggests that a direct pathway mediated by phospholipase Cβ is involved in Rac activation or that Rac activation follows the Gq-mediated release of mediators, which in turn may activate Gi-coupled receptors. ADP, which is an important mediator of some TXA2 effects, can activate various receptors, including the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor (32Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D. Li G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.-B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). To exclude a possible contribution of Gi activated through U46619-induced ADP release, we degraded ADP with apyrase or blocked the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor with AR-C69931MX. Apyrase and AR-C69931MX completely blocked ADP-induced aggregation (Fig. 3 D). Both apyrase and AR-C69931MX partially inhibited the U46619-induced Rac activation in wild-type platelets (Fig. 3 D) indicating that ADP and the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor are involved in the effect of U46619 on Rac activation. To test whether Gi activation alone is sufficient to lead to activation of Rac in platelets, we tested the effect of thrombin and ADP on GTP loading of Rac in Gαq-deficient platelets in which both agonists induce activation of G12/G13 and Gi (18Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Although thrombin and ADP and ADP+U46619 led to Rac activation in wild-type platelets (data not shown), no Rac activation could be observed in response to these stimuli in Gαq-deficient platelets (Fig. 3 E). This indicates that Gi activation alone is not sufficient for Rac activation and that a direct Gq/PLCβ-mediated mechanism as well as the Ca2+-dependent release of ADP and possibly other mediators are required for full Rac activation in platelets. Platelet activation is accompanied by rapid actin polymerization, a process that is regulated through the formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (33Janmey P.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 763-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 34Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The major PtdIns(4,5)P2-forming enzyme, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, has been shown to be regulated by Rho and Rac (35Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 36Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Especially in platelets, evidence has been provided that Rac links receptors to PtdIns(4,5)P2formation and actin polymerization via stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (16Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 17Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although a considerable portion of actin polymerization during platelet activation is mediated in an integrin αIIbβ3-dependent manner, some actin polymerization accompanies the protrusion of filopodia and lamellipodia during platelet shape change (18Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 38Wurzinger L.J. Adv. Anat. Embryol.

Accordingly, in Gαq-deficient platelets, which do not aggregate in response to TXA2 receptor activation, U46619 induced an increase in the Triton X-100-insoluble actin fraction (Fig.4, A and B). The latter was comparable to the effect observed in wild-type platelets treated with a GP IIb/IIIa blocking antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). To test whether there was still some receptor-dependent PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation in the absence of Gq-mediated Rac activation, we determined PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in response to U46619 in wild-type and Gαq-deficient platelets. Although there was no Rac activation in Gαq-deficient platelets in response toU46619, a significant increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels by about 30% could be observed shortly after addition of the TXA2 analogue, which was about half of that seen in wild-type mouse platelets (Fig. 4 C). At longer times of stimulation (3 min), the PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels decreased in wild-type platelets probably due to the activation of phospholipase C, whereas in Gαq-deficient platelets, which do not show any phospholipase C activation, PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels remained elevated. These data show that platelets can form PtdIns(4,5)P2 and undergo shape change in response toU46619 by a mechanism independent of Ca2+ and Rac activation. To test whether the Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated pathway is involved in the formation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 found in Gαq-deficient platelets, we preincubated wild-type platelets and platelets lacking Gαq with 10 μm of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Although PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation in wild-type platelets was partially reduced, the U46619-dependent formation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in Gαq-deficient platelets was completely blocked by Y27632 (Fig. 4 D). This clearly suggests that PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation in platelets is under dual control through a pathway mediated by Gq/Rac and G12/13/Rho/Rho-kinase. The two main intracellular mediators of platelet inhibition, cAMP and cGMP strongly inhibit platelet aggregation but have been shown to differentially affect platelet shape change. While cAMP blocks the platelet shape change response, cGMP has no effect on shape change of human or mouse platelets (Fig. 5, Ref.18Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Preincubation of mouse platelets with prostacyclin which induces cAMP formation through the prostacyclin receptor or with the cAMP analogue Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS strongly suppressed U46619-induced Rho activation in wild-type (Fig.6 A) and Gαq-deficient platelets (data not shown). In contrast, the cGMP analogue 8-pCPT-cGMP was without effect (Fig. 6 A). Activation of Rac by U46619 was, however, strongly inhibited by the cGMP analogue as well as by prostacyclin and the cAMP analogue. Very similar effects of cyclic nucleotides on Rho and Rac activation were observed in human platelets (Fig. 6 B). Thus, cAMP inhibits both Rac and Rho activation while cGMP blocks only receptor-mediated Rac activation.Figure 6Effect of cyclic nucleotides on RhoA and Rac activation. Platelets from wild-type mice (A) or human (B) were preincubated for 20 min with Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS (cAMP) (100 μm) or 8-pCPT-cGMP (cGMP) (1 mm) or for 1 min with prostacyclin (PGI 2, 500 nm). Thereafter, stimulation was started by the addition of U46619 (1 μm). After 10 s, activation was stopped by addition of ice-cold 2× RIPA buffer. The amount of activated Rho and Rac was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are representative of three independent experiments. Shown are blots of the precipitates (Rho/Rac pull-down) as well as of 40 μl of the lysates (500 μl).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Rho activation by U46619 appears to be mediated by G12/G13, whereas Rac involves Gq, we tested whether cAMP and cGMP interfere with TXA2receptor-mediated activation of Gq and/or G12/G13. Photolabeling of receptor-activated G-proteins in mouse platelet membranes and subsequent immunoprecipitation of individual G-protein α-subunits showed that, in wild-type mouse platelets, activated TXA2 receptors couple to Gq, G12, and G13 (18Klages B.

This pathway is thought to work in a constitutive fashion, but little is known about possible regulation of the individual steps, i.e. direction and speed of sorting out of the early endosome, fusion with the recycling endosome, and exit from this compartment. The mammalian glucose transporter GLUT4 is an integral membrane protein specific to muscle and fat cells that undergoes both constitutive recycling (2Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J.

The importance of this phenomenon is highlighted by evidence that GLUT4 externalization is defective in the pathophysiological state of insulin resistance underlying type 2 diabetes (4King P.A.

Despite extensive work, the intracellular donor compartments remain poorly defined as do the effects of insulin on the route or the velocity of inter-compartmental GLUT4 traffic. This paucity in knowledge is largely because of shortcomings of biochemical approaches to isolate and characterize the diverse intracellular compartments populated by GLUT4 and by the limited intracellular space available for detailed immunolocalization in primary fat and muscle tissue and in cultured adipocytes. Here we used L6 myoblasts stably expressing GLUT4 bearing an extracellular Myc epitope (GLUT4myc) to examine the time course and route of GLUT4 intracellular transit. The subcellular distribution of GLUT4myc in L6 muscle cells was previously characterized (7Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A.

Ninety percent of this protein was sequestered intracellularly (9Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), more than half of it in compartments that segregate from the constitutively recycling isoform GLUT1 (8Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin mobilizes GLUT4myc to attain a new steady state distribution where 30% is exposed at the cell surface (9Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This translocation occurred with a t12 of 3.5 min, resembling the rate of GLUT4 exocytosis in adipose cells (2Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J.

J. 1991; 278: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The movement of GLUT4myc to the surface of L6 myoblasts was prevented by expression of dominant negative mutants of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase and Akt/PKB (11Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and was sensitive to agents that prevent actin remodeling (7Wang Q. Khayat Z.

Insulin-dependent translocation of GLUT4myc differed from basal state recycling of GLUT4myc in its sensitivity to tetanus toxin, suggesting that basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc arrive at the plasma membrane on distinct vesicles (14Randhawa V.K. Bilan P.J. Khayat Z.A. Daneman N. Liu Z. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Peng X.R. Coppola T. Regazzi R. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2403-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Like the endogenous GLUT4 of muscle and adipose cells, GLUT4myc also responds to other stimuli such as hyperosmolarity (9Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and dinitrophenol (15Khayat Z.A. Tsakiridis T. Ueyama A. Somwar R. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1487-C1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When partially detached from the substratum, L6 myoblasts round up and thus offer the opportunity to discern with clarity the intracellular compartments populated by GLUT4myc using fluorescence microscopy. Here we take advantage of the exofacial exposure of the Myc epitope to follow the journey of GLUT4myc during its recycling back to the cell surface. After labeling with an anti-Myc antibody the transporter summoned to the cell surface in response to insulin, we analyze its temporal and spatial intracellular coordinates during its internalization in the absence and presence of insulin. Strikingly, we observed that insulin expedites GLUT4 transit into and out of the recycling endosome. Dominant-negative mutants of PI 3-kinase or PKB blocked the insulin-dependent acceleration of GLUT4myc traffic. These results provide evidence for a previously unknown action of insulin, i.e. to speed up inter-endosomal GLUT4 traffic. This increase may be the basis for the acceleration of GLUT4 recycling caused by the hormone. The following antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: rabbit (A-14) and mouse (9E10) antibodies against the c-Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse antibodies against human transferrin receptor (TfR) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), fluorescein isothiocyanate, Cy3, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, ON, Canada). 9E10 was also a generous gift of Dr. Mike Moran.

A subclone of the L6 rat skeletal muscle cell line stably expressing GLUT4 with an exofacial Myc epitope (L6-GLUT4myc) has been described previously (7Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A.

Where indicated, L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts were transiently transfected using the liposome-mediated Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Marker DNA (enhanced green fluorescent protein) was transfected in a 1:4 ratio with construct DNA. For recycling studies, L6 GLUT4myc myoblasts grown in 24-well tissue culture plates were incubated at 37 °C with anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (8 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin. At the indicated times, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min. This was followed by incubation in PBS containing 5% goat serum and reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000) at 4 °C for 1 h, washing six times with PBS, and incubation with 1 ml/well o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.4 mg/ml) for 20–30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.25 ml of 3 n HCl, and the optical absorbance was measured at 492 nm. The total content of GLUT4myc was calculated by permeabilizing the cells using 0.1% Triton X-100 before incubation with 9E10 antibody, as reported earlier (9Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The amount of GLUT4myc label at each time point is expressed as the percent of the total GLUT4myc (Fig. 1). For endocytosis studies, L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts grown in 24-well tissue culture plates were stimulated with 100 nm insulin at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS and labeled with 9E10 (8 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C in the absence of insulin. Medium pre-warmed to 37 °C was added, and the plates were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin for indicated times. Where indicated, 100 nm wortmannin was added during the 1-h incubation with 9E10 and maintained in 100 nm wortmannin throughout the internalization period. At the indicated times cells were placed on ice, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and fixed briefly with 3% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000) at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by washes and reaction with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as described above for GLUT4myc recycling. Cell surface levels of GLUT4myc are expressed as a percentage of the amount of cell surface GLUT4myc on control cells at 0 min of internalization. L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts were detached from the substratum using nominally Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. This condition was used instead of trypsin to preserve the GLUT4myc and insulin receptor molecules on the cell surface. Rounded-up (semi-attached) myoblasts offer the opportunity to study topological distribution of intracellular compartments by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Flattened myoblasts (and other cell types) afford considerably less resolution by this approach, especially in differentiating surface-bound from intracellular epitopes. Total removal of Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu is reported to be inconsequential to GLUT4 translocation (18Cheatham B. Volchuk A. Kahn C.R. Wang L. Rhodes C.J. Klip A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15169-15173Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). After resuspending in HEPES-buffered RPMI, myoblasts were allowed to settle on coverslips for 10 min while treating them with or without 100 nm insulin at 37 °C. To determine the overall cellular localization of GLUT4myc in these rounded-up myoblasts, the cells were immediately fixed in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 20 min. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and blocked for 20 min with 5% goat serum. GLUT4 was detected using anti-Myc polyclonal antibody A-14 (1.33 μg/ml), and the TfR-containing compartment was detected using monoclonal anti-TfR antibody (1:1,000). These antibodies were added to the cells for 1 h followed by secondary antibodies (1:250) along with the DNA stain TO-PRO3 (2 μm). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides and imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M laser scanning confocal microscope 510. To determine endocytic transit of cell surface-labeled GLUT4myc, rounded-up myoblasts resuspended in HEPES-buffered RPMI were allowed to settle (semi-attach) on coverslips for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin. The coverslips were transferred to 4 °C to halt all vesicular traffic and then incubated in the absence of insulin for 1 h at 4 °C with Hepes-buffered RPMI medium containing anti-Myc antibodies (1.33 μg/ml polyclonal A-14 or 4 μg/ml of monoclonal 9E10 as indicated). Coverslips were then washed, maintained at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 10 or 20 min, and then immersed in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 20 min followed by quenching with ice-cold 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and blocked for 20 min with 5% goat serum. Primary antibodies against TfR (1:1,000) or EEA1 (1:250) were added to the cells for 1 h followed by fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250) along with the DNA stain TO-PRO3 (2 μm). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides and imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M laser scanning confocal microscope 510. Secondary antibodies used in this study showed no detectable labeling of L6-GLUT4myc cells when incubated in the absence of primary antibodies. Gain settings for the photomultiplier tube were adjusted for each experiment to bring all images within the linear range of the detector. Images of Cy5 or TO-PRO3 labeling were given a false blue color to aid in visualization. More than 100 cells were observed per condition per experiment, and representative images of each condition are shown. The extent of colocalization between GLUT4myc and EEA1 or TfR signals was quantified using NIH Image (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). The yellow signal generated by overlap between the pair of fluors was separated from the remaining image using the Select Color Range option in Adobe Photoshop. For panels i–n in Fig. 8 the green (green fluorescent protein) channel of the RGB Photoshop image was replaced with the blue (TfR) channel for purposes of quantitation. The intensity of the yellow signal selected in this way was then expressed as a percentage of the intensity of the entire GLUT4myc signal. To determine endocytic transit of rhodamine-conjugated transferrin, rounded-up myoblasts resuspended in HEPES-buffered RPMI were allowed to settle (semi-attach) on coverslips while being loaded for 10 min at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml of rhodamine-transferrin. Coverslips were transferred to HEPES-buffered RPMI devoid of rhodamine-transferrin and maintained at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 nminsulin for 10 or 20 min, then placed directly in ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+for 20 min followed by quenching with 50 mmNH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and blocked for 20 min with 5% goat serum. Primary antibody against TfR (1:1,000) was added to the cells for 1 h followed by secondary goat anti-mouse alexa 488 antibody (1:500) along with the DNA stain TO-PRO3 (2 μm). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides and imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M laser scanning confocal microscope 510. L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts grown to confluency in six-well tissue culture plates were serum-starved for 4 h, then incubated without or with 100 nm insulin at 37 °C for 30 min. Some wells were then washed with PBS three times, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in the absence of insulin, washed three times again, and analyzed at this point; the other half was incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C before analysis. All cells were then rinsed twice with PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed with 300 μl/well 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 5 μm E-64, 1 μmleupeptin, 2.5 μm pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 nm okadaic acid. After scraping the lysates, they were passed 5 times through a 25-guage syringe and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. Once cooled to 20 °C, the lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phosphothreonine 308 of PKB (phospho-Akt (Thr-308), New England Biolabs, Mississauga, ON). L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin, and any GLUT4myc molecule arriving at the cell surface was labeled with anti-Myc antibody 9E10 during the incubation. In the absence of insulin, half-maximal recycling occurred after 2 h, whereas insulin sharply increased the rate of GLUT4myc recycling, reducing the half-time to about 40 min (Fig.1). This result confirms that GLUT4myc behaves as reported for the endogenous GLUT4 in adipose cells (2Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the rate of recycling of GLUT4myc is similar to that determined for a chimeric protein encoding the exofacial portion of the TfR and the cytosolic tail of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase vpTR (or IRAP) (20Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4787-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Garza L.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 also shows that virtually all the cellular GLUT4myc molecules were available for surface labeling within 6 h, establishing that the antibody-labeled transporter is able to recycle without undergoing degradation. Insulin accelerated this recycling so that all GLUT4myc molecules were labeled within 3 h. To measure the rate of removal of GLUT4myc from the cell surface, L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts were stimulated with insulin for 30 min to expose GLUT4myc at the cell surface. This treatment consistently increases cell-surface GLUT4myc by 2–3-fold in these cells (7Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Such an increase is consistent with the change observed in isolated skeletal muscles (22Mu J. Brozinick Jr., J.T. Valladares O. Bucan M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1085-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 23Kawanaka K. Han D.H. Gao J. Nolte L.A. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20101-20107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The exofacially exposed Myc epitope was then labeled at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibody for 1 h and then allowed to internalize upon warming to 37 °C. Insulin and/or wortmannin were added during the internalization period to examine their effects on disappearance of GLUT4myc from the cell surface. Fig.2 shows that labeled GLUT4myc disappeared from the cell surface with a t12 of 3 min for all treatments, fitting a one-phase exponential decay curve (r 2 values: control, 0.970; insulin, 0.928; wortmannin, 0.999; insulin plus wortmannin, 0.999). Tukey’s pairwise analysis of variance of all values at each time point indicated that only the 30-min insulin re-addition and 30-min insulin re-addition plus wortmannin points were significantly different from one another (p < 0.05). These results suggest that there is no evident effect of insulin on the initial rate of removal of GLUT4myc from the cell surface. The separation of the insulin-treated curve from the curves in other conditions at longer time points is likely the result of the enhanced recycling of labeled transporters back to the cell surface. The lack of effect of insulin on GLUT4myc removal from the cell surface raised the question of whether insulin signals are maintained during incubation of myoblasts for 1 h at 4 °C so that re-addition of insulin to the cells after this time period would not have any further input. To address this possibility, myoblast monolayers were incubated as described in Fig. 1 but without the addition of primary antibody during the 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The cells were then lysed in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted to probe for phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and for phosphothreonine 308 of PKB. The results shown in Fig.3 indicate that insulin-dependent increases in a 175-kDa phosphotyrosine protein (likely IRS-1) and phosphorylated (on threonine 308) PKB (the site phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) had returned to near basal levels after 1 h of incubating cells in the absence of insulin at 4 °C. These results indicate that during the internalization period, any effects of prior insulin addition are not preserved, and therefore subsequent addition of insulin represents re-stimulation of the cells with the hormone. The increase in GLUT4myc recycling without reduction in GLUT4myc removal from the cell surface suggests that insulin stimulation increases the rate of return of GLUT4myc to the cell surface. It is therefore important to examine the mechanism leading to increased recycling in space and time. For this purpose, we were required to maximize our ability to discern the location of GLUT4myc vis à vis known organellar markers. When spread out on substratum, the cytosol of myoblasts (as well as fibroblasts) is distributed very thinly over a large area, making it difficult to distinguish juxtamembrane localization of immunofluorescent signals from more internal signals. To overcome this problem we lifted L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts off tissue culture flasks by incubating them in the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ for ∼20 min. Once detached, myoblasts were allowed to settle onto coverslips for 10 min in the absence and presence of insulin, fixed, and immunocytochemically labeled for GLUT4myc and TfR as well as stained for DNA with TO-PRO3 (Fig. 4). In the absence of insulin, a large fraction of the GLUT4myc label was intracellular, with a loose perinuclear pattern. At this steady state distribution, a significant portion of intracellular GLUT4myc escaped colocalization with the TfR-containing compartment. Insulin addition caused translocation of a fraction of the GLUT4myc signal to the cell periphery. On the other hand, virtually all of the TfR was detected intracellularly in a compact region about the nucleus in the absence and presence of insulin, with no discernible changes caused by the presence of the hormone. DNA labeling was included to add perspective and emphasize the perinuclear localization of the TfR-containing compartment. Fig. 4 illustrates the ability to determine intracellular and surface GLUT4myc in rounded-up myoblasts, and that GLUT4myc responds to insulin in rounded-up L6 myoblasts by translocating to the cell surface. Morphologically, different endosomes are defined by the presence of marker proteins. EEA1 is a putative tethering protein that helps to bring vesicles in close proximity with the early endosome and is found solely on early endosomes (24Mu F.-T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.-P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins undergo constitutive recycling between the plasma membrane and the recycling endosome. The TfR is responsible for iron entry into the cell via binding to transferrin and is constitutively recycled back to the cell surface (25Witt D.P. Woodworth R.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3913-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The relative abundance of TfR on the plasma membrane and in the recycling endosome varies among cell types. Greater than 90% of the TfR resides in the recycling endosome in L6 myoblasts, 2L. Foster and A. Klip, unpublished observation. making it a suitable marker for this compartment. To follow the transit of GLUT4myc through the early endosome and recycling endosome, surface GLUT4myc labeled with anti-Myc antibodies in intact myoblasts was allowed to internalize at 37 °C for different times up to 20 min. At each time point studied, the localization of internalized GLUT4myc was compared with the steady state distribution of endosomal markers. Fig.5 a shows the localization of labeled GLUT4myc and EEA1 at the onset of rewarming. Two min after initiation of internalization, some GLUT4myc could be detected in a compartment positive for EEA1 staining (Fig. 5 b) and remained in this compartment for at least 5 min (Fig. 5 c). At 10 min, there was no detectable labeled GLUT4myc in the perinuclear, TfR-positive compartment (Fig. 5 d), but by 15 min (Fig.5 e) GLUT4myc began to collect there, and by 20 min (Fig.5 f) a large portion of the labeled GLUT4myc overlapped with TfR. This distribution remained for up to 30 min (longer times could not be analyzed because of flattening of the myoblasts). GLUT4myc was allowed to internalize and chased in the absence or presence of re-added insulin. The hormone did not appear to affect the rat"
https://openalex.org/W2027002330,"The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) in developing spinal neurones is internalized efficiently upon antagonist inhibition. Here we used surface labeling combined with affinity purification to show that homopentameric α1 GlyRs generated inXenopus oocytes are proteolytically nicked into fragments of 35 and 13 kDa upon prolonged incubation. Nicked GlyRs do not exist at the cell surface, indicating that proteolysis occurs exclusively in the endocytotic pathway. Consistent with this interpretation, elevation of the lysosomal pH, but not the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, prevents GlyR cleavage. Prior to internalization, α1 GlyRs are conjugated extensively with ubiquitin in the plasma membrane. Our results are consistent with ubiquitination regulating the endocytosis and subsequent proteolysis of GlyRs residing in the plasma membrane. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes thus may have a crucial role in synaptic plasticity by determining postsynaptic receptor numbers.

J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because nAChR degradation occurs only after internalization and lysosomal targeting of the receptor protein (4Xu R. Salpeter M.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 5Pumplin D.W. Fambrough D.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 44: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), endocytosis is considered to be of crucial importance in the control of postsynaptic receptor density. An unexpectedly dynamic role of exo- and endocytosis in regulating synaptic efficacy has emerged recently from studies on glutamatergic synapses in the central nervous system (6Turrigiano G.G. Neuron. 2000; 26: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Lüscher C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Muller D. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). High frequency stimulation of hippocampal neurons has been shown to trigger the plasma membrane insertion of AMPA subtype glutamate receptors in dendritic spines during long term potentiation (8Shi S.H.

Science. 1999; 284: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), whereas receptor removal by clathrin-mediated internalization may be essential for inducing long term depression in the cerebellum (9Wang Y.T. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 25: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 10Man Y.H. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In summary, developmental and electrical activity-driven changes in LGIC numbers appear to be based on a tight regulation of the surface incorporation and endocytotic recycling of these membrane proteins. Another LGIC in the central nervous system known to undergo efficient endocytosis is the inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR), a pentameric membrane protein (11Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 12Kuhse J. Laube B. Magalei D. Betz H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1049-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that mediates postsynaptic inhibition in spinal cord and other regions of the mammalian central nervous system. Addition of the antagonist strychnine to cultured spinal neurons has been shown to cause internalization of GlyRs into an endosomal compartment (13Kirsch J. Betz H. Nature. 1998; 392: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14Levi S. Vannier C. Triller A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 335-345PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitantly, the blocked GlyRs fail to co-localize with gephyrin, a peripheral membrane protein that anchors GlyRs and GABAA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane (for review, see Ref. 15Kneussel M. Betz H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This may indicate that anchoring to postsynaptic gephyrin protects synaptically localized GlyRs against endocytosis. Consistent with this view, in neurons from gephyrin-deficient mice a loss of GABAA receptor localization at synapses is accompanied by increased levels of intracellular receptor immunoreactivity (16Kneussel M. Brandstätter J.H. Laube B. Stahl S. Müller U. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9289-9297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, there is a variety of processes in which regulated endocytosis appears to contribute significantly to the control of postsynaptic LGIC density. The mechanisms that trigger internalization are, however, not well understood. Here, we have used a recombinant homo-oligomeric GlyR generated in Xenopus oocytes as a model system to search for reactions involved in receptor endocytosis. The GlyR appeared to be particularly suited for such an analysis because its molecular structure, subunit assembly, and cell surface incorporation have been analyzed in detail. Presently, four GlyR genes encoding ligand-binding α subunits (α1–α4) and a single gene for the structural β subunit are known in vertebrates (for review, see Refs. 17Kuhse J. Betz H. Kirsch J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar and 18Harvey R.J. Betz H. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 147: 479-497Crossref Google Scholar). These subunits form homo-oligomeric and hetero-oligomeric chloride channels in different regions of the mammalian central nervous system. Each subunit shares with the other members of the nAChR superfamily a large glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain and four membrane-spanning regions (M1–M4), which, between M1 and M3, are separated by short hydrophilic stretches, and between M3 and M4 by a loop of ∼85 amino acids (β subunit 124 amino acids) which faces the cytosol. All α subunit isoforms assemble into functional homopentameric GlyR upon heterologous expression inXenopus oocytes or mammalian cells (19Schmieden V. Grenningloh G. Schofield P.R. Betz H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Akagi H. Hirai K. Hishinuma F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This assembly occurs soon after polypeptide synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and is a prerequisite for efficient export to the cell surface (21Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). By using affinity purification combined with selective cell surface labeling and blue native (BN) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), we now show that the recombinant GlyR is targeted to internalization and degradation after selective ubiquitination at the plasma membrane. Conjugation to ubiquitin is known to serve as an internalization signal for other receptor and ion channel proteins (22Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,23Staub O. Abriel H. Plant P. Ishikawa T. Kanelis V. Saleki R. Horisberger J.D. Schild L. Rotin D. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 809-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our data thus suggest that ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes may have a crucial role in regulating postsynaptic LGIC densities. Sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) proprionate (sulfo-SHPP) was from Pierce. Concanamycin and lactacystin were from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). A rabbit antiserum and a monoclonal antibody to ubiquitin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (La Jolla, CA) and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively. All amino acids were numbered according to their position in the mature protein sequence. cDNA constructs encoding α1-His with a C-terminal hexahistidyl tag (His) have been described before (21Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Lysine 411 was mutated to arginine (mutant K411R) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. cDNA encoding human ubiquitin (24Wiborg O. Pedersen M.S. Wind A. Berglund L.E. Marcker K.A. Vuust J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from a human brain cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) using gene-specific primers (forward, 5′-AAAgacgtcGAAGTAGCCAGAATGCAGATCTTCGTGAAGACTCTGACTGGTAA; reverse, 5′-TTGAATTCTGCCCATTATCAACCCCCCCTCAAGCGCA) cloned into the vector pNKS2 (25Gloor S. Pongs O. Schmalzing G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and sequenced. The forward polymerase chain reaction primer contained unique restriction sites for Aat II (lower case letters) and Bsm I (underlined) at the start codon. Taking advantage of these sites, codons for a N-terminal hexahistidyl tag were inserted to generate His-ubiquitin (His tag at the N terminus). Capped cRNAs were synthesized from linearized templates with SP6 RNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified as described (26Schmalzing G. Gloor S. Omay H. Kröner S. Appelhans H. Schwarz W. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For oocyte injection, the cRNAs were dissolved in 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at 0.5 μg/μl, using the absorbance reading at 260 nm for quantitation (A 1.0 = 40 μg/μl). DefolliculatedXenopus oocytes of oogenesis stage V or VI (26Schmalzing G. Gloor S. Omay H. Kröner S. Appelhans H. Schwarz W. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were injected with about 50-nl aliquots of cRNAs. Oocytes were kept at 19 °C in sterile frog Ringer's solution (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 mg/liter gentamycin. One to 3 days after cRNA injection, macroscopic glycine responses were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp recording at a holding potential of −70 mV as described previously (12Kuhse J. Laube B. Magalei D. Betz H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1049-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). cRNA-injected oocytes and noninjected controls were labeled metabolically by overnight incubation with l-[35S]methionine (>40 TBq/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at about 100 MBq/ml (0.1 MBq/oocyte) in frog Ringer's solution at 19 °C and chased with 1 mm unlabeled methionine as indicated. Oocytes expressing His-ubiquitin were preincubated at 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide to inactivate ubiquitin proteases prior to cell lysis. His-tagged proteins were then purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography from digitonin (1%, w/v) extracts of oocytes as detailed previously (27Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) with the following modification. Iodoacetamide was routinely included at 10 mm and 1 mm in the lysis and washing buffers, respectively, to prevent artificial cross-linking of polypeptides by disulfide bonds. Bound proteins were released from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose with nondenaturing elution buffer consisting of 0.5% (w/v) digitonin and 250 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.6 (equivalent to 50 mm Cl−), and kept at 0 °C until analyzed by PAGE. For selective labeling of plasma membrane receptors, the injected oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 19 °C and then labeled with freshly radioiodinated (Na125I, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) sulfo-SHPP (125I-sulfo-SHPP), a membrane-impermeant derivative of the Bolton-Hunter reagent (28Thompson J.A. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), exactly as described (27Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Where indicated, surface radioiodinated oocytes were incubated for another 20 h at 19 °C after removal of unbound 125I-sulfo-SHPP by washing in frog Ringer's solution. Proteins were then purified from digitonin extracts of the oocytes by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography as detailed above. BN-PAGE (29Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) was performed as described (27Nicke A. Bäumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Before loading, purified proteins were supplemented with BN sample buffer to final concentrations of 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) Serva blue G, and 20 mm sodium 6-amino-n-caproate, and applied onto polyacrylamide gradient slab gels. Molecular mass markers (Combithek II, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were visualized by Coomassie staining. For SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), proteins were supplemented with the appropriate SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and electrophoresed in parallel with 14C-labeled molecular mass markers (Rainbow, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Where indicated, samples were treated prior to SDS-PAGE with either endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or PNGase F (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside to reduce inactivation of PNGase F. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to BioMax MR or MS film (Kodak) at −80 °C. In some experiments, radioactive bands were quantified with an image analyzer (PhosphorImager Storm 820, Molecular Dynamics). After removal of the 28 amino acids of the signal peptide, the native human α1-His subunit encompasses 421+6 amino acid residues, corresponding to a calculated protein core of 49.2 kDa. The α1-His subunit migrated at an apparent mass of 48 kDa when isolated by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography under nondenaturing conditions from Xenopus oocytes and analyzed by reducing Tricine-SDS-PAGE after a 6-h [35S]methionine pulse. Subsequent to a 20-h chase interval, an additional 35-kDa protein was isolated which was not present immediately after the pulse. To identify smaller fragments generated during cleavage of the 48-kDa full-length α1-His subunit, we used Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels appropriate for resolution of low mass polypeptides. Fig.1 A shows that a 13-kDa polypeptide was detected consistently when α1-His GlyR was isolated after a 20-h chase interval, but not directly after the [35S]methionine labeling pulse. These data indicate that the α1-His subunit is cleaved proteolytically into two defined fragments of 35 and 13 kDa during the chase period. To determine the regions from which the two fragments originated, we exploited the fact that the α1-His subunit harbors a singleN-linked oligosaccharide side chain at position 38 (38NVS; see Fig. 7). Hence, the fragment derived from the N-terminal portion must include this unique N-glycan. Fig.1 B shows that PNGase F, which is capable of releasing complex-type carbohydrates, reduced the molecular masses of both the 48-kDa subunit and its 35-kDa fragment by ∼3 kDa; this corresponds to the mass of one single N-linked oligosaccharide chain (21Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mobility of the 13-kDa fragment did not increase upon PNGase F treatment. We conclude from these data that the soleN-glycan is located on the 35-kDa fragment, whereas the 13-kDa fragment originates from the nonglycosylated C-terminal portion of the α1-His subunit and thus carries the hexahistidyl tag. Fig. 1 B also shows that after a 20-h chase period none of the polypeptides was reduced in molecular mass by Endo H, which removes high mannose-type sugars characteristic for proteins that have not yet left the ER. The acquisition of Endo H resistance of virtually all full-length 48-kDa α1-His subunits during the chase is consistent with an efficient ER exit of the homopentameric receptor (21Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The 35-kDa cleavage product appeared during the chase interval and existed in the complex-glycosylated form only (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the proteolytic cleavage took place outside the ER,i.e. within or beyond the Golgi. During prolonged chase intervals, there was a further increase in the amounts of both the 35- and 13-kDa fragments at the expense of the 48-kDa polypeptide (Fig.1 C). A significant fraction of the α1-His subunit remained at 48 kDa, however, even after a 60-h chase period. GlyR α1 subunits assemble into a homopentamer rapidly after their synthesis while still in the ER (21Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The isolation of two fragments of the full-length α1-His subunit suggested that these fragments remain associated during purification because only the 13-kDa C-terminal fragment carries the hexahistidyl tag that interacts with the Ni2+-NTA beads. To examine directly whether the 13-kDa fragment is an integral part of the pentameric α1-His GlyR complex, we analyzed the natively isolated receptor by BN-PAGE before and after a 48-h chase interval, i.e. before and after partial cleavage. Under nondenaturing conditions, the α1-His GlyR migrated as a single protein with an apparent mass of 400 kDa irrespective of the length of the chase interval (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and5). The 13-kDa fragment in particular could not be detected. Treatment of the α1-His GlyR isolated shortly after the pulse with urea and DTT to weaken noncovalent subunit interactions produced five distinct bands (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), consistent with the pentameric nature of this receptor (21Griffon N. Büttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). If, however, the α1-His GlyR isolated after a 48-h chase interval was subjected to the same treatment, up to nine distinct bands were resolved by BN-PAGE (Fig.2 A, lane 6). To identify the individual polypeptides of which these bands were composed, the corresponding lane developed in the first dimension by BN-PAGE was excised, soaked with SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, and reanalyzed in the second dimension by reducing Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B). This analysis revealed that the 13-kDa fragment was released entirely by treatment with DTT/urea and corresponded to band 9 on the BN-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.2 A). In addition, the 35-kDa and 48-kDa polypeptides could be clearly attributed to bands 8 and 7, respectively, on the BN-polyacrylamide gel. Notably, the assembly intermediates consisted of multiples of either 48-kDa subunits or truncated 35-kDa subunits (Fig.2 B) but not a mixture of both. In other words, either the five subunits that constitute the native α1-His GlyR were all intact or all proteolytically nicked. To visualize selectively the plasma membrane-bound α1-His GlyR, we radioiodinated the outer cell surface of oocytes with125I-sulfo-SHPP, a membrane-impermeant Bolton-Hunter derivative (28Thompson J.A. Lau A.L. Cunningham D.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Three days after cRNA injection, i.e. at a time when a large portion of the metabolically labeled α1-His subunits were already proteolytically nicked (Fig.3 A, lane 1), the plasma membrane contained only the full-length 48-kDa polypeptide (Fig.3 A, lane 2). This indicated that the 35-kDa product was either not routed to the cell surface or that cleavage occurred in a compartment distal from the plasma membrane (see below). Unexpectedly, however, two polypeptides of 55 and 62 kDa, and occasionally a third band of 69 kDa, were resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE in addition to the 48-kDa full-length α1-His subunit. Upon treatment with glycosidases, the 55- and 62-kDa polypeptides behaved exactly like authentic α1-His subunits: they were Endo H-resistant but reduced by 3 kDa upon PNGase F treatment, indicating that they all carried a single complex-type N-glycan (data not shown). BN-PAGE analysis of the surface radioiodinated GlyR combined with Tricine-SDS-PAGE in the second dimension revealed that the 55- and the 62-kDa polypeptides were integral parts of the α1-His pentamer (Fig.3 B) and not co-isolated accessory proteins. We conclude from these results that the 55- and the 62-kDa poylpeptides represent α1-His subunits of the homopentameric GlyR which were conjugated with a 7-kDa molecule en route to the plasma membrane or at the plasma membrane itself. Retrospectively, small amounts of these additional polypeptides could also be detected on autoradiographs of α1-His GlyR purified from [35S]methionine-labeled oocytes (Fig.1 B, open arrowheads). Because the ladder of plasma membrane α1 subunit bands differing from each other by ∼7 kDa was reminiscent of that of other polypeptides conjugated to one, two, and three molecules of ubiquitin, a protein of 76 amino acids, we examined whether a significant fraction of the α1-His GlyR indeed exists in ubiquitinated form at the plasma membrane. Using antibodies to ubiquitin, we were unable to detect the presence of ubiquitin in affinity-purified GlyR preparations by Western blotting; this presumably reflects the low abundance of this membrane receptor in our purified preparations. We therefore co-expressed human His-ubiquitin together with the nonhistidyl-tagged GlyR α1 subunit to examine whether GlyRs can be isolated through covalently attached His-ubiquitin. Control purifications from [35S]methionine-labeled oocytes confirmed that His-ubiquitin was synthesized efficiently in oocytes (see Fig.4 C). Using this co-expression approach, nontagged α1 GlyR was purified through His-tagged ubiquitin from surface-radioiodinated oocytes (Fig. 4 A). Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of polypeptides of 55 and 62 kDa, corresponding to mono- and di-ubiquitinated forms of the 48 kDa α1 subunit (Fig. 4 A). A major fraction of the α1 subunit existed also in the nonubiquitinated 48-kDa form and was apparently co-isolated with the ubiquitinated receptor polypeptides. This argues that not all α1 subunits within the homopentamer carried ubiquitin chains, whereas some were evidently multiply ubiquitinated. Nonhistidyl-tagged GlyR α1 subunits could also be purified from oocytes injected with a commercially available recombinant His-ubiquitin protein together with GlyR α1 cRNA (Fig.4 B). From oocytes synthesizing nontagged GlyR α1 subunits without recombinant His-ubiquitin, only small amounts of GlyR protein were purified on the Ni2+-NTA beads, which consistently accounted for ≤ 5% of that obtained after co-injection of His-ubiquitin. Notably, we could not co-isolate significant amounts of GlyR α1 subunits with His-ubiquitin when using this co-expression approach with [35S]methionine-labeled oocytes (Fig.4 C). Thus, only a minor fraction of the total cellular pool of the α1 GlyR is ubiquitinated, and this ubiquitination occurs predominantly or exclusively at the plasma membrane (see Fig. 3). To characterize the membrane trafficking step at which proteolysis of the α1 GlyR occurs, we first surface labeled oocytes with125I-sulfo-SHPP and then incubated these oocytes for 20 h at either 0 °C or 19 °C. Fig.5 shows that surface α1-His subunits migrated entirely in their full-length form and as respective ubiquitin conjugates when isolated after incubation at 0 °C. However, when the oocytes were kept for 20 h at 19 °C subsequent to surface radioiodination, both the truncated 35-kDa form and the cleaved 13-kDa fragment appeared. Because these fragments were never detected at the plasma membrane directly after surface radioiodination (Fig.4 A), this suggests that cleavage does not take placeen route to or at the plasma membrane itself, but in a later compartment, i.e. in the endocytotic pathway. The intense radiolabeling of the 13-kDa fragment found in these surface labeling experiments was surprising in view of the presence of only a single extracellular lysine residue (Lys-411) that is located in the short tail region just behind the fourth transmembrane domain (see Fig.7). In contrast, the extracellularly exposed N-terminal half of the α1-His subunit carries a total of 12 lysine residues that all might react with 125I-sulfo-SHPP. To unravel whether Lys-411 is indeed a preferred site of iodination, we mutated this residue to arginine and purified the resulting mutant GlyR after surface radioiodination. Fig. 5 (lane 5) shows that the K411R mutation did not prevent the cleavage of the surface-radioiodinated full-length α1-His subunit upon subsequent incubation of the oocytes at 19 °C, as the 35-kDa band was clearly detected. The corresponding 13-kDa fragment, however, remained invisible, evidently as a result of Lys-411 elimination. Functionally, the Arg-411 α1-His GlyR was indistinguishable from its parent α1-His GlyR as assessed by two-electrode voltage clamp measurements (results not shown). These data confirm that Lys-411 is particularly accessible to covalent modification. The role of endosomal or lysosomal compartments in the cleavage of α1-His GlyR was assessed further by using chemical inhibitors. Concanamycin, a specific inhibitor of vesicular H+-ATPases similar to bafilomycin A1, has been reported to block the acidification of endosomes and lysosomes and to interfere with early to late endosomal transport (31Woo J.T. Shinohara C. Sakai K. Hasumi K. Endo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Incubation of oocytes in the presence of concanamycin greatly reduced the formation of the 35- and 13-kDa cleavage products (Fig.6 A), corroborating the view that cleavage occurs in the endocytotic pathway. Likewise, cleavage of α1-His was abolished upon addition of the lysosomotropic amine NH4Cl (Fig. 6 A), which dissipates transmembrane H+ gradients of acidic organelles (32Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting the activity of lysosomal enzymes (33Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 18: 468-475PubMed Google Scholar). The routing of α1-His GlyR toward the cell surface was not affected notably by concanamycin or NH4Cl, as assessed by the unimpaired acquisition of complex-type carbohydrates in the presence of either compound (results not shown). A complete inhibition of α1-His cleavage was also seen in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fig. 6 B), which, unlike conventional lysosomal inhibitors such as NH4Cl, does not raise lysosomal pH values. Together these data show that lysosomal serine protease activity is required for ef"
https://openalex.org/W2051971925,"Activating mutations in rasgenes are frequently associated with non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) and contribute to transformed growth in these cells. Expression of oncogenic forms of Ras in these cells is associated with increased expression and activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), leading to constitutively elevated levels of prostaglandin production. Expression of oncogenic Ras is sufficient to induce these enzymes in normal lung epithelial cells. We have previously reported that the JNK and ERK pathways are necessary for induction of cPLA2 and have defined a minimal region of the cPLA2 promoter from −58 to −12 that is required for Ha-Ras-mediated induction. To further characterize the cis-regulatory elements within this region involved in this response, site-directed mutagenesis was used to make mutations at various sites. Three cis-regulatory elements were identified: regions −21/−18, −37/−30, and −55/−53. Mutations in any of these elements decreased basal and Ha-Ras-induced cPLA2 promoter activity in both normal lung epithelial cells, as well as steady state promoter activity in A549 cells, with a mutation in element −21/−18 completely eliminating all promoter activity. Overexpression studies and gel shift assays indicated that Sp1 may serve as a transcription factor functionally regulating promoter activity by directly interacting with two of thecis-regulatory elements, −21/−18 and −37/−30. Expression of Ha-Ras led to induction of c-Jun protein, which showed functional cooperation with Sp1 in driving promoter activity. Additional unidentified transcription factors bound to the regions from −55/−53 and −37/−34. Activating mutations in rasgenes are frequently associated with non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) and contribute to transformed growth in these cells. Expression of oncogenic forms of Ras in these cells is associated with increased expression and activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), leading to constitutively elevated levels of prostaglandin production. Expression of oncogenic Ras is sufficient to induce these enzymes in normal lung epithelial cells. We have previously reported that the JNK and ERK pathways are necessary for induction of cPLA2 and have defined a minimal region of the cPLA2 promoter from −58 to −12 that is required for Ha-Ras-mediated induction. To further characterize the cis-regulatory elements within this region involved in this response, site-directed mutagenesis was used to make mutations at various sites. Three cis-regulatory elements were identified: regions −21/−18, −37/−30, and −55/−53. Mutations in any of these elements decreased basal and Ha-Ras-induced cPLA2 promoter activity in both normal lung epithelial cells, as well as steady state promoter activity in A549 cells, with a mutation in element −21/−18 completely eliminating all promoter activity. Overexpression studies and gel shift assays indicated that Sp1 may serve as a transcription factor functionally regulating promoter activity by directly interacting with two of thecis-regulatory elements, −21/−18 and −37/−30. Expression of Ha-Ras led to induction of c-Jun protein, which showed functional cooperation with Sp1 in driving promoter activity.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)1 constitutes the majority of lung cancers, and gain of function mutations inras genes are frequently associated with NSCLC, occurring in 30% of adenocarcinomas, and just under 10% of other NSCLC types (1Giaccone G. Chest. 1996; 109: 130S-134SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activating mutations in ras genes have also been detected in other types of human cancer, including colon, prostate, and pancreatic. It is believed that these mutated forms of Ras lacking intrinsic GTPase activity mediate transformation by constitutively activating downstream effector pathways. We recently reported that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras was associated with increased expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a panel of NSCLC cell lines (2Heasley L.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is the major intracellular form of PLA2, which preferentially hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids at thesn-2 position to release arachidonic acid and represents the rate-limiting enzyme in eicosanoid production (3Bonventre J.V.

COX converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxane, lipoxygenases produce leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase produces epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Two forms of cyclooxygenase have been identified (6DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Smith W.L. Am. J. Med. 1993; 95: 40S-44SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cell types and involved in maintaining vascular tone, whereas COX-2 is an immediate early response gene (7Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) induced by mitogenic stimuli and associated with inflammation. Constitutively high levels of prostaglandin production are observed in NSCLC as a result of elevated levels of cPLA2 and COX-2 (8Hubbard W.C. Alley M.C. McLemore T.L. Boyd M.R.

These drugs do not hinder the growth of most nontransformed cells, suggesting that this pathway plays a critical role in transformation. Although studies in NSCLC cell lines have implicated a role for Ras in the induction of cPLA2, these cells contain a large number of mutations and aberrations in signaling pathways, making it difficult to define the critical molecular pathways regulating cPLA2expression. We therefore sought to examine the effects of constitutively active forms of Ras on cPLA2 expression in untransformed lung epithelial cells. Ras has been shown to connect to numerous effector pathways, leading to the activation of diverse physiological responses (see Ref. 13Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar for review). These pathways regulate cell proliferation as well as changes in the cytoskeleton. We have recently demonstrated that expression of oncogenic forms of Ras directly increased cPLA2 expression in normal lung epithelial cells through activation of the JNK and ERK pathways (14Van Putten V.

The regulatory elements within the cPLA2 promoter critical for this induction by oncogenic Ras have not been defined. The cPLA2 promoter has been isolated from both human (15Wu T. Ikezono T. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5093-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and rat (16Tay A. Maxwell P. Li Z. Goldberg H. Skorecki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and contains a number of putative regulatory elements including AP-1 sites, NF-κB sites, and glucocorticoid regulatory elements. The promoter region resembles that of a housekeeping gene in that it contains no TATA box and no CAAT box, but it is atypical in that it is not GC-rich (34.5%) and has no consensus Sp1 sites (15Wu T. Ikezono T. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5093-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,17Miyashita A. Crystal R.G. Hay J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We reported previously that the region of the promoter covering residues −58 to −12 is crucial for induction of promoter activity by oncogenic Ras (14Van Putten V. Refaat Z. Dessev C. Blaine S.

Mather J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: L415-L425PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we define threecis-regulatory elements within this region of the promoter critical for both basal and Ha-Ras-induced cPLA2 promoter activity, and have begun to define transcription factors acting at these sites. The cPLA2promoter construct contains 2.4 kilobase pairs of the 5′ region ligated into the promoterless luciferase vector PA3-Luc (16Tay A. Maxwell P. Li Z. Goldberg H. Skorecki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The truncation mutant encoding the region from −102 to +40 (16Tay A. Maxwell P. Li Z. Goldberg H. Skorecki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used to generate additional truncations by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (14Van Putten V. Refaat Z.

Mutations within this region were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

RL-65 lung epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with NaHCO3 (25 mm), sodium selenite (25 nm), insulin (5 μg/ml), human transferrin (10 μg/ml), ethanolamine (100 μm), phosphoethanolamine (100 μm), hydrocortisone (0.5 μm), forskolin (5 μm), retinoic acid (50 nm), bovine pituitary extract (150 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml), according to the producer's recommendation. A549 human lung cancer cells were obtained from the University of Colorado Cancer Center Tissue Culture Core, and were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transient transfections, cells were electroporated as described previously (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 million cells were electroporated in duplicate dishes using a geneZAPPER (IBI). Unless otherwise stated, cells were transfected with 2 μg of the −58 truncation mutant of the cPLA2 promoter, 2 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase, and 2 μg of other DNA (e.g. CMV-Ha-Ras, CMV-Sp1). Total DNA concentration for each transfection was matched with pcDNA-3.1. Following electroporation, cells were incubated in standard media for 48 h. Cells were then harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity determined as described previously (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as luciferase units normalized to β-galactosidase units. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and nuclear extracts prepared by a modification of the method of Dignam (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets containing 107 cells were washed and resuspended in a 5-fold volume of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mm PMSF) at 4 °C for 10 min, vortexed, and centrifuged at 25,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm PMSF), homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g and the supernatant recovered. Extracts were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT), aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotides for gel shift assays were fill-in labeled with [32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed, and the buffer was exchanged with a Centri-Sep column (Princeton Separations). The following oligonucleotides, with mutations indicated in underlined bold type, were synthesized: for wild type −42/−13, 5′-AGAGACCAGCCCATTTCTTAGCCCCTCCTA-3′; for mutation −37/−34, 5′-AGAG GTT AGCCCATTTCTTAGCCCCTCCTA-3′; for mutation −33/−30, 5′-AGAGACCA TATG ATTTCTTAGCCCCTCCTA-3′; for double mutation −37/−30, 5′-AGAG GTT A TATG ATTTCTTAGCCCCTCCTA-3′; for wild type −28/−8, 5′-TTTCTTAGCCCCTCCTACCAG-3′; for mutation −21/−18, 5′-TTTCTTA ATTT CTCCTACCAG-3′; for wild type −65/−40, 5′-CTTGAATTCCACCTTAACATCCACAG-3′; for mutation −55/−53, 5′-CTTGAATTCC GTT TTAACATCCACAG-3′ (only the coding strand sequence provided). The Sp1 consensus binding site oligonucleotide (5′-CCCTTGGTG GGGGCGGGGC CTAAGCTGCG-3′; Sp1 consensus site in bold italics) was purchased from Geneka Biotechnology (Toronto, Canada). Supershift assays were carried out using a specific monoclonal Sp1 antibody and a specific polyclonal c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts (2 μg) were incubated in binding reaction buffer with a final KCl concentration of 100 mm for 30 min on ice. For supershift or competition assays, the relevant antibodies or unlabeled oligonucleotides were incubated with nuclear extracts prior to adding the labeled probe. [32P]dCTP-labeled probe (100,000 cpm) was added for an additional 30 min in a total volume of 20 μl. For competition assays, a 50- or 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction. Samples were resolved on a nondenaturing 5% acrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), in 1× TGE (25 mm Tris, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 190 mm glycine) at 20 mA/gel for ∼90 min. Gels were dried and exposed to film for autoradiography. In earlier studies, we defined a minimal region of the rat cPLA2 promoter spanning residues −58 to −12, which was necessary and sufficient for Ha-Ras-mediated induction of cPLA2 in RL-65 cells and expression in NSCLC (14Van Putten V. Refaat Z. Dessev C. Blaine S. Wick M. Butterfield L. Han S.Y. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An additional 5′-truncation down to −37 reduced basal promoter activity, and inhibited but did not completely block induction by Ha-Ras. Ultimately, truncation down to −12 completely abolished both basal and Ha-Ras-induced promoter activity. These studies were paralleled in A549 cells, a human NSCLC cell line expressing an activating mutation in Ras. Promoter activity was slightly elevated upon truncation from −2.4 kilobase pairs to −58 bp. Further deletion to −37 decreased promoter activity by ∼60%, and truncation to −12 entirely abolished promoter activity. Examination of the sequence of the cPLA2 promoter revealed that the 58-bp region contained no consensus sites for any known transcription factors. Therefore, to define regulatory elements, a series of mutations were introduced throughout the region with the original −58 truncation mutant as a template (Fig.1). With the exception of mutation −37/−34, all mutations correspond to regions of the promoter that are conserved between the rat and human promoter (15Wu T. Ikezono T. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5093-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding each mutation were transiently co-transfected into RL-65 cells along with an expression plasmid for Ha-Ras or pcDNA-3 as a control. Expression of Ha-Ras increased wild type promoter activity by 3–5-fold (Fig. 2 A), consistent with earlier studies. Mutation −21/−18 almost completely abolished both basal and Ha-Ras stimulated promoter activity. Mutations −37/−34 and −33/−30 inhibited both basal and Ha-Ras-mediated promoter activity by ∼80–90%. With the double mutant −37/−30, activity was further inhibited to ∼10% of wild-type promoter. Mutation at −55/−53 decreased both basal promoter activity and Ha-Ras-mediated induction by 66%. There was no significant change in either basal promoter activity or Ha-Ras-mediated induction with mutation −49/−47.Figure 2Effect of mutations on cPLA2 promoter activity in RL-65 cells. A, RL-65 cells were transiently transfected with cPLA2 promoter constructs containing the indicated mutations, along with either an Ha-Ras expression plasmid or pcDNA-3 as a control.

Results represent the means of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate with mean and S.E. indicated. *,p < 0.05 versus EGF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Stimulation of RL-65 cells with EGF also increased cPLA2promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). This induction was blocked by co-expression with N17-Ras (data not shown), indicating that the effects of EGF are mediated at least in part through the Ras signaling pathway. EGF stimulation was blocked with mutants −55/−53, −37/−34, −33/−30, or −21/−18 to an extent similar to that seen with expression of Ha-Ras (Fig. 2 B). Finally, the effects of these mutations in the cPLA2 promoter were also examined in A549 cells. Steady-state promoter activity was almost entirely eliminated with mutation −21/−18. Mutations −55/−53, −37/−34, and −33/−30 inhibited steady-state promoter activity by ∼85–95% (Fig.3). The double mutant −37/−30 decreased promoter activity by about 95%. Mutation −49/−47 reduced promoter activity by ∼60%. The data from these studies suggest that three regions of the cPLA2 promoter appear to be critical for expression: regions −37/−30, −21/−18, and −55/−53. To examine complexes formed at these sites, EMSAs were performed using32P-labeled probes spanning each of the threecis-regulatory elements (Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Using an oligonucleotide encoding −42 to −13, a number of specific bands were detected using nuclear extracts prepared from RL-65 cells (Fig. 4 A). At least three complexes were competed off by excess cold oligonucleotide. Extracts from EGF-stimulated cells showed the same pattern of bands, with no significant change in intensity (data not shown). Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, which binds to GC-rich elements frequently found in a number of housekeeping genes. The region of the cPLA2 promoter from −58 to −1 is 55% GC-rich, and several areas within this region represent putative, but not consensus Sp1 binding sites. Sp1 has been demonstrated to activate numerous TATA-less promoters (20Huber R. Schlessinger D. Pilia G. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 214: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Wick M. Zubov D. Hagen G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to control expression of tissue specific genes as well (22Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 23Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To examine whether Sp1 can form complexes with this region of the cPLA2 promoter, we employed a specific Sp1 antibody in a “supershift” EMSA. In the presence of Sp1 antibody and nuclear extracts from RL-65 cells, a major complex (a) was supershifted to a slower migrating complex (b) (Fig. 4 A). Using a probe with mutations at −33/−30, the intensity of band a was greatly diminished, and a new band (c) was detected (Fig.4 B). This band was not supershifted with anti-Sp1 antibody. Using a probe with mutations at −37/−34, resulted in decreased intensity of band a, and a detectable, but faint supershifted band b (Fig. 4 C). The double mutation −37/−30 eliminated all three bands (Fig. 4 D). A similar pattern of bands was observed using nuclear extracts prepared from A549 cells (Fig.4 E), with the slowest migrating band supershifted with anti-Sp1 antibodies. Mutations at −33/−30 caused a similar disappearance of band a and appearance of a new band (c). With a labeled probe encoding the region from −28 to −8, three major bands were detected using extracts from either RL-65 cells or A549 cells (Fig. 5). All of these bands were competed off by excess cold oligonucleotide (data not shown). The slowest migrating band (a) was supershifted with anti-Sp1 antibodies to a slower migrating complex (b). When the identical extracts were incubated with probe containing a mutation at −21/−18, no specific bands were detected with extracts from RL-65 (Fig. 5 A, lane 5) or A549 cells (data not shown). Finally, EMSA analysis was performed using a labeled probe corresponding to the region from −65 to −40. A single major complex was detected, which was competed off by excess cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 A). Extracts from EGF-treated cells showed the same pattern, with no significant difference in the intensity of the band. Antibodies against Sp1 failed to supershift this band (Fig.6 B). Once again, extracts from A549 cells gave a complex of the same mobility, which was competed off by cold oligonucleotide and not shifted by Sp1 antibody (Fig. 6 C). Based on these data, it appears that Sp1 can bind to both the −37/−30 region and the −21/−18 region. Because the −21/−18 region is also encoded within the −42/−13 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4), we performed an additional EMSA, with the −42/−13 oligonucleotide mutated at −21/−18. The pattern of bands observed with this oligonucleotide (data not shown) was indistinguishable from that obtained with the wild-type −42/−13 probe (Fig. 4 A).Figure 6EMSA analysis in region −65/−40 of the cPLA2 promoter. Oligonucleotides were constructed encoding region −65 to −40 of the cPLA2 promoter and labeled with [32P]dCTP. These were used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Binding reactions were carried out by incubating each probe with nuclear extracts prepared from RL-65 cells (A and B) or A549 cells (C).A, lane 1, extract from RL-65 cells; lane 2, extract + 100× double-stranded cold oligonucleotide.

Overexpression of Sp1 increased wild type promoter activity ∼1.6-fold in RL-65 cells (Fig.7). However, with the promoter construct with a mutation at −33/−30, no transactivation of promoter activity was detected in the context of Sp1 overexpression. Mutations at −37/−34 or −21/−18 resulted in lower basal promoter activity, with some residual stimulation in the presence of Sp1. Sp1 is capable of forming multimeric complexes through homotypic interactions (24Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 25Pascal E. Tjian R.

The 12-lipoxygenase promoter has many similarities with the cPLA2 promoter in that it is also a TATA-less promoter whose activity is regulated by the ERK and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and induced by Ha-Ras expression (30Chen B.K.

A. 2000; 97: 10406-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Others have reported that c-Jun superactivates Sp1 to drive the human p21(WAF/Cip1) promoter by directly binding to Sp1 but not to the promoter (34Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Jun is involved in the induction of the cPLA2 promoter, RL-65 cells were co-transfected with the cPLA2 promoter construct along with expression plasmids encoding c-Jun and Sp1 either individually or in combination. Overexpression of c-Jun alone increased cPLA2 promoter activity by itself and, in the setting of Sp1 overexpression, resulted in a synergistic increase in promoter activity (Fig. 7 A). Overexpression of either Sp1 or c-Jun individually or together had a blunted effect on promoter activity with the −37/−34 mutant, and failed to cause significant increases for mutants −33/−30, or −21/−18 (Fig. 7 A). Direct binding of c-Jun to the promoter was assessed by EMSA with an anti-c-Jun antibody. However, no supershifted complex was detected with this antibody using either region −42/−13 (Fig. 4) or −28/−8 (Fig. 5). Incubation of extracts with either oligonucleotide in the presence of antibodies against Sp3, NF-Y, or gut Kruppel-like factor (GKLF) failed to result in a supershifted complex (data not shown). Expression of v-Jun, which lacks the JNK docking domain (35Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar), also stimulated promoter activity, and synergized with Sp1. In fact, co-expression of v-Jun and Sp1 increased promoter activity to levels comparable with that seen with expression of Ha-Ras. One possible mechanism to account for the role of c-Jun in regulating the cPLA2 promoter is that activation of Ras leads to increased expression of c-Jun. We therefore examined levels of c-Jun expression in RL-65 cells transfected with Ha-Ras. Expression of Ha-Ras induced c-Jun expression 3–4-fold, as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig.7 B). Increased phosphorylation of c-Jun was also increased as assessed by immunoblotting with a phospho-Jun-specific antibody (data not shown). Activating mutations in Ras are characteristic of a variety of cancer cells and play a critical role in the transformation of these cells. We have shown previously that expression of oncogenic Ras is necessary for elevated expression of cPLA2 and COX-2 in NSCLC (2Heasley L.E. Thaler S. Nicks M. Price B. Skorecki K. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14501-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and sufficient to induce expression of both enzymes in nontransformed lung epithelial cells (14Van Putten V. Refaat Z. Dessev C. Blaine S. Wick M. Butterfield L. Han S.Y. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In both cell types, induction of cPLA2 involved activation of the ERK and the JNK families of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Through truncational analysis, we have previously defined the minimal region of the promoter required for induction of cPLA2 from −58 to −12 (14Van Putten V. Refaat Z. Dessev C. Blaine S. Wick M. Butterfield L. Han S.Y. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Further truncation of this region indicated two smaller regions, which contribute to regulated expression. Promoter activity decreased when truncating from −58 to −37, but some basal activity was retained and the -fold induction of the promoter achieved by expression of Ha-Ras was similar. An additional truncation to −12 abolished both basal and Ha-Ras stimulated activity. We sought to further characterize thecis-regulatory elements in this region responsible for these effects. From the present study, we have identified threecis-regulatory elements from −55/−53, from −37/−30, and from −21/−18, which appear to be critical for regulated expression of cPLA2. In normal lung epithelial cells, mutations in each of these regions significantly decreased both basal promoter activity and stimulated promoter activity in response to expression of Ha-Ras or exposure to EGF. Similarly, each mutation decreased steady-state promoter activity in an NSCLC line expressing oncogenic Ras (A549). Overall, region −21/−18 appears to be the most crucial element in regulating promoter activity because mutation of this region abolishes all promoter activity. By EMSA analysis, Sp1 bound to both the −37/−30 region and the −21/−18 region. Although these regions do not contain classical Sp1 sites, they are GC-rich. Our data suggest that at least two factors bind to the −37/−30 region. Mutating the −37/−34 region decreased the binding of Sp1, but still resulted in a fainter band, which was shifted by anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 4 C). However, mutation of the −33/−30 region resulted in the formation of a complex that was not supershifted (Fig. 4 B). We would therefore propose that a factor binding to the −37/−34 cooperates to promote Sp1 binding to the −33/−30 region. The identity of this second factor is unknown, but, based on supershift assays, it is not likely to be another member of the Sp1 family. Sp1 binding correlated with the ability of Ha-Ras to induce the promoter, because mutations that inhibited induction of promoter activity blunted or abolished Sp1 binding. Furthermore, overexpression of Sp1 in RL-65 cells was sufficient to induce promoter activity in the absence of Ha-Ras expression. Overexpressing Sp1 alone did not stimulate promoter activity to the extent seen with Ha-Ras. This may be a result of the fact that Sp1 is already highly expressed in most cells and is difficult to overexpress. Alternatively, Sp1 itself may not be sufficient to drive the promoter and an additional factor(s) is required (see above). Mutations in the −33/−30 region, which resulted in disappearance of complexes containing Sp1, completely abolished transactivation of promoter activity by Sp1 overexpression. With a construct containing mutations in the −21/−18 region, overexpression of Sp1 still resulted in a small increase in promoter activity. Thus, we would suggest that Sp1 binding to both regions (−33/−30 and −21/−18) is required for promoter induction. Our data suggest that, similar to regulation of the 12-lipoxygenase promoter by Ha-Ras (30Chen B.K. Liu Y.W. Yamamoto S. Chang W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Chen B.K. Kung H.C. Tsai T.Y. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), c-Jun cooperates with Sp1 to induce cPLA2 expression. Overexpression of c-Jun alone increased cPLA2 promoter activity; importantly, a synergistic induction of promoter activity occurred when both c-Jun and Sp1 were overexpressed. With oligonucleotides spanning the entire 58-bp region, no complex was detected in EMSA assays that was supershifted with anti-Jun antibodies. This is consistent with the lack of an AP-1 site in this region. These findings suggest that c-Jun does not bind directly to the promoter, but may form a complex with Sp1, leading to activation. Although we have not been able to detect such a complex using an EMSA assay, the affinity of binding may be too low. Others workers have reported that c-Jun is involved in driving expression of the p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter by binding directly to Sp1 but not to the promoter (34Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but also failed to detect a c-Jun/Sp1 complex in an EMSA assay. Our previous studies have implicated a role for JNK activation in Ha-Ras-mediated induction of the cPLA2 promoter. Phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNKs on serines 63 and 73 is critical for activation of c-Jun-mediated transcription at AP-1 sites (36Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that activation of JNKs in response to expression of Ha-Ras mediates induction of cPLA2 promoter activity by phosphorylating c-Jun. However, the ability of v-Jun, which lacks the JNK docking domain, to synergize with Sp1 in inducing promoter activity, suggests that increased expression of c-Jun may mediate induction of the promoter. The role of the JNK pathways may therefore be more important in regulating expression of c-Jun, rather than direct phosphorylation of the protein. Sp1 belongs to a family of 16 different transcription factors containing a highly conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain (22Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). All these proteins bind to similar DNA sites, which are specifically G-rich elements such as GC and GT/CACC boxes (22Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 37Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although the Sp subgroup of proteins prefer the GC-rich box and the Kruppel-like factors favor the GT/CACC element, some cis elements have affinities for members of both subfamilies (37Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). GKLF binds to a GC-rich consensus sequence, but can bind with lower affinity to a classical GC-rich Sp1 site (38Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), whereas GKLF and Sp1 can bind with strong affinity to the basic transcription element found in the promoters of a family of cytochrome P450 genes (37Dang D.T. Pevsner J. Yang V.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1103-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 39Zhang W. Shields J.M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17917-17925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Another member of this family is lung Kruppel-like factor (LKLF). The major site of expression of LKLF is the lung (22Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to play a role in normal lung development (40Wani M.A. Wert S.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21180-21185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). LKLF can bind to the CACC element of the β-globin promoter known to be a site for erythroid Kruppel-like factor (41Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We have preliminary data, using a yeast one-hybrid screen, that LKLF can also bind to the cPLA2promoter. 2M. Wick, S. A. Blaine, and R. A. Nemenoff, manuscript in preparation. As the minimal region of the cPLA2 promoter (−58 to −12) does not contain any classical Sp1 sites, it may be that multiple family members have an affinity for the cis-regulatory elements within this region. Sp1 may be able to bind to the promoter with some affinity and drive the promoter when it is highly expressed, but multiple Kruppel-like factors may share affinity for these cis-regulatory elements and regulate the promoter in vivo. In summary, we propose a hypothetical model for induction of cPLA2 expression by oncogenic Ras. Constitutively active Ras signals through the ERK and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as well as some additional pathway to activate downstream transcription factors that work to regulate cPLA2expression through three cis-regulatory elements within its promoter, from −21/−18, −37/−30, and −55/−53. A candidate transcription factor includes Sp1 which may bind to two of the elements, −21/−18 and −33/−30. Additional factors bind to the region from −37/−34 and the third element from −55/−53. c-Jun expression is induced by Ha-Ras and may play a functional role by interacting with Sp1 without directly binding to the promoter. The similarities in the pathways mediating induction of cPLA2and 12-lipoxygenase by Ha-Ras also suggest that the coordinated induction of these enzymes is required for enhanced eicosanoid production."

The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional regulation of ENA-78 gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Reporter gene transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies demonstrated that cooperation between two regions of the ENA-78 promoter were required for maximal gene expression in interleukin-1β-stimulated Caco-2 cells. Binding of activated p50/p65 nuclear factor-κB to nucleotides −82 to −91 was essential for interleukin-1β-dependent gene transcription, whereas binding of constitutively expressed zinc-requiring nuclear factors to nucleotides −125 to −134 (site A) was required for basal gene expression. Scanning mutagenesis of site A demonstrated overlapping binding elements at this locus. One site (CTCCCCC) bound Sp1 and Sp3, and overexpression of Sp1 (but not Sp3) up-regulated basal ENA-78 transcription. Another site (CCCCTCCCCC) was found to bind the zinc finger nuclear factor ZBP-89, and overexpression of this protein significantly repressed ENA-78 reporter gene activity. This study demonstrates that ENA-78 gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells is subject to complex regulation involving the coordinate binding of ZBP-89, Sp1, and nuclear factor-κB to the ENA-78 promoter.

Epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78 (ENA-78)1 is a C-X-C chemokine that is structurally and functionally similar to IL-8. Like IL-8, it contains the neutrophil-activating amino acid motif glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR) and is thus a potent neutrophil-activating agent, inducing chemotaxis, cytoskeletal reorganization, and modulation of neutrophil adhesion molecule expression (8Walz A.

Recent studies indicate that ELR-bearing C-X-C chemokines are also potent angiogenic factors that regulate endothelial cell proliferation and chemotaxis (10Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L.

A wide variety of cell types can release IL-8 if stimulated appropriately; however, it is produced mainly by activated monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells and to a lesser extent by neutrophils and epithelial cells (2Ben-Baruch A.

Strieter R.M. Schnyder S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 351: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Schnyder-Candrian S. Walz A. J.

Recent studies from our laboratory and others have shown that intestinal epithelial cells are the major site of ENA-78 production in human colon and that production of this chemokine is up-regulated in ulcerative colitis. Furthermore, we and others find that ENA-78 immunoreactivity in the human colon is confined mainly to intestinal epithelial cells, particularly the crypt epithelium (16Keates S. Keates A.C. Mizoguchi E. Bhan A. Kelly C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G75-G82PubMed Google Scholar, 17Z'Graggen K. Walz A. Mazzucchelli L. Strieter R.M. Mueller C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 808-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Chemokines produced by activated epithelial cells are capable of binding to sulfated polysaccharides present in the extracellular matrix, thereby creating a fixed chemotactic gradient (18McCormick B.A. Hofman P.M.

Biol. 1994; 4: 394-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, ENA-78 production may be especially important in the recruitment of neutrophils to the epithelial layer. The production of chemokines is regulated largely at the level of gene transcription through the binding of activated transcription factors to specific gene promoter regulatory elements (2Ben-Baruch A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11703-11706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the ENA-78 gene promoter indicates potential binding sites for the nuclear factors NF-κB, AP-2, C/EBP, interferon regulatory factor-1, and cAMP response element (20Corbett M.S. Schmitt I. Riess O. Walz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Chang M.S. McNinch J. Basu R. Simonet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25277-25282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB site was found to be a functionally important regulatory element for ENA-78 gene expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (21Chang M.S. McNinch J. Basu R. Simonet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25277-25282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution, if any, of the other potential nuclear factor binding sites has not been determined. In this study we have used luciferase reporter gene transfections and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for ENA-78 gene expression in human Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Our studies confirm that the NF-κB binding site on the ENA-78 promoter plays a major role in regulating IL-1β-induced gene transcription in Caco-2 cells. Our findings also identified a second 5′-regulatory element (nucleotides −127 to −136) that is required for maximal gene expression in Caco-2 cells. We demonstrate that ZBP-89 and Sp1 bind to overlapping sites in this region of the ENA-78 promoter and also regulate ENA-78 gene transcription.

After restriction digestion with KpnI and BamHI the ENA-78 promoter fragment was cloned directionally into the pGL2-Basic firefly luciferase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) between unique KpnI and BglII sites to generate a “full-length” ENA-78 reporter construct. Reporter genes containing sequentially truncated fragments (nucleotides −529, −399, −216, −154, −126, −78 to +15) of the ENA-78 5′-promoter region were prepared in a similar manner using sense primers containing KpnI restriction sites and the antisense primer used to generate the full-length ENA-78 reporter construct (see Fig.1).

To correct for variations in DNA uptake by the cells, each test construct was cotransfected with either 2 μg of pCAT 3-Control vector (Promega) or 0.2 μg of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase control vector (Promega). Transfections using pGL2-Basic vector without an insert were used as a negative control. For experiments investigating the effect of Sp1, Sp3, and ZBP-89 overexpression on ENA-78 reporter gene activity Caco-2 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of full-length ENA-78 reporter gene and 3 μg of pCMV-Sp1 or pCMV-Sp3 (kindly provided by Dr G. Suske, Marburg, Germany), or 3 μg of pSPORT-ZBP-89. After transfection for 15 h the precipitate was removed and replaced with normal growth medium. Caco-2 cells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with serum-free medium for 16 h to reduce background luciferase levels prior to stimulation with 25 ng/ml IL-1β for 8 h. The firefly luciferase activity of the cells was determined using a commercially available kit (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity of the cells was assessed using a commercially available kit (CAT Enzyme Assay System, Promega), that measured the conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to n-butyryl [14C]chloramphenicol. In experiments using the pRL-TK control vector, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured simultaneously in each sample using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Drosophila SL2 cells were transfected using a modification of the method of Han et al. (23Han B. Liu N. Yang X. Sun H.B. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7937-7942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 12-well dishes at a density of 1 × 106/well and transfected by calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation. Each well received an equal amount of DNA that included 2.5 μg of the full-length ENA-78 reporter gene and variable amounts of pcDNA3-p50NF-κB, Rc-CMV-p65NF-κB (both kindly provided by Simos Simeonidis, Division of Gastroenterology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston), pCMV-Sp1, and pBK-ZBP-89 overexpression contructs (or their respective control plasmids). 48 h after transfection the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the firefly luciferase activities were determined. Luciferase activities were normalized to total lysate protein concentration. To examine the activation of transcription factors EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from nontransfected Caco-2 cells as described by Ladias et al. (24Ladias J.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Caco-2 cells were seeded onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA) and grown until confluent. After overnight incubation with serum-free medium, cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml IL-1β for up to 6 h and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were removed from tissue culture plates by scraping into ice-cold buffer containing 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and spun in a microcentrifuge at 20,000 ×g for 5 s. Cells were then resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Nonidet P-40 was added to achieve a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v), and the cell suspension was incubated for a further 2 min on ice. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 s, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were gently resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and incubated for 30 min on ice. Extracts were then centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 2 min and the supernatants frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C until use. Single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides bearing either wild type or mutant ENA-78 binding elements (i.e. NF-κB and site A) were prepared by custom oligonucleotide synthesis (Genosys Biotechnologies). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing consensus binding sites for AP-2α and Sp1 were obtained commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After annealing, 100 ng of the double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled using either DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment (Promega) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Labeled probes were then purified on a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions for NF-κB EMSAs were performed as described by Ferrari et al. (25Ferrari D. Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Site A EMSAs were performed according to the method of Wang et al. (26Wang D. Shin T.H. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14244-14250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that 100 μm ZnSO4 was added to the binding reactions. Caco-2 cell nuclear extracts, purified transcription factors (AP-2α and Sp1; Promega), or recombinant rat ZBP-89 (produced by in vitro transcription and translation using a pcDNA3-ZBP-89-FLAG plasmid (27Bai L. Merchant J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30725-30733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in the reaction mixture after which the probe DNA was added and the incubation continued for another 30 min. Probe-protein complexes were then separated from free probe using 5% native polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C to visualize the probe-protein complexes. To confirm the specificity of the binding reactions supershift assays were performed using antibodies to AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, and the NF-κB components p50, p52, p65, RelB, and c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Supershift experiments were also performed using antibodies directed against the entire sequence of rat ZBP-89 (28Taniuchi T. Mortensen E.R. Ferguson A. Greenson J. Merchant J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In some experiments binding specificity was also determined by competition with excess unlabeled probe. Antibodies or competing probe were added to the binding reactions at the start of the 30-min incubation period. Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma- Stat for Windows version 2.0 (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Analysis of variance followed by protected ttests were used for intergroup comparisons, except where otherwise stated. Previous studies have shown that the production of chemokines is regulated largely via increases in gene transcription (29Eckmann L. Jung H.C. Schurer-Maly C. Panja A. Morzycka-Wroblewska E.

To obtain a more complete understanding of the factors that control ENA-78 gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, a series of luciferase reporter constructs containing sequentially truncated fragments of the ENA-78 promoter was created (Fig. 1). After transfection of Caco-2 cells with equimolar amounts of each construct the cells were incubated for 8 h with or without 25 ng/ml IL-1β, and the luciferase activities were determined. Cytokine-stimulation of Caco-2 cells transfected with an empty luciferase expression vector or an ENA-78 reporter construct containing only a TATA binding site (nucleotides −78 to + 15) did not significantly elevate luciferase activity compared with nonstimulated cells. In contrast, luciferase activity in stimulated Caco-2 cells transfected with an ENA-78 reporter construct containing NF-κB and C/EBP binding sites (nucleotides −126 to +15) was increased 4.4-fold compared with nonstimulated cells and was increased ∼26-fold compared with cells transfected with a reporter gene containing no promoter elements. The basal luciferase activity of Caco-2 cells transfected with this construct was also increased 9.3-fold compared with cells transfected with the promoterless construct. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells transfected with a reporter construct containing site A in addition to the NF-κB and C/EBP binding sites (nucleotides −154 to +15) further increased luciferase activity 4-fold compared with the reporter gene containing only NF-κB and C/EBP binding sites. Again, the basal luciferase activity of this construct was increased 2.7-fold compared with the construct containing nucleotides −126 to +15 of the ENA-78 promoter. Transfection of Caco-2 cells with ENA-78 reporter genes containing additional putative transcription factor binding sites did not significantly increase IL-1β-stimulated luciferase activity. Taken together, these results suggest that nucleotides −154 to +15 of the ENA-78 promoter are sufficient for responses to IL-1β stimulation as well as basal activity, whereas regulatory elements upstream of this region (nucleotides −706 to −155) are not required for gene expression. To define further the relative contributions of the NF-κB and C/EBP regulatory elements to IL-1β-stimulated ENA-78 gene expression, mutant full-length ENA-78 reporter constructs containing either a targeted deletion or nucleotide substitutions within each putative transcription factor binding site were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis (Table I). Under nonstimulated conditions deletion or substitution of the NF-κB binding site reduced the luciferase activity of transfected Caco-2 cells ∼ 50% (p < 0.01) compared with the full-length ENA-78 reporter construct (Fig.2 A). In contrast, deletion or substitution of the C/EBP binding site had no significant effect on basal Caco-2 luciferase activity. In Caco-2 cells transfected with the full-length ENA-78 reporter gene exposure to 25 ng/ml IL-1β induced a 10-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with nonstimulated cells (Fig. 2 A). Deletion or substitution of the NF-κB binding site reduced the luciferase activity of stimulated Caco-2 cells by ∼95 and 90% respectively (p < 0.01 for each) compared with the wild type construct. Moreover, the NF-κB deletion or substitution mutants were largely unresponsive to IL-1β stimulation. In contrast, deletion or substitution of the C/EBP binding site had no significant effect on IL-1β-stimulated reporter gene activity. These findings indicate that NF-κB is the major regulator of ENA-78 gene expression in response to IL-1β stimulation in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. We next performed EMSAs in nontransfected Caco-2 cells to determine the species of NF-κB which binds the ENA-78 promoter κB element (Fig.2 B). Nuclear extracts prepared from control Caco-2 cells showed very little binding of NF-κB to the ENA-78-specific probe. After stimulation with IL-1β for 1 h Caco-2 nuclear extracts showed markedly increased levels of a slowly migrating NF-κB complex (band 1) as well as elevated levels of a second faster migrating NF-κB band (band 2). To investigate the composition of the two NF-κB complexes binding to the ENA-78 probe, supershift studies using antibodies directed against various Rel proteins were performed. As shown in Fig. 2 B the lower complex (band 2) supershifted only with anti-p50 consistent with a p50/p50homodimer. The upper complex (band 1) underwent a supershift with both anti-p65 and anti-p50 indicating the presence of a p50/p65 heterodimer. Thus, in IL-1β-stimulated Caco-2 cells the ENA-78-specific NF-κB binding site appears to bind two species of activated NF-κB: p50/p50 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers. As shown in Fig. 1, sequential truncations of the ENA-78 promoter indicated that in addition to the NF-κB binding site region, functionally important regulatory element(s) were also likely to be located within nucleotides −154 to −126 of the promoter. A previous study (21Chang M.S. McNinch J. Basu R. Simonet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25277-25282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has reported that this region of the ENA-78 promoter contains a putative AP-2 binding site (designated site A; see Fig. 1). To define the contribution, if any, of site A to IL-1β-stimulated ENA-78 gene expression, a mutant full-length ENA-78 reporter construct containing a targeted deletion of this potential binding site was prepared. Deletion of site A reduced basal and IL-1β-stimulated ENA-78 reporter gene activity ∼75% (Fig.3 A; p < 0.01 versus wild type). However, in contrast to deletion or substitution of the NF-κB site, site A deletion did not prevent cytokine-stimulated ENA-78 reporter gene activation (9.6-fold induction with IL-1β). Mutant ENA-78 reporter genes containing deletions of two other potential AP-2 binding sites (site B or site C; see Fig. 1), which by promoter truncation analysis did not contribute to Caco-2 luciferase activity, were prepared also. As shown in Fig. 3, targeted deletion of either site B or site C had no significant effect on basal or IL-1β-induced luciferase activity. Taken together with the data presented in Fig. 2, these findings suggest that NF-κB is a critical regulator of the ENA-78 gene expression in response to IL-1β stimulation, whereas site A appears to control the overall activity of ENA-78 gene transcription but is not required for responses to IL-1β. EMSA using a site A probe (nucleotides −146 to −118 of the ENA-78 promoter; Fig. 3 B) revealed the presence of two major complexes (designated NF-1 and NF-2) and two faster migrating minor complexes (designated NF-3 and NF-4) in nuclear extracts from control Caco-2 cells. Binding of all bands to the site A probe was reduced significantly upon competition with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled site A probe (shown in Fig.4 B), indicating specific binding to the probe. Exposure of Caco-2 cells to IL-1β did not appear to alter levels of any complex over the 6-h time course of the experiment. To determine whether these complexes contained AP-2, supershift assays were performed using antibodies to AP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ; however, none of the complexes was supershifted with any of the antibodies tested (data not shown). Thus, contrary to the report of Chang et al. (21Chang M.S. McNinch J. Basu R. Simonet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25277-25282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the site A region of the ENA-78 promoter does not appear to contain a functional binding element for known members of the AP-2 family of transcription factors. Further analysis of the site A region for homology to known transcription factor binding elements (using the TransFac data base) indicated potential binding sites for members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors, in particular, Sp1. To determine whether binding of NF-1, -2, -3, or -4 to the site A probe required zinc, we next performed EMSAs in the presence of the zinc-chelating agent EDTA. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the addition of increasing amounts of EDTA to the EMSA reaction mixture dose dep"

One aspect of vascular function that is altered in diabetes is smooth muscle cell (SMC)1 behavior. SMC undergo a change from a quiescent state to an activated proliferative and migratory phenotype. This change is termed phenotypic modulation and it is the hallmark of atherosclerosis (11Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Cyclic nucleotides have an important role in regulating vascular tone and maintaining the mature contractile phenotype in SMC. CREB, the Ca2+/cAMP response element-binding protein, is a transcription factor that is a downstream target of cyclic AMP signaling. β-Adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP-dependent signaling pathways and protein kinase A (PKA) in the vessel wall has anti-proliferative effects. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation is one aspect of this antiproliferative effect. Data presented by our group suggests that CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) may be a downstream target for the antiproliferative effects of cyclic nucleotides (8Bornfeldt K.E.

We have recently demonstrated that CREB protein content is important for regulation of SMC phenotype, specifically migratory and proliferative capacity. A significantly greater CREB content is found in proliferation-resistant SMC subpopulations in normal vessels, while much lower levels exist in proliferation-prone SMC and vessels exposed to hypoxia (15Klemm D.J.

In diabetes, there is an abnormal metabolic environment including high glucose, high free fatty acids, and either high insulin or insulin deficiency. Accumulation of reactive oxidant species (ROS) has been reported in human and rodent diabetic vessels (16Inoguchi T. Xia P. Kunisaki M. Higashi S. Feener King G.L. Am. J.

There is a suggestion in the neuronal literature that oxidative stress in a negative modulator of CREB DNA binding and also that ROS interferes with acute signaling to CREB. High glucose can increase intracellular ROS by numerous mechanisms including activation of PKC, AGE accumulation, and release form mitochondria (20Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X. Yamagishi S.

In this study, we examined the impact of chronic exposure to high glucose or ROS upon CREB content in SMC, both in vessel walls and in culture. We observed high glucose-mediated depletion of CREB content in vitro, which correlated with increased chemokinesis and proliferation. These changes in SMC activation could be rescued either by pretreatment with antioxidants or by overexpression of constitutively active CREB protein. These studies suggest that one factor leading to atherosclerosis in diabetes could be loss of CREB content. Fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Gemini Bio Products, Inc. (Cabassas, CA). Trypsin/EDTA, LipofectAMINE and Plus Reagent were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). CREB and phospho-CREB-specific antisera were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [3H]Thymidine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Promoter-reporter constructs containing cyclic AMP regulatory elements driving expression of the gene encoding firefly luciferase (CRE-Luc) were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the constitutively active CREB mutant DIEDML-CREB (DCREB) was graciously provided by Dr. Richard Goodman. Cells expressing luciferase and β-galactosidase following transfection with promoter-reporter plasmid constructs were extracted using diluted 5 × reporter lysis buffer obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Reagents for assays of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity in cell extracts were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). 12-Well micro-Boyden chambers (Transwell Apparatus) with polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters with 8-mm pores were obtained from Costar, Corning, NY. Dif Quick Cell Staining Reagents were purchased from American Hospital Supply Corp., McGraw Park, IL. Minimal essential Eagle's medium and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated by media explant from bovine and rat aortas. Cells were passaged in culture and used for experiments between passages 2 and 5. Cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For most of the experiments presented bovine cells were used, results were similar in all cases in rat SMC. Prior to experiments, cells were incubated in serum-reduced medium (MEM + 0.1% FBS) for 48 h. In experiments involving different glucose concentrations, glucose was added to MEM + 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone at final concentrations of 5 mm(low glucose) and 25 mm (high glucose) for 72 h prior to assessment. Similarly, hydrogen peroxide and glucose oxidase were added at varying concentrations (0–45 μm or 0–34 milliunits/ml, respectively) for 72 h prior to assay. For SMC chemokinesis studies, cells were plated on the upper membrane surface in a Boyden chamber (Transwells, Costar, Corning, NY) and chemokinesis allowed to continue for 3 h in the presence of low or high glucose or various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as indicated in the individual figures. SMC were labeled with 10 mm 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes, CA). This dye, in acetomethyl ester form, easily enters cells where it is trapped by the action of cellular deacetylase activity. This dye, when exposed to an excitation wavelength of 485 nm, emits light at 530 nm only when it has been oxidized. Cells were exposed to ROS (using hydrogen peroxide) or altered medium glucose concentration in the absence or presence ofl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (Sigma) which enhances oxidant stress in cells by blunting the synthesis of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione. Labeled SMC were examined using a fluorescence spectrofluorimeter for oxidized dye. A standard curve of increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide was used to validate the method in SMC (see Fig. 4 A). Additionally, cells were treated with l-glucose and mannitol to control for the effects of osmotic load (which can induce ROS accumulation in cells) as well as providing a distinction between metabolizable and non-metabolizable hexose sugars. Early passage cultures (P1-P5) of either bovine or rat aortic SMC cells were plated in 6-well culture dishes at a density of 1.4 × 105 cells/cm2. Cells were subsequently maintained for 18 h in growth medium, consisting of minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 1 × non-essential amino acids, 0.4 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products Inc.). Transfection is performed using LipofectAMINE Plus Transfection Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. In addition to specific chimeric promoter-luciferase plasmid constructs, SMC cells were co-transfection with a constitutively expressed β-galactosidase reporter plasmid construct (RSV-β-gal). As a control for the CRE-luc studies we employed a plasmid containing the enhancerless control plasmid pCIS-CK (Stratagene; identical to the CRE-luc construct but lacking CRE promoter elements). The LipofectAMINE Plus:DNA mixture in growth medium was left on cells for 3 h, and cells were allowed to recover in growth medium overnight. SMC cells were subsequently serum-starved in 1 × MEM (minimal essential medium containing 1 × non-essential amino acids and 0.4 mm glutamine) for 24 h. Agonist treatment was performed in 1 × MEM for durations of 4–24 h, and cells were subsequently extracted in 1 × reporter lysis buffer (Promega) for analysis of reporter gene expression. Luciferase reporter activity was corrected for differences in transfection efficiency, cell number, and extract recovery, using β-galactosidase activity determined in the same cellular extract. All results are expressed as luminescence as arbitrary light units/β-galactosidase activity in the sample extract. SMC were infected using recombinant, replication-deficient adenovirus under the regulation of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter regulating the ectopic expression of cDNA encoding constitutively active VP16-CREB (VP16-CREB), DIEDML CREB (DCREB), MCREB (MCREB), KCREB (KCREB), or β-galactosidase (β-gal). Constructs were assessed for enhanced expression of appropriate recombinant proteins in SMC following treatment of cultures with either different volumes of crude virus (VP16-CREB) or purified virus (at 2.5 × 103 m.o.i. per cell) using Western blot analysis. Additionally, all constructs were created using the same adenoviral DNA backbone containing a FLAG tag for assessment of expression in infected cells. Quality control experiments were performed to determine thenumber of cells expressing FLAG peptide following infection with purified CREB-mutant viruses (as described in Ref. 15Klemm D.J. Watson P.A. Frid M.G. Dempsey E.C. Schaack J. Colton L.A. Nesterova A. Stenmark K.R. Reusch J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46132-46141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Results indicate that 42–70% of cells in these cultures expressed visually detectable FLAG peptide in cells infected with the same m.o.i. of different CREB-FLAG adenovirus constructs (data not shown). When cells were infected with an adenoviral construct expressing green fluorescent protein, more than 90% of cells were infected. Immunohistochemical assessment of FLAG-peptide expression may underestimate the percent of cell infected as detection of fluorescence from green fluorescent protein is more robust. In either case, the observation that infection and expression of recombinant proteins at a rate less than 100% of cells indicates that the impact of these proteins on SMC behavior may actually be understated by these experiments. For experiments, bovine or rat SMCs were plated at a density of 1.4 × 105 cells/cm2 in 6-well culture dishes and maintained in growth medium for 24 h. SMC in 35-mm culture dishes were treated with purified adenovirus (adVP16-CREB or adβGal) at the previously described m.o.i. per cell for 24 h. Cells were fed fresh serum-reduced medium lacking virus and incubated an additional 24 h. DNA synthesis, cell chemokinesis, fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) analysis of cell cycle, and protein extraction for Western blot analysis were performed at this time. At the end of experimental treatments, SMC cultures were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and wells scraped in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer. Protein concentrations of samples were assessed by the Bradford protein assay, and 40 μg of cellular protein were run on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels for assessment of phospho-CREB, CREB, and ATF3 analyses. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nylon membranes, and equivalence of protein loading was assessed by staining of membrane-bound proteins by Ponceau stain. CREB, phosphorylated CREB, and ATF3 content were evaluated immunologically using commercially available antisera (New England Biolabs), a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and subsequent enhanced chemiluminesence. Both Ponceau-stained membranes (for protein loading) and autoradiographic films (for specific protein signals) were analyzed densitometrically using a Fluor-S MultiImager and Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. In figures, results are expressed as arbitrary densitometric units with statistical differences (p > 0.05) as determined by Student's t test. Rates of DNA synthesis in cultured bovine or rat SMC cells were estimated by the rate of incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cellular DNA. SMC cells plated in 12-well plates were subjected to experimental treatment, and pulsed with [3H]thymidine (2.0 μCi/ml) for the final 3 h of treatment. Cells were extracted fixed for 10 min in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, which also removed unincorporated [3H]thymidine. Fixed cells were extracted in 1 m sodium hydroxide, which was normalized with 1 m hydrochloric acid. An aliquot of the extract was used for protein determination (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and the remainder of the sample subjected to liquid scintillation spectrometry. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into SMC cell DNA is expressed as disintegrations per minute per μg of cell protein. Cell cycle progression was assessed using FACS. Cells were treated with recombinant adenoviruses, adVP16-CREB, or adβGal, for 24 h in either medium containing either 0.1 or 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone. Cells were fixed in ice-cold ethanol, incubated with propidium iodide, and subjected to FACS analysis. Results are expressed as cells in phases S + G2M versuscells in phases G0-G1. Chemokinetic behavior of SMC cells was be assessed using a 12-well micro-Boyden chamber apparatus with Type I collagen-coated polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filter with 8-mm pores (Transwell Apparatus, Costar). Different concentrations of medium glucose or hydrogen peroxide are diluted in serum-free medium and added to the lower chamber of the apparatus. Trypsinized cells are resuspended in serum-free medium containing appropriate concentrations of glucose or hydrogen peroxide, and are plated at a density of 25,000 or 50,000 cells per well in a volume of 100 μl. At the end of the experimental incubation, cells attached to the filter are fixed and stained in Dif Quick Cell Staining reagents (American Hospital Supply Corp.). Cells that have migrated, located on the underside of the filter, are counted manually and chemokinesis expressed as cells migrating per microscopic field. The animals were housed in the Denver Veterans Affairs Animal Facility and diabetes was induced in half of the animals via intraperitoneal injection of 45 mg/kg streptozotocin, with vehicle injected into control animals. Diabetes was be confirmed with tail vein blood (One Touch Glucometer, LifeScan, Newtown, PA) 48 h after streptozotocin. Animals with blood glucose levels greater than 250 mg/dl were maintained for 8 weeks with ad libitum food and water. Weekly body weight and blood glucose determinations were made throughout the duration of the study. Animals were sacrificed as per the animal facility requirements. All animal studies were approved by the local Veterans Affairs and UCHSC animal care committees. Following 8 weeks of diabetes, during which animals which had been injected had elevated blood glucose (>400 mg/dl), the animals were sacrificed with sodium pentobarbital at 45 mg/kg and aorta tissue removed. Tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Aorta from female ob/ob and lean ob/− littermate control mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were obtained in collaboration with Dr. Boris Draznin (Denver, CO). Ob mice were given ad libitum access to food and sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and samples were analyzed for insulin and glucose concentrations. In separate experiments, C57 BL-6 male mice experimental obesity was created by intraperitoneal injection of gold thioglucose (Sigma: 0.5 mg/kg body weight) at 5 weeks of age (21Young J.K. McKenzie J.C. Brady L.S. Herkenham M. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 165: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These and animals that matched the sham injected animals were givenad libitum access to food and sacrificed at 30 weeks of age. Age-matched Zucker obese (fa/fa) and lean control (fa/−) rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Rats were fed standard chow and sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Aortic samples from ob/ob, ob/−, gold thioglucose-obese, control, fa/fa, and fa/− animals were obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Boris Draznin, unrelated data on these animals has been previously published (22Goalstone M.L. Wall K. Leitner J.W. Kurowski T. Ruderman N. Pan S.J. Ivy J.L. Moller D.E. Draznin B. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the rosiglitazone treatment studies, 40 male ob mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories at 6 weeks of age. Mice with blood glucose greater than 15 mmol/liter were randomized to treatment via gavage with either 20 mg/kg/days of rosiglitazone or CMC vehicle. Glucose and body weight were assessed at baseline, days 4 and 8. Animals were sacrificed at day 11. Previous studies from our laboratory defined CREB as an antiproliferative protein in SMC. As mentioned in the Introduction, diabetes-mediated accumulation of ROS could negatively affect CREB function. Therefore, we examined the impact of high glucose on SMC CREB protein content and function. Chronic exposure (72 h) of SMC to high glucose (25 mm) results in a modest but statistically significant decrease in CREB protein content (Fig. 1). Chronic exposure to high glucose also leads to increased content ofactivating transcription factor 3, ATF3 (Fig. 1). ATF3 is a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors which can inhibit CRE-mediated gene activation. CREB is known to regulate cAMP responseelement (CRE)-dependent gene expression. To determine whether decreased CREB content led to decreased CREB-mediated gene expression we examined the effect of high glucose treatment upon CRE-dependent promoter activity. SMC were transfected with a consensus CRE-containing promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene). Transcriptional activity from this promoter was significantly diminished following treatment with chronic high glucose (Fig. 2). This decrease in transcription from the chimeric CRE-luc construct is a function of the CRE sequences in the construct, as luciferase production from the pCIS-CK construct, which lack CRE elements, was unaffected by ROS or glucose (Fig. 2). This was not a generalized effect on all transcription as experiments using two distinct promoters containing NF-κB regulatory elements indicated that transcription from these constructs was unaffected by exposure to glucose or ROS (data not shown). Acute NF-κB activation following treatment with ROS or glucose was not examined in these experiments, however, immunohistochemical examination of SMC following 30 min exposure to these agents indicates rapid and transient translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the nuclei of SMC (data not shown). Exposure of either rat or bovine SMC to 25 mm glucose for 48 h results in a significant acceleration in the rate of DNA synthesis, as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig.3 A), and the number of replicating SMC as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 3 B). Cell number was also increased (data not shown). Similarly, both rat and bovine SMC demonstrate an increase in chemokinesis in response to chronic high glucose treatment (Fig. 3 C). Increases in rates of SMC chemokinesis and DNA synthesis following chronic high glucose were similar to those reported previously in rat SMC (23Yasunari K. Kohno M. Kano H. Yokokama K. Minami M. Yoshikawa J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Natarajan R. Gonzales N. Xu L. Nadler J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the glucose-mediated induction of ROS could be responsible for depletion of CREB in the SMC. This hypothesis was attractive because increased ROS has been reported in the vasculature of both insulin-resistant and insulin-deficient diabetes in rodents and humans (16Inoguchi T. Xia P. Kunisaki M. Higashi S. Feener King G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E369-E379PubMed Google Scholar, 17Karasu C. Ozansoy G. Bozkurt O. Erdogan D. Omeroglu S.

SMC were labeled with 10 mmCM-H2DCFDA (Molecular Probes), a dye which when exposed to an excitation wavelength of 485 nm, emits light at 530 nm only when it has been oxidized. Standard curves using hydrogen peroxide indicate the effectiveness of this approach in SMC (Fig.4 A). SMC exposed to increasing concentrations of glucose for 24 h demonstrate a significant dose-dependent increase in oxidation of intracellular dye relative to both mannitol and l-glucose controls (Fig.4 B). Additionally, the effect of d-glucose to increase dye oxidation was enhanced by treatment withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, which blocks production and accumulation of the intracellular anti-oxidant glutathione (Fig. 4 B). SMC were exposed to two methods commonly employed for induction of ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glucose oxidase; which generates a constant level of H2O2). Increased ROS mimicked the effects of chronic high glucose treatment on CREB (Fig. 5, top andcenter) as well as increased the content of ATF3 (Fig. 5,bottom). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that decreases in CREB content seen with chronic hyperglycemia result from glucose-induced oxidative stress. SMC were exposed to chronic ROS as detailed in the figure legends. After 72 h, cells were assessed for cell cycle progression by FACS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results indicate that exposure to ROS increases the number of cells progressing through the cell cycle, similar to the effects seen with chronic glucose exposure (Fig.6 A). In addition, SMC exposed to hydrogen peroxide demonstrated increased migratory behavior (Fig.6 B), similar to that observed in SMC exposed to chronic high glucose. We next assessed the impact of pretreatment with antioxidants upon glucose and ROS-mediated CREB depletion. Pretreatment of SMC with N-acetylcystiene, an antioxidant which will neutralize hydrogen peroxide, results in the prevention of high glucose- and ROS-mediated loss of CREB (Fig.7). This suggests that high glucose-mediated CREB depletion is secondary to ROS generation. Experiments were performed to determine whether the induction of progression through the cell cycle and increased chemokinesis induced by glucose or ROS were mechanistically related to the CREB depletion noted in Fig. 5. CREB content and function were manipulated by infection with a panel of adenoviral constructs encoding either active or dominant negative CREB expression vectors (constitutively active CR"

Using the monocyte cell line THP-1, we investigated the relative abilities of eotaxin and MCPs 1–4 to induce CCR2 signaling, employing assays of directed cell migration and intracellular calcium flux. Surprisingly, 1 μm concentrations of eotaxin were able to recruit THP-1 cells in chemotaxis assays, and this migration was sensitive to antagonism of CCR2 but not CCR3. Radiolabeled eotaxin binding assays performed on transfectants bearing CCR2b or CCR3 confirmed eotaxin binding to CCR2 with a K d of 7.50 ± 3.30 nm, compared with aK d of 1.68 ± 0.91 nm at CCR3. In addition, whereas 1 μm concentrations of eotaxin were able to recruit CCR2b transfectants, substimulatory concentrations of eotaxin inhibited MCP-1-induced chemotaxis of CCR2b transfectants and also inhibited MCP-1-induced intracellular calcium flux of THP-1 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that eotaxin is a partial agonist of the CCR2b receptor. A greater understanding of the interaction of CCR2 with all of its ligands, both full and partial agonists, may aid the rational design of specific antagonists that hold great promise as future therapeutic treatments for a variety of inflammatory disorders.

CC chemokine receptor monocyte chemoattractant protein monoclonal antibody fluorescence-activated cell sorting polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) Chemokines represent an expanding family of structurally highly related small proteins that play a crucial role in inflammation (1Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3289) Google Scholar). Upwards of 40 chemokines have been described to date, and they can be divided into four different structural families, according to the position of their amino-terminal cysteine residues. Most chemokines belong to two main families: the CXC class, where one amino acid separates the first two cysteine residues, or the CC class, possessing two adjacent cysteine residues. In addition, a C class featuring a single C-motif and a CX3C class in which the two cysteines are separated by three residues have been described. At present, the only members of these classes are lymphotactin and fractalkine, respectively (2Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.A.

Chemokines mediate their signaling by binding to specific receptors that belong to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptors (4Murphy P.M. Baggiolini M. Charo I.F. Hebert C.A. Horuk R. Matsushima K. Miller L.H. Oppenheim J.J. Power C.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 145-176PubMed Google Scholar). Between the various receptors, the highest homology occurs in the transmembrane domains, and the greatest divergence occurs in the extracellular domains, which show selectivity for different ligands. Studies of CCR2b,1 CCR1, and CCR3 have shown that the amino terminus of each receptor seems to play a fundamental role in chemokine binding and that one or more extracellular loops are necessary for subsequent transduction of a signal, the so-called two-step model of receptor activation (5Monteclaro F.S.

Most known receptors have been reported to interact with multiple ligands, and likewise a single chemokine can usually interact with more than one receptor. For example, all four members of the monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) family (MCPs 1–4) bind to CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) (7Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol.

In this report, we show that high concentrations of eotaxin are sufficient to activate the related receptor CCR2 in assays of chemotaxis and that substimulatory concentrations of eotaxin can antagonize MCP-1 activity at CCR2, characteristic of eotaxin being a partial agonist at CCR2. Analytical grade reagents were purchased from BDH Chemicals Ltd. or Sigma. Fura-2/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). IgG1 (clone MOPC 21) and IgG2a (clone UPC 10) negative control antibodies were obtained from Sigma. The mAbs 2D4 (anti-human CCR1), 1D9 (anti-human CCR2), 2D7 (anti-human CCR5), and 7B11 (anti-human CCR3) were kind gifts of Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Boston, MA). Rabbit IgG was from Vector Laboratories, whereas fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (F(ab′)2 fragment) and rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins/RPE (F(ab′)2 fragment) were purchased from DAKO (Ely, United Kingdom). Recombinant chemokines were purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd., and oligonucleotide primers were purchased from MWG-Biotech UK (Milton Keynes, United Kingdom).125I-Radiolabeled chemokines were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and had a specific activity of ∼2000 Ci/mmol. THP-1 cells, the previously described 4DE4-CCR3 transfectants, and the murine pre-B cell line L1.2 were maintained as previously described (6Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol.

Stably transfected cells were cultured in the same medium with the addition of 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) to maintain selection. The vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the cDNA encoding CCR2b was introduced into L1.2 cells by electroporation as previously described (21Sabroe I. Conroy D.M. Gerard N.P. Li Y. Collins P.D. Post T.W. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Gerard C. Ponath P.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6139-6147PubMed Google Scholar). For transient transfections, 10 mm sodium butyrate was added to the medium overnight, and cells were used the following day. To generate stable transfectants, cells were cultured for 48 h before supplementing with fresh medium containing G418 at 1 mg/ml final concentration to allow the positive selection of the transfected cells. Individual pools of cells were then screened for receptor expression by FACS analysis using appropriate antibodies, and clones subsequently obtained by limiting dilution. L1.2 transfectants bearing known chemokine receptors or THP-1 cells were assessed by FACS analysis as follows. 5 × 105harvested cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% NaN3) containing specific antibodies directed against CCR1 (2D4; 10 μg/ml), CCR2 (LS132.1D9; 10 μg/ml), CCR3 (7B11; 3 μg/ml), or CCR5 (2D7; 10 μg/ml). An irrelevant IgG1 or IgG2a antibody was used as an appropriate isotype control. For THP-1 staining, an additional incubation step with rabbit IgG was added prior to incubation with the primary antibody to reduce background binding, presumably to Fc receptors expressed in abundance on these cells. Unbound antibody was removed by washing with 2 ml of FACS buffer, and the cells were then resuspended in the same buffer containing a 1:20 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 secondary antibody. After a 30-min incubation, cells were washed again with 2 ml of FACS buffer and resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. Surface expression was then analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 106 THP-1 cells using RNAzolTM(Biogenesis, Poole, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions, after which 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperscriptTM II, RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase, (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK). The cDNAs obtained were amplified by PCR using the following primer pairs specific for each receptor: CCR1, sense primer (5′-CGA CTA CAA GTT GAA GGA TGA CT-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGC TTT CGT GAG GAA AGT GAA G-3′); CCR2 TM7 (5′-TCT TGG GAT GAC TCA CTG CTG-3′); CCR2a, antisense primer (5′-GGC TCC TTC TTT GTC CTG AAG-3′); CCR2b, antisense primer (5′-TAA ACC ACG CGA GAC TTC CTG-3′); and CCR3, sense primer (5′-GTC AGG GGG CAT AAC TGG GTT-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ACT GCA AAG AGT TCT TTC AAA CA-3′). Intron-spanning primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also employed as a positive control to assay for potential genomic DNA contamination. Reactions were carried out using theTaq-BeadTM hot start polymerase kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and the resulting PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 3% MetaPhor gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME). These were performed as previously described (22Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol.

Cells were stimulated with the appropriate chemokine, and real time data were recovered using a fluorimeter (LS-50B; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data were expressed as the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after sequential stimulation at 340 and 380 nm. Assays of the chemotactic responsiveness of THP-1 cells or L1.2 transfectant cells were carried out as previously described (6Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using ChemoTXTM microchemotaxis chambers with a 5-μm pore (Receptor Technologies, Adderbury, UK). In receptor blockade experiments, cells were preincubated with LS132.1D9 as a blocking CCR2 mAb (10 μg/ml) or 7B11 as a CCR3-blocking mAb (3 μg/ml) at room temperature for 10 min before chemotactic activity was assessed. Preincubation of cells with an irrelevant control antibody was also performed as a negative control. 125I-Eotaxin binding assays were performed on CCR2b and CCR3 transfectants as previously described (22Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was typically 20–40% of the total counts. The data were fit to a curve, and the dissociation constant (K d) for eotaxin at each receptor was calculated using the program LIGAND (23Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). The cold displacement binding assays involving 125I-MCP-1 binding to CCR2b transfectants and THP-1 membranes were carried out as follows (24LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CCR2b transfectants were treated overnight with 2 mm sodium butyrate before harvesting by centrifugation. The cells (2.5 × 105) or membranes (2 μg/well) were incubated at room temperature for 90 min with either 0.1 nm (transfectants) or 0.2 nm (THP-1 membranes) 125I-labeled MCP-1 in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines. Bound and free tracer were separated by filtration using 96-well GF/B Unifilter plates (Packard Instrument Co.) presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed at 4 °C with 300 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl to reduce nonspecific binding. IC50 values (concentrations at which specific binding of the iodinated chemokine was inhibited by 50%) were calculated by a two-parameter logistic curve fit using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Inc., Reading, PA). K i values were calculated with the Cheng-Prusoff (25Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12293) Google Scholar) correction (K i = IC50/(1 + (tracer concentration/tracer K d))) using aK d value for MCP-1 of 0.43 nm for the CCR2b transfectants and 0.13 nm for the THP-1 membranes. The monoclonal antibody 1D9 was produced against human CCR2 by immunizing mice with L1.2 transfectants expressing CCR2. 2G. LaRosa, manuscript in preparation. Fig.1 illustrates its selectivity for CCR2 as verified by a panel of L1.2 transfectants bearing either CCR2b or the two most closely related receptors at the protein level, CCR1 (54.7% identity) and CCR5 (69.7% identity). Fig. 1 A shows that 1D9 clearly recognizes CCR2 stable transfectants but not CCR5 (Fig.1 D) or CCR1 (Fig. 1 G) transfectants. Control staining of these latter two cell lines is shown in Fig. 1,E and I, with the anti-CCR6 antibody 2D7 or the anti-CCR1 antibody 2D4. We have previously shown that 1D9 does not stain eosinophils and is also unable to block CCR3/eotaxin-mediated eosinophil shape change, ruling out any cross-reactivity with the more distantly related receptor CCR3 (52.3% identity with CCR2) (26Heinemann A. Hartnell A. Stubbs V.E.L. Murakami K. Soler D. LaRosa G. Askenase P.W. Williams T.J. Sabroe I. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7224-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MCP-1 was originally identified by its ability to recruit monocytes and is typically associated with diseases characterized by monocyte infiltration. We assessed the monocytic cell line THP-1 for the expression of CCR2 and related receptors. CCR1, -2, and -3 were detected at the protein level by FACS analysis by specific monoclonal antibodies (Fig.2 A). Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, mRNA for all three species could also be detected (Fig. 2 B). The expected bands of 300 and 280 bp were detected for CCR1 and CCR3, respectively, whereas both isoforms of CCR2 (CCR2a and CCR2b) could be detected (260 and 210 bp for CCR2a and CCR2b, respectively). A larger band presumably corresponding to the fully transcribed unspliced form of the CCR2 gene was also detected (27Polentarutti N. Allavena P. Bianchi G. Giardina G. Basile A. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Introna M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2689-2694PubMed Google Scholar). Negative controls for each primer pair (minus cDNA template) showed a lack of genomic contamination (lanes 5–8), as did the intron-spanning glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (lane 9). It is well documented that upon binding to their receptors, chemokines activate many intracellular signaling pathways, one or more of which may lead to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. THP-1 cells were loaded with the fluorescent dye Fura-2/AM and subsequently stimulated with different concentrations of the chemokines MCP-1 to -4 and eotaxin. Mobilization of intracellular calcium was detected by real time fluorescence measurement. Fig.3 A shows the response of cells stimulated with a 10 nm concentration of each chemokine. MCP-1 and MCP-3 induced a robust increase of intracellular calcium, whereas in contrast, responses to MCP-2 and MCP-4 were relatively poor. Despite expressing CCR3 at the protein and mRNA level, stimulation of THP-1 cells with 10 nm eotaxin resulted in no detectable calcium fluxes, the same concentration that gave detectable fluxes for MCP-1 to -4. The dose-response analysis of all five chemokines (Fig.3 B) illustrated that MCP-1 and MCP-3 were much more potent than MCP-2 and MCP-4, with a maximal response obtained at a concentration of 10 nm. Again, even at concentrations of up to 25 nm, eotaxin gave no detectable response. The ability of THP-1 cells to undergo directed migration in response to the different chemokines was subsequently assessed (Fig.4 A). In response to MCP-1, THP-1 cells showed a typical bell-shaped curve with a maximal response reached at 10 nm. MCP-3 was a more efficacious and more potent ligand, with a maximal chemotactic response obtained to a concentration of 1 nm. In contrast, only modest levels of chemotaxis were induced by MCP-2 and MCP-4, consistent with their reduced efficacies at inducing calcium flux (Fig. 4, A andB). Eotaxin, despite being unable to recruit THP-1 cells at low concentrations, was able to recruit cells at concentrations of 1 μm, with an efficacy approaching that of 10 nm MCP-1. This is in contrast to its chemotactic activity at CCR3, the sole receptor believed to date to signal in response to eotaxin, whose activity we and others have shown to be optimal in the low nanomolar range (6Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 28Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J. Malkowitz L. Sirontino A. Springer M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Whereas MCP-1 binds exclusively to CCR2, the other members of the MCP family can also bind and signal through CCR3. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, THP-1 cells possess both CCR2 and CCR3 at the protein and mRNA levels. To dissect the roles of each receptor in inducing chemotaxis to MCP-1, MCP-3, and eotaxin, we specifically inhibited both receptors in series. THP-1 cells were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with either the blocking monoclonal antibody LS132.1D9 (an inhibitor of CCR2) or the blocking monoclonal antibody 7B11 (an inhibitor of CCR3). An IgG2a isotype control antibody was also used as a negative control. Chemotaxis assays were then carried out as before. The results obtained are shown in Fig.4 B. As expected, chemotaxis induced by MCP-1 was greatly reduced in cells that were preincubated with mAb LS132.1D9, whereas little or no effect was observed in cells pretreated with mAb 7B11, suggesting that chemotaxis to MCP-1 is directed solely through CCR2 in THP-1 cells. Similarly, chemotaxis to MCP-3 was affected only by blockade of CCR2, suggesting usage of this receptor by MCP-3. We were initially surprised by the results obtained by dissection of the eotaxin-induced chemotactic pathway. The CCR3-blocking antibody 7B11 had little effect on chemotaxis, whereas the mAb LS132.1D9, specific for CCR2, greatly reduced migration of the cells. Migration in response to MIP-1α was unaffected, underscoring the specificity of the 1D9 antibody. Thus, it appears from our data that the eotaxin-induced migration of THP-1 cells is mediated via CCR2, previously reported solely as a receptor for the MCPs 1–4. As a consequence of the results obtained in the chemotaxis experiments, we hypothesized that eotaxin binds to and subsequently signals through CCR2. To test this hypothesis, a series of binding assays were performed using either the pre-B cell lines L1.2 or 4DE4 stably transfected with cDNAs encoding CCR2b or CCR3, respectively (6Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Binding assays performed using 125I-radiolabeled eotaxin showed that125I-eotaxin bound to CCR2b with a K d of 7.50 nm, compared with a higher affinityK d of 1.68 nm at CCR3 (Fig.5, A and C). Competition experiments with unlabeled eotaxin and unlabeled MCP-1 to -4 suggest that the binding sites for eotaxin at both receptors overlap to a degree with those for the MCPs (Fig. 5, B andD). Thus, eotaxin is a ligand for CCR2b, albeit with a lower affinity than the one it displays at CCR3. To confirm that eotaxin was able to signal through CCR2, we assessed the ability of cells transfected with CCR2b to migrate in response to eotaxin and MCP-1. The data are shown in Fig.6 A and complement our data obtained using THP-1 cells. Whereas MCP-1 was able to induce chemotaxis via CCR2b at subnanomolar concentrations, eotaxin was only efficacious at the relatively high concentration of 1 μm, despite being able to bind to CCR2 with a low nanomolar affinity. In contrast, the ligands eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3 were inactive in assays of chemotaxis at all concentrations tested. We subsequently sought to investigate the effect of substimulatory concentrations of eotaxin on MCP-1-induced chemotaxis in L1.2 cells expressing CCR2b. A 0.1 nm MCP-1 fixed concentration was chosen, since this gave adequate migration (Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6 B shows that low concentrations of eotaxin were sufficient to inhibit MCP-1-induced chemotaxis in a concentration-dependent manner. In keeping with these findings, eotaxin was able to compete for the binding of125I-radiolabeled MCP-1 to both CCR2 transfectants (Fig.6 C, K i values of 0.15 nm for MCP-1 and 8.0 nm for eotaxin) and to THP-1 membranes (Fig.6 D, K i values of 0.06 nm for MCP-1 and 12.0 nm for eotaxin). Viewed as a whole, we conclude that eotaxin is a partial agonist of CCR2, being active in inducing chemotaxis at high concentrations yet inhibiting processes via the same receptor at low concentrations. To confirm our findings, we returned to the THP-1 cell line and investigated the ability of substimulatory concentrations of eotaxin to antagonize MCP-1-induced intracellular calcium fluxes. As can be seen in Fig. 7, complementary to our findings in CCR2b transfectants, substimulatory concentrations of eotaxin were able to antagonize CCR2b signaling induced by MCP-1. Eotaxin is a CC chemokine that was originally identified as a eosinophil chemoattractant (15Jose P.J. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D. Walsh D.T. Moqbel R. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Williams T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) and subsequently identified as a principal ligand for the chemokine receptor CCR3 (19Ponath P.D. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Newman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 28Daugherty B.L. Siciliano S.J. DeMartino J.

Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Using both the monocytic cell line THP-1 and CCR2b transfectants, we have demonstrated conclusively that eotaxin binds to and signals via CCR2 and not exclusively through CCR3 as was previously believed. Our findings are in contrast to those recently published by Ogilvieet al. (30Ogilvie P. Bardi G. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Uguccioni M. Blood. 2001; 97: 1920-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), who described eotaxin as a natural antagonist of CCR2 and an agonist of CCR5. Using the THP-1 cell line, we were unable to demonstrate functional CCR5 expression either by FACS analysis using a CCR5-specific antibody or by intracellular calcium flux in response to the CCR5-specific ligand MIP-1β (data not shown). This, coupled with the data we obtained with CCR2 blocking antibodies, suggests to us that in the THP-1 cell line, the chemotactic activity of eotaxin is mediated by CCR2. In addition, we have directly assessed the binding of eotaxin to CCR2 and demonstrated that it binds with low nanomolar affinity, around 5-fold lower than its affinity for CCR3. This lower affinity of eotaxin for CCR2 may, in part, explain the higher concentration of eotaxin needed to induce CCR2 as compared with CCR3 signaling. Chemotaxis induced by 0.1 nm MCP-1 was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by eotaxin with an IC50of 0.15 nm (Fig. 6 B). These concentrations of eotaxin are readily reached in vivo at sites of inflammation (31Humbles A.A. Conroy D.M. Marleau S. Rankin S.M. Palframan R.T. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Li D. Jeffery P.K. Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Williams T.J. Jose P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and suggest that functional antagonism of CCR2 by eotaxin probably occurs in human inflammation. Concentrations of 100 nm eotaxin were unable to completely block MCP-1-induced chemotaxis, suggesting either that this dose of eotaxin was able to induce some level of chemotaxis or that relatively few CCR2 molecules need to be occupied by MCP-1 to drive efficient chemotaxis of the tranfectants. This latter explanation agrees with the recent finding by Janetopoulos et al. (32Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) that the steady state level of G-protein activation can achieve a level of saturation well before all receptors are occupied, suggesting that G-protein-coupled receptors act catalytically. Current theories of G-protein-coupled receptor activation favor the ternary complex model (33De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and its more recent variant (34Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model proposes that the binding of the agonist to G-protein-coupled receptor stabilizes the formation of a ternary complex of agonist (A), receptor (R), and G-proteins (G), the so-called AR*G complex. In this complex, R* is the active state that can couple to the G-proteins, in contrast to the uncoupled inactive R state of receptor. Binding of ligand to the uncoupled receptor R may be described in terms of the stabilization of a partly activated form of the receptor (R*) that can couple with G-proteins. In addition, different states of R* are believed to exist, and it is possible that different agonists may stabilize different conformations of R*, accounting again for different efficacies observed in signal transduction (35Strange P.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the setting of CCR2 activation, eotaxin can be visualized as being less efficient at stabilizing the R* state of receptor than is MCP-1; hence, a higher concentration of eotaxin is required for effective chemotaxis. Thus, eotaxin is a partial agonist for CCR2 and exhibits only a weak affinity for the activation state of the receptor in contradiction to a full agonist, such as MCP-1, which has strong affinity for the activated R* state. Eotaxin shares more than 60% identity at the amino acid level with all four members of the MCP family (Fig. 8), so its agonist activity at CCR2, albeit partial, may not be so surprising. Interestingly, the two other eotaxin species, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3, were inactive at CCR2 as measured by assays of chemotaxis, which again may be predicted, since they share less than 40% identity with either eotaxin or the MCPs. Many of the residues believed to be critical for the interaction of MCP-1 with CCR2, namely Pro8, Arg24, and Lys35, are conserved in eotaxin (36Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13013-13025Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Whereas the cores of the two proteins are relatively similar, the amino-terminal regions (amino acids 1–9) are quite different, resembling either an ordered or disordered β-strand structure in MCP-1 and eotaxin, respectively (37Lubkowski J. Bujacz G. Boque L. Domaille P.J. Handel T.M. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38Crump M.P. Rajarathnam K. Kim K.S. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22471-22479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For a variety of chemokines, the amino terminus has been shown to be critical for receptor binding and activation. Indeed, the biological activity of eotaxin at CCR3 is dramatically reduced when the first two amino-terminal amino acids are removed by the activity of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV) (39Struyf S. Proost P. Schols D. De Clercq E. Opdenakker G. Lenaerts J.P. Detheux M. Parmentier M. De Meester I. Scharpe S. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4903-4909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Work by Han et al. (40Han K.H. Green S.R. Tangirala R.K. Tanaka S. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) has previously highlighted a crucial role in CCR2 activation for histidine 100 in the first extracellular loop of the receptor. They concluded that this basic residue of CCR2 did not contribute to ligand binding but was vital for receptor activation and subsequent signaling events and postulated that aspartate 3 of mature MCP-1 (also present in MCP-2 and -4) ion-bonded with histidine 100 of CCR2, resulting in a functional receptor-G-protein complex. It is tempting to speculate that the lack of negative charge within the amino terminus compromises the ability of eotaxin to induce formation of the AR*G complex and subsequently induce signaling. The introduction of a negative charge into the amino terminus of eotaxin by site-directed mutagenesis would directly test this hypothesis. Eotaxin has previously been shown to have antagonist properties at CXCR3 (41Weng Y. Siciliano S.J. Waldburger K.E. Sirotina-Meisher A. Staruch M.J. Daugherty B.L. Gould S.L. Springer M.S. DeMartino J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18288-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), possessing a low affinity for the receptor. Since CCR3 is expressed on cells believed to be involved in Th2 responses and CXCR3 in cells characteristic of the Th1 response (42Bonecchi R. Bianchi G. Bordignon P.P. D'Ambrosio D. Lang R.

In view of the data we present here, we propose that similar to its antagonistic activity at CXCR3, low nanomolar concentrations of eotaxin, as found in inflammatory settings, may be an important modulator of inflammation and Th1/Th2 bias. Thus, eotaxin is a potential target for the treatment of allergic inflammatory disease independent of its actions at CCR3, the receptor previously supposed to be its sole receptor.

https://openalex.org/W1537738024,"Neurons in the primary visual cortex are highly selective for stimulus orientation, whereas their thalamic inputs are not. Much controversy has been focused on the mechanism by which cortical orientation selectivity arises. Although an increasing amount of evidence supports a linear model in which orientation selectivity is conferred upon visual cortical cells by the alignment of the receptive fields of their thalamic inputs, the controversy has recently been rekindled with the suggestion that late cortical input—delayed by multiple synapses—could lead to sharpening of orientation selectivity over time. Here we used intracellular recordings in vivo to examine temporal properties of the orientation-selective response to flashed gratings. Bayesian parameter estimation demonstrated that both preferred orientation and tuning width were stable throughout the response to a single stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1980117255,"Arylalkylamine <i>N</i>-acetyltransferase (AANAT, serotonin <i>N-</i>acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.87) plays a unique transduction role in vertebrate physiology by converting information about day and night into a hormonal signal: melatonin. Only vertebrate members of the AANAT family have been functionally characterized. Here a putative AANAT from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (scAANAT) was studied to determine whether it possessed the catalytic activity of the vertebrate enzyme. scAANAT is 47% similar to ovine AANAT, but lacks the regulatory N- and C-terminal flanking regions conserved in all vertebrate AANATs. It was found to have enzyme activity generally typical for AANAT family members, although the substrate preference pattern was somewhat broader, the specific activity was lower, and the pH optimum was higher. Deletion of scAANAT reduced arylalkylamine acetylation by <i>S. cerevisiae</i>extracts, indicating that scAANAT contributes significantly to this process. The scAANAT sequence conformed to the three-dimensional structure of ovine AANAT catalytic core; however, an important structural element (loop 1) was found to be shorter and to lack a proline involved in substrate binding. These differences could explain the lower specific activity of scAANAT, because of the importance of loop 1 in catalysis. Data base analysis revealed the presence of putative AANATs in other fungi but not in the nearly complete genomes of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> or <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These studies indicate that the catalytic and kinetic characteristics of fungal and vertebrate enzymes can be considered to be generally similar, although some differences exist that appear to be linked to changes in one structural element. Perhaps the most striking difference is that fungal AANATs lack the regulatory domains of the vertebrate enzyme, which appear to be essential for the regulatory role the enzyme plays in photochemical transduction."

Glucagon treatment resulted in a 30% decrease in total plasma homocysteine and increased hepatic activities of glycine N-methyltransferase, cystathionine β-synthase, and cystathionine γ-lyase. Enzyme activities of the remethylation pathway were unaffected. The 90% elevation in activity of cystathionine β-synthase was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in its mRNA level. Hepatocytes prepared from glucagon-injected rats exported less homocysteine, when incubated with methionine, than did hepatocytes of saline-treated rats. Flux through cystathionine β-synthase was increased 5-fold in hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats as determined by production of14CO2 and α-[1-14C]ketobutyrate froml-[1-14C]methionine. Methionine transport was elevated 2-fold in hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats resulting in increased hepatic methionine levels. Hepatic concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, allosteric activators of cystathionine β-synthase, were also increased following glucagon treatment. These results indicate that glucagon can regulate plasma homocysteine through its effects on the hepatic transsulfuration pathway. An elevated plasma level of homocysteine is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease.

These results indicate that glucagon can regulate plasma homocysteine through its effects on the hepatic transsulfuration pathway. S-adenosylmethionine S-adenosylhomocysteine high performance liquid chromatography bovine serum albumin An elevated plasma concentration of homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid derived from methionine, has been recognized as an independent risk factor for the development of vascular disease (1Kang S.S. Wong P.W.K. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Methionine is adenylated by methionine adenosyltransferase to form S-adenosylmethionine, an important biological methyl donor. Numerous methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to a methyl acceptor, producing a methylated product and S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to form adenosine and homocysteine. Homocysteine has several possible fates: 1) remethylation to form methionine via either the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (using N 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a methyl donor) or betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (using betaine as a methyl donor); 2) catabolism by the transsulfuration pathway, ultimately forming cysteine; 3) export to the extracellular space. Two vitamin B6-dependent enzymes comprise the transsulfuration pathway: cystathionine β-synthase, which condenses homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine, and cystathionine γ-lyase, which cleaves cystathionine to cysteine, NH4+, and α-ketobutyrate. Altered flux through the remethylation or transsulfuration pathways as a result of genetic mutations or impaired vitamin status has been shown to affect plasma homocysteine levels (2Ubbink J.B. Vermaak W.J.H. van der Merwe A. Becker P.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1993; 57: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 3Kluijtmans L.A. Boers G.H. Kraus J.P. van der Heuvel L.P. Cruysberg J.R. Trijbels F.J. Blom H.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 59-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In recent years it has also become apparent that certain hormones can affect homocysteine metabolism. It has been shown that hypothyroid patients tend to have elevated plasma homocysteine and that these levels are normalized when thyroid levels are restored by thyroxine treatment (4Nedrebo B.G. Ericsson U.B. Nygard O. Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Aakvaag A. Aanderud S. Lien E.A. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 89-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Hussein W.I. Green R. Jacobsen D.W. Faimen C. Ann. Int. Med. 1999; 131: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Estrogen therapy for post-menopausal women has been shown to lower plasma homocysteine (6van Baal W.M. Smolders R.G. van der Mooren M.J. Teerlink T. Kenemans P. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 94: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Altered homocysteine metabolism has been observed in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients (Types 1 and 2) with signs of kidney dysfunction (i.e. elevated creatinine levels) tend to have increased plasma homocysteine (7Hultberg B. Agardh E. Andersson A. Brattstrom L. Isaksson A. Israelsson B. Agardh C.D. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1991; 51: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of renal dysfunction, patients with Type 1 diabetes exhibit decreased plasma homocysteine relative to normal subjects (8Robillon J.F. Canivet B. Candito M. Sadoul J.L. Jullien D. Morand P. Chambon P. Freychet P. Diabetes Metab. 1994; 20: 494-496PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in our laboratory have shown that plasma homocysteine is decreased in the streptozotocin-diabetic rat (a model for Type 1 diabetes mellitus). Insulin treatment increased plasma homocysteine in these diabetic animals (9Jacobs R.L. House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have also shown that enzyme activities of the hepatic transsulfuration pathway are increased during uncontrolled diabetes. These changes in activity were reversed by insulin treatment (9Jacobs R.L. House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The regulatory effects of glucagon on amino acid metabolism are well known. It can, for example, activate the glycine cleavage system (10Mabrouk G.M. Jois M. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), stimulate the y+ transporter (11Handlogten M.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3519-3525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and induce the five urea-cycle enzymes (12Snodgrass P.J. Lin R.C. Muller W.A. Aoki T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 23: 2748-2753Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Patients with a glucagonoma have diminished plasma amino acid levels, which are related to increased clearance by the liver (13Barazzoni R. Zanetti M. Tiengo A. Tessari P. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In light of the broad effects of glucagon on amino acid metabolism, it appears likely that homocysteine metabolism would be similarly regulated, given that it is a product of the metabolism of dietary essential methionine, and a precursor to cysteine. In addition, plasma glucagon is frequently elevated in Type 1 diabetes (14Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1976; 25: 136-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of glucagon in regulating homocysteine metabolism in the rat. We show that glucagon treatment lowered plasma homocysteine levels and those of related amino acids. Glucagon administration elevated the activity of both enzymes of the hepatic transsulfuration pathway. Increased hepatic cystathionine β-synthase mRNA was also observed. In addition, higher SAM1 and SAH concentrations provide positive allosteric modulation of cystathionine β-synthase, the committed step for the conversion of homocysteine to cysteine. The increased enzymes and positive effectors of the transsulfuration pathway could therefore provide a viable mechanism for the decrease in plasma homocysteine by stimulating flux through this pathway. Such an increased transsulfuration flux was directly demonstrated in isolated hepatocytes. Finally, we report novel data on the hepatic concentration of the relevant amino acids. In particular, we demonstrate that glucagon treatment, which decreases plasma levels of most amino acids, including methionine, actually results in an increase in hepatic levels of this amino acid. This, which would also contribute to the increased transsulfuration flux, was brought about by marked increase in methionine transport into hepatocytes. Injectable glucagon was obtained from Eli Lilly Canada Inc. (Toronto, Canada). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. All procedures were approved by Memorial University's Institutional Animal Care Committee and were in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (supplied from our University's breeding colony) weighing between 225 and 275 g were used in all studies. Animals were placed in individual cages and exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle beginning with light at 8:00 a.m. The animals ate commercial rodent chow (20% crude protein; ProLab® RMH 3000 rat chow) ad libitum and had free access to water. Glucagon treatment followed the procedure of Snodgrass et al. (12Snodgrass P.J. Lin R.C. Muller W.A. Aoki T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 23: 2748-2753Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Glucagon (4 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) was administered in three equal daily doses (at 8:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m., and 12:00 midnight) for 2 days while control rats received the vehicle (Eli Lilly Canada Inc). Two hours following the last injection, animals were anesthetized with 65 mg/kg intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital. Following a midline abdominal incision, a blood sample was collected from the abdominal aorta. The liver was then rapidly removed, and a portion was freeze-clamped at −70 °C while the remaining tissue was placed in ice-cold 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). Heparinized tubes containing the blood samples were placed on ice until plasma was separated by centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge (15 min, 3700 × g). The plasma was then frozen (−20 °C) for later use. Fresh tissues were diluted 1:5 with phosphate buffer and then homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkman Instruments, Toronto, Canada) for 20 s at 50% output. Homogenates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was retained. All enzyme assays were carried out on this 18,000 × g, post-mitochondrial supernatant. Total homocysteine and cysteine concentrations were determined in plasma and liver using reverse-phase HPLC and fluorescence detection of ammonium 7-fluoro 2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate thiol adducts, using the method of Vester and Rasmussen (15Vester B. Rasmussen K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 549-554PubMed Google Scholar). For amino acid determination, plasma and freeze-clamped liver were first deproteinized with 10% sulfosalicylic acid. Following centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was adjusted to pH 2.2 with lithium citrate buffer. The samples were then analyzed on a Beckman 121 MB amino acid analyzer using Benson D-X, 0.25 Cation Xchange Resin and a single-column, three-buffer lithium method as per Beckman 121MB-TB-017 application notes. Results were quantitated using a Hewlett Packard Computing Integrator Model 3395A. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined enzymatically (16Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Schmidt F. Stork H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Vol. 3. 2nd Ed. Verleg Chemie International, Deerfield Beach, FL1981Google Scholar). Plasma insulin and glucagon levels were measured by Linco Research Inc. (St. Charles, MO) using rat insulin and glucagon, respectively, as standards. We measured the activities of enzymes responsible for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine: methionine synthase (17Kolbin D.D. Watson J.E. Deady J.E. Stokstad E.L.R. Eger II, E.I. Anesthesiology. 1981; 54: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase (18Wang J.A. Dudman N.P.B. Lynch J. Wilcken D.E.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 204: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (19Engbersen A.M.T. Franken D.G. Boers G.H.J. Stevens E.M.B. Trijbels F.J.M. Blom H.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 142-150PubMed Google Scholar). Four enzymes that catabolize methionine conversion to cysteine were also measured:S-adenosylmethionine synthase (20Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Irreverre F. Laster L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4382-4392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glycine N-methyltransferase (21Wagner C. Decha-Umphai W. Corbin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9638-9642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cystathionine β-synthase (22Miller J.W. Nadeau M.R. Smith J. Smith D. Selhub J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and cystathionine γ-lyase (23Stipanuk M.H. J. Nutr. 1979; 109: 2126-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the determination of betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase and cystathionine β-synthase activity, methionine and cystathionine, respectively, were measured by reverse-phase HPLC (24Jones B.N. Gillingham T.P. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 266: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Biuret method (25Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after solubilization with deoxycholate, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (26Jacobs E.E. Jacob J. Sanadi D.R. Bradley L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 147-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were demonstrated to be linear with respect to time and protein concentration. Enzyme activities are expressed as nanomoles of product per milligram of protein per minute. Hepatocytes were isolated by the method of Berry et al. (27Berry M.N. Edwards A.M. Barritt G.J. Burdon R.H. van Knippenburg P.H. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 21. Elsevier, Oxford1991: 44-57Google Scholar), and viability was assessed by 0.2% (w/v) Trypan Blue exclusion. Viability was at least 95% in all cases. Hepatocytes were preincubated for 20 min at 4–6 mg of dry weight of cells/ml (1 ml of final volume) in Krebs-Henseleit medium equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and containing 1.25% (w/v) BSA. Following preincubation, 1 mm methionine was added and cells were incubated for another 30 min. Cells were gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 at the beginning of preincubation and at the addition of methionine. At the end of the incubation, the contents of the flasks were immediately centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 2 min to sediment the cells. The supernatant was then frozen at −20 °C until analyzed. Homocysteine export was determined by subtracting a zero time point and is expressed as nanomoles of homocysteine per milligram of hepatocytes per 30 min. In a separate series of experiments, hepatocytes were incubated with 1 mml-[1-14C]methionine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO) in the presence and absence of propargylglycine and α-cyanocinnimate. Following the addition of methionine, flasks were incubated for 30 min, after which they were equipped with rubber septa with suspended plastic center wells containing NCS tissue solubilizer. Incubations were terminated by injection of 0.3 ml of 30% (w/v) perchloric acid through the septa, and 14CO2 was collected for 1 h. Radioactivity was then measured by placing the center wells in scintillation vials containing Omnifluor scintillation fluid. To collect 14CO2 from intermediate α-ketoacids, a new center well containing NCS was then added to each flask and 0.3 ml of 30% (w/v) hydrogen peroxide was injected through the septa (28Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).14CO2 was collected for 1 h and measured as described above. Methionine transport into isolated hepatocytes was measured as described by Salter et al. (29Salter M. Knowles R.G. Pogson C.I. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Following a 20-min preincubation period, [1-14C]methionine was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm (0.2 μCi). At 5, 35, 65, 95, and 125 s following the addition of methionine, 1-ml aliquots were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.25 ml of silicone oil mixture (2:1 (v/v) Dow Corning 550 silicone oil and dinonyl phthalate) layered on top of 0.1 ml of 6% (v/v) perchloric acid. The tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 s to sediment cells through the silicone oil and into the acid layer, leaving the extracellular fluid on top of the oil. Following centrifugation, the tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then the tubes were cut at the end of the silicone oil layer. The bottom layer, containing the intracellular [14C]methionine, was placed in a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of Omnifluor scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was determined by a scintillation counter. The volume of extracellular space that was carried through the silicone oil was determined by measuring radioactivity in the bottom layer following cell incubation with [carboxyl-14C]inulin. This value was used to correct rates of methionine transport. Methionine transport rates were determined by subtracting 5-s rates, representing primarily amino acid binding to membranes, from the values obtained at subsequent time points. SAM and SAH were measured in the liver using the method of Wagner 2C. Wagner, personal communication.. with minor modifications. Freeze-clamped liver was quickly added to 5 volumes of 8% cold trichloroacetic acid. Samples were homogenized with a Polytron for 10 s and were placed on ice for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was retained and analyzed by HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (model 2187P54) that was equilibrated with 96% 50 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm heptane sulfonic acid (adjusted to pH 3.2 with concentrated sulfuric acid), and 4% acetonitrile. A 15-min gradient from 4% to 20% acetonitrile was used to separate SAM and SAH. Peaks were monitored by UV detection at 258 nm and quantified using a 3390A Hewlett Packard integrator. Total RNA was isolated from rat livers by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a Hybond-Nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNAs for rat cystathionine β-synthase, cystathionine γ-lyase, and β-actin (CLONTECH) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random-labeling kit (Ambion). The probes (specific activity ∼109 cpm/μg) were allowed to hybridize to the membrane for 16 h at 42 °C in Northern Max ultrahybridization buffer (Ambion). Following high stringency washing (0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS) and radioautography, the bands were quantitated by densitometry. The cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase mRNA abundance were normalized to the amount of RNA applied, using β-actin mRNA. Intracellular hepatic amino acid concentrations were calculated using published data from our laboratory on hepatic cellular spaces (31Qian D. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 313: 479-486Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The measured hepatic concentration for an amino acid is the sum of the amino acid in the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the amino acid in the extracellular fluid (ECF). The following equation was used to determine the hepatic intracellular concentration of an amino acid (AA). Total liver AA(nmol/g)=[plasma AA(nmol/ml)×ECF(ml/g liver)+intracellular AA×ICF(ml/g liver)]Eq. 1 Intracellular water was previously found to be 0.45 ml/g liver, whereas the extracellular water was 0.25 ml/g liver. Data are presented as means ± S.D. unless otherwise noted. There were three to eight samples in each experimental group. Student’s unpaired t test was performed to compare means unless otherwise specified. A p value of <0.05 was taken to indicate a significant difference. Table I gives information on body weight, food intake, plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma glucagon. Two-day glucagon treatment did not affect weight gain in male rats. Likewise, there was no change in food intake following glucagon treatment. Therefore, none of the metabolic changes observed can be attributed to alterations in vitamin or amino acid intakes. Plasma glucose was increased by 80% (as expected) following glucagon administration. Plasma glucagon was increased 35-fold versuscontrol rats, and there was no change in plasma insulin.Table IBody weight, food intake, plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations in control and glucagon-treated ratsUnitsControlGlucagonInitial weightg240 ± 15245 ± 7Final weightg272 ± 10271 ± 7Food intakeg/day26.3 ± 4.527.5 ± 3.7Plasma glucagonpg/ml79.5 ± 12.12630 ± 10401-aSignificant difference versus control rats, p < 0.05.Plasma insulinng/ml8.9 ± 1.77.1 ± 2.6Plasma glucosemm8.0 ± 0.814.1 ± 1.31-aSignificant difference versus control rats, p < 0.05.Rats were administered glucagon (4 mg/kg/day) for 2 days while control rats received the vehicle.

Blood samples were taken from the abdominal aorta and centrifuged for plasma separation. Means ± S.D. are shown for three to six measurements. Total plasma homocysteine levels were decreased by 30% by glucagon treatment (Table II). This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the homocysteine-lowering effects of glucagon. Table II also shows the effects of the glucagon treatment on plasma and liver concentrations of the other amino acids involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism. All plasma amino acids shown were significantly decreased by glucagon treatment. Hepatic amino acid levels are also reported. Liver homocysteine and glycine levels were significantly decreased by glucagon treatment, whereas the concentration of taurine was increased. No change was observed in the hepatic levels of methionine, cysteine, and serine. However, calculation of intracellular amino acid concentrations revealed increased methionine and taurine in the glucagon-treated rat, whereas intracellular homocysteine was decreased.Table IIPlasma and hepatic amino acids involved in homocysteine metabolismControlGlucagonPlasmaLiverHepatic intracellular concentrationL:P ratioPlasmaLiverHepatic intracellular concentrationL:P ratioμmnmol/mgμmμmnmol/mgμmMethionine56.9 ± 2.956.0 ± 6.094.1 ± 10.11.714.8 ± 2.82-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.60.6 ± 6.0125 ± 132-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.8.5Homocysteine9.7 ± 1.19.0 ± 1.014.8 ± 1.71.56.4 ± 0.72-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.6.9 ± 1.02-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.11.9 ± 1.72-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.1.9Cysteine318 ± 25443 ± 110808 ± 2002.5223 ± 282-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.358 ± 158672 ± 2973.0Taurine177 ± 192850 ± 4356235 ± 95035101 ± 182-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.3600 ± 5572-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.7943 ± 12282-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.78Serine180 ± 17311 ± 51591 ± 972.985 ± 312-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.330 ± 48686 ± 1008.0Glycine239 ± 38920 ± 1411912 ± 2938.096 ± 342-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.830 ± 772-aSignificant difference versus control, p < 0.05.1804 ± 16619.0Plasma and liver amino acids were determined using a Beckman amino acid analyzer, except for total homocysteine and total cysteine, which were determined by HPLC.

Open table in a new tab Plasma and liver amino acids were determined using a Beckman amino acid analyzer, except for total homocysteine and total cysteine, which were determined by HPLC. Intracellular amino acid concentrations were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Liver:plasma (L:P) ratio is calculated by dividing the hepatic intracellular amino acid concentration (μm) by the plasma amino acid concentration (μm). Means ± S.D. for five rats are shown. The liver is the central organ in sulfur amino acid metabolism. It contains a full complement of enzymes involved in the methionine cycle and the transsulfuration pathway and is the site of 85% of all methylation reactions in the body (32Wyss M. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 134: 51-66Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In light of this, it is reasonable to assume that alterations in hepatic homocysteine metabolism would have a profound effect on circulating levels of this atherogenic amino acid. We therefore measured homocysteine output by isolated hepatocytes. Previously, our laboratory has showed that the half-maximal rate of homocysteine export occurs at a methionine concentration of 0.44 mm and is linear for at least 60 min (28Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A methionine concentration of 1 mm was chosen for all experiments. Following incubation with methionine, hepatocytes isolated from the glucagon-treated rats exported less than half as much homocysteine as the control hepatocytes (Fig.1). Our earlier studies have shown that addition of serine (a substrate for cystathionine β-synthase), together with methionine, reduced homocysteine export (28Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore undertook experiments with both serine and methionine in the incubation medium. Serine incubation decreased homocysteine export from the control hepatocytes by 50%. However, serine did not reduce, any further, the homocysteine export of hepatocytes from glucagon-treated animals. There was no change in cysteine export found in any of the experimental groups (data not shown). Such a decrease in homocysteine export by hepatocytes coupled with a decreased intracellular homocysteine concentration suggests an appreciably altered metabolism. Therefore, we assayed the major enzymes involved in producing (transmethylation) and removing (transsulfuration and remethylation) homocysteine in the liver. Glucagon-treated rats exhibited increased hepatic activities of enzymes involved in the catabolism of methionine to cysteine (TableIII). The activities of glycine N-methyltransferase and cystathionine γ-lyase activity were elevated by 25% whereas cystathionine β-synthase activity was increased by 90%. These changes are still evident when activities are expressed per gram of liver or per 100 g of body weight (data not shown). Methionine adenosyltransferase activity was unaffected by glucagon treatment. These data suggest the importance of the hepatic transsulfuration pathway in glucagon's regulation of homocysteine metabolism.

It is well known that the FPR couples to Gi proteins to activate phospholipase C, chemotaxis, and cytotoxic cell functions, but the in vivo role of the FPR in man has remained elusive. Recently, F110S and C126W mutations of the FPR have been associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. We studied FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W in comparison with wild-type FPR (FPR-WT) by coexpressing epitope-tagged versions of these receptors with the G protein Gαi2β1γ2 in Sf9 insect cells. FPRs were efficiently expressed in Sf9 membranes as assessed by immunoblotting using the β2-adrenoreceptor as a standard. FPR-C126W differed from FPR-WT and FPR-F110S in migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and tunicamycin-sensitive glycosylation. FPR-WT efficiently reconstituted high-affinity agonist binding and agonist- and inverse agonist-regulated guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) binding to Gαi2β1γ2. In contrast, FPR-F110S only weakly reconstituted agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding, and FPR-C126W was completely inefficient. Collectively, our data show almost complete and complete loss of Gi protein coupling in FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W, respectively. The severe functional defects in FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W contrast with the discrete clinical symptoms associated with these mutations, indicating that loss of FPR function in host defense is, for the most part, readily compensated.

LJP is a defined periodontal disease that begins at ∼11–15 years of age, affects the permanent incisors and/or first molars, and is associated with the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival pockets. LJP is not associated with other diseases, and there is evidence that LJP is caused by a genetic defect (12Dennison D.K. Van Dyke T.E. Periodontology 2000. 1997; 14: 54-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Wara-aswapati N. Howell T.H. Needleman H.L. Karimbux N. ASDC J. Dent.

It has been known for a long time that neutrophils from LJP patients show reduced binding of the agonist fMLP and reduced fMLP-induced chemotaxis (14Van Dyke T.E. Levine M.J. Tabak L.A. Genco R.J.

Periodontol. 1993; 64: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of 30 LJP patients revealed that 29 of those patients possess a F110S and/or C126W mutation in the FPR gene (17Gwinn M.R. Sharma A. De Nardin E. J. Periodontol. 1999; 70: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of 31 patients with adult periodontitis and none of 20 control subjects possess a F110S or C126W mutation (17Gwinn M.R. Sharma A. De Nardin E. J. Periodontol. 1999; 70: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The F110S mutation resides in the third transmembrane domain, whereas the C126W mutation resides in the second intracellular loop (Fig. 1). The second intracellular loop of the FPR is important for Gi protein coupling (18Bommakanti R.K. Dratz E.A. Siemsen D.W. Jesaitis A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and a C126S mutation uncouples the FPR from Gi proteins (19Miettinen H.M. Gripentrog J.M. Mason M.M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27934-27942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on all these findings, we developed the hypothesis that the underlying cause of LJP is defective Gi protein coupling of the FPR. To test this hypothesis, we engineered FLAG epitope-tagged FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W and analyzed coupling of these FPR mutants and FPR-WT to the G protein Gαi2β1γ2 using Sf9 insect cells as the expression system. In previous studies, we already showed that Sf9 insect cells are a very sensitive system for studying Gi protein coupling of chemoattractant receptors (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J.

Here we report that FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W show an almost complete defect and a complete defect in Gi protein coupling, respectively. The discrete clinical symptoms associated with the defective FPR indicate that the loss of FPR function in host defense is, for the most part, readily compensated. The baculovirus encoding Gαi2 was kindly provided by Dr. A. G. Gilman (Department of Pharmacology, University of Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Recombinant baculovirus encoding the unmodified versions of the G protein β1γ2 subunits was a kind gift of Dr. P. Gierschik (Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). CsH was donated by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). The generation of the baculovirus encoding FPR-WT (isoform 26) was described previously (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). fMLP, tunicamycin, and the anti-FLAG Ig (monoclonal antibody M1) were from Sigma. The anti-Gαi2Ig was from Calbiochem. [35S]GTPγS (1100 Ci/mmol), [3H]dihydroalprenolol (85–90 Ci/mmol), and [3H]fMLP (56 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled GTPγS and GDP were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A DNA sequence encoding the cleavable signal peptide from influenza hemagglutinin followed by the FLAG epitope, which can be recognized by the M1 antibody, was placed 5′ of the start codon of the cDNAs of FPR mutants. We also added a hexahistidine tag to the C terminus to allow future purification of FPR mutants and to provide additional protection against proteolysis (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). FPR mutants were generated by sequential overlap-extension PCRs. To create FPR-F110S, in PCR-1A, the N-terminal portion of the DNA sequence encoding FPR-WT was amplified using a sense primer encoding the last 18 base pairs of the FLAG epitope and an antisense primer introducing the F110S mutation (accompanied by the creation of a new BspEI site) with pGEM-3Z-SF-FPR-WT26 as template. In PCR-1B, the C-terminal portion of the DNA sequence encoding FPR-WT was amplified using a sense primer introducing the F110S mutation and an antisense primer encoding the two C-terminal amino acids of FPR-WT, a hexahistidine tag, the stop codon, and an extra XbaI site with pGEM-3Z-SF-FPR-WT26 as template. In PCR-1C, the products of PCR-1A and PCR-1B were annealed in the region coding for the newly introduced F110S mutation and were amplified with the sense primer of PCR-1A and the antisense primer of PCR-1B. The resulting fragment was digested with AvaI and BseRI and cloned into pGEM-3Z-SF-FPR-WT26 digested with AvaI and BseRI. The DNA encoding FPR-F110S was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 using the SacI site at the 5′-end of the signal FLAG region of the receptor and the XbaI site at the 3′-end of the receptor. To create FPR-C126W, in PCR-2A, the N-terminal portion of the DNA sequence encoding FPR-WT was amplified using a sense primer encoding the last 18 base pairs of the FLAG epitope and an antisense primer introducing the C126W mutation (accompanied by the creation of a new BsgI site) with pGEM-3Z-SF-FPR-WT26 as template. In PCR-2B, the C-terminal portion of the DNA sequence encoding FPR-WT was amplified using a sense primer introducing the C126W mutation and an antisense primer encoding the two C-terminal amino acids of FPR-WT, a hexahistidine tag, the stop codon, and an extra XbaI site with pGEM-3Z-SF-FPR-WT26 as template.

PCR-generated DNA sequences were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and enzymatic sequencing. Sf9 cells were cultured in 250-ml disposable Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C under rotation at 125 rpm in SF 900 II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin. Cells were maintained at a density of 1.0–6.0 × 106 cells/ml. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated in Sf9 cells using the BaculoGold transfection kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For membrane preparation, cells were sedimented by centrifugation and suspended in fresh medium at 3.0 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were infected with 1:100 dilutions of high-titer baculovirus stocks encoding GPCRs, Gαi2, and β1γ2complex. At this time, we added tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) to some cultures to inhibit N-glycosylation of GPCRs (23Grünewald S. Haase W. Reiländer H. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15149-15161Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 48 h before membrane preparation. Sf9 membranes were prepared as described (24Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin as protease inhibitors. Membranes were suspended in binding buffer (12.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 75 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) and stored at −80 °C until use. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol saturation binding to determine the expression of the β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) was carried out as described (24Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For [3H]fMLP saturation binding, Sf9 membranes were thawed, centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and suspended in binding buffer. Reaction mixtures (500 μl) contained Sf9 membranes (50–75 μg of protein/tube) in binding buffer supplemented with [3H]fMLP at 0.2–30 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled fMLP. Incubations were conducted for 60 min at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Bound [3H]fMLP was separated from free [3H]fMLP by filtration through GF/C filters, followed by three washes with 2 ml of binding buffer (4 °C). Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For GTPγS binding time course studies, Sf9 membranes were suspended in 1500 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 nm [35S]GTPγS, 9 nm unlabeled GTPγS, and 1 μm GDP in the absence and presence of fMLP (10 μm) or CsH (3 μm). Reactions were conducted at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Aliquots of 200 μl (containing 15–40 μg of protein) were withdrawn at different time points. Nonspecific [35S]GTPγS binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled GTPγS and was <0.1% of total binding. Bound [35S]GTPγS was separated from free [35S]GTPγS by filtration through GF/C filters, followed by three washes with 2 ml of binding buffer (4 °C). Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For GTPγS saturation experiments, reaction mixtures (500 μl) contained Sf9 membranes (15–30 μg of protein/tube), 0.5–2 nm [35S]GTPγS plus unlabeled GTPγS to achieve final GTPγS concentrations of 0.5–20 nm, 1 μm GDP, and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in the absence and presence of fMLP (10 μm) or CsH (3 μm). Reactions were conducted for 60 min at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. For studying the effect of NaCl on GTPγS binding, reaction mixtures (500 μl) contained Sf9 membranes (15–30 μg of protein/tube), 0.4 nm [35S]GTPγS, 1 μm GDP, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and NaCl at various concentrations in the absence and presence of fMLP (10 μm). Reactions were conducted for 60 min at 25 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Sf9 membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting using the M1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000), which recognizes the N-terminal FLAG epitope of the chemoattractant receptors (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and anti-Gαi2 Ig (1:1000) (21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The acrylamide concentration in gels was 10% (w/v). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Proteins were visualized with peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG (monoclonal antibody M1) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (anti-Gαi2 Ig), respectively, using o-dianisidine and H2O2 as substrates. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Prism III program (GraphPAD-Prism, San Diego, CA). The expression of FLAG epitope-tagged FPR-WT and FPR mutants in Sf9 membranes was examined by immunoblotting with the M1 monoclonal antibody. As a standard, we used FLAG epitope-tagged β2AR expressed at a level of 3.9 pmol/mg as assessed by antagonist saturation binding. In this way, the expression of FPR-WT and FPR mutants could be determined without relying on the [3H]fMLP binding assay. This was important for two reasons. First, the [3H]fMLP binding assay, as other agonist binding assays (25Wise A. Sheehan M. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), largely underestimates the actual GPCR expression level (21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Second, high-affinity [3H]fMLP binding depends on intact FPR/Giprotein coupling (19Miettinen H.M. Gripentrog J.M. Mason M.M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27934-27942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19757-19760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but we assumed that Giprotein coupling is defective in FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W. Fig. 2 A compares the electrophoretic mobility of FPR-WT, FPR mutants, and the β2AR and analyzes the effect of tunicamycin treatment on electrophoretic mobility. Fig. 2 B allows for direct comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of fully glycosylated FPR-WT and FPR mutants. The β2AR migrated as a doublet of 50–52 kDa, representing differently glycosylated forms of the GPCR (24Seifert R. Lee T.W. Lam V.T. Kobilka B.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As reported before (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), FPR-WT migrated as a series of broad bands of 38–45 kDa, reflecting the fact that this GPCR is more extensively glycosylated than the β2AR. Although the different shapes of the β2AR and FPR-WT bands render a precise comparison difficult, one can nonetheless estimate that FPR-WT was expressed at a level of ∼6–8 pmol/mg. To examine the glycosylation of FPR-WT in more detail, we treated Sf9 cells with an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, tunicamycin (23Grünewald S. Haase W. Reiländer H. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15149-15161Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), during the protein expression period. In membranes from tunicamycin-treated Sf9 cells, FPR-WT migrated as a single 38–39-kDa band. This size corresponds well to the predicted molecular mass of unmodified FPR-WT (27Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11123-11133Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), indicating that FPR-WT is exclusively N-glycosylated. However, the intensity of the FPR-WT band in membranes from tunicamycin-treated Sf9 cells was much lower than the band intensities in control membranes, suggesting that N-glycosylation is important for proper membrane targeting of FPR-WT. The importance of N-glycosylation for membrane targeting has been reported for other GPCRs (28Benya R.V. Kusui T. Katsuno T. Tsuda T. Mantey S.A. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1490-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Boer U. Neuschafer-Rube F. Moller U. Puschel G.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In terms of expression level, apparent molecular mass, glycosylation pattern, and tunicamycin sensitivity of glycosylation, FPR-F110S was indistinguishable from FPR-WT. The data also indicate that membrane targeting of FPR-WT and FPR-F110S is similar. Moreover, there was no evidence for structural instability of FPR-F110S since such a property would have resulted in decreased expression levels relative to FPR-WT (30Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The expression level of FPR-C126W seemed to be in a range similar to that of the expression levels of FPR-WT and FPR-F110S, but it was difficult to quantify FPR-C126W expression precisely because the migration of FPR-C126W on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was very different from the migration of FPR-WT and FPR-F110S. Specifically, in addition to the multiple 38–45-kDa bands that were observed for FPR-WT and FPR-F110S, we also observed multiple bands in the 28–32-kDa region and, less prominently, in the 45–100-kDa region. Although the majority of FPR-C126W migrated as 28–32-kDa proteins, i.e. well below the expected molecular mass of non-glycosylated FPR-WT (38–39 kDa), this discrepancy does not automatically imply that FPR-C126W represents an aggregated GPCR. Abnormal migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was also observed for wild-type GPCRs (23Grünewald S. Haase W. Reiländer H. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15149-15161Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The 38–45-kDa bands in Sf9 membranes expressing FPR-C126W were less intense than the corresponding bands in membranes expressing FPR-WT and FPR-F110S. In membranes from tunicamycin-treated Sf9 cells, the size of the 28–32-kDa proteins decreased somewhat; but overall, tunicamycin had little effect on the migration of FPR-C126W. In contrast to the data obtained with FPR-WT and FPR-F110S, tunicamycin did not have an inhibitory effect on the expression of FPR-C126W. Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that the C126W mutation has a profound impact on electrophoretic mobility and glycosylation of the FPR, whereas the F110S mutation is without effect. As already stated above, high-affinity [3H]fMLP binding to FPR depends on the expression of Gi proteins (19Miettinen H.M. Gripentrog J.M. Mason M.M. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19757-19760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies on various GPCRs including the FPR, we already showed that Gαi2 is expressed at high levels (∼200–450 pmol/mg) in Sf9 membranes (21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Recept.

Using Sf9 membranes expressing Gαi2at ∼300 pmol/mg and FPR-WT as a standard, we confirmed that Gαi2 was expressed at similar levels in membranes expressing FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W (Fig. 2 C). Thus, we can estimate that there is an ∼40–50-fold excess of FPR-WT and FPR mutants relative to Gαi2 in Sf9 membranes. This ratio should provide excellent conditions for detecting GPCR/G protein coupling in terms of high-affinity agonist binding and GDP/GTP exchange (22Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Recept. Channels. 2001; 7: 357-369PubMed Google Scholar). As reported before (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in membranes expressing FPR-WT, we readily detected high-affinity [3H]fMLP binding. FPR-WT bound [3H]fMLP with a Kd of 3.2 ± 1.0 nm and a Bmax of 0.90 ± 0.10 pmol/mg (Fig. 3 A). The Kd for high-affinity [3H]fMLP binding to FPR-WT in Sf9 membranes agrees with the Kdvalues obtained for the FPR expressed in native systems (32Wenzel-Seifert K. Seifert R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4591-4599PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jacobs A.A. Huber J.L. Ward R.A. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that nonspecific [3H]fMLP binding in Sf9 membranes expressing FPR-WT was <10% of total [3H]fMLP binding, ensuring high sensitivity for detecting high-affinity agonist binding. However, despite the sensitivity of Sf9 membranes for analyzing high-affinity [3H]fMLP binding (Fig. 3 A) and despite the fact that FPR-F110S, FPR-C126W, and Gαi2 were efficiently expressed (Fig. 2), we failed to detect high-affinity agonist binding with the two FPR mutants (Fig. 3, B and C). The results of the [3H]fMLP binding studies strongly suggest that Gi protein coupling is defective in FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W. However, these studies cannot rule out the possibility that fMLP binds to the FPR mutants with low affinity and that this low-affinity fMLP binding induces a conformational change in GPCRs that enables them to promote GDP/GTP exchange. Indeed, even for FPR-WT, low-affinity fMLP binding to the FPR results in efficient stimulation of GDP/GTP exchange (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additionally, FPR-WT is constitutively active, i.e. even agonist-free FPR-WT efficiently stimulates GDP/GTP exchange at Gi proteins. This constitutive activity of FPR-WT is unmasked by strong inhibitory effects of the inverse agonist CsH on basal GDP/GTP exchange (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol.

To address the possible activation of FPR mutants by low-affinity fMLP binding and to determine the constitutive activity of FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W, we analyzed GDP/GTPγS exchange. In addition to its hydrolysis resistance, GTPγS possesses an ∼100-fold higher affinity for Gi proteins than does GTP (21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These properties render [35S]GTPγS a suitable probe for analyzing guanine nucleotide exchange in a binding assay. We used fMLP at 10 μm, i.e. a concentration that is sufficient to saturate both high- and low-affinity binding to the FPR (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Over the entire time period of 5–180 min, fMLP stimulated GTPγS binding to Gαi2β1γ2 in membranes expressing FPR-WT, whereas CsH reduced GTPγS binding (Fig. 4 A). The stimulatory effects of fMLP were particularly large at earlier time points of the binding reaction (up to 150% stimulation above basal levels), whereas the inhibitory effects of CsH were particularly large at later time points of the binding reaction. fMLP decreased the t12 of GTPγS binding by ∼3-fold from 16.1 ± 3.4 to 5.6 ± 0.8 min, whereas CsH increased the t12 to 36.1 ± 7.2 min. In membranes expressing FPR-F110S, fMLP increased the t12 of GTPγS binding by ∼1.5-fold from 22.9 ± 3.0 to 14.7 ± 2.6 min, with the stimulatory effect of fMLP amounting to ∼10–20% (Fig. 4 B). CsH was without inhibitory effect on GTPγS binding in membranes expressing FPR-F110S, indicating that this FPR mutant, in contrast to FPR-WT, is not constitutively active. Although with FPR-F110S minimal fMLP-stimulated GDP/GTPγS exchange at Gαi2β1γ2 could be detected (Fig. 4 B), we failed to detect agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding with FPR-C126W (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, CsH had no inhibitory effect on GTPγS binding to Gαi2β1γ2 with FPR-C126W. Taken together, these data indicate that FPR-F110S exhibits an almost complete Gi protein coupling defect and that FPR-C126W exhibits a complete defect. In an effort to enhance the relative stimulatory effects of fMLP on GTPγS binding in membranes expressing FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W, we studied the effect of NaCl on GTPγS binding. Na+stabilizes the FPR and other chemoattractant receptors in an inactive state. As a result, Na+ reduces basal GTPγS binding and substantially enhances the relative stimulatory effect of chemoattractants (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Recept. Channels. 2001; 7: 357-369PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gierschik P. Moghtader R. Straub C. Dieterich K. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In membranes expressing FPR-WT, NaCl strongly reduced basal GTPγS binding and enhanced the relative stimulatory effect of fMLP from ∼1.5-fold in the absence of NaCl up to almost 6-fold with 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, even at concentrations as high as 200 mm, NaCl had almost no inhibitory effect on basal GTPγS binding and no enhancing effect on GTPγS binding in the presence of fMLP in membranes expressing FPR-F110S (Fig. 5, C and D) or FPR-C126W (E and F). These data corroborate the notion that FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W exhibit defective Gi protein coupling and are not constitutively active. To allow comparison with previous studies from our laboratory (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Recept. Channels. 2001; 7: 357-369PubMed Google Scholar), we conducted the time course studies of GTPγS binding with a high GTPγS concentration (10 nm), whereas the experiments investigating the effects of NaCl were conducted with a subsaturating concentration of GTPγS (0.4 nm) (see “Experimental Procedures”). When comparing the GTPγS binding values in the absence of NaCl in the two types of experiments, we noticed that the maximum values with fMLP in the time course experiments were similar for all three FPRs (Fig. 4); but in the NaCl experiments, the maximum GTPγS binding values for FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W were much lower than those for FPR-WT (Fig. 5). Considering that the expression levels of Gαi2 were similar for all three FPRs (Fig. 2 C), these findings suggested the hypothesis that Gαi2 exhibits a higher GTPγS affinity in membranes expressing FPR-WT than in membranes expressing FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W. To address this hypothesis, we conducted GTPγS saturation binding studies. fMLP stimulated GTPγS binding to Gαi2β1γ2 in membranes expressing FPR-WT with a Kd of 0.9 ± 0.3 nm (Fig. 6 A), whereas the Kd for fMLP-stimulated GTPγS binding to Gαi2β1γ2 in membranes expressing FPR-F110S was 3.5 ± 0.5 nm. These data indicate that agonist-occupied FPR-WT stabilizes a conformation in Gαi2β1γ2 that confers an ∼4-fold higher GTPγS affinity for the G protein than the Gαi2β1γ2 conformation stabilized by fMLP-occupied FPR-F110S. GPCR-specific regulation of the GTPγS affinity of Gαi2 was reported before for the β2AR and several wild-type chemoattractant receptors (20Wenzel-Seifert K. Hurt C.M. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24181-24189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol.

Thus, our data indicate that the higher GTPγS affinity of Gαi2β1γ2 in membranes expressing FPR-WT relative to membranes expressing FPR-F110S and FPR-C126W accounts for the higher fMLP-stimulated GTPγS binding values in the former system when a subsaturating GTPγS concentration is used (Fig. 5, A–C). The GTPγS saturation binding studies also allowed us to answer the question of how many Gi proteins a single FPR molecule activates. Recent studies (21Wenzel-Seifert K. Arthur J.M. Liu H.Y. Seifert R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Recept. Channels. 2001; 7: 357-369PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that chemoattractant receptors, in contrast to the previously held view (33Jacobs A.A. Huber J.L. Ward R.A. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1995; 57: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Gierschik P. Moghtader R. Straub C. Dieterich K. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), do not activate Gi proteins catalytically, but rather linearly. The Bmax for ligand-regulated GTPγS binding,i.e. the difference between minimum CsH-inhibited and maximum fMLP-stimulated GTPγS binding, with FPR-WT was 6.3 pmol/mg (Fig. 6 A). Relating this number to the expression level of FPR-WT (∼6–8 pmol/mg) (Fig. 2 A), one can estimate that one FPR-WT molecule activates approximately one Gαi2β1γ2 molecule. The Bmax for ligand-regulated GTPγS binding with FPR-F110S was only 0.7 pmol/mg (Fig. 6 B). Given the fact that FPR-WT and FPR-F110S are expressed at about the same level (Fig. 2, A and B), the GTPγS saturation binding data show that FPR-F110S couples to Gi proteins with an efficiency that amounts to only ∼10% of that of FPR-WT. The lack of inhibitory effect of CsH in the GTPγS saturation binding studies with membranes expressing FPR-F110S (Fig. 6 B) confirms the conclusion that FPR-F110S is not constitutively active. Our data show that the F110S mutation in the third transmembrane domain of the FPR and the C126W mutation in the second intracellular loop of the FPR (Fig. 1) result in an almost complete defect and a complete defect in Gi protein coupling, respectively. The defect in Gi protein coupling of these FPR mutants is associated with a loss of constitutive activity. It is conceivable that the exchange of a hydrophobic phenylalanine against a hydrophilic serine in a transmembrane domain involved in fMLP binding (35Miettinen H.M. Mills J.S. Gripentrog J.M. Dratz E.A. Granger B.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4045-4054PubMed Google Scholar) interferes with proper helix formation and thereby reduces agonist affinity of the FPR. Nonetheless, FPR-F110S still binds fMLP with low affinity, inducing a conformational change in the GPCR that allows the FPR mutant to catalyze GDP/GTP exchange (Figs. 4 and 6). However, the fMLP-induced conformational change in FPR-F110S must be different from the fMLP-induced conformational change in FPR-WT because fMLP-occupied FPR-F110S is much less efficient than agonist-occupied FPR-WT in activating Gi proteins in terms of GTPγS affinity of Gαi2 and the total number of Gαi2 molecules activated (Fig. 6)."

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a recently identified cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin, has an important role in transmembrane signal transduction via integrins. We report that ILK is expressed in N1E-115 cells, the expression levels of which are constant under both normal and differentiating conditions.

On the other hand, a transient expression of wild type ILK stimulated neurite outgrowth. The ILK activity in the parental cells was transiently activated after seeding on the laminin matrix, whereas that in the DN-ILK-transfected cells was not. These results suggest that transient activation of ILK is required for neurite outgrowth in serum-starved N1E-115 cells on laminin. Under the same conditions, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, but neither MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) nor extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), was transiently activated after N1E-115 cell attachment to laminin, but not in the DN-ILK-expressed cells. The time course of p38 MAP kinase activation was very similar to that of ILK activation. Furthermore, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, significantly blocked neurite outgrowth.

Such interactions are important in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Clustering of integrins on the cell surface in contact with the ECM induces focal adhesion that recruits numerous mitogenic signaling proteins, such as growth factor receptors (2Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (3Miyamoto S. Teramoto H.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) to integrin receptors. Thus, integrin-associated focal adhesions serve as signaling centers where adhesive and mitogenic pathways can integrate. Numerous physical interactions between integrins or focal adhesion components and mitogenic signaling proteins have been demonstrated (5Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies indicate a biochemical coupling between integrin and growth factor signaling pathways; however, the functional significance of these interactions in the context of the regulation of proliferation and differentiation is not well understood. The intracellular signaling cascades that are activated when integrins bind to their ECM ligands are varied in many different cell types (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). The specific intracellular pathways differ depending on the specific integrin/ECM ligand interaction and/or on the specific integrin/intracellular signal proteins coupling in different cell types. In neuronal cells, neurite formation in response to differentiation signals is strongly promoted by ECM ligands such as laminin, fibronectin, or collagen (6Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Dev.

On the other hand, neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, which are induced to differentiate into sympathetic neuron-like cells by growth factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF), is also affected by cell adhesion to ECM (11Rossino P.

The mechanisms by which the ECM regulates neuronal differentiation, however, are currently poorly understood. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a cytoplasmic protein serine/threonine kinase that interacts with β1 integrin (13Hannigan G.H. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J.

The present study investigated the roles and potential mechanisms of ILK in the control of neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells.

For detection of the immunoprecipitated ILK and DN-ILK proteins, the precipitated proteins were released from the immunobeads by boiling in 80 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Equal volumes of the samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Total ILK and DN-ILK proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ILK antibody (UB 06-550) that recognizes both ILK and DN-ILK proteins. A cDNA library was constructed in Uni-ZAP XR using cDNA synthesis kits (nos. 200400–200402, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from the whole brain of an adult guinea pig was converted to cDNA by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription. The obtained cDNAs were ligated between EcoRI and XhoI sites of Uni-ZAP XR as described by the manufacturer. This cDNA library was screened with 32P-labeled antisense oligonucleotides, 3′-ATACGTGGACGGACCCAT-5′ and 3′-GGACTTCTGTGTTTGTCT-5′, both of which were designed to bind to the encoding sequences for the amino acids sequences, 351YAPAWV356 and365PEDTNR370, respectively, within the catalytic domain of human ILK (13Hannigan G.H.

One positive clone containing a 1.8-kilobase pair insert, which binds both oligonucleotide probes, was isolated from 2 × 105 plaques. After excision of the pBluescript phagemid vector from the Uni-ZAP XR, the cDNA insert was cloned into the pBluescript SK plasmid as described by the manufacturer and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of guinea pig ILK has been submitted to the GenBank™ data base with accession numberAF256520. The encoded protein has a 98.9% amino acid homology with the human ILK. The kinase-deficient ILK (DN-ILK) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Glu to Lys) at amino acid residue 359 within the kinase domain using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as follows. A 1153-kilobase pair cDNA containing the 5′-untranslated sequence and the coding region for Met1–Glu366 of guinea pig ILK, in which Glu359 was mutated to Lys, was synthesized using PCR with two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-TGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGAT-3′ (pBluescript vector primer, the NotI site is underlined) and 5′-TTCAGGTTTCTTCTGCAAAGCTT(T)AGGGGCTA-3′ (a uniqueHindIII site of ILK cDNA is underlined, and a single mutation site (C to T) is shown in parentheses), and ILK cDNA in pBluescript vector as a template. The PCR fragment was digested withNotI/HindIII restriction enzymes, and was then placed back into a full-length ILK cDNA in a pBluescript vector. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR fragment was determined using a standard DNA sequencing technique (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Wild type ILK and DN ILK cDNAs were ligated into the polylinkers in a mammalian expression vector, pTracerTM-CMV2 (V885-01, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and were introduced into N1E-115 cells. DN-ILK cDNA was transfected into N1E-115 cells (5 × 105cells/100-mm culture dish) using the calcium/phosphate precipitation method as described by Graham and van der Eb (19Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar), and 48 individual zeocin-resistant cell lines were isolated over the next 4–5 weeks. Among them, three different cell lines were selected on the basis of detection of the GFP fluorescence and confirmation of gene transcription using reverse transcriptase-PCR. The cloned cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT) and zeocin (0.5 mg/ml). N1E-115 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/dish onto 35-mm noncoated culture dishes and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. At 20 h following plating, cells were transfected with the plasmid containing the wild type ILK cDNA using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Control cells were transfected with the empty plasmid. Briefly, cells were washed in serum-free medium and incubated in serum-free medium for 1 h. During this time, the plasmid DNAs were mixed with the LipofectAMINE reagent and incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then added to the cells. Ten percent FBS was added to the cells 6 h after addition of the transfection mix. At 18 and 36 h following the transfection, the morphological changes produced by the transfection of the plasmid of interest were examined using fluorescence microscopy. Cells that had positively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) were assumed to be expressing the protein of interest cDNA. Cells that have a process longer than 2-fold the length of a cell body were categorized as being neurite-bearing cells, and neurite-bearing cell was assessed as the percentage of the total number of GFP-expressing cells. Cells were solubilized in five volumes of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The solubilized materials were subjected to SDS-PAGE (5–20% gradient, 6.5 or 10% polyacrylamide) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 192 mmglycine, 20% methanol, and 0.025% SDS. After blocking, the blots were probed with anti-ILK polyclonal antibody (UB 06-550) for the detection of endogenous ILK in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The final protein-IgG complexes were visualized following the reaction to 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. For detection of the phosphorylation status of p38 MAP kinase and MEK, polyclonal antibodies reactive with the phosphorylated form of p38 MAP kinase and MEK were purchased from New England Biolabs. For detection of the phosphorylation status of p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2), polyclonal antibodies reactive with the phosphorylated form of p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2) were purchased from Promega. Preparation of cell lysate and protein blotting for detection of these phosphorylated MAP kinases were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). We observed neurite outgrowth of cells grown on laminin-coated plates under serum-free conditions. In this condition, cells became flattened and then gradually extended neurites within 8 h, and ∼88% of the cells possessed neurites after 16 h (Fig. 1 B; see also Fig. 3). The number of neurite-bearing cells grown on noncoated plates, however, was quite low (8.6 ± 3.0% at 8 h and 18.3 ± 5.2% at 16 h). Sarner et al. (10Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) found that pre-treatment of N1E-115 cells with β1 integrin antibody blocks adhesion and neurite outgrowth of the cells plated on laminin-coated glass slide in serum-free condition, suggesting that β1 integrin is involved in both adhesion and neuritogenesis of N1E-115 cells grown on a laminin matrix. We also examined the effect of β1 integrin antibody on neurite outgrowth in serum-starved N1E-115 cells grown on the laminin-coated plastic plate. Cells were briefly pretreated for 7 min with varying concentrations of an antibody directed against β1integrin and then seeded on laminin-coated plates under serum-free conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, higher concentrations of antibody significantly blocked adhesion. On the other hand, lower concentrations of antibody (0.3 and 1.0 μg/ml) did not affect cell adhesion but significantly inhibited neurite outgrowth 8 and 16 h after antibody-treatment. Our observations are similar to those of Sarneret al. (10Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, β1 integrin is involved in both adhesion and neuritogenesis of N1E-115 cells grown on a laminin matrix under serum-free conditions.Figure 3Time course of neurite outgrowth in parental and DN-ILK-transfected N1E-115 cells after seeding on laminin-coated plates in the presence and absence of serum.

Parental (a–c) and DN-ILK-transfected (d-f) cells were seeded on laminin-coated plates and cultured in the presence of 20% FBS (a and d) and in the absence of FBS (b, c, e, and f).

ILK has important roles in integrin- and growth factor-mediated signal transduction in several different cells, leading to regulation of cell adhesion, growth, migration, survival, proliferation, and differentiation (13Hannigan G.H.

Because β1 integrin is involved in both adhesion and neuritogenesis of N1E-115 cells grown on the laminin matrix (Fig. 1), we further examined whether ILK is expressed in the cells. We found that ILK is highly expressed in N1E-115 cells and also that the expression level of ILK did not change during neuronal differentiation (Fig.2). We first examined whether endogenous ILK is involved in integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth. To inactivate the endogenous ILK, cells were stably transfected with a kinase-deficient mutant of ILK (DN-ILK) that behaves as a dominant negative (17Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Based on the results obtained from immunoblotting (Fig. 4, inset), the expression level of DN-ILK protein in DN-ILK-transfected cells could be estimated to be at least twice more than that of endogenous ILK protein. As shown in Figs. 3 and4, neurite outgrowth of the DN-ILK-transfected cells was significantly inhibited compared with that of untransfected parental cells 8 and 16 h after seeding on the laminin matrix under serum-free conditions. This result suggests that the kinase activity of endogenous ILK is critical for neurite outgrowth in serum-starved N1E-115 cells grown on a laminin matrix. We also examined the effect of transient expression of the wild type ILK on neurite outgrowth of the cells. Overexpression of the wild type ILK stimulated neurite outgrowth in the cells even grown on noncoated plates (Fig. 5). We next examined whether ILK is activated after seeding on a laminin matrix under serum-free conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, the ILK activity in the parental cells was transiently activated after seeding on the laminin matrix, whereas that in the DN-ILK-transfected cells did not change after cell attachment to the laminin. Maximal stimulation of ILK activity in the parental cells occurred 60 min after plating, and then rapidly disappeared. Moreover, ILK activation was prevented by treatment of the cells with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ILK activation following cell attachment to the laminin under serum-free conditions is PI 3-kinase-dependent. These results suggest that transient activation of ILK activity after cell attachment to a laminin matrix is required for neurite outgrowth in serum-starved N1E-115 cells.Figure 5Effect of transient expression of wild type ILK on neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells grown on the noncoated plate. N1E-115 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104/dish onto 35-mm noncoated culture dishes and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. At 20 h following plating, cells were transfected with the plasmid containing the wild type ILK cDNA (Wild-type ILK) using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control cells were transfected with the empty plasmid (Vector). At 18 and 36 h following the transfection, the morphological changes produced by the transfection of the plasmid were examined using fluorescence microscopy. At least 100 randomly selected GFP-positive cells were assessed, and the cells that have a process longer than 2-fold the length of a cell body were categorized as being neurite bearing cells. The neurite bearing cell was assessed as the percentage of the total number of GFP-expressing cells. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.

ILK activity was determined using myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (top). To examine the involvement of PI 3-kinase in the stimulation of ILK activity, cells were treated with 40 μm LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, for 1 h by direct addition to the culture medium. Total ILK and DN-ILK proteins in the immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ILK antibody that recognizes both ILK and DN-ILK proteins, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells (25Cowley S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Unlike the NGF-induced neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells, however, activation of MEK and/or ERK was not detected in the integrin-dependent neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 cells (Fig. 7, A andB). We next examined the possible involvement of another member of the MAP kinase family, p38 MAP kinase, in the signaling pathway of integrin-dependent neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 cells. As shown in Fig. 7 (A and C), the p38 MAP kinase in the parental control cells was transiently activated after seeding on the laminin matrix under serum-free conditions. The activation of p38 MAP kinase in the parental cells reached a maximum level within 60 min and then declined rapidly. Weak activation was still detected 90 min after plating. Thus, the time course of the activation of p38 MAP kinase was very similar to that of the ILK. In contrast, activation of p38 MAP kinase in the DN-ILK-transfected cells was not detected (Fig. 7, A and C). Thus, endogenous ILK is somehow involved in the activation of p38 MAPK. These results suggest that the ILK activation after cell attachment to laminin is necessary for the activation of p38 MAP kinase in serum-starved N1E-115 cells. To evaluate the specific role of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway in integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth of N1E-115 cells, the cells were treated for 3 h with varying concentrations of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38MAP kinase (27Cuenda A.

SB203580 was applied after seeding the cells on laminin-coated plates under serum-free conditions. Treatment was terminated by changing the medium. As shown in Fig. 8, treatment of the cells with SB203580 markedly, but not completely, inhibited integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal inhibition obtained at 10 μm.

On the other hand, the same treatment of DN-ILK-transfected cells with SB203580 did not affect neurite outgrowth (Fig. 9), suggesting that p38 MAP kinase is not involved in ILK-independent neurite outgrowth.

Ca2+ cycling between the cytoplasm and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)1 is tightly linked to the contraction-relaxation cycle of myocytes. Contraction occurs upon release of Ca2+ from the SR into the cytosol, whereas relaxation is mediated by the rapid removal of cytosolic Ca2+, which is predominantly re-sequestered into the SR by the Ca2+ pumps of the SERCA gene family. In higher vertebrates, SERCA Ca2+-pump isoforms are encoded by three genes, recently designated ATP2A1-3 (reviewed in Refs. 1Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Further isoform diversity at the protein level is created by alternative processing of the primary gene transcripts at a conserved 3′-terminal site. Alternative processing is regulated in a developmental or tissue-specific manner. SERCA1 is expressed specifically in adult (SERCA1a) or neo-natal (SERCA1b) fast-twitch skeletal muscle. SERCA2a is expressed in the heart and in slow-twitch muscle, whereas SERCA2b is the main isoform expressed in smooth muscle and in all non-muscle tissues examined. SERCA3 isoforms are expressed in various non-muscle cells. Various pathologies have been linked to defects in SERCA-encoding genes. Mutations in ATP2A1, encoding SERCA1, cause an autosomal recessive form of Brody disease (3Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Khanna V.K. Busch H.F. Karpati G. Jablecki C.K. Breuning M.H. MacLennan D.H. Nat.

These studies carry the prospect that modulation of SERCA2a or PLB activity can correct cardiac dysfunction in heart failure. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model organism amenable to genetic and pharmacological analysis. Here we report characterization of the unique C. elegans SERCA homologue. The two protein isoforms, CeSERCAa and CeSERCAb, show differential functional characteristics and expression patterns. Down-regulation of CeSERCA results in defects in various muscle and myoepithelial tissues, demonstrating an indispensable role for CeSERCA in behavior, growth, and reproduction. Standard molecular biological techniques were used to construct plasmids. A NotI-KpnI restriction fragment (3.2 kb) containing the entire coding sequence of CeSERCAb (Kohara clone yk75f8) was blunt-ended and ligated into the blunt-ended BamHI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The CeSERCAa expression vector was constructed by replacing the CeSERCAb-specific tail for a PCR-amplified CeSERCAa-specific tail by ApaI-BstXI swapping. Transient DNA transfections were carried out in COS-1 cells with FuGENETM6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Enouf J. Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1410-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stained 60 h after transfection. Primary anti-SERCA antisera were used at 1:100 and 1:1000 dilutions. Stained samples were treated with ProLongTM anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes Inc.) to retard photobleaching. Western blotting was performed as reported previously (15Wuytack F. Papp B. Verboomen H. Raeymaekers L. Dode L. Bobe R. Enouf J. Bokkala S. Authi K.S. Casteels R. J. Biol.

Oxalate-stimulated ATP-dependent45Ca2+ uptake in microsomal fractions was measured at 27 °C by a Millipore filtration method as described earlier (16Dode L. De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M.

(17Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions were incubated in phosphorylation buffer containing 1 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm EGTA + 0.9 mm Ca2+-EGTA. The reaction was stopped after 20 s. Signal intensities were quantified by means of a PhosphorImager (STORM 840, Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). C. elegans strains were maintained according to Brenner (18Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and grown at 20 °C.sca-1(ok190) was back-crossed seven times against the wild-type strain N2 and unc-49(e382) using PCR to follow the lethal mutation. A genomic sca-1 subclone, pGK1, was generated by inserting a 14-kb SpeI fragment from the cosmid K11D9 into pUC18. A 3.3-kb MluI-SmaI fragment was removed to yield pGK7. This clone contains 5.6 kb of sequence upstream of the translational start codon and 1.1 kb of sequence downstream of the translational stop codon of CeSERCAa. Germ-line transformation rescue of the sca-1(ok190) null mutant was performed by injecting pGK7 at 10 and 20 ng/μl along with pRF4 (rol-6 D marker) and the pGK10 (Psca-1::GFP) construct described below. A total of 10 lines were established that all rescued sca-1(ok190). Isoform-specific constructs (pDW2651 and pDW2652) were made by inserting the pGK10 promoter fragment and the cDNAs amplified from the mammalian expression vectors into pPD49.26. 2A. Fire, J. Ahnn, G. Seydoux, and S. Xu, personal communication. These constructs were injected at 20 ng/μl. From each construct 5 lines were obtained that, all but one, rescued ok190. To construct Psca-1::GFP (pGK10), a 5.0-kb fragment of the sca-1 upstream sequence ending at the translational start site was amplified from pGK7 and cloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of pPD95.75.2 For CeSERCAa::GFP (pGK26) and CeSERCAb::GFP (pGK27), standard overlap extension PCR was performed to obtain products consisting of three subfragments: the C terminus of the proper isoform, GFP, and the 3′-untranslated region of that isoform. These were swapped into pGK7 using ApaI-PacI for CeSERCAa and ApaI-SalI for CeSERCAb, respectively. Constructs were injected at 20 ng/μl. For each construct at least three lines were obtained. The 727-base pair EcoRI-HindIII fragment from exon 5 was cloned into pGEM3 to yield pGK6. RNA was transcribed in vitro from linearized pGK6 using the MEGAscript™ SP6 and T7 kits (Ambion), mixed, and dissolved in injection buffer (66 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm potassium citrate (pH 7.5), 6.6% polyethylene glycol 3550). Double-stranded RNA was injected into gravid adults, which were transferred to fresh plates 3 h after injection to remove embryos resulting from eggs fertilized before the injection. Injections were done at three different times, and each time at least 10 animals were injected. The mutation F259V was introduced into pGK7 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) with Pfu DNA polymerase and primers oGK33 (CAACAGAAGTTGGACGAAGTCGGAGAGCAACTTTC) and oGK34 (GAAAGTTGCTCTCCGACTTCGTCCAACTTCTGTTG). The resulting plasmid (pGK28) was able to rescue sca-1(ok190) (data not shown). pGK28 was injected at 20 ng/μl in N2 together with 20 ng/μl pGK10 and 160 ng/μl pUC18. Three strains were obtained: UG528, UG529, and UG530. UG528 and UG530 showed comparable resistance to thapsigargin; UG529 was somewhat less resistant. 12-Well plates with standard NGM agar (2 ml) were seeded with a thin lawn of cold-sensitive OP50-derived bacteria that were completely covered with a 10-μl drop of thapsigargin (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) dissolved in Me2SO 1 day before the test. The thapsigargin concentrations mentioned in the text assume complete diffusion of thapsigargin in the plate. To follow the growth of wild-type and thapsigargin-resistant animals, thapsigargin plates were seeded with ∼50 L1 larvae obtained after bleaching and hatching in M9, 4 wells/strain/concentration. The stage of each animal was determined after 3 days of growth at 20 °C. As a way of quantifying growth, each stage was assigned an arbitrary value (1 for adult, 0.5 for L4, 0.25 for L3, and 0.125 for L2). The “relative growth score” reflects the average stage all animals reached. When all animals become adult, the resulting score is 1.0. When half of the animals reach the L3 and half reach the L4 stage of the resulting score becomes 0.375. The C. elegans genome contains only one gene encoding a SERCA homologue. This gene was originally identified by the C. elegans sequencing consortium (1919. The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, Science, 282, 1998, 2012, 2018.Google Scholar) and annotated K11D9.2. In this paper, we will refer to the gene as sca-1 and to the corresponding protein as CeSERCA. CeSERCA shows about 70% amino acid identity and 80% similarity to the three human SERCA proteins. The phosphorylation domains of CeSERCA and human SERCA2 share 81% amino acid identity, the ATP binding domains share 59% amino acid identity, and the anchor domain shares 67% amino acid identity. The predicted amino acid sequence of CeSERCA possesses all residues defined as essential for phosphorylation (Asp-351), ATP binding (such as Phe-487, Lys-515, and Lys-492) and Ca2+ binding/translocation in membrane-spanning segments 4, 5, 6, and 8 (for review see e.g. Ref. 20MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). C. elegans SERCA does not contain the putative cytosolic interaction site for phospholamban, which is found both in vertebrate SERCA1 and SERCA2 but is lacking in vertebrate SERCA3 and in other invertebrate SERCAs (21Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22929-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted in this respect that no gene encoding PLB or a PLB-like protein could be found in C. elegans nor has such a gene been reported in any other invertebrate. The sca-1 gene consists of eight exons and seven introns (Fig. 1 A). The positions of four of these introns in the nematode gene are conserved in all three vertebrate SERCA genes; the worm introns 3, 4, 5, and 6 correspond to the vertebrate SERCA introns 1, 5, 16, and 19, respectively. The transcripts of the sca-1 gene, like those of the three vertebrate SERCA genes, can be alternatively spliced, whereby the position of the alternative intron is conserved as well. Alternative splicing of the sca-1 transcript follows a similar mode as that of vertebrate SERCA2, which differs from that of SERCA1 or SERCA3. In sca-1, exon seven contains an optional internal 5′ splice donor site, which can be spliced to the 3′ splice acceptor site, marking the beginning of exon eight (Fig.1 A). Such a splicing results in the formation of the short isoform (1004 amino acids), which we name CeSERCAa following the nomenclature in the SERCA field. The absence of this splicing leads to expression of the CeSERCAb variant (1059 amino acids). As in vertebrate SERCA2b, the CeSERCAb-specific tail comprises a hydrophobic stretch (1006-SAISLLAWVSVTLAYFAWMLG-1026) with the propensity to form an additional transmembrane domain. Four lines of evidence indicate that both predicted CeSERCA proteins are indeed expressed in C. elegans. First, multiple cDNA clones of both isoforms are present in the Kohara cDNA collection (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/htmls/c-elegans/html/CE_INDEX.html). Second, both transcripts were detected using reverse transcription-PCR on whole worm mRNA. Third, both proteins were detected by Western blotting on fragmented membranes prepared from whole worms (Fig. 2). Fourth, GFP reporter constructs specific for each of the splice variants were expressed in vivo (see Fig. 7).Figure 2Expression of CeSERCA isoforms. Both CeSERCA isoforms are recognized by Western blot of C. elegans membrane preparations using primary antisera against CeSERCAa (α-a), CeSERCAb (α-b), or a conserved sequence of rabbit SERCA1 (809-27).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Expression pattern of sca-1.

Immunocytochemical staining with isoform-specific polyclonal antisera or with a polyclonal pan-specific SERCA antiserum revealed that both CeSERCA proteins were expressed at high levels and were properly targeted to the ER compartment (Fig. 3 A). Western blots of microsomes prepared from these cells showed immunoreactive bands with an electrophoretic mobility of around 100 kDa, with CeSERCAb showing a slightly higher apparent molecular mass than CeSERCAa (Fig.3 B). From these blots it can also be concluded that in the COS cells the CeSERCAs were expressed at levels at least 10-fold higher than the endogenous SERCA2b. Microsomal vesicles were isolated from the transfected COS cells to measure the time course of oxalate-stimulated Ca2+ uptake. Ca2+ transport into the vesicles was strictly dependent on the presence of ATP. The apparent affinity for Ca2+(Km) of CeSERCAa was found to be 2-fold lower than that of CeSERCAb (Km = 0.80 versus0.40 μm; Fig.4 A). This difference is similar to that seen for vertebrate SERCA2a and SERCA2b (17Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, both the mode of splicing and its structural and functional consequences at the protein level appear to be evolutionarily conserved. As other P-type ATPases (reviewed in Ref. 20MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), CeSERCA formed a phosphoprotein intermediate (Fig. 4 B). Phosphorylation depended on the presence of Ca2+ and was much more pronounced in microsomes from CeSERCA-expressing COS cells than in microsomes from untransfected controls, in concurrence with the strong overexpression of the CeSERCA isoforms in the COS cells. A deletion allele of the sca-1 gene was isolated using a PCR-based sib-selection protocol (kindly provided by the C. elegans knockout consortium). Subsequent sequence analysis revealed that this allele, designated ok190, lacked 12 base pairs of intron 4 and 1690 base pairs of exon 5 (Fig. 1 A). The deleted region encompasses the third and fourth transmembrane domain (the latter of which contains residues critical for Ca2+ binding/translocation), the ATP binding domain, and the phosphorylation domain including the aspartyl phosphorylation site, ascertaining that ok190 represents a sca-1 null allele. Animals heterozygous for ok190 appeared as wild type. Animals that were homozygous for ok190, however, arrested in the first larval (L1) stage, showed slow and irregular pharyngeal pumping and sluggish body movement, and became constipated (Fig.5 A). Their body cavity became filled with fluid, indicative of defective osmo-regulation.ok190 larvae rescued by the wild-type sca-1 gene on an extra-chromosomal transgene developed into apparently wild-type adults that were, however, sterile or produced very few offspring. The gonads of these adults contained endomitotic oocytes, indicative of failing ovulation (Fig. 5 B). To perform RNA interference (22Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11430) Google Scholar), double-stranded RNA was prepared in vitro from a 727-base pair genomic fragment (Fig.1 A) and injected into the gonadal syncytium of healthy wild-type gravid adults. Within 24 h the injected animals became sterile (Fig. 5 D). The progeny of injected animals was severely affected. About half of them successfully completed embryonic development but then arrested at the L1 stage, closely resembling homozygous ok190 larvae. The other half of the progeny arrested already during embryogenesis, usually at the 2–3-fold stage (Fig. 5 C). Similar results were reported by Cho et al. (23Cho J.H. Bandyopadhyay J. Lee J. Park C. Ahnn J. Gene. 2000; 261: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although embryonic defects generally occurred at an earlier stage. Thapsigargin is a highly potent and highly specific inhibitor of SERCA pumps (24Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 25Treiman M. Caspersen C. Christensen S.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 131-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). L4 larvae or young adults that were transferred to thapsigargin-containing plates acutely and completely suppressed pharyngeal pumping (Table I). The effect was reversible; after 1 h, pharyngeal pumping resumed, albeit slower and irregular. In addition, thapsigargin affected animal movement and defecation cycles (Table I). The animals became small, pale, and thin as a consequence of limited food intake and displayed a protruding vulva (Fig. 6 A; Table I). Often the gonads were malformed and contained endomitotic oocytes or oocytes with multiple nuclei, resulting in a reduced production of progeny (Fig. 6 C). Thapsigargin also affected growth. Wild-type L1 larvae essentially arrested or died at the L3 or L4 stage when transferred to plates containing 1.25 μmthapsigargin or higher, whereas L1 larvae developed normally into healthy, gravid adults at less than 1.25 μm thapsigargin (Fig. 6 D).Table IDefective behavior induced by thapsigarginDefect1-aWild-type N2 animals and N2 expressing CeSERCAF259V were grown on standard plates and transferred to plates with or without thapsigargin as young adults.

Open table in a new tab Two lines of evidence support the view that CeSERCA is the in vivo target for thapsigargin and that the binding site for thapsigargin is conserved in CeSERCA. First, the epoxide derivative of thapsigargin did not cause any defect under the same experimental conditions, not even at 64-fold higher concentrations (data not shown). As the result of a very small structural change, thapsigargin epoxide has a SERCA affinity of at least 5 orders of magnitude lower than thapsigargin and, thus, serves as a negative control for thapsigargin inhibition (26Christensen S.B. Hergenhahn M. Roeser H. Hecker E. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1992; 118: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Second, animals expressing CeSERCA with a mutated thapsigargin-binding site showed greatly reduced sensitivity to thapsigargin. It was reported that F256V-substituted avian SERCA1 required 40-fold higher concentrations of thapsigargin to inhibit Ca2+ uptake than wild-type SERCA1 (27Yu M. Lin J. Khadeer M. Yeh Y. Inesi G. Hussain A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We introduced the homologous F259V mutation into the rescuing CeSERCA construct described above and established transgenic strains carrying this construct on an extrachromosomal array. Transgenic young adults were considerably less responsive to thapsigargin than wild-type young adults (Fig.6 B and Table I). Also, transgenic L1 larvae developed into healthy, gravid adults at high thapsigargin concentrations that caused developmental arrest and lethality of wild-type or non-transgenic L1 (Fig. 6 D). To determine the expression pattern of sca-1, we made a number of GFP reporter constructs. The isoform-specific reporter constructs CeSERCAa::GFP and CeSERCAb::GFP were obtained by insertion of GFP (28Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5412) Google Scholar) at the C-terminal end of either coding region in the rescuing sca-1 genomic clone (Fig.1 B). A third construct, Psca-1::GFP, contained sca-1 upstream sequence transcriptionally fused to GFP (Fig.1 B). All three reporter constructs were expressed in all major contractile tissues, starting during embryogenesis and continuing until adulthood (Fig. 7 and data not shown). Fluorescence was particularly pronounced in striated muscle (body wall muscles used for locomotion), non-striated muscle (pharyngeal muscles used for pharyngeal pumping, vulval and uterine muscles used for egg laying, the sphincter muscle and anal depressor used for defecation), and in myoepithelial cells (gonadal sheath cells used for ovulation). Furthermore, all three constructs showed expression in the intestine. Some cells expressed CeSERCAb::GFP but not CeSERCAa::GFP. These include the somatic cells of the spermatheca and the excretory canal and the uterine sheath cells (Fig.7, B–D). No cells were found that expressed CeSERCAa::GFP but not CeSERCAb::GFP. Fluorescence from Psca-1::GFP was evenly distributed over the cytosol. However, both CeSERCAa::GFP and CeSERCAb::GFP showed specific subcellular localization. Both fusion proteins were found in a tubular meshwork that was most distinct in the body wall muscle cells. This staining was continuous with staining at or near the dense bodies, structures functionally analogous to vertebrate Z-lines (Fig. 7, E and F). In body wall muscle cells and other cells, staining was also often localized in internal vesicles and membrane-like structures, including the nuclear envelope. In this paper we have described the C. elegans SERCA gene sca-1 and its two protein products. Alternative splicing occurs at a homologous position in the worm transcript as in vertebrate SERCA1–3 transcripts, according to a mode typical for SERCA2. It leads to the production of two protein variants, CeSERCAa and CeSERCAb, which structurally and functionally resemble the SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms, pointing to an evolutionarily conserved mechanism and functional significance of the isoform diversity. Both CeSERCA isoforms transported Ca2+ into the microsomal vesicles of COS-1 cells in an ATP-dependent and oxalate-stimulated manner, which was associated with the formation of a Ca2+-dependent phosphoprotein intermediate. Similarly to mammalian SERCA2a and SERCA2b, the longer b isoform showed a 2-fold higher apparent affinity for Ca2+ than the a isoform. However, in contrast to SERCA2 expression pattern, the two CeSERCA isoforms were expressed in a highly overlapping pattern. We employed three complementary approaches to inactivate CeSERCA. Direct gene targeting, RNA interference, and treatment with the SERCA-specific inhibitor thapsigargin all resulted in developmental arrest and lethality. The observation that RNA interference caused embryonic lethality, whereas the ok190 null allele caused larval lethality, argues for a maternal component of CeSERCA expression, which is required during early embryogenesis, and a zygotic component, which is required during larval development.ok190 embryos receive CeSERCA from their heterozygous mothers but fail to produce CeSERCA themselves and, hence, arrest as L1 larvae. Injection of double-stranded RNA into wild-type mothers already removes the maternal component and, hence, results in embryonic arrest. Besides its absolute requirement for normal development, inhibition of CeSERCA resulted in a variety of behavioral defects, reflecting the widespread expression of CeSERCA. The pumping and movement defects in ok190 larvae and after thapsigargin treatment show that Ca2+ from internal stores plays an important role in pharyngeal and body wall muscle activity. Both pharyngeal pumping and locomotion are impaired but not eliminated in animals deficient for CeSERCA. Apparently, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is required for full muscle function but is not essential for excitation-contraction coupling, as is also suggested by the relatively mild phenotypes observed in mutants of the main Ca2+release channel of the SR, the ryanodine receptor (29Sakube Y. Ando H. Kagawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 849-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Maryon E.B. Saari B. Anderson P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2885-2895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane is sufficient to induce pharyngeal and body wall muscle contraction. The smaller size and higher surface-to-volume ratio compared with vertebrate muscle cells could make nematode muscle cells relatively less dependent on internal Ca2+ stores. Furthermore, the diminished Ca2+-loading state of internal stores may increase Ca2+ entry at the plasma membrane via store-activated Ca2+ entry. CeSERCA-deficient animals show defective defecation, a process that is coordinated by inositol-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca2+ oscillations generated in the posterior intestinal cells (31Dal Santo P. Logan M.A. Chisholm A.D. Jorgensen E.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The defecation defects found in CeSERCA-deficient animals could therefore be caused by the absence of these Ca2+oscillation cycles by defective body wall or enteric muscle contraction or both. The process of ovulation requires the concerted action of oocyte signaling, spermathecal dilation, and sheath cell contraction (32McCarter J. Bartlett B. Dang T. Schedl T. Dev. Biol. 1999; 205: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 33McCarter J. Bartlett B. Dang T. Schedl T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mutants of two other Ca2+-handling proteins, the inositol trisphosphate receptor, expressed in the spermatheca (34Clandinin T.R. DeModena J.A. Sternberg P.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and troponin T, expressed in the sheath cells (35Myers C.D. Goh P.Y. Allen T.S. Bucher E.A. Bogaert T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), also display ovulation defects. Any of these events could be perturbed in CeSERCA-deficient animals. Osmo-regulation is mediated by the excretory canal. Dysfunction of this cell, which expresses CeSERCAb, is therefore the likely cause of the osmo-regulatory defects found in CeSERCA-deficient animals. Thus, loss of CeSERCA activity leads to a variety of phenotypes that could be used as a starting point for further analysis. C. elegans is a model organism amenable to high-throughput genetic and pharmacological screening. Because SERCA is likely to be a difficult target for classical in vitro drug screening,C. elegans-based models could prove to be particularly useful in the identification of compounds against SERCA-related diseases, such as heart disease.

Genetic analyses of the PCD pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans have successfully identified key regulatory genes that define the core machinery of cell death. Orthologues of the apoptosis genes of C. elegans have subsequently been identified in other organisms including mammals (3Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1998; 391: 440-442Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar,4Horvitz H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1701s-1706sPubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the molecular strategies that regulate the fundamental aspects of this important biological process are likely to be conserved across species. The molecular strategies that are involved in sex determination among species, however, are thought to be quite diverse (5Schafer A.J. Goodfellow P.N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Marin I. Baker B.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Indeed, genes in the sex-determining pathway are known to be rapidly diverged even between two closely related species, C. elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae (7Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, many genes have been identified that affect sexual fate. One of the key steps in the sex determination pathway in C. elegans is regulated by three fem genes, fem-1,fem-2, and fem-3 (8Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Kimble J. Edgar L. Hirsh D. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in any one of the fem genes prevent all aspects of male development and transform both males and hermaphrodites into females (9Kimble J. Edgar L. Hirsh D. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Doniach T. Hodgkin J. Dev. Biol. 1984; 106: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). fem-1 encodes a protein with ankyrin repeats (11Spence A.M. Coulson A. Hodgkin J. Cell. 1990; 60: 981-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and fem-2 encodes a serine/threonine protein phosphatase of the PP2C type (12Pilgrim D. McGregor A. Jackle P. Johnson T. Hansen D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which interacts directly with FEM-3 (13Chin-Sang I.D. Spence A.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Ahringer J. Rosenquist T.A. Lawson D.N. Kimble J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2303-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a protein without any recognizable functional motif. F1Aα has recently been identified as a mammalian Fas death domain-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (15Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Overexpression of F1Aα induces apoptosis in mammalian cells, and F1Aα is a caspase substrate (15Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, F1Aα was found to be highly homologous throughout its entire protein sequence, to the C. elegans sex determination protein FEM-1 (15Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Chan S.L. Yee K.S. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17925-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The degree of similarity between FEM-1 and F1Aα (30% amino acid identity) is comparable with that between several of the functionally conserved components of PCD in nematodes and mammals, e.g.the amino acid identity between CED-9 and Bcl-2 is 23% (17Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), and that between CED-3 and caspase-3 is 34% (18Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Despite their exclusive roles in masculinizing somatic tissues in males and regulating the production of male germ cells (8Hansen D. Pilgrim D. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Kimble J. Edgar L. Hirsh D. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), FEM-1 and FEM-2 proteins are expressed throughout development in all somatic tissues at equivalent levels in both sexes (12Pilgrim D. McGregor A. Jackle P. Johnson T. Hansen D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Gaudet J. VanderElst I. Spence A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This observation raises the question as to whether these proteins would have additional functions other than sex determination. Although there is no evidence to link F1Aα to sex determination function, FEM-1 and its mammalian homologue, F1Aα, were found to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in mammalian cells (15Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Chan S.L. Yee K.S. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17925-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments demonstrated that FEM-1 is cleaved by the C. elegans caspase, CED-3, demonstrating a striking parallel to its mammalian homologue, F1Aα (16Chan S.L. Yee K.S. Tan K.M. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17925-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is possible that fem-1, in contrast to many other sex-determining genes in C. elegans, was conserved during evolution because of its function in apoptosis. The functional conservation between FEM-1 and F1Aα in mediating apoptosis in mammalian cells raises an intriguing possibility that perhaps not only FEM-1 but a subset of genes in the C. elegans sex determination pathway may also be conserved if they have a role to play in apoptosis signaling. To test our hypothesis, we initiated a search for putative mammalian homologues of fem genes. A search in the GenBank™ data base revealed a human cDNA that encodes a full-length protein, which we named hFEM-2, that exhibits extensive amino acid sequence similarity to FEM-2 (28% amino acid identity). hFEM-2 exhibited enzymatic characteristics of the PP2C type similar to those for FEM-2. Like FEM-2, hFEM-2 associates with FEM-3, whereas a related PP2C phosphatase, PP2Cα (20Mann D.J. Campbell D.G. McGowan C.H. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), does not. The putative human homologue of fem-2 shares 79% amino acid identity with the rat Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (rCaMKPase) that was recently cloned from rat brain (21Kitani T. Ishida A. Okuno S. Takeuchi M. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1022-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CaM-dependent protein kinases are multifunctional protein kinases that control a variety of cellular functions including apoptosis (22Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Soderling T.R. Curr. Opin.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II is activated through autophosphorylation, whereas CaM kinase I and IV are activated through phosphorylation by upstream Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (23Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CaM kinase phosphatase was initially purified from rat brain using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the autophosphorylation site of CaM kinase II (28Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The rCaMKPase dephosphorylated and deactivated CaM kinase II activated by autophosphorylation (28Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and was later shown to be able to dephosphorylate CaM kinases I and IV activated upon phosphorylation by CaM kinase kinases (28Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Ishida A. Okuno S. Kitani T. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We show that FEM-2, hFEM-2, and rCaMKPase mediate caspase-dependent cell death when overexpressed in mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that FEM-2 and its human homologue can dephosphorylate autophosphorylated CaM kinase II efficiently in vitro. Hence, FEM-2 and its mammalian homologues are evolutionarily conserved CaM kinase phosphatases that may play a role in apoptosis signaling. Mono- and polyclonal antibodies against the Myc epitope (9E10, A14), monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope (F7), and polyclonal antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (A20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 293T human embryo kidney cells, NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, and HeLa cells were originally from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). tumor necrosis factor-sensitive MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were maintained as described previously (15Chan S.L.

Plasmids containing the cDNAs for fem-1, fem-2, and fem-3 were kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Spence (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The cDNA for rat Ca2+/calmodulin kinase phosphatase was kindly provided by Dr. Hitoshi Fujisawa (Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan). cDNA fragments for hFEM-2 and hPP2Cα (20Mann D.J. Campbell D.G. McGowan C.H. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from human spleen cDNA (CLONTECH) with the Expand™ high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with primers incorporated with appropriate restriction sites and inserted into the pXJ40 mammalian expression vector driven by the CMV promoter (30Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The constructs were sequenced to ensure that no PCR error was introduced. All epitope tags are at the NH2 termini. Point mutations were introduced using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with a32P-labeled probe corresponding to the NH2-terminal 295-base pair coding region of hFEM-2 using ExpressHyb™ hybridization solution (CLONTECH) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. MCF-7 cells were transfected at 70% confluence on sterile glass coverslips using LipofectAMINE™ with 2 μg of Myc-hFEM-2, and 16 h later cells were harvested and washed gently with PBS. Cells were then fixed with methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, followed by four washes with PBS. Cells were then blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 10 min and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody for 1 h, followed by washing three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antibody for 1 h and washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with propidium iodide for 10 min to stain the nuclei and washed three times with PBS. Cells were mounted in anti-fading agent (Molecular Probes), placed on a glass slide, and viewed using a confocal microscope. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as described (15Chan S.L.

Briefly, 293T cells seeded on a 100-mm plate at 80% confluence were transfected with 5 μg each of expression plasmids driven by the CMV promoter (pXJ40) (15Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S.

An aliquot (1%) of the cell lysates (1 ml) was fractionated on SDS-PAGE for visualization of the expression of proteins. The remaining cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using 1 μg of polyclonal anti-Myc antibody. 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose was added after 1 h and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed once in 1 ml of lysis buffer, two times in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and once in 1 ml of lysis buffer before fractionation on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analyses. Sequence encoding hFEM-2 was excised from pXJ40 vector and cloned in-frame into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein bacterial expression vector pGEX-TK4E. The plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21. GST and GST fusion protein were prepared by standard methods (30Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the recombinant proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Labeled proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription/translation of pXJ-HA-constructs using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The integrity of the 35S-labeled proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE. For in vitro protein interaction, equal amounts of total 35S -labeled lysate (7 × 105 cpm of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts) were diluted into 0.2 ml of GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 1 h with the various GST fusion proteins immobilized on the beads (∼2 μg). Samples were subsequently washed six times with binding buffer and boiled for 3 min in loading buffer before fractionation on 10% SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. 293T cells seeded on 150-mm plates at 80% confluence were transfected with 10 μg of expression plasmids driven by the CMV promoter (pXJ40) (15Chan S.L.

Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using 3 μg of polyclonal anti-Myc antibodies. 20 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose was added after 1 h and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed three times with storage buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of storage buffer before incubating with the phosphothreonine peptide substrate, RRA(pT)VA, and PP2C buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgSO4, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) at 30 °C for 1 h. In experiments that determine cation requirement, MgSO4 is replaced with the sulfates of the indicated cations. Free phosphate generated was then quantitated according to the instructions of the Serine/Threonine Phosphatase Assay System™ (Promega). Autophosphorylation of CaMKII (Calbiochem) was performed as described (28Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, CaMKII (10 μg/ml) was autophosphorylated at 30 °C for 1 min in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 μm calmodulin, 0.4 mmCaCl2, 0.02% Tween 20, and 0.33 μm[γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Excess EDTA (12.3 mm) and BSA (1 mg/ml) were added to stop the reaction, and the reaction mixture was applied to a P30 microspin column (Bio-Rad) buffered with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The eluate from the spin column was collected and stored at −80 °C. Dephosphorylation of CaMKII was performed as described (28Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of [32P]CaMKII was carried out at 30 °C for 20 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing ∼2 μg of GST, GST-rCaMKPase, GST-hFEM-2, GST-FEM-2, or GST-PP2Cα, or immunoprecipitates of Myc-hFEM-2, Myc-hFEM-2, or Myc vector, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Tween 20, 10 μg/ml poly(Lys), and 28,000 cpm autophosphorylated [32P]CaMKII. After preincubation for 30 s at 30 °C, the reaction was started by adding the phosphoprotein. Where indicated, 1 mm orthovanadate or 25 mm EDTA was added. After incubation for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by mixing with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The mixture was boiled for 2 min and centrifuged for 2 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure equal loading of protein, following which the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. HeLa cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at 70% confluence and transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-FEM-2, or pEGFP-PP2Cα using LipofectAMINE™. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed, rinsed with PBS, and then incubated for 2 min with Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes Inc.) to enable nuclear staining. The cells were subsequently fixed and then visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. Apoptosis assays were performed as described (15Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17925-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa, MCF7, or NIH3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with 2 μg each of the expression plasmids or vector and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase. Vector plasmid was supplemented to bring the total amount of plasmids for each transfection to 5 μg. Transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE™ for 6 h, followed by change of medium, and ZVAD added to the fresh medium at this point where indicated. 24 h later, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) solution at 37 °C. Cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy and blue (β-galactosidase-positive) cells were scored for apoptotic morphology. The data (mean ± S.D.) shown are percentage of round blue cells as a function of total number of blue cells counted (∼400–500 cells/sample) from three to five randomly chosen fields. For detection of PARP cleavage, HeLa cells cultured on 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the various pXJ-Myc constructs (10 μg). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The extracts were fractionated on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analyses using PARP-specific antibody (A20). To identify mammalian homologues of fem-2 and fem-3, we searched the GenBank™ data base for cDNAs encoding proteins with homology to these genes. No gene with significant similarity to fem-3 was found. However, the amino acid sequence predicted by analysis of an open reading frame (ORF) of a cDNA clone, kiaa0015 (GenBank™ accession no. D13640), derived from randomly sampled cDNA clones prepared from human immature myeloid cell line KG-1 (31Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayasi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), showed significant homology to FEM-2. The kiaa0015 clone contained a single long ORF encoding a protein of 454 amino acids (Fig.1 A). The 5′ and 3′ regions adjacent to the ORF contain stop codons in all three reading frames preceding the predicted translation start site and subsequent to the end of the ORF, suggesting that it encodes a full-length protein. Using the 5′ and 3′ sequence information derived from this clone, several independent cDNA clones encoding kiaa0015 product were generated by PCR from double-stranded cDNAs prepared from human spleen (CLONTECH). Three of the independent clones were sequenced completely in both directions, and the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the clones were found to be identical to the sequence encoded by kiaa0015. We named this protein hFEM-2. hFEM-2 shares relatively high amino acid sequence homology with FEM-2, with a relatively long amino-terminal extension flanking the catalytic domain. Over the entire length of the protein, the amino acid identity between hFEM-2 and FEM-2 is 28%. The degree of similarity is not uniform over the entire length of the protein. In the catalytic domain, the two proteins are 30% identical, whereas in the amino-terminal region, the proteins are 18% identical. The catalytic domains among different members (α, β, γ) (20Mann D.J.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar); however, the catalytic domain of FEM-2 is more similar in sequence to that of hFEM-2 than to other mammalian PP2Cs. The expression profile of hFEM-2 in human tissues was assessed by Northern blot analysis. Two transcripts, with estimated length of 6.5 and 3 kb, were detected in all adult tissues studied (Fig.1 B). The level of hFEM-2 mRNA message was variable from tissue to tissue, with the highest expression in testis (Fig.1 B). The subcellular localization of hFEM-2 was assessed in MCF-7 cells using immunocytochemistry. Myc-tagged hFEM-2 was expressed in MCF-7 cells, and the expression of the protein was detected using FITC-conjugated Myc antibody, whereas propidium iodide was used to stain the nuclei. hFEM-2 was consistently found diffusely distributed in the cytosol with no notable expression in the nucleus (Fig.1 C), suggesting that hFEM-2 is a cytosolic protein. As FEM-2 is known to exhibit PP2C phosphatase activity (13Chin-Sang I.D. Spence A.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2314-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we proceeded to examine the phosphatase activity of hFEM-2 in vitro. PP2C is the main enzyme subtype of the PPM family of serine-threonine phosphatases, and some of its members include mammalian PP2Cα (20Mann D.J. Campbell D.G. McGowan C.H. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), PP2Cβ (32Marley A.E. Kline A. Crabtree G. Sullivan J.E. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and PP2Cγ (33Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast to other protein phosphatases, the dephosphorylation activity of PP2C absolutely requires the metal cations, Mn2+ or Mg2+, but its activity is not sensitive to the tumor promoter okadaic acid and other inhibitors of the PPP family (34Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). Full-length NH2-terminal Myc-tagged hFEM-2, FEM-2, or hPP2Cα were transiently overexpressed in 293T cells. The Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for phosphatase activity in vitro. The phosphatase activity was assayed by dephosphorylating the phosphothreonine peptide RRA(pT)VA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitates of hFEM-2 protein from transiently transfected 293T cells exhibited phosphatase activity to an extent similar to that of FEM-2 and PP2"

In this report, we found that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV enhances Nur77 transactivation in cotransfections either alone or in synergy with AF2dependent coactivator ASC-2, whereas corepressor silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) is repressive. Interestingly, Nur77 interacted with SMRT but did not directly bind ASC-2, and accordingly, the putative AF2 core domain of Nur77 did not affect the Nur77 transactivation. SMRT harbors transferable repression domains that associate with various histone deacetylases. Surprisingly, histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A was unable to block the repressive effect of SMRT while dramatically stimulating the Nur77 transactivation. These results suggest that SMRT and ASC-2 are specific coregulators of Nur77 and that SMRT may dynamically compete with a putative adaptor molecule, which links ASC-2 to Nur77, for the identical binding sites within Nur77 in vivo.

The superfamily includes receptors for a variety of small hydrophobic ligands, such as steroids, T3, and retinoids, as well as a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands referred to as orphan nuclear receptors. Functional analysis of nuclear receptors has shown that the ligand-binding domain (LBD)1 exhibits ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function referred to as activation function-2 (AF2). Notably, this region has been shown to play a critical role in mediating transactivation by serving as a ligand-dependent interaction interface with many different coactivators (for reviews, see Refs. 2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar and 3Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.-Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.-K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Transcriptional coactivators either bridge transcription factors and the components of the basal transcriptional apparatus and/or remodel the chromatin structures. In particular, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and its functional homologue p300, steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and its family members, and activating signal cointegrator-2 (ASC-2) were shown to be essential for the activation of transcription by a large number of regulated transcription factors, including many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.-Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.-K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SRC-1 and its family member activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors (ACTR) along with CBP and p300 were recently shown to contain histone acetyltransferase activities and associate with another histone acetyltransferase protein p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.-Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.-K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and its homologue silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) harbor transferable repression domains that can associate with various histone deacetylases (HDACs) (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.-Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.-K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the notion that acetylation of histones destabilizes nucleosomes and relieves transcriptional repression by allowing transcription factors access to recognition elements, whereas deacetylation of the histones stabilizes the repressed state. A distinctive structural feature of the AF2-dependent coactivators is the presence of L XXLL signature motifs (i.e. NR box) (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 5Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The AF2 core region (helix 12) was recently shown to undergo a major restructuring upon ligand binding, forming part of a “charged clamp” that accommodates coactivators within a hydrophobic cleft of the receptor LBD through direct contacts with these NR boxes (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-CoR/SMRT nuclear receptor interaction motifs exhibited a consensus sequence of (I/L)XX(I/H)I (i.e. CoRNR box, in which H indicates hydrophobic residues) (6Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), which was able to interact with specific residues in the same receptor pocket required for coactivator binding. Thus, discrimination of the subtle differences between the coactivator and corepressor interaction helices by the nuclear receptor AF2 core may provide the molecular basis for the exchange of coactivators for corepressors with ligand-dependent formation of the charged clamp that stabilizes NR box binding and inhibits interaction with the CoRNR box helix. The orphan nuclear receptors Nur77 (NGFI-B), Nurr1, and NOR-1 constitute the NGFI-B subfamily within the nuclear receptor superfamily (for a review, see Ref. 8Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar). Nur77 was originally isolated as an immediate early gene rapidly expressed in response to serum or phorbol ester stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts. Other diverse signals, such as membrane depolarization and nerve growth factor, also increase Nur77 expression. Inactivation of a Nur77-related protein results in agenesis of mesencephalic dopamine neurons (9Zetterstrom R.H. Williams R. Perlmann T. Olson L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 41: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Nur77 is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis in different cell types. It is rapidly induced during apoptosis of immature thymocytes and T cell hybridoma (10Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 11Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), lung cancer cells treated with synthetic retinoid (12Li Y. Lin B. Agadir A. Liu R. Dawson M.I. Reed J.C. Fontana J.A. Bost F. Hobbs P.D. Zheng Y. Chen G.Q. Shroot B. Mercola D. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4719-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and prostate cancer cells treated with different apoptosis inducers (13Young C.Y. Murtha P.E. Zhang J. Oncol. Res. 1994; 6: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar, 14Uemura H. Chang C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2329-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin (CaM), the most ubiquitous and abundant Ca2+-binding protein in cells, is an essential protein that serves as a receptor to sense changes in calcium concentrations and, in this fashion, mediates the second messenger role of this ion (for a review, see Ref. 15Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Calcium binds to CaM by means of a structural motif called an EF-hand, and a pair of these structures is located in both globular ends of the protein. CaM binds to and activates target enzymes. These Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) include CaM kinase kinase, CaMKI, and CaMKIV, which are phosphorylated and activated by CaM kinase kinase, and CaMKII. In particular, CaMKIV is a monomeric multifunctional enzyme that is expressed only in subanatomical portions of the brain, T lymphocytes, and postmeiotic male germ cells. CaMKIV is present in the nucleus of the cells in which it is expressed and has been implicated in the regulation of transcription of a number of genes including those encoding interleukin-2, members of the immediate early gene family such as c-fos; tumor necrosis family members such as CD40L, Fas ligand, and tumor necrosis factor; the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); an Epstein-Barr virus gene involved in the switch to the lytic cycle called BZLF1; and orphan members of the steroid receptor superfamily such as retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR) and chicken ovalbumin upstream transcription factor (COUP-TF) (15Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the only direct substrates for CaMKIV involved in transcription that have been defined to date are CREB, cAMP response element modulator (CREM), and the NFκB component p65 (16Schulman H. Braun A. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 311-343Google Scholar, 17Means A.R Ribar T.J. Kane C.D. Hook S.S. Anderson K.A. Recent Prog. Horm.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20005-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), although CBP has also been indirectly implicated as a possible substrate (19Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that SMRT and ASC-2 are transcriptional coregulatory proteins of Nur77. We further present experimental evidence that CaMKIV stimulates the Nur77 transactivation, likely through modulation of various functional aspects of SMRT and ASC-2. Coupling of these two distinct signaling pathways (i.e.CaMKIV and Nur77) may play an important role in a subset of tissues that express both Nur77 and CaMKIV, such as brain and T lymphocytes. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments for Nur77ΔAF2, Nur77-TRAF2, the SMRT residues 1074–1291 and 1292–1495 (i.e. SMRT-D/N and SMRT-D/C, respectively), the SMRT residues 1060–1478 (i.e. SMRT-DΔS), and SMRT-Dm and SMRT-DmΔS, which are identical to SMRT-D (the SMRT residues 1060–1495) and SMRT-DΔS, respectively, except for mutations in the CoRNR motifs, were subcloned into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the B42 fusion vector pJG4-5, the in vitro translation and mammalian expression vector pcDNA3, the LexA fusion vector pEG202PL, and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

HeLa and CV-1 cells (5×104 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and transiently transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 12 h later, cells were washed and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum either in the presence or absence of 100 nmtrichostatin A (TSA). The cells were harvested 24 h later, and normalized luciferase expressions from triplicate samples were calculated relative to the LacZ expressions as described previously (24Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation, expression vectors for Nur77, SMRT, and CaMKIVc, a constitutively active mutant form of CaMKIV that consists of the CaMKIV residues 1–313, were transfected into 293T cells, and the resulting nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation against SMRT monoclonal antibody (the kind gift of Dr. Dean Edwards at University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) and blotted with polyclonal antibody against Nur77 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (24Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cotransformation and β-galactosidase assay in yeast were done as described previously (24Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For each experiment, at least three to six independently derived colonies expressing chimeric proteins were tested. Equal amounts of GST alone or GST fusions to SMRT-D, SMRT-D/N, SMRT-D/C, and ASC2-2C, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated in reaction buffer (20 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5% bovine serum albumin) with labeled Nur77 expressed by in vitro translation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (24Ko L. Cardona G.R. Chin W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6212-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). CaMKIV has recently been found to stimulate transactivation by a subset of orphan nuclear receptors such as ROR and COUP-TF (15Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results led us to examine whether CaMKIV similarly modulates the Nur77 transactivation. In CV-1 cells, coexpressed CaMKIVc stimulated the Nur77 transactivation with two different reporter constructs driven by upstream Nur77 binding sites (23Caira F. Antonson P. Pelto-Huikko M. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5308-5317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). NBRE was identified by genetic selection in yeast, and NurRE is a naturally occurring response element identified in the pro-opiomelanocortin promoter (23Caira F. Antonson P. Pelto-Huikko M. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5308-5317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nur77 binds NBRE and NurRE as a monomer and a homodimer, respectively. Similarly, Gal4/Nur77-directed transactivation of the Gal4-Luc reporter construct was significantly enhanced by coexpressed CaMKIVc in a dose-dependent manner (results not shown). Interestingly, the C-terminally deleted, constitutive active form of CaMKI, but not CaMKII, showed similar stimulatory effects on the Nur77 transactivation (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of HeLa cells with ionomycin, the CaMK activator, either in the absence or presence of coexpressed CaMKIV, also led to stimulation of the Nur77 transactivation, whereas the CaMKIVc-stimulated Nur77 transactivation was impaired by KN-93, the CaMK inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner (results not shown). From these results, we concluded that CaMKI and CaMKIV are capable of stimulating the Nur77 transactivation. Despite a large volume of work with conventional nuclear receptors (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.-Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.-K. Cell. Mol.

In accordance with these results, we further found that CaMKIVc dramatically potentiates the previously described autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2 (20Lee S.-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.-E.

We and others have recently shown that the autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2 requires CBP/p300 and can be down-regulated by CBP-neutralizing viral oncoprotein E1A (22Lee S.-K. Jung S.Y. Na S.-Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Consistent with an idea that the autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2 is indeed essential for the Nur77 transactivation, E1A but not E1A(Δ2–36), which is unable to bind CBP/p300, repressed the Nur77 transactivation (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were also obtained with the CaMKIV-stimulated Nur77 transactivation. Notably, E1A(Δ2–36) still exhibited significant repressive effects, suggesting that the repressive action of E1A may also involve proteins other than CBP. Surprisingly, ASC-2, a typical AF2-dependent coactivator of many nuclear receptors (20Lee S.-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.-E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.-Y. Jung Y.-K. Kallioniemi O.-P. Kononen J. Trent J.M.

Accordingly, deletion of the putative AF2 core region of Nur77 or incorporation of the AF2 sequences of thyroid hormone receptor β into Nur77 did not affect the Nur77 transactivation (Fig. 2 C). These results strongly suggest the presence of an AF2-independent coactivator molecule of Nur77 that may function as an adaptor that links Nur77 to the autonomous transactivation potential of ASC-2.Figure 4SMRT as a corepressor of Nur77. A and C, CV-1 cells were transfected with LacZ expression vector and a reporter gene and various expression vectors as indicated. Cells were grown for 24 h before harvest. The results were expressed as -fold activation (n-fold) over the value obtained with a reporter alone, and the error bars are as indicated. Similar results were also obtained with HeLa cells (results not shown).

Beads were washed, and specifically bound material was eluted with reduced glutathione and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 20% of the total reaction mixture was loaded as input. Similar results were also obtained with the LBD of Nur77 (results not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While examining other known coregulatory proteins of nuclear receptors, we found that SMRT directly interacts with Nur77. SMRT-D encodes the C-terminal subregion of SMRT (i.e. the SMRT residues 1060–1495) that contains two CoRNR boxes (6Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) as summarized in Fig.3 A. SMRT-Dm is identical to SMRT-D except for mutations in both CoRNR motifs ((L/I)XX(I/H)I, where H represents hydrophobic residues, to A XXAA) that abolished interactions with thyroid hormone receptor β and retinoic acid receptor α in the GST pull-down assays as expected (results not shown). SMRT-D, but not SMRT-Dm, fused to transcriptional activation domain B42 further stimulated the constitutive transcriptional activities directed by the LexA fusion to the LBD of Nur77 in yeast (Fig. 3 B). The Nur77-interacting region was further localized to SMRT-D/C (i.e. the SMRT residues 1292–1495) that contains the second CoRNR motif. The B42 fusion to the LBD of Nur77 also stimulated transactivation by the LexA fusion to SMRT-D. Similar results were also obtained with the mammalian two-hybrid-based assays (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the full-length Nur77 and its LBD alone, produced and radiolabeled by in vitro translation, specifically bound the GST fusion to SMRT-D, SMRT-D/N, and SMRT-D/C (Fig. 4 B and results not shown). Consistent with the yeast results (Fig. 3 B), however, SMRT-D/C, but not SMRT-D/N, showed specific interactions with Nur77 under more stringent conditions (i.e. 100–150 mm NaCl instead of 20 mm) (results not shown). Notably, Nur77 did not show any interaction with GST fusions to ASC2-2C and other ASC-2 fragments (Fig. 4 B and results not shown). Confirming the functional significance of these interactions, cotransfected SMRT repressed the Nur77 transactivation, either in the absence or presence of CaMKIVc, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C and results not shown). Interestingly, SMRT-D, but not SMRT-Dm, was also sufficient to repress the Nur77 transactivation. Notably, SMRT-Dm still exhibited significant repression, suggesting that SMRT-D may contain other cryptic receptor or Nur77 binding sites. In addition, the deletion of 17 residues from the C-terminal region of SMRT, which was recently shown to be a binding site for a novel corepressor SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein (SHARP) (29Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), abolished the repressive effect of SMRT-D (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that SMRT acts as a specific corepressor of Nur77 via direct interactions with Nur77, and the corepressor SHARP (29Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) could be essential at least for the SMRT-D-mediated repression of Nur77. We have recently demonstrated that CaMKIV results in a novel translocation of SMRT from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (18Jang M.K. Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim Y.S. Lee S.-K. Cheong J. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20005-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Accordingly, αSMRT-mediated immunoprecipitates of cells cotransfected with expression vectors encoding Nur77 and SMRT retained Nur77 less efficiently in the presence of coexpressed CaMKIVc (Fig.5 A). In addition, the Nur77 transactivation was tremendously increased in the presence of 100 nm TSA, an inhibitor of HDAC (Fig. 5 B), as expected from the previously suggested role of SMRT as an adaptor molecule (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.-Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.-K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) between HDAC and target transcription factors such as Nur77. Interestingly, the TSA-stimulated level of the Nur77 transactivation was impaired by cotransfected SMRT in a dose-dependent manner. Under this condition, it was noted that SMRT-D was a much stronger inhibitor (Fig. 5 B). Overall, these results suggest that SMRT may share identical binding surfaces of Nur77 with a putative Nur77 coactivator, such as the missing adaptor molecule between Nur77 and ASC-2, and these two coregulators (i.e. SMRT versus ASC-2/adaptor) could be in a dynamic equilibrium to occupy Nur77 in vivo. For instance, with the arrival of the CaMKIV-activating signal, this equilibrium can be driven toward the ASC-2/adaptor-bound form because of CaMKIV-mediated stimulation of the ASC-2 function as well as relocation of SMRT to the cytoplasm. Many transcriptional coregulators have been isolated for various members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (2McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.W. Lee Y.C. Na S.-Y. Jung D.J. Lee S.-K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, none has been identified for the NGFI-B subfamily that includes Nur77 (NGFI-B), Nurr1, and NOR-1 (8Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the AF2-dependent coactivators ASC-2 (20Lee S.-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.-E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.-Y. Jung Y.-K. Kallioniemi O.-P.

In this report, we demonstrated that ASC-2 enhances the Nur77 transactivation in synergy with CaMKIV (Fig. 1 C). CaMKIV also stimulated the previously described autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2 (20Lee S.-K. Anzick S.L. Choi J.-E. Bubendorf L. Guan X.-Y. Jung Y.-K. Kallioniemi O.-P. Kononen J.

Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). It is noted that CaMKIV also potentiates the autonomous transactivation function of CBP (19Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), which in turn appears to be essential for the action of ASC-2 (22Lee S.-K. Jung S.Y. Na S.-Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). Based on the results with CBP-neutralizing viral oncoprotein E1A and a mutant protein E1A(Δ2–36) that fails to bind CBP (22Lee S.-K. Jung S.Y. Na S.-Y. Lee Y.C. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2 is expected to be essential for the Nur77 transactivation both in the absence and presence of CaMKIV (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with the inability of ASC-2 to directly interact with Nur77, mutations of the AF2 core region of Nur77 did not affect the Nur77 transactivation (Fig.2 C). Overall, these results suggest that ASC-2 may function as a CaMKIV-responsive, indirect coactivator molecule of Nur77 via a putative adaptor molecule that recognizes a non-AF2 subregion of Nur77. We recently found that ASC-2, a protein of 250 kDa, exists as a steady-state complex of ∼2 MDa in vivo, 2Y. C. Lee and J. W. Lee, unpublished results. which consists of multiple polypeptides. One of these polypeptides can be an excellent candidate adaptor molecule that links ASC-2 to Nur77, although another unrelated protein may also accomplish this mission. In contrast to ASC-2, SMRT directly bound Nur77, likely through the second CoRNR motif of SMRT (6Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. McInerney E.M. Kurokawa R. Krones A. Rose D.W. Lambert M.H. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and repressed its transactivation potential in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 3 and 4). The C-terminal fragment of SMRT (i.e. SMRT-D) that contains the CoRNR motifs and a recently described novel repression domain (29Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was sufficient to transmit the repressive effect of the SMRT to Nur77. This C-terminal repression domain associates with SHARP (29Shi Y. Downes M. Xie W. Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Tsai C.C. Hon M. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1140-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), a potent transcriptional repressor whose repression domain interacts directly with SMRT and at least five members of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex (for a review, see Ref. 30Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), including HDAC1 and HDAC2. As expected from the functional association of SMRT with various HDACs, the repressive effect of SMRT-HDACs on the Nur77 transactivation was relieved in the presence of HDAC inhibitor TSA, resulting in dramatically enhanced transcriptional activities of Nur77 (Fig. 5 B). Surprisingly, however, cotransfected SMRT and SMRT-D were still repressive of the Nur77 transactivation in the presence of TSA. These results strongly suggest that SMRT may bind identical or overlapping binding sites within Nur77 that are also utilized by the putative coactivator/adaptor molecule. Thus, this adaptor molecule may contain a CoRNR-type interaction interface to interact with Nur77. Alternatively, it is also possible that SMRT binding may force Nur77 to adopt a distinct conformation that is incapable of interacting with the putative Nur77 coactivator/adaptor. However, the limited proteolysis experiments indicated that Nur77 conformation is not affected by the presence of SMRT-D (results not shown). From the results presented in this work, we propose a working model (Fig. 5 C) in which ASC-2 is indirectly recruited to Nur77 via unknown adaptor factor(s) in contrast to the direct recruitment of SMRT (Fig. 4 B), and the “transcriptionally active ASC-2 complex” could be in a dynamic equilibrium with the “repressive SMRT complex.” In this model, CaMKIV stimulates both the autonomous transactivation function of ASC-2 and translocation of SMRT to the cytoplasm, leading to a switch in equilibrium toward the active complex and the maximum stimulation of the Nur77 transactivation. Likewise, the model also predicts that the level of SMRT in a given cell type is an important determinant for the maximum level of the Nur77 transactivation that can be achieved. In this regard, it is noted that transcriptional repression by retinoic acid receptor can be either positively or negatively regulated by changes in the levels of N-CoR expression (31Soderstrom M. Vo A. Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Yang W.M. Seto E. Peterson D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently CaMK signaling was shown to promote myogenesis by disrupting MEF2·HDAC complexes and stimulating HDAC nuclear export (32McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar,33McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of SMRT by MEKK-1 was shown to inhibit the ability of SMRT to physically tether to its transcription factor partners and led to a redistribution of the SMRT protein from a nuclear compartment to a more perinuclear or cytoplasmic compartment (34Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have also shown that CaMKI and CaMKIV, but not CaMKII, led to the cytoplasmic translocation of SMRT (18Jang M.K. Goo Y.H. Sohn Y.C. Kim Y.S. Lee S.-K. Cheong J. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20005-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), consistent with their activity profile for the Nur77 transactivation (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with these results, the amount of SMRT associated with Nur77 in vivo decreased upon cotransfection of cells with the CaMKIVc expression vector (Fig. 5 A). Close examinations of the SMRT, Nur77, and ASC-2 sequences revealed that these proteins contain the known consensus phosphorylation sequences for CaMKIV, R XX(S/T) (15Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Currently we are examining if these proteins (particularly ASC-2) are a direct phosphorylation substrate for CaMKIV. In T lymphocytes, where both Nur77 and CaMKIV are expressed, the Ca2+-dependent activation of MEF2 appears to lead to programmed cell death by activating the Nur77 transcription factor (35Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies suggest that CaMKIV may synergize with Nur77 to induce apoptosis in T lymphocytes, providing a positive feed-in mechanism to stimulate the Nur77 transactivation potential along with this calcium-responsive MEF2-dependent up-regulation of Nur77 expression (35Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the calcium-dependent control of programmed cell death is complicated and often cell type-dependent. Greenberg and colleagues (36Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) recently found that Ca2+ stimuli that protected neurons from cell death activated MEF2-dependent transcription in a calcineurin-dependent fashion. Presumably the genes that are activated by MEF2 in neurons protect them from cell death. Several reports have also demonstrated that inhibition of CaMK activity is associated with apoptosis and proliferation. Inhibition of CaMK activity with specific inhibitors induces apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells (37Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar) and sensitizes etoposide-resistant cells to apoptotic challenge (38Kawamura K. Grabowski D. Krivacic K. Hidaka H. Ganapathi R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we suspect that coupling of these two distinct signaling pathways (i.e. CaMKIV and Nur77) may play a pivotal role in tissues that express both Nur77 and CaMKIV. In summary, we have shown that SMRT and ASC-2 mediate transcriptional repression and activation by Nur77, respectively. It is important to note that SMRT appears to be in a dynamic equilibrium in vivo with a putative adaptor molecule that may enable Nur77 to indirectly recruit the CaMKIV-responsive transactivation function of ASC-2. Molecular cloning of this putative adaptor molecule will facilitate complete understanding of the Nur77 regulatory circuit, particularly with regard to CaMKIV signaling. We thank Drs. Tony Means and Dean Edwards for various CaMK plasmids and the SMRT antibody."

A peculiar feature of the monoclonal antibody (mAb)1 H572, the probe first used to discover EndoGlyx-1 (1Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Garin-Chesa P. Stockert E. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 366-373PubMed Google Scholar), is its distinctive reactivity with human tissues. In an extensive immunohistochemical survey of normal human fetal and adult tissues as well as human cancer tissues, H572 immunostaining was found exclusively on blood vessel endothelium. Notably, these included capillaries, veins, arterioles, and muscular arteries, but interestingly no immunoreactivity was observed in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of the spleen and liver. In neoplastic tissues, H572 immunostaining was consistently found in tumor capillaries, including “hot spots” of neoangiogenesis in certain tumors (2Belien J.A. van Diest P.J. Baak J.P. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The endothelial staining pattern revealed a uniform cell surface and cytoplasmic distribution of the antigen, in some cases with an accentuated staining at the abluminal side of the endothelial cell layer. All nonendothelial cell types in normal and tumor tissues were unreactive with mAb H572. The expression of the antigen on cultured human tumor cell lines and normal cells in vitro was also studied in detail. Thus, a host of cultured transformed cells of mesenchymal, neuroectodermal, and epithelial derivation as well as normal lymphocytes, hematopoetic cells, and platelets were found to be H572 antigen-negative. Cells of endothelial origin, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), microvascular endothelial cells, and the immortalized endothelial hybrid cell line EA.hy926 express high levels of the antigen in tissue culture. Stimulation of HUVECs with a variety of regulatory peptides and mediators that are known to induce expression of endothelial activation antigens found in inflammatory lesions (3Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2068-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lasky L.A. Science. 1992; 258: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) did not result in an altered expression of the H572 antigen. Radioimmunoprecipitation studies with mAb H572 identified the target antigen on cultured HUVECs as a high molecular mass glycoprotein complex of ∼500 kDa composed of at least four different disulfide-bridged protein subunits migrating at distinct molecular sizes in reducing SDS gels. Direct identification of the epitope-carrying subunit(s) were unsuccessful because of the fact that the epitope was destroyed by the immunoblotting procedure. To reflect the biochemical characteristics and the endothelium-specific expression of the H572 antigen, the molecule was designated EndoGlyx-1. In the absence of any information on the EndoGlyx-1 molecular structure, no clues were available regarding its potential function in endothelial cells. Considering the strong interest in mechanisms that control assembly of endothelial cells into vascular structures and regulate the biological function of established vessels, the present study was designed to characterize the EndoGlyx-1 gene. The results should provide essential information and molecular tools to investigate EndoGlyx-1 function in suitable model systems and to investigate the mode of EndoGlyx-1 regulation in the vascular bed. HUVECs were purchased (BioWhittaker, Walkersville) and cultured on collagen I-coated cell culture plates (Becton Dickinson) in EGM BulletKit medium (BioWhittaker). EA.hy926 were purchased from C. J. Edgell (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (BioWhittaker) with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 1× hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). The anti-EndoGlyx-1 antibody H572 (mouse IgG1) was raised against HUVEC as described (1Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Garin-Chesa P. Stockert E. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 366-373PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody TEA-1/31 to human VE-Cadherin was purchased from BD Biosciences (Heidelberg, Germany). Tissues for immunohistochemistry were obtained from the collection of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, and umbilical cord samples were obtained from the University of Ulm. Immunohistochemistry was carried out using mAb H572, mAb TEA-1/31, or negative control IgG as described previously (5Garin-Chesa P. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7235-7239Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). For staining endothelium of intact blood vessels, samples of 10 cm in length were generated from freshly obtained, intact human umbilical cord specimens. Before antibody application, the umbilical cord vein was rinsed extensively with cold phosphate-buffered saline, closed at one end by a cable binder, and filled with antibody supernatant at a concentration of 10 μg antibody/ml in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Intraluminal application using a 10-ml syringe with a blunt ended needle was followed by an occlusion of the umbilical vein by a second cable binder and subsequent incubation on ice for 1 h before rinsing extensively with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, 4–5-mm samples from the central part of the specimens were embedded in OCT (Miles) compound and used for immunohistochemical analysis. For protein purification 3 × 109 EA.hy926 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 unit/ml α2-macroglobulin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 2 × 108 cells/ml, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Gelman/Pall, Ann Arbor, MI), centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and precleared with ethanol amine-blocked Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at 4 °C. EndoGlyx-1 was precipitated from lysates at a ratio of 2 μl of mAb H572 covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (4.9 mg/ml of gel)/108lysed cells. The precipitate was washed three times with IP wash buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 0.02% azid), washed two times with 250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.4, and eluted twice for 15 min at 55 °C, using 2 μl of nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer (6Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar)/1 μl of affinity matrix. The eluate was reduced with 50 mmdithiothreitol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For peptide analysis, purified protein was separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 6% gel and visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). The EndoGlyx-1 bands were excised from the gel, incubated with trypsin solution (Promega, Madison, WI), and eluted peptides were subjected, after HPLC (Waters, Milford, MA) separation, to a 494 cLC ABI-Perkin-Elmer device. The peptides were desalted by ZipTip-procedure and subjected to mass spectroscopy analysis using a matrix-assisted laser disorption ionization-time of flight instrument (Voyager DE-STR, PerSeptive Biosystems/AB, Foster City, CA). The peptide samples were prepared using dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix (7Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Out of the calibrated MS peptide map, a peak table list of the peptide-mass fingerprint was designed, omitting signals observed in the chemical background spectrum. The peak table list served as input data, and the MS-Fit software program was written by K. R. Clauser and P. Baker (School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology Chemical Mass Spectrometry Facility, UCSF; rafael.ucsf.edu) was used for searching the SWISS Prot and NCBI protein data bases for sequence similarities and thus suggesting the identity of the protein. MS-Fit search results were checked regarding the molecular weight search (MOWSE) score (8Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar), molecular mass (Da), pI, species, and percentage of masses matched. Transient transfection of HeLa-S3 cells plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson) was carried out with the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and expression vector pMH (Roche Diagnostics), containing the complete EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140 coding sequence or as empty vector. The cells were analyzed for antigen expression 48 h after transfection by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cells with mAb H572 or control IgG1 essentially as described (7Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) was used for total RNA isolation according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Oligo(dT)-cellulose (Life Technologies, Inc.) was taken for poly(A)+ RNA isolation as described (9Weller A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15176-15183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blots, 1.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were electrophoresed on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.6, and 1.11% formaldehyde. The RNA was blotted in 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) on a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 16–20 h and UV-cross-linked. To detect EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140 mRNA, two polymerase chain reaction fragments, a 201-bp 5′ probe comprising positions +174 to +375 or a 290-bp central probe comprising positions +1124 to +1414 of EndoGlyx-1 cDNA, were used. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (9Weller A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15176-15183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cell surface expression analysis, HUVECs (5 × 106 cells) were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline on a cell culture plate and incubated with biotinylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.45, 5 mm KCl, 130 mm NaCl, 0.8 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml EZ link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin; Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of the reagent, the cells were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 1 h. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. EndoGlyx-1 was immunoprecipitated as described above and eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NH4HCO3). Eluted proteins were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (10Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were subsequently incubated, after blocking, with ExtrAvidin-peroxidase conjugates diluted 1:5,000 (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected after incubation with ECL reagent and exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For glycosylation studies, EndoGlyx-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell surface biotinylated HUVECs as described before, using AffiGel 10-bound mAb H572 (4.9 mg/ml). After washing four times with IP wash buffer, the immunoprecipitates were split into four equal aliquots, resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and incubated for 16 h either (a) with 1 unit ofN-glycosidase F from Flavobacterium meningosepticum or (b) with 10 milliunits of sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens, 0.5 milliunits ofO-glycosidase from Diplococcus pneumoniae, or (c) with 1 unit of N-glycosidase F, 10 milliunits of sialidase and 0.5 milliunits O-glycosidase (Roche Diagnostics) or (d) in the absence of enzyme (mock treatment). Subsequent washing, elution in Laemmli sample buffer, and immunoblotting followed by ECL detection were performed as described before. Data base mining and sequence analyses were performed as essentially outlined in Ref. 7Christian S. Ahorn H. Koehler A. Eisenhaber F. Rodi H.P. Garin-Chesa P. Park J.E. Rettig W.J. Lenter M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7408-7414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and are described in great detail at the supplementary World Wide Web pagemendel.imp.univie.ac.at/SEQUENCES/endoglyx/. To compare vascular expression of EndoGlyx-1 with VE-cadherin, a protein complex constituting an antigen specific for the intercellular junctions of endothelium, serial frozen sections obtained from normal human tissues were tested with mAb H572 specific for human EndoGlyx-1 or with mAb TEA-1 specific for human VE-cadherin by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. The results of these studies showed that VE-cadherin staining concentrated, as described previously (11Navarro P. Ruco L. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), at sites of vascular cell-cell contact (Fig.1, right panel), whereas EndoGlyx-1 showed a diffuse, continuous localization along the endothelial lining of the blood vessels (Fig. 1, left panel). The H572 antigen-positive cell line EA.hy926, obtained by fusion of a human umbilical vein endothelial cell with the transformed tumor cell line A549 (12Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), was selected as a source for EndoGlyx-1 purification. Protein was purified from detergent extracts of 3 × 109 cells using mAb H572 covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 as an immunoaffinity matrix. To analyze the quality of the preparation, an aliquot of the eluted material was separated on a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and four major protein bands of 110 kDa (p110 subunit), 125 kDa (p125 subunit), 140 kDa (p140 subunit), and 200 kDa (p200 subunit) were visualized by silver staining (Fig.2, arrows). This is in agreement with the EndoGlyx-1 subunit pattern described previously for human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures (1Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Garin-Chesa P. Stockert E. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 366-373PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining eluate was separated under reducing conditions on a quantitative SDS-PAGE and yielded 0.1–0.5 pmol of the four specific protein species as determined by colloidal Coomassie staining. Gel fragments containing the EndoGlyx-1 subunits were subjected to a trypsin digest, the eluted peptides were separated by HPLC and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight. Subsequent peptide-mass fingerprint analysis gave rise to the molecular masses of nine peptides derived from the p125 subunit (Fig. 3,dashed lines) and fourteen peptides from the p140 subunit (Fig. 3, underlined) matching with the same entry in the public data base of a full-length cDNA (EMBL data base, accession number AK023527) encoding an “unnamed protein” from human placenta. The complete cDNA comprises 3,828 bp and harbors a single open reading frame of 2,847 bp, coding for a protein of 949 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass 104.4 kDa (Fig. 3). The results obtained from peptide analysis of the two remaining EndoGlyx-1 subunits, p110 and p200 (Fig. 2, open arrows), were not interpretable, and their analysis is pending.Figure 3cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence of human EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140. The sequence of full-length cDNA was identified as an entry for an unnamed protein in the public data base using a matrix-assisted laser disorption ionization-time of flight-based peptide mass fingerprint analysis resulting in molecular mass detection of 9 tryptic peptides derived from the p125 protein species (dashed lines) and 14 tryptic fragments derived from the p140 protein species (underlined amino acids). The putative N-terminal signal sequence is boxed, and the potential polyadenylation signal is double underlined. The 11 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites are marked bycircles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bioinformatic analysis identifies EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140 as a typical precursor sequence for a eukaryotic protein resulting evolutionarily from exon shuffling (Fig. 4 A). First, there is a putative N-terminal sequence of 23 amino acids similar to a signal leader peptide for translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum. Next there are two major globular segments, an N-terminal EMI domain and a C-terminal C1q-like domain spaced by a central coiled-coil rich region. The EMI domain comprises the amino acids 55–130 including 7 cysteine residues (C1–C7), which potentially form two subdomains (C1–C4 and C5–C7) as determined by sequence similarity searches in data bases by PSI-BLAST tools (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). This is followed by a coiled-coil region comprising more than half of the polypeptide (547 amino acids), composed of five subdomains with a strong prediction (amino acids 323–346, 374–481, 532–553, 554–594, and 687–713) and two subdomains with a weak prediction (amino acids 166–188 and 290–313) for coiled-coil formation. These are interrupted by noncoiled regions, allowing structural flexibility. A short cluster (amino acids 779–806) rich in positively charged amino acids separates the coiled-coil region from the C1q-like domain-containing consensus sequences, common in proteins known to interact with glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate (14Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). There are two well conserved regions in the C1q domain: an aromatic motif (amino acids 844–873) as defined by the Prosite C1q pattern is located within the first part of the domain (amino acids 827–873), the other conserved region is near the extreme C terminus (amino acids 912–947). A C-terminal C1q domain is a common feature of the C1q-family of proteins such as the A, B, and C chains of the complement C1q protein (15Sellar G.C. Blake D.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Reid K.B. Immunology. 1985; 55: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar), the type VIII and X collagens (17Muragaki Y. Jacenko O. Apte S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and a large protein of homomultimeric structure called multimerin (20Hayward C.P. Hassell J.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18246-18251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) found in the α-granules of platelets and Waibel-Palade bodies of endothelium. The N-terminal EMI domain of EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140, between amino acids 55 and 130, shares 38% sequence identity with the corresponding region in the precursor protein of human EMILIN-1 (EMBL data base accession number AF088916) and 34% sequence identity with the protein precursor of human multimerin (SwissProt data base,Q13201), respectively (Fig. 4 B). The positions of six (of 7) cysteine residues critical for disulfide bridges are conserved among the three proteins, suggesting a shared three-dimensional structure in this segment. Additionally, a significant level of conservation was found for the C-terminal C1q-like domain, between amino acids 818 and 949, with 26% sequence identity with the respective region in the human EMILIN-1 precursor protein and 32% sequence identity with the human multimerin precursor protein (Fig. 4 B), indicating a shared functional feature provided by this segment, such as the formation of homomultimers, which was demonstrated for several members of the TNF/C1q superfamily (21Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Bot S. Mucignat M.T. Giacomello E. Doliana R. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25471-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additional sequence analysis details can be viewed atmendel.imp.univie.ac.at.SEQUENCES/endoglyx/. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the EndoGlyx-1-expressing cell line EA.hy926 revealed a single major transcript of about 3,800 bp (Fig. 5) for two distinct radioactive cDNA probes, matching either the 5′ end or the central region of the open reading frame. Thus, p125 and p140 (Fig.2, filled arrows) are encoded by the same mRNA, and detection of a single mRNA transcript by hybridization with two widely spaced probes indicates that the molecular mass difference of the two encoded subunits is more likely due to post-translational events than being mediated by alternative splicing of a common mRNA precursor. To determine the EndoGlyx-1 subunit composition, detergent extracts of metabolically labeled human umbilical vein endothelial cells were purified with mAb H572, and eluted material was separated either by nonreducing or reducing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EndoGlyx-1 was identified by mAb H572 under nonreducing conditions as a single protein species with a molecular mass of ∼500 kDa that barely entered the separating gel (Fig.6 A). Reduction previous to SDS gel electrophoresis resulted in detection of three distinct EndoGlyx-1 species, p125, p140, and p200, indicating a high molecular mass complex cross-linked through intermolecular disulfide bridges (Fig.6 B). To test this, the 500-kDa EndoGlyx-1 protein and a respective control were cut from the nonreduced polyacrylamide gel and re-electrophoresed under reducing conditions on a second gel (Fig. 6,A and B, asterisks), resulting in a protein pattern that appeared to be identical to that of the directly reduced H572 precipitates. This indicates that EndoGlyx-1 is composed of at least three disulfide-bonded protein subunits: p125, p140, and p200 (Fig. 6 B, arrows). In contrast, no major reduction-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility was observed for proteins in TEA-1 immunoprecipitates, which is in agreement with the reported noncovalent association of VE-cadherin with catenins (22Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geiger B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Transient transfection studies with the EndoGlyx-1-negative cell line HeLa-S3 were used to confirm that the putative cDNA indeed specifies the antigen defined by mAb H572. Unlike the parental or mock transfected cells, which did not react with mAb H572 (data not shown), H572 antigen was immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of metabolically labeled transfectants generated with an expression vector containing full-length EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140 cDNA, revealing under nonreducing conditions a high molecular mass species of ∼500 kDa, which gave rise after reduction to a major protein band of 125 kDa and to two less prominent species of about 110 and 200 kDa (Fig.6 C, arrowheads). The lack of the p140 species in the transfectants could be due to alternate splicing or differential protein processing. Thus, recombinant EndoGlyx-1 assembles into a disulfide-bonded complex with subunits similar in size to those found in the endogenous EndoGlyx-1 of HUVECs and EA.hy926. To investigate whether the EndoGlyx-1 antigen is expressed on the luminal side of intact blood vessel endothelium, mAb H572 or a corresponding isotype-matched control antibody was infused intraluminally into the umbilical cord vein. To detect bound antibody, frozen sections generated after antibody perfusion were incubated with a biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG followed by the avidin-biotin complex and diaminobenzidine as substrate for the reaction. Our results show a strong immunoreactivity of mAb H572 with the endothelial lining (Fig.7 A), whereas no staining was detected for the isotype control (data not shown). This indicates that at least a sizable fraction of EndoGlyx-1 is exposed on the luminal surface of human blood vessels. To discriminate between intra- and extracellular distribution of the distinct EndoGlyx-1 subunits, lysates of cell surface biotinylated human umbilical vein endothelial cells were generated and tested by immunoprecipitation with mAb H572 immobilized to Affi-Gel 10. The bound antigen was eluted, separated by reducing SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the subsequent avidin-peroxidase conjugate-based ECL reaction gave rise to the detection of four biotinylated subunits: p110, p125, p140, and p200 (Fig. 7 B). Restriction of biotin label to antigens located on the cell surface was confirmed by the exclusive detection of surface exposed VE-cadherin and not of the intracellular attached catenins, which co-purify in mAb TEA-1 immunoprecipitates (Figs. 7 B and 6 B). This result indicates that EndoGlyx-1 is composed of four cell surface exposed protein subunits. The absence of the p110 species in metabolic studies indicates either a lower content of cysteine/methionine residues or a slower metabolic turnover rate. To investigate the possibility that the different EndoGlyx-1 subunits emerge from a differentially glycosylated core protein, we examined the glycosylation pattern of the endogenous complex. Because direct detection of subunits was hampered by the fact that mAb H572 is not usable in Western blot analysis, we first immunopurified EndoGlyx-1 from lysates of cell surface biotinylated human umbilical vein endothelial cells with immobilized mAb H572. Pretreatment of matrix bound antigen withN-glycosidase F led to a reduction in the size of the three smaller EndoGlyx-1 subunits of ∼15 kDa. This is consistent with the presence of 11 Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) consensus sites in the primary sequence of the identified p125/p140. Additionally, removal ofO-linked carbohydrates by combined treatment withO-glycosidase and sialidase resulted in a collective shift in electrophoretic mobility but less pronounced (∼10 kDa), indicating a similar extent of enzymatically sensitive N- and O-glycosylation of the three smaller EndoGlyx-1 subunits (Fig. 8). This was further supported by the combined removal of N- and O-linked carbohydrates, resulting in an additive (∼25 kDa) and simultaneous shift in the apparent molecular mass of the proteins. The loss in signal intensity after N-glycosidase F treatment could be due to a removal of biotin label immobilized to N-bound sugars. We have cloned the gene coding for the human EndoGlyx-1 subunits p125 and p140 based on two lines of evidence. First, 17 peptide sequences found in the p125 and/or p140 proteins are present in the putative EndoGlyx-1 cDNA. Second, transfection of this cDNA into antigen-negative HeLa-S3 cells results in expression of a protein recognized by cognate mAb H572. The apparent molecular size of transfected recombinant EndoGlyx-1 protein under reducing and nonreducing conditions is in good agreement with the observed size of the endogenous antigen. The present study is not the only evidence linking EndoGlyx-1 expression to the endothelium. Rather, an independent line of investigation, aimed at dissecting comprehensive gene expression profiles for blood vessels in cancer versus normal tissues with the SAGE method, has implicated an EndoGlyx-1-specific tag sequence (23St Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). This study identified a SAGE tag sequence designated PEM87 among 93 tagged transcripts elevated at least 20-fold in normal and tumor endothelium compared with other nonendothelial cell types. The PEM87 tag matches the 3′-untranslated region of a full-length cDNA transcript coding for an unnamed protein in human placenta and three oriented expressed sequence tags deposited in the public data base. We show here that PEM87 is the EndoGlyx-1 p125/140 gene. Taking together the EndoGlyx-1 expression data generated with mAb H572 (1Sanz-Moncasi M.P. Garin-Chesa P. Stockert E. Jaffe E.A. Old L.J. Rettig W.J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 366-373PubMed Google Scholar) and the RNA expression data derived from SAGE, a consistent picture of EndoGlyx-1 expression in endothelium emerges. EndoGlyx-1 represents a new member of the unique group of EMILIN-like proteins. This group is shared by two Elastin microfibril interface-located proteins, designated as EMILIN-1 and EMILIN-2, and multimerin, a massive, soluble protein found to be expressed in platelets, megakaryocytes, and vascular endothelium (24Hayward C.P. Song Z. Zheng S. Fung R. Pai M. Masse J.M. Cramer E.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1337-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike EndoGlyx-1, EMILINs are expressed in connective tissues of blood vessels, skin, heart, lung, kidney, and cornea (25Colombatti A. Bressan G.M. Volpin D. Castellani I. Coll. Relat. Res. 1985; 5: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 26Colombatti A. Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Volpin D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Colombatti A. Poletti A. Bressan G.M. Carbone A. Volpin D. Coll. Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140 diverges in domain architecture from EMILIN-1 and multimerin by a short cluster of charged amino acids located in the transition between the coiled-coil and the C1q-like domains. EMILIN-1 shows two leucine zipper motifs followed by a collagenous domain at this position, and multimerin contains an EGF-like domain instead. This region is dominated by basic amino acids (10 of 27 residues) arranged in a sequence similar to consensus motifs found in heparin binding proteins, such as von Willebrand factor (28Sobel M. Soler D.F. Kermode J.C. Harris R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8857-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are known to be important for ionic interactions with glucosaminoglycans, such as heparin and heparan sulfate (14Hileman R.E.

Because glucosaminoglycans provide antithrombotic activities to endothelium through activation of the coagulation protease inhibitor ATIII, it will be interesting to test whether EndoGlyx-1 is capable of recruiting glucosaminoglycans or related structures to the endothelial cell surface. The molecular organization of EMILINs and multimerin is highly characteristic; both form homotrimers and larger homomultimers via interchain disulfide bonds, giving rise in the case of EMILINs to high molecular aggregates deposited as a fine network in the extracellular matrix (29Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17534-17540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas multimerin oligomers assembled from a precursor protein, prepromultimerin, are stored in secretory granules of platelets and endothelium (24Hayward C.P. Song Z. Zheng S. Fung R. Pai M. Masse J.M. Cramer E.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1337-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exploiting the yeast two-hybrid system with EMILIN-1 indicates that trimerization is initiated by the C1q-like domain followed by a subsequent quarternary assembly mediated by intermolecular disulfide bridges, which was further supported by the fact that a deletion mutant of EMILIN-1, lacking the C1q-like domain, was incapable in multimer formation (21Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Bot S. Mucignat M.T. Giacomello E. Doliana R. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25471-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our analysis shows that the C-terminal portion of EndoGlyx-1 p125/140 consists of an C1q-like domain homologous to EMILIN-1 and multimerin, with 26 and 32% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, which is in accordance with the oligomerization of the different EndoGlyx-1 subunits mediated by intermolecular disulfide bridges. Analysis of tryptic peptides revealed that the p125 and p140 species originate from the same EndoGlyx-1 mRNA precursor. A likely explanation for the difference in molecular mass of the p125 and p140 subunits is proteolytic processing, as has been shown for platelet multimerin, which, expressed as a 170-kDa glycosylated precursor protein form, is proteolytically converted into a stable 155-kDa protein subunit (30Hayward C.P. Warkentin T.E. Horsewood P. Kelton J.G. Blood. 1991; 77: 2556-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hayward C.P. Bainton D.F. Smith J.W. Horsewood P. Stead R.H. Podor T.J. Warkentin T.E. Kelton J.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The size difference of the p125 and p140 polypeptide backbone is further supported by enzymatic removal ofN- and O-linked carbohydrates, which resulted in an almost identical reduction in the molecular mass of both species excluding the possibility of a differentially glycosylated common core protein. Because sequence analysis of EndoGlyx-1 p125/p140 cDNA revealed no potential motif for membrane localization, cell surface exposure on endothelium is putatively mediated through association with a plasma membrane-bound and cell surface exposed molecular species. In this context, the as yet unidentified and cell surface exposed subunits p110 and p200 of EndoGlyx-1 are potential candidates for membrane targeting of the complex. However, how the four identified covalently linked subunits contribute to the molecular composition of the individual EndoGlyx-1 complexes awaits elucidation. In conclusion, the surprisingly restricted tissue distribution and unique domain architecture of EndoGlyx-1 implies a potentially important role in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, or hemostasis. Future investigations focusing on the biological function will benefit from availability of mAb H572 and recombinant EndoGlyx-1 protein.

Although direct interactions between several endocytic sequences and the medium chain and endocytic clathrin adaptor complexes have been shown by protein-protein interaction assays, whether all these interactions occur in vivo or are physiologically important has not always been addressed. Here we show, using bothin vitro and in vivo assays, a physiologically relevant interaction between CFTR and the μ subunit of AP-2. Cross-linking experiments were performed using photoreactive peptides containing the YDSI motif and purified adaptor complexes. CFTR peptides cross-linked a 50-kDa subunit of purified AP-2 complexes, the apparent molecular mass of μ2. Furthermore, isolated μ2 bound to the sorting motif, YDSI, both in cross-linking experiments and glutathioneS-transferase pull-down experiments, confirming that μ2 mediates the interaction between CFTR and AP-2 complexes. Inducible overexpression of dominant-negative μ2 in HeLa cells results in AP-2 complexes that fail to interact with CFTR. Moreover, internalization of CFTR in mutant cells is greatly reduced compared with wild type HeLa cells. These results indicate that the AP-2 endocytic complex selectively interacts with the conserved tyrosine-based internalization signal in the carboxyl terminus of CFTR, YDSI. Furthermore, this interaction is mediated by the μ2 subunit of AP-2 and mutations in μ2 that block its interaction with YDSI inhibit the incorporation of CFTR into the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway.

Morphological, biochemical, and functional evidence indicates that, in addition to a cell surface localization, CFTR is also found in endosomal and recycling compartments. The presence of CFTR within endosomes was demonstrated functionally in several cell lines expressing endogenous and exogenous CFTR. Thus, PKA stimulated an anion conductance in isolated as well as in situ endosomes, a conductance that was susceptible to inhibition by monoclonal anti-CFTR antibodies (7Lukacs G.L. Chang X.B.

In addition, immunocytochemistry at the light microscopy level has revealed co-localization of CFTR with rab4, a member of the small GTP-binding protein family, and a component of recycling endosomes (8Webster P.

Compelling evidence indicates that CFTR enters endosomal compartments through the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway (9Prince L.S. Workman R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Clathrin-mediated internalization of integral membrane proteins relies on the presence of relatively short peptide sequences within their cytosolic tails. Although heterogeneous, most sorting signals fall into two main classes (14Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

The first class is characterized by an essential tyrosine residue, either as part of an NPX Y motif (as initially identified in the low density lipoprotein receptor), or in the context of aY XXΦ motif, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid). The second class of internalization motifs typically contains a dileucine sequence, although in some cases one of the leucines may be replaced by an isoleucine, valine, alanine, or methionine. Such endocytic sorting signals have been most extensively studied in type I and type II membrane proteins. Depending upon the precise context of the sorting signal, such motifs can be also recognized in sorting events within thetrans-Golgi network as well as endosomes (18Honing S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Clathrin adaptor complexes (APs) have been obvious candidates to recognize sorting signals and to act as adaptors between integral membrane proteins and the clathrin lattice. However, in only a very few cases have membrane proteins and adaptors co-immunoprecipitated (20Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Several in vitro assays, including bead pull-down and surface plasmon resonance, had shown interaction between tyrosine-based sorting signals and clathrin adaptor complexes (21Ohno H. Stewart J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), yet surprisingly few data are available concerning whether such interactions occur in vivo or are physiologically important. Although a direct interaction between YXXΦ internalization sequences and μ2 subunits has been demonstrated, the binding of receptors to AP-2 does not necessarily correlate with the internalization capacity of proteins bearing YXXΦ motifs. For example, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor strongly binds AP-2 through a YRAL sequence (26Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the YRAL sequence that abolish the interaction of the EGF receptor with AP-2 do not significantly affect internalization of the receptor (26Sorkin A. Mazzotti M. Sorkina T. Scotto L. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13377-13384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, transferrin receptors whose endocytic removal from the plasma membrane shows a strong dependence upon a YTRF motif (28Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), show very weak, if any, detectable interaction with the AP-2 endocytic adaptor complex (21Ohno H. Stewart J.

In addition, although direct interaction between tyrosine-based sequences and the μ subunit of the endocytic adaptor complex AP-2 have been demonstrated by several types of protein-protein interaction assays (21Ohno H.

Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), a recent report suggests that the NPXY motif binds directly to the terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain rather than directly to AP-2 (30Kibbey R.G. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to the many studies on endocytic signals in type I and II membrane proteins, relatively little is known about the endocytic signals in polytopic membrane proteins such as transporters and ion channels. The β2-adrenergic receptor contains a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr326) that is responsible for the ligand-induced internalization of the receptor (31Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT4, the insulin-responsive sodium-glucose co-transporter, is constitutively retrieved from the plasma membrane via clathrin-mediated pathways in the absence of insulin and contains a leucine endosomal targeting signal (32Garippa R.J. Johnson A. Park J. Petrush R.L. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20660-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, a tyrosine (Tyr1424)-based motif was identified as a potential endocytic targeting signal in the carboxyl cytoplasmic tail of CFTR (10Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L.

Mutation of this sequence, either in the context of a chimera consisting of transferrin receptor and the carboxyl-terminal tail of CFTR (10Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F.

Methods in Molecular Medicine. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ2001Google Scholar), inhibits the retrieval of CFTR from the plasma membrane. Thus although AP-2 adaptors, and their medium chain subunits, have been implicated in the recruitment of several type of plasma membrane proteins into the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, the molecular details and the physiological significance of such interactions are poorly understood. Moreover, such information is completely lacking for ion channels. We have used both in vitro protein-protein interaction studies and in vivostudies with inducible dominant-negative μ2 to investigate the interaction of adaptor complexes with the tyrosine endocytic sequence of a clinically important ion channel, CFTR. The analyses of in vitro binding and endocytic trafficking reveal, for the first time in a polytopic ion channel, a unified model for CFTR endocytosis showing a strong correlation between in vitro binding of CFTR to μ2 and its endocytic capacity.

Peptides (KVIEENKVRQYDSIQ) were coupled via their amino-terminal biotin moiety to an SA5 sensor chip (streptavidin surface) according the manufacturer's instructions. All binding studies were performed with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Purified adaptor and clathrin preparations were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 30 min prior to the experiment to remove potential aggregates. Adaptors and clathrin were used at 100 nm unless otherwise noted. A short pulse injection (15 s) of 20 mm NaOH, 0.5% SDS was used to regenerate the sensor chip surface after each experiment. The peptide-derivatized sensor chip remained stable and retained its specific binding capacity throughout the experiments.

AP concentrations ranging between 0.13 and 0.6 mg/ml were incubated with 0.2 μm photoreactive peptides. For competition experiments, peptides YQRL, ADSA, or YDSI were included at a final concentration of 200 μm. Cross-linking experiments were carried out in microtiter plates in a final volume of 20 μl. Plates were incubated on ice for 30 min in the dark. Samples were irradiated at 80,000 μJ/cm2 to cross-link samples. Following irradiation, 5 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer was added to the samples and boiled for 5 min. To identify the AP protein chains that were cross-linked to the biotinylated peptide, an aliquot of the cross-linking reaction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Following blocking (10 mmTris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 10% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was rinsed in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated for 30 min with streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 5 μl/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in blocking buffer. The membrane was then washed six times for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline plus Tween and processed for ECL using SuperSignal West Pico ECL reagent (Pierce). For recapturing experiments, AP complexes were photolabeled with *YSDI peptides and AP complexes were immunoprecipitated with AC1-M11 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in RIPA (1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1% BSA), supplemented with Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). Samples were resuspended in SDS buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol). Samples were shaken vigorously for 20 min at 4 °C and boiled for 5 min to release the immunoprecipitates from the antibodies and to denature the AP complex. The extract was diluted 20-fold with RIPA, clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h with one of the following antibodies (anti-α, anti-β1/β2, or anti-μ). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with RIPA and once with RIPA minus detergent. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using streptavidin-HRP as described above. HeLa cell lines expressing hemagglutinin-tagged D176A/W421A mutant μ2 constructs under control of the tetracycline-off system were kindly provided by Dr. A. Sorkin. The HeLa cell line has been characterized previously and expresses an epitope-tagged μ2 containing mutations at Asp-176 and Trp-421 under control of the Tet-Off system. Studies in this cell line demonstrate that mutant hemagglutinin-μ2 incorporates into AP-2 and is targeted to coated pits. Inducible overexpression of the mutant μ2 resulted in the replacement of endogenous wild type μ2 in AP-2 complexes and the complete abrogation of AP-2 interactions with tyrosine-based internalization motifs (40Nesterov A. Carter R.E. Sorkina T. Gill G.N. Sorkin A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 400 μg/ml G418, 200 ng/ml puromycin, and 2 ng/ml doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative. For experiments, cells were plated in the growth medium without selection markers with or without doxycycline. At 24 h after plating, medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without doxycycline; cells without doxycycline were supplemented with 2 mm sodium butyrate to ensure high levels of hemagglutinin-μ2 protein expression to replace the endogenous wild type μ2 in AP-2 complexes. Experiments were performed 3–4 days after plating. For transient transfections cells were plated at 50–60% confluence as outlined above. 48 h after plating, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 CFTR plasmids using the LipofectAMINE 2000™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were used 48 h after transfection. HeLa cells cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline were washed with PBS to remove media and to cool the cells. Cells were lysed in TGH buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA), supplemented with Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material and aggregates were removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 125,000 × g. Glutathione-Sepharose, loaded with 20 μg of GST or GST-CT, was incubated with HeLa lysates for 3 h to overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with TGH and once with HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2)). Beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for immunoblot according to standard protocols. Detection of bound primary monoclonal antibodies was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using SuperSignal® West Pico reagents (Pierce). pcDNA 3.1 constructs containing wild type or D176A/W421A μ2 were translated at 30 °C for 1.5 h in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT coupled protein translation kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to pull-down experiments, 10% of the translation was reserved for SDS-PAGE analysis. For each pull-down experiment, 45 μl of the translation was diluted into 1 ml of TGH buffer and cleared by centrifugation for 45 min at 125,000 × g. 20 μg of GST-CT, GST-P6, GST-P9, and GST preabsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with TGH diluted translation products for 3 h to overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with TGH buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 de3pLysS strain. Protein expression was induced by 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h, and GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells grown on glass coverslips were cooled to 4 °C for 15 min and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells transiently expressing CFTR were incubated with polyclonal anti-CFTR antibodies diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then rapidly warmed to 37 °C with pre-warmed media and incubated for 15 min in a 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2. Cells were immediately cooled to 4 °C with PBS-containing 1% BSA and kept on ice. The cell surface was labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to rhodamine (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 h. The cells were washed and subsequently mounted onto glass slides using Gelvatol. Confocal microscopy was performed on a TCS confocal microscope equipped with krypton, argon, and helium-neo"

Heat shock is a well known transcriptional activator of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR). We report here that mutations or deletions of the LTR κB sites impaired the LTR transcriptional activation by heat shock. Further analysis revealed that, during heat shock recovery, the NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits migrated into the nucleus of HeLa cells, bound to DNA, and induced κB-dependent reporter gene expression. This NF-κB activation did not depend on new transcriptional and/or translational events and on the pro-oxidant state generated by heat shock. It was not concomitant with IκBα phosphorylation and was not abolished by the expression of IκB kinase or IκBα dominant-negative mutants. Moreover, NF-κB activation and migration into the nucleus were not concomitant with IκBα/β or p105 degradation. However, during heat shock recovery, NF-κB was dissociated from its complexing partners, allowing its migration into the nucleus. Hence, we describe here a novel mechanism for activation of NF-κB based on the thermolability of the NF-κB·IκB complex.

AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The progression of the disease induced by HIV-1 infection is directly correlated with the level of expression of HIV-1 RNA (10Bagnarelli P. Menzo S. Valenza A. Manzin A. Giacca M. Ancarani F.

Nature. 1993; 362: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Hence, modulation of HIV-1 LTR activity is a key element in the development of the disease. The HIV-1 promoter contains binding sites for many transcription factors such as NF-κB, SP1, upstream stimulatory factor, and AP1 and therefore confers on the virus the possibility of being activated or reactivated by many stimuli (13Steffy K. Wong-Staal F. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Garcia J.A. Gaynor R.B. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Graham G.J. Maio J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5245-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), co-infection by other viruses (1Gendelman H.E. Phelps W. Feigenbaum L. Ostrove J.M. Adachi A.

If, for oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), the intervention of the transcription factor NF-κB in the transcriptional activation of the LTR was clearly demonstrated (16Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.-A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar), the mechanism regulating the thermal activation of this promoter is still unknown. Heat shock generates abnormally folded proteins. As a consequence, the expression of most genes is inhibited, whereas a small set of genes (the heat shock genes) are preferentially transcribed. Heat shock genes encode heat shock or stress proteins that can protect cells from thermally induced injuries. Indeed, heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones that help the cells to cope with aberrant protein folding and, as a consequence, help the cell to recover from thermal damage (20Burel C. Mezger V. Pinto M. Rallu M. Trigon S. Morange M. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several studies suggested that a modification of the redox state homeostasis and particularly of the non-protein thiols such as glutathione could be involved in the heat stress signal transduction pathway that activates heat shock protein synthesis (21Zou J.

Indeed, hydrogen peroxide treatment can induce, in vitro and in vivo, heat shock gene transcription (25Becker J. Mezger V. Courgeon A.M. Best-Belpomme M. Eur. J.

Of interest, amino acid analogs, which are powerful agents that disrupt protein folding, are able to induce NF-κB activation (2Kretz-Remy C. Bates E.E.M. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3180-3191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This observation, together with the fact that NF-κB activation is under the control of the intracellular redox state (29Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 30Arrigo A.-P. Kretz-Remy C. Halliwell B. Aruoma O. Free Radicals and the Molecular Biology of Human Diseases. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 183-216Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate the mechanism of NF-κB activation by heat shock. NF-κB belongs to the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors that includes many proteins conserved from Drosophila to humans. It controls a variety of physiological aspects of immune, inflammatory, viral, and stress responses (31Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a heterodimeric (p65/p50) inducible factor whose regulation is centered around nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. Indeed, the transcription factor is retained in a latent form in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells by inhibitory molecules called IκB subunits (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε or p50 and p52 precursors called p105 and p100, respectively) (32Baeuerle P.-A.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). IκB subunits inhibit NF-κB by masking its nuclear localization signal, thereby causing its cytoplasmic retention and blocking both its DNA binding and transactivation ability (36Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 37Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell.

Migration of NF-κB into the nucleus requires cytoplasmic NF-κB·IκB complex disruption. Most NF-κB inducers such as inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α), phorbol esters (e.g. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), pathogenic agents, and oxidative stress (31Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar) act via a common pathway based on the phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκB proteins, which was first described with the best studied and major IκB protein, IκBα.

Following IκBα degradation, NF-κB migrates into the nucleus as an active factor and induces transcription of κB-containing genes such as the IκBα gene. Newly synthesized IκBα enters the nucleus, removes NF-κB dimers from DNA, and causes their exportin-mediated transport to the cytoplasm (49Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D.

Activation of NF-κB in response to UV radiation or amino acid analog treatment depends on IκBα degradation, but without its prior phosphorylation (2Kretz-Remy C. Bates E.E.M. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol.

In contrast, anoxia stimulates IκBα Tyr42phosphorylation, a phenomenon that leads to p65/p50 release from the NF-κB·IκBα complex (53Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.-M.

We report here that heat shock induces the transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR through a mechanism that is NF-κB-dependent. NF-κB activation that occurs during the heat shock recovery period differs from the universal pathway of NF-κB activation since it does not involve any prior phosphorylation or degradation step of IκB subunits. Moreover, this phenomenon does not require new transcriptional and/or translational events and is a redox-independent process. During heat shock recovery, we observed a dissociation of NF-κB from its complexing partners, allowing NF-κB to migrate into the nucleus. This new mechanism of NF-κB activation is characterized by the thermolability of the NF-κB·IκB complex. HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For heat shock treatments, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC),N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), hydrogen peroxide, and type B gelatin were from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).

Anti-IκBα/MAD-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a full-length recombinant protein of human IκBα. Rabbit anti-p65 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) is directed against the 13 C-terminal amino acids of the p65 subunit of human NF-κB. The wild-type HIV LTR-Cat plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. F. Arenzana-Seisdedos (Pasteur Institute, Paris, France). It is composed of a 719-base pair XhoI-HindIII fragment containing the HIV-1 LTR (from the pBenn-Cat plasmid (1Gendelman H.E. Phelps W. Feigenbaum L. Ostrove J.M. Adachi A. Howley P.M. Khoury G.

These mutants were produced by megaprimer polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (3Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The pLTR-Cat-NcoI plasmid is a mutation of the pLTR-Cat-wt plasmid in which the κB sites and the three SP1 sites of the LTR were spaced out by the insertion of a 4-nucleotide sequence (CCAT). The p2xκB-37TKcat vector, which is composed of two κB sites in front of a cat reporter gene, has already been described (2Kretz-Remy C. Bates E.E.M. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol.

The expression of pLXSN-IκBαM leads to a dominant-negative mutant of IκBα in which the N-terminal (Ser32 and Ser36) and C-terminal (Ser283, Ser288, Ser291, Ser293, and Ser296) serine phosphorylation sites are mutated to alanines (7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded the day before transfection at a density of 2 × 106cells/100-mm dishes. The cells were then transfected with 11 μg of the desired plasmids according to the LipofectAMINETMreagent procedure (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy Pontoise, France). The lipid·DNA complex was applied to the cultured cells over 4 h. Two h later, cells were trypsinized and replated onto five or six 60-mm dishes. After 12 h, the cells were submitted to various heat, hydrogen peroxide, or TNF-α treatments and harvested after a 24-h recovery period. The transfected cells were then lysed, and 50 μg of total cellular proteins were analyzed using the CAT/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with 0.1% type B gelatin. Twenty h later, the cells were submitted to various heat treatments at 43 °C, followed or not by a recovery period at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 90 s with cold methanol. Anti-p65 antibody was diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Organon Teknica-Cappel, Fresnes, France) was used as a second antibody. The stained cells were observed and photographed with a Zeiss Axioskop photomicroscope. Fluorescent images were recorded on Tri-X Pan film (Eastman Kodak Co.). NF-κB binding to κB sites was assessed using the Trans-AMTM NF-κB p65 transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium). In this assay, an oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus site is attached to a 96-well plate. The active form of NF-κB contained in cell extracts specifically binds to this oligonucleotide and can be revealed by incubation with antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology with absorbance reading. In our study, HeLa cells were submitted to various heat treatments. Thereafter, whole cell extracts were prepared, and 10 μg of total cellular proteins were analyzed for p65 binding to κB oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Note that for whole cell extract preparation, a sonication step of 20 s was added after the 10-min incubation time in lysis buffer. Specificity of the assay was monitored by competition with free wild-type κB consensus oligonucleotide or mutated κB consensus oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's instructions. Acrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described (2Kretz-Remy C. Bates E.E.M. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3180-3191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of IPP 150 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and 20 μl of cØmpleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were lysed by repeated freezing-thawing (three times). After centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 × g, the supernatant was incubated for 3 h on ice with 1 μg of nonimmune or anti-IκBα serum (for p65/IκBα co-immunoprecipitation) or with 3 μg of nonimmune or anti-p65 serum (for p65/p100 co-immunoprecipitation). The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose with constant agitation at 4 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, the protein A immunocomplexes were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min, washed several times with cold IPP 150 buffer, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. After removal of protein A-Sepharose by centrifugation, samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with either anti-p65 or anti-p100 antibody. Cells (2 × 107) were resuspended in 1 ml of IPP 150 buffer and lysed by repeated freezing-thawing (three times). After a 10-min centrifugation at 4000 × g, the supernatant was applied to a Sepharose 6B gel filtration column (1 × 100 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ullis, France) equilibrated and developed in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The fractions eluted from the column were analyzed by immunoblotting. Molecular mass markers (Sigma) that were used to calibrate the gel filtration column included dextran blue (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). ROS detection was performed by ethidium bromide fluorescence as already described (8Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.-P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 × 106 cells pretreated or not with PDTC or NAC were submitted to various heat treatments. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 μg/ml hydroethydine, the sodium borohydride-reduced form of ethidium bromide. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France) using a 488-nm excitation wavelength. The emission filter was 610 nm for oxidized hydroethydine fluorescence. We previously reported that the HIV-1 LTR was transcriptionally activated in response to heat shock (19Kretz-Remy C. Arrigo A.-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the mechanism regulating this thermal activation remained obscure. To unravel the molecular mechanism of this activation, we tested the heat-induced transcriptional activity of the wild-type or κB-deleted HIV-1 LTR. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type HIV LTR-Cat or (ΔκB)HIV LTR-Cat plasmid and thereafter submitted to 90-min heat shock treatments performed at temperatures ranging from 41 to 44 °C. In these experiments, the transfection efficiency (determined in a parallel transfection using the β-galactosidase gene-bearing plasmid pCMVβ) was ∼90%. By quantifying the level of CAT polypeptide produced, we observed that up to 43 °C, the different heat shock treatments stimulated the transcriptional activity of the wild-type HIV-1 LTR (Fig. 1,A–D). At 44 °C, a drastic decrease in CAT polypeptide production was observed. In contrast, deletion of the two κB sites of the HIV-1 LTR completely abolished HIV-1 LTR activation by heat shock (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that the HIV-1 LTR transcriptional response to a heat stress is κB site-dependent. We therefore investigated the effect of different nucleotide variations in the sequence of the two κB sites present in the HIV-1 LTR. The κB consensus sequence (5′-GGGA(N/N)YYCC-3′) is highly conserved. However, small nucleotide variations have been described to occur preferentially at the level of the 4 central nucleotides (54Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The pLTR-Cat-PstI mutant (Fig. 1 E) was constructed by modifying the most conserved 5′-nucleotides (GG) of the κB sites with CA nucleotides. These mutations have been described to impair the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR after UV irradiation or mitogen treatment (55Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 56Stein B. Kramer M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ponta H. Herlich P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4540-4543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the pLTR-Cat-EcoRI mutant, the two κB sites were transformed into palindromic κB sites (Fig.1 E), a situation that is suspected to improve the activity of NF-κB (54Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 57Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These constructions were transfected into HeLa cells, which were submitted thereafter to heat shock treatments. A complete impairment of the HIV-1 LTR response to heat shock was obtained in the case of pLTR-Cat-PstI (Fig. 1 B), as was obtained with the κB-deleted vector (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that κB sites are indispensable for HIV-1 LTR activation by heat shock. The pattern of pLTR-Cat-EcoRI activation by heat shock was similar to that obtained with the wild-type LTR (Fig. 1 C), except that the maximal degree of activation was increased by 2-fold in comparison with the maximal degree of activation of the wild-type LTR. Therefore, palindromic κB sites seem to enhance NF-κB transactivation ability. We then assessed whether cooperation between SP1 and NF-κB was involved in the HIV-1 LTR response to heat shock. To this end, the pLTR-Cat-NcoI mutant was constructed, in which the κB and SP1 sites were spaced out by the insertion of a 4-nucleotide sequence so that NF-κB and SP1 are located on opposite sides of the DNA helix (Fig. 1 E). We observed that the pLTR-Cat-NcoI response to heat shock was similar to that of the wild-type LTR (Fig.1 D). Therefore, cooperation between the κB and SP1 sites is not necessary for HIV-1 LTR activation by heat shock. Taken together, these results indicate an intervention of κB sites in HIV-1 LTR activation by heat shock since the different modifications of κB sites we have tested modulate the HIV-1 LTR response to heat shock. Based on the results presented above, we analyzed whether heat shock was able to activate the NF-κB transcription factor itself. To this end, we looked for indices of NF-κB activation such as NF-κB migration into the nucleus or binding to DNA, transactivation of κB-dependent reporter genes, and IκBα degradation. The nuclear redistribution of NF-κB subunits was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. We observed that, during heat shock, HeLa cells became rounded and that the cytoplasmic distribution of the p65/RelA subunit was not modified. In contrast, after 1–5 h of heat shock recovery at 37 °C, the p65 subunit of NF-κB redistributed into the nucleus of the cells (Fig.2 A). The same results were obtained with an antibody raised against the p50 subunit of NF-κB (data not shown). This experiment showed that heat shock induces the migration of NF-κB into the nucleus, but this event seems to solely occur during the recovery period after a heat stress. We then quantified NF-κB binding to DNA in HeLa cells submitted to heat shock treatments. We observed that p65 binding to κB sites was detectable during the first hour of heat shock recovery and increased up to 5 h of recovery at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B). Specificity of p65 binding was tested by competition with free κB oligonucleotide. Wild-type oligonucleotide competed efficiently for p65 binding after 5 h of heat shock recovery (R5 + κB), whereas mutated κB oligonucleotide had no effect (R5 + mut κB). Monitoring of NF-κB binding to DNA was also performed in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D or 20 μg/ml cycloheximide added 5 min before heat shock treatment. These drug concentrations efficiently blocked transcription and translation, respectively (data not"

In this study we identified the epitopes of three PAI-1 inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MA-44E4, MA-42A2F6, and MA-56A7C10). Differential cross-reactivities of these monoclonals with PAI-1 from different species and sequence alignments between these PAI-1s, combined with the three-dimensional structure, revealed several charged residues as possible candidates to contribute to the respective epitopes. The production, characterization, and subsequent evaluation of a variety of alanine mutants using surface plasmon resonance revealed that the residues His185, Arg186, and Arg187 formed the major sites of interaction for MA-44E4. In contrast, the epitopes of MA-42A2F6 and MA-56A7C10 were found to be conformational. The epitope of MA-42A2F6 comprises residues Lys243 and Glu350, whereas the epitope of MA-56A7C10 comprises residues Glu242, Lys243, Glu244, Glu350, Asp355, and Arg356.

The u-PA-inhibiting effect of PAI-1 has its main physiological implications in processes outside of the circulation (10Blasi F. Thromb.

PAI-1 is a unique serpin because of its functional and conformational flexibility (12Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PAI-1, synthesized as an active molecule, converts spontaneously into a nonreactive, latent form, which can be partially reactivated by denaturing reagents (13Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol.

Additionally, a third distinct, noninhibitory form (substrate) is identified that is reactive toward its target proteinases without the formation of a stable complex (14Declerck P.J. De Mol M.

The C-terminal side of the reactive site loop (P4′-P13′) forms strand s1C in β-sheet C. Conversion to the latent state implies the insertion of the N-terminal side of the reactive site loop into β-sheet A, the loss of strand s1C from β-sheet C, and the formation of an unusual extended loop by the C-terminal side of the reactive site loop, resulting in the distortion of the P1-P1′ “bait” peptide bond (19Mottonen J.

It is hypothesized that the active-to-latent conversion involves the movement of the C-terminal side of the reactive site loop through a gap formed by two surface-exposed loops, i.e. loop 1 (residues 185–200, connecting strand s4C with s3C) and loop 2 (residues 242–246, connecting strand s3B with helix hG) (19Mottonen J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), has been assumed to contribute to the mobility of the reactive site loop in PAI-1. Previously, we have characterized a panel of monoclonal antibodies with PAI-1 inhibitory properties (23Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Bijnens A.P. Ngo T.H. Gils A. Dewaele J. Knockaert I. Stassen J.M. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For MA-44E4 the major interaction sites were suggested to be located within a segment from residue 81 to 187 comprising helices hD, hE, and hF, β-strands s1A, s2A, s3A, and s4C and the loops connecting these elements. The major determinants for the binding of MA-42A2F6 and MA-56A7C10 were suggested to be located C-terminal from residue 327 in a region containing the reactive site loop. In the present study, the evaluation of the differential reactivity of these PAI-1 inhibitory monoclonal antibodies with PAI-1 from different species and in various conformations, in combination with sequence alignments and the analysis of the three-dimensional structure of PAI-1, is used to identify the major residues involved in the binding of these inhibitory antibodies. In addition, alanine-scanning mutagenesis is used to confirm the contribution of surface-exposed charged residues located in the vicinity of or comprising residues in the distal hinge of the reactive site loop. Even though the possible contribution of other noncharged residues cannot be excluded when using this approach, it is generally accepted that charged residues form the major interaction sites governing the specificity of the interaction between an antigen and an antibody (25Greenspan N.S. Di C.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 936-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The localization of two previously unknown epitopes reveals new target regions to modulate PAI-1 activity. Furthermore, the localization of the epitopes of MA-42A2F6 and MA-56A7C10 forms a molecular explanation for the differential reactivity of these antibodies with the different conformations of PAI-1.

The murine monoclonal antibodies MA-42A2F6, MA-44E4, and MA-56A7C10, directed against human PAI-1 (humPAI-1), were produced and purified as described previously (23Debrock S. Declerck P.J. Biochim.

DNA manipulation techniques were carried out according to standard procedures and following the instructions of the manufacturers. Plasmid DNA was isolated using Nucleobond® cartridges (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany), DNA fragments were purified using the QIAquick®gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and PCR was performed using the GeneAmp® 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA was sequenced with the Autoread Sequencing®kit and the Automated Laser Fluorescent ALF® apparatus (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

PCR was performed using 2.5 units of PfuTurbo™ DNA polymerase, 50 ng of template, 125 ng of each primer, and 0.2 nmol of each dNTP in 50 μl of buffer containing 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. After an initial DNA denaturation step (95 °C, 30 s), 16 PCR cycles were performed (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 60 s; 68 °C, 12 min). Subsequently, DNA was subjected to a DpnI digestion prior to transformation of DH1λ E. coli. For all mutants, large scale DNA preparations were made, and the PAI-1 encoding region was sequenced entirely. PAI-1-wt and PAI-1 mutants were expressed in MC1061E. coli cells using a method described previously (26Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, competent MC1061 cells were cotransformed with pAcI and either pIGE20-PAI-1-wt or one of the pIGE20-PAI-1 mutant constructs. Clonal isolates were grown and PAI-1 expression was induced by increasing the temperature to 42 °C. After 3 h cells were harvested and disrupted by pressure. The cell lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation, and the PAI-1 containing supernatant was collected and immediately subjected to purification as described previously (30Bijnens A.P. Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Stassen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6375-6380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After evaluation of PAI-1 content and purity, PAI-1-containing elution fractions were examined for their inhibitory activity toward t-PA by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing the highest proportion of functionally active PAI-1 were pooled and used for further experiments. Samples of PAI-1-wt and PAI-1 mutants were diluted on ice to a final PAI-1 protein concentration between 60 and 360 μg/ml with the appropriate diluent to obtain a buffered solution with 0.045 m KH2PO4-NaHPO4, 70 mm NaCl, pH 7.2–7.4. To determine the functional distribution, aliquots were incubated immediately with a 2-fold molar excess of t-PA at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–15% gels followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Quantitation of the formed reaction products (complexed, nonreactive, and cleaved, corresponding to the presence of active, latent, and substrate conformation, respectively) was done by densitometric scanning of the gels using the Imagemaster®system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (26Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Residual PAI-1 activity was quantitated (31Verheijen J.H. Chang G.T. Kluft C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 51: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) after preincubation of human PAI-1 with monoclonal antibody. Briefly, 100 μl of PAI-1 (50 ng/ml with an activity of 80% of the theoretical maximal value) was incubated with 100 μl of serial 2-fold dilutions of the antibodies (MA-44E4, MA-42A2F6, and MA-56A7C10) ranging from 0.125- to 16-fold molar excess over total PAI-1. The reaction mixture was allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature. 50-μl samples of this reaction mixture were incubated with 50 μl of t-PA (20 IU/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min in the wells of a microtiter plate. Then, 100 μl of a solution containing plasminogen (1 μm), CNBr-digested fibrinogen (1 μm), and S-2403 (0.6 mm) was added. The residual plasminogen activator activity was measured by recording the absorbance change at 405 nm. 100% PAI-1 activity was defined as the PAI-1 activity observed in the absence of monoclonal antibody. The percentage inhibition by the monoclonal antibody was then calculated from the residual PAI-1 activity measured in the presence of the monoclonal antibody. PAI-1 was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with either phosphate-buffered saline or a 3-fold molar excess of monoclonal antibody. The samples were further incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of t-PA for 2 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS (final concentration of 1%) and heating for 30 s at 100 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–15% gels followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Quantitation of the formed reaction products (complexed, nonreactive, and cleaved, corresponding to the presence of active, nonreactive, and substrate conformation, respectively) was done by densitometric scanning of the gels using the Imagemaster®system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (26Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Affinity constants for the binding between monoclonal antibodies and PAI-1-wt and PAI-1 mutants were determined using the BIAcore™ 3000 analytical system equipped with the CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB) as described previously (32Jönsson U. Malmqvist M. Turner A. Advances in Biosensors. JAI Press, London1992: 291-336Google Scholar). In brief, the monoclonal antibodies were coupled covalently to 2000 resonance units (using a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5) using the automatic Wizard mode. Subsequently, PAI-1 variants diluted in 0.01 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0,005% Tween 20, pH 7.4 to a final PAI-1 antigen concentration ranging from 18 to 1200 nm were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min (injection volume is 40 μl). After each cycle the chip was regenerated using 10 μl of a 15 mm HCl solution. The analyses of the association and dissociation phases were made with the software of the BIAcore™ 3000 (Langmuir binding, local, or global fit). Isolation of the latent and substrate conformation of PAI-1-wt was performed as described previously (14Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Vaughan D.E. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11693-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, active PAI-1-wt was converted into the latent form by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. To separate the latent from the substrate conformation, the inactivated sample was applied to immobilized t-PA-S478A; the nonbinding fraction (i.e. the latent conformation) was collected, and bound PAI-1 (i.e. the substrate conformation) was eluted using a 0.1 m acetate buffer containing 2 mm glutathione and 1.5 m NaCl, pH 5.5. The displacement ofp-aminobenzamidine (PAB), a fluorescent probe inhibitor of serine proteinases (33Evans S.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3014-3017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to determine the effect of monoclonal antibody binding on formation of the initial PAI-1-proteinase complexes. u-PA (0.08–0.22 μm) or t-PA (0.15–1.1 μm) were preincubated with PAB (100 and 180–400 μm, respectively) for 10 min at 25 °C in 0.1m Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl. PAI-1 (1.6 μm) or its complex with each monoclonal antibody, when reacted with the PAB-proteinase complex, causes a decrease in fluorescence emission of the PAB because of its displacement from the active site of the enzyme (34Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14895Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out using an SX-18MV microvolume stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) equipped with a fluorescence detector or an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter for slower reactions. Excitation wavelengths were 320 and 330 nm for u-PA and t-PA, respectively. Progress of the PAI-1-proteinase reaction was monitored by changes in the fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm for u-PA and 375 nm for t-PA in the SLM 8000 or through 335 nm cutoff filter in the stopped-flow instrument. Data were analyzed by fitting to a single exponential process from which the values ofkobs were calculated. The second order rate constants (k1) for binding of u-PA and t-PA to PAI-1 were determined from the slope of the dependence ofkobs on PAI-1 concentration, which equalsk1/(1 + [PAB]/KPAB) (34Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14895Google Scholar), where KPAB is a dissociation constant of the PAB-proteinase complex. The values of KPABhave been determined by fluorescence titration of proteinase with PAB as described previously (34Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14895Google Scholar). The statistical significance of differences was evaluated using Student's t test. The two-tailed p values are indicated where necessary. In a PAI-1 neutralization assay, MA-44E4, MA-42A2F6, and MA-56A7C10 inhibited PAI-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner revealing that MA-56A7C10 is the most potent inhibitor (i.e.80 ± 5% inhibition using a 2-fold molar excess of MAversus 21 ± 6% and 15 ± 6% for MA-42A2F6 and MA-44E4, respectively). At a 128-fold molar excess, PAI-1 inhibition exceeding 85% is observed for all three antibodies. When evaluating the influence of MA-44E4, MA-42A2F6, and MA-56A7C10 on the reaction products generated during interaction between PAI-1 and t-PA, a significant (p < 0.005) transition to a nonreactive form was observed for all three monoclonal antibodies (Table I). Again, MA-56A7C10 was revealed as the most potent inhibitor of PAI-1 activity.Table IFunctional distribution of PAI-1 in the absence (−) or presence of the monoclonal antibodies studied−MA-44E4MA-42A2F6MA-56A7C10Active60 ± 11-aExpressed as percentage of total PAI-1 protein; mean ± S.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19559-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was incubated with these monoclonal antibodies prior to incubation with t-PA, the cleavage of the substrate form was significantly (p < 0.0001) hindered (i.e. 59 ± 0.8, 46 ± 0.9, and 70 ± 0.7% nonreactive material in the presence of MA-44E4, MA-42A2F6, and MA-56A7C10, respectively, versus 14 ± 1.4% nonreactive material in the absence of antibody). MA-44E4 binds human PAI-1 with a KA of 4 × 108m−1 but lacks affinity (i.e. KA at least 400-fold less) for porcine, murine, and rat PAI-1 (Table II). Alignment of the sequence of human PAI-1 between residue 81 and 187, the region previously suggested to harbor the major interaction sites for MA-44E4 (24Bijnens A.P. Ngo T.H. Gils A. Dewaele J. Knockaert I. Stassen J.M. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with the corresponding segment of the latter three species reveals the presence of only two charged residues, i.e.Asp181 and Arg186, that are not conserved in any of the other species. Consequently, we hypothesized that one or both of these residues play an essential role in the interaction between human PAI-1 and MA-44E4.Table IIAffinity constants (KA ) of MA-44E4 and of MA-42A2F6 and MA-56A7C10, combined with the amino acid (AA) sequence alignment between AA81 and AA187 and between AA327 and AA379aThe amino acids are represented using one-letter codes.

The KA values of MA-42A2F6 and MA-56A7C10 for human PAI-1 are 3.8 × 108 and 1.3 × 109m−1, respectively (Table II). The affinity constants of both antibodies for porcine PAI-1 are reduced 6- and 9-fold, respectively, and no binding to murine or rat PAI-1 was observed. In the stretch of residues in human PAI-1 C-terminal from position 327 (24Bijnens A.P. Ngo T.H. Gils A. Dewaele J. Knockaert I. Stassen J.M. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), only one charged amino acid in human PAI-1, Glu350, differs from the corresponding residues in murine and rat PAI-1, whereas it is conserved in porcine PAI-1. Therefore, we hypothesized that Glu350 is involved in the interaction of PAI-1 with MA-42A2F6 and MA-56A7C10. Localization of residues Asp181, Arg186, and Glu350 in the three-dimensional structure of human PAI-1 (17Nar H. Bauer M. Stassen J.M. Lang D. Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reveals that they are all surface-exposed in a region close to or in the distal hinge of the reactive site loop. To investigate whether these residues contribute to the epitope of MA-44E4, MA-42A2F6, or MA-56A7C10, it was decided to produce alanine mutants at these positions (i.e. PAI-1-D181A, Asp181 to Ala; PAI-1-R186A, Arg186 to Ala; PAI-1-E350A, Glu350to Ala). Nine other charged residues (i.e.His185, Arg187, His190, Lys191, Glu242, Lys243, Glu244, Asp355, and Arg356) were found within a radius of 20 Å of the Asp181, Arg186, Glu350 cluster in the three-dimensional structure of active human PAI-1. To study the possible contribution of these residues to the epitopes, the corresponding alanine mutants were generated (PAI-1-H185A, His185 to Ala; PAI-1-R187A, Arg187 to Ala; PAI-1-H190A, His190 to Ala; PAI-1-K191A, Lys191 to Ala;PAI-1-E242A, Lys242to Ala; PAI-1-K243A, Lys243 to Ala; PAI-1-E244A, Glu244 to Ala; PAI-1-D355A, Asp355 to Ala; and PAI-1-R356A, Arg356 to Ala). To further investigate the impact of several alanine substitutions four double mutants (PAI-1-H185A/R186A, PAI-1-R186A/R187A, PAI-1-H190A/K191A, PAI-1-D355A/R356A), two triple mutants (PAI-1-H185A/R186A/R187A, PAI-1-E242A/K243A/E244A), and one quadruple mutant (PAI-1-E242A/K243A/E244A/E350A) were also created, expressed, and isolated. MA-44E4 reacts with active, latent, and substrate conformations of human PAI-1 with comparable affinity (TableIII). For MA-42A2F6 and MA-56A7C10, the affinity constants indicate that both antibodies react preferentially with PAI-1 in the active conformation. The affinity of the latter antibodies for the substrate conformation is reduced 9- and 5-fold, respectively, and the affinity for the latent form is decreased 56- and 25-fold, respectively. For both antibodies the affinity constants for the stable variant is similar to that for human PAI-1.Table IIIAffinity constants of MA-44E4, MA-42A2F6, and MA-56A7C10 for PAI-1 in different conformationsPAI-1 variantKA 3-aMean ± S.D.

We have shown that acute phase protein genes are induced during intestinal acute phase response, and that the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein family of transcription factors are involved. To address the role of specific C/EBP isoforms, we generated IEC-6 rat intestinal epithelial cell lines expressing different C/EBP isoforms, by retroviral infection. Overexpression of C/EBPα p30 and C/EBPδ led to increases in C/EBPβ LAP and C/EBPβ LIP endogenous protein levels, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blot. Inhibition of C/EBP activity with dominant negative C/EBPs (C/EBPβ LIP, 3hF, 4hF) decreased glucocorticoid-, cAMP- and IL-1 responsiveness of the endogenous haptoglobin gene, while overexpression of each C/EBP isoform increased the responsiveness to these regulators. In contrast, dominant negative C/EBPs or C/EBP isoforms did not alter the expression of α-acid glycoprotein in response to dexamethasone and of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in response to various regulators as assessed by Northern blot. These data show that the three C/EBP isoforms are involved in the regulation of haptoglobin and that C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and α-acid glycoprotein expression are not induced by C/EBP isoforms in contrast to other cell types. C/EBPβ LAP-expressing cells showed an inhibition of cell growth characterized by a delay in p27Kip1decrease in response to serum and a decrease in cyclin D isoforms and cyclin E protein levels. Finally, C/EBP isoforms interact with the E2F4 transcription factor. Thus, specific C/EBP isoforms are involved in the differential expression of acute phase protein genes in response to hormones and cytokines. Furthermore, C/EBP isoforms may play a role in the control of cell cycle progression. Intestinal epithelial cells participate in the acute phase response in response to inflammation.

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 3-19Google Scholar). The inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract is mediated by the concerted actions of cellular and humoral elements, including cytokines, reactive oxygen metabolites, and bacterial products (2Mayer L. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 280-297Google Scholar). An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that intestinal epithelial cells can actively participate in the generation of an immune response (3Sanderson A.R. Walker W.A. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 65-73Google Scholar). In fact, intestinal epithelial cells participate in intestinal homeostasis and mucosal immunity by secreting and responding to cytokines (4Podolsky D.K. Fiocchi C. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 191-207Google Scholar).The intestinal inflammatory response leads to the establishment of an acute phase response characterized by the local production of acute phase proteins (APPs)1 in response to cytokines and hormones (5Mackiewicz A. Int. J. Cytol. 1997; 170: 225-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, we have shown that the APP gene haptoglobin is induced in various rat models of intestinal inflammation (6Boudreau F.

These genes belong to a class of transcription factors with adjacent leucine zipper dimerization and basic DNA-binding domains that enable the various C/EBP isoforms (α, β, δ, γ, ε, gadd153/CHOP) to form homo- or heterodimers (10Takiguchi M.

However, while the role of specific C/EBP isoforms, namely C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ as well as their differently translated isoforms (C/EBPα p30, C/EBPβ LIP) (12Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G.

The goal of the present study was to increase the expression of specific C/EBP isoforms or to inhibit C/EBP activity in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 and to assess the phenotype of these cell lines according to the regulation of the acute phase response as well as of cell proliferation.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this study show that C/EBP isoforms are involved in the regulation of the acute phase protein gene haptoglobin. First, inhibition of C/EBP activity by the dominant negative transactivation repressor C/EBPβ LIP (40Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 559-579Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (855) Google Scholar) or by dominant negative DNA binding inhibitors (3hF, 4hF) (29Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) leads to a decrease in haptoglobin expression in response to glucocorticoids, forskolin, and IL-1. This confirms the importance of C/EBP isoforms in the regulation of haptoglobin in intestinal epithelial cells. Second, overexpression of C/EBPα p30, C/EBPβ LAP, and C/EBPδ independently leads to increased basal levels of haptoglobin. Likewise, the level of haptoglobin mRNA induction in response to glucocorticoids, forskolin, and IL-1 is increased when C/EBP isoforms are overexpressed. This confirms our previous results showing that the C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ isoforms are the most potent activators of haptoglobin expression (7Pelletier N. Boudreau F. S.-J. Yu Zannoni S. Boulanger V. Asselin C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Yu S.-J. Boudreau F. Désilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results show that C/EBPα plays an important role in the regulation of haptoglobin in intestinal epithelial cells. It has been demonstrated by studying the neonatal acute-phase response to inflammation in C/EBPα knock-out mice that C/EBPα expression was required for haptoglobin expression in liver as opposed to lung (14Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is however surprising that C/EBPα p30 is so effective. Two isoforms of C/EBPα arise through the use of different translational initiation sites (25Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A. Diahl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 44Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The shorter C/EBPα p30, as opposed to the full-length C/EBPα p42 protein, has a decreased transactivation potential due to the absence of two of three transactivation domains. It remains to be determined whether the capacity of C/EBPα p30 to activate haptoglobin expression depends solely on its ability to increase the endogenous levels of C/EBPβ in IEC-6 cells when overexpressed.In contrast, C/EBP isoforms are not involved in the regulation of α-acid glycoprotein by dexamethasone in intestinal epithelial cells. Firstly, overexpression of dominant negative C/EBPs, affecting either the transactivation or the DNA binding potential, does not inhibit α-acid glycoprotein induction by dexamethasone. Secondly, overexpression of specific C/EBP isoforms does not increase basal α-acid glycoprotein mRNA levels. This indicates that the main regulator of α-acid glycoprotein expression is the glucocorticoid receptor, in contrast to α-acid glycoprotein regulation in rat liver or in other species. Indeed, glucocorticoids act through a minimal steroid responsive unit composed of a glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding site overlapping C/EBP DNA-binding sites in the proximal α-acid glycoprotein promoter (45Fournier T. Medjoubi-N N. Porquet D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). In rat liver and in other species, a strong cooperation between the glucocorticoid receptor and C/EBPs is necessary for hormone induction. Our results suggest that this cooperation is not necessary for α-acid glycoprotein regulation by glucocorticoids in intestinal epithelial cells, at least in the IEC-6 cell model.Transient transfection studies have shown that C/EBP isoforms may control the levels of C/EBPβ (18Chang C.-J. Shen B.-J. Lee S.-C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and C/EBPδ (19Yamada T. Tsuchiya T. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) mRNAs by autoregulatory mechanisms in other cell types. Furthermore, the C/EBPα promoter is autoregulated directly by C/EBPα in murine (46Legraverend C. Antonson P. Flodby P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and human cells (47Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Wilde A.M. Abdelsayed S. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dominant negative construct stably expressed in hepatoma cells inhibits the expression of C/EBPα (48Crosson S.M. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, overexpression of dominant negative forms of C/EBPs or of specific C/EBP isoforms did not affect C/EBP isoform mRNA levels. Furthermore, C/EBPα protein levels were not affected in C/EBP isoform-overexpressing cell lines. Our results suggest that C/EBP isoforms are not subject to autoregulation in IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells.Thus, the intriguing increase in C/EBPβ LAP and C/EBPβ LIP endogenous protein levels following C/EBPα p30 or C/EBPδ overexpression does not involve transcriptional autoregulatory mechanisms. Nothing is known of the mechanisms involved in dimerization of C/EBP isoforms in the cell. One may envision the possibility that dimers may be more stable than monomers. Increases in one isoform may alter the steady-state levels of dimers by increasing the probability of forming dimers, thereby increasing the stability of the C/EBP isoform pool. On the other hand, C/EBP isoforms may compete with other proteins known to interact with C/EBPs with less affinity. For example, C/EBPα interacts with the transcription factor NF-κB (49Vietor I. Oliveira I.C. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5595-5602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Increases in C/EBPα protein levels may favor the formation of C/EBP dimers as opposed to C/EBPα-NF-κB dimers, thus increasing overall C/EBP DNA binding activity.We have observed that C/EBPα p42 overexpression leads to growth arrest in IEC-6 cells (data not shown), as in other cell types (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). C/EBPα-dependent cell growth arrest depends on the transcriptional regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (50Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) or its stabilization at the protein level (51Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in different cell lines. More recently, C/EBPα has been shown to inhibit cell growth by direct repression of E2F-mediated transcription (42Slomiany B.A. D'Arigo K.L. Kelley M.M. Kurtz D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5986-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and may disrupt E2F-p107 complexes (52Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in C/EBPα-dependent growth arrest in IEC-6 cells do not implicate a transcriptional regulation of p21 (data not shown). Other C/EBP isoforms may be required to control intestinal epithelial cell growth. For example, overexpression of the gadd153/CHOP C/EBP isoform inhibits the growth of many cell types (10Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), including IEC-6 cells (data not shown). In addition, we have shown that C/EBPβ LAP overexpression reduced IEC-6 cell growth, in contrast to C/EBPα p30, C/EBPβ LIP, and C/EBPδ. C/EBPβ LAP-expressing cells are characterized by a delayed down-regulation of p27Kip1 and a delayed pRb hyperphosphorylation (data not shown) in response to serum and by decreased levels of cyclin D1/2 and cyclin E. Levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip and p57INK4B are not affected. C/EBPβ has been shown to inhibit hepatoma cell proliferation (53Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, C/EBPβ is required for proliferation induced by TGFα in primary hepatocytes (54Buck M. Poli V. Van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that C/EBPβ LAP overexpression leads to a delay in G1 progression of intestinal epithelial cells.The exact mechanism involved in the C/EBPβ-mediated growth delay remains to be determined. However, our results show that C/EBP isoforms may physically interact with the E2F4 transcription factor, leading to the recruitment of C/EBP isoforms to E2F DNA-binding sites. Firstly, C/EBP isoforms α p30 and β LIP are immunoprecipitated by the E2F4 antibody in IEC-6 cells overexpressing these isoforms, as determined by IP-EMSA. Secondly, the E2F4 antibody immunoprecipitates both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ isoforms from human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. Thirdly, immunoprecipitation of GFPC/EBPα p30 and GFPC/EBPβ LAP fusion proteins from 293T-overexpressing cells leads to the recovery of the E2F4 transcription factor, as determined by a supershift with a E2F DNA-binding site. These data also suggest that the minimal region involved in the interaction with E2F4 includes the C/EBP leucine zipper and that the transactivation domains of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are dispensable since C/EBPβ LIP is devoid of most of the transactivation domains of C/EBPβ and since C/EBPα p30 lacks two of three transactivation domains, including a putative E2F homology region (52Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While all C/EBP isoforms bind to E2F4 at least by the C-terminal region, only C/EBPα p42 (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Slomiany B.A. D'Arigo K.L. Kelley M.M. Kurtz D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5986-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and C/EBPβ LAP (our results) induce growth arrest. One may speculate that the presence of the transactivation domains of C/EBPα p42 and C/EBPβ LAP in E2F complexes negatively alters the transactivation potential of E2F complexes, leading to reduced expression of E2F target genes, such as cyclin D and cyclin E, and decreased cell proliferation. In addition, the presence of these domains may in some way stabilize the interaction of these complexes to the E2F DNA-binding site.Thus, we have shown the presence of different regulatory mechanisms for C/EBP isoform as well as acute phase protein gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Specific C/EBP isoforms are involved in the differential expression of APP genes in response to hormones and cytokines. Furthermore, C/EBP isoforms, including C/EBPβ, may play an important role in the control of intestinal epithelial cell growth. Intestinal epithelial cells form a critical mucosal barrier between the host's internal milieu and the external environment and serve as an integral component of the mucosal immune system (1Chang E.B. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 3-19Google Scholar). The inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract is mediated by the concerted actions of cellular and humoral elements, including cytokines, reactive oxygen metabolites, and bacterial products (2Mayer L. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 280-297Google Scholar). An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that intestinal epithelial cells can actively participate in the generation of an immune response (3Sanderson A.R. Walker W.A. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 65-73Google Scholar). In fact, intestinal epithelial cells participate in intestinal homeostasis and mucosal immunity by secreting and responding to cytokines (4Podolsky D.K. Fiocchi C. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 191-207Google Scholar). The intestinal inflammatory response leads to the establishment of an acute phase response characterized by the local production of acute phase proteins (APPs)1 in response to cytokines and hormones (5Mackiewicz A. Int. J. Cytol. 1997; 170: 225-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, we have shown that the APP gene haptoglobin is induced in various rat models of intestinal inflammation (6Boudreau F. Bardati T. Nadeau A. Blouin R. Asselin C. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112 (Abstr. 940)Google Scholar) and in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 in response to cAMP and glucocorticoids (7Pelletier N. Boudreau F. S.-J. Yu Zannoni S. Boulanger V. Asselin C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Yu S.-J. Boudreau F. Désilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors is one class of transactivators involved in the regulation of APP expression in various tissues, including the intestine (9Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). These genes belong to a class of transcription factors with adjacent leucine zipper dimerization and basic DNA-binding domains that enable the various C/EBP isoforms (α, β, δ, γ, ε, gadd153/CHOP) to form homo- or heterodimers (10Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). C/EBP isoforms show differential expression during adipocyte differentiation and liver regeneration, and during the acute phase response in multiple tissues, including the intestine (10Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). C/EBPα plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation (11Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and is a regulator of homeostasis in mammals (12Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). C/EBPα inhibits cell proliferation in many cell lines (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and may control the acute phase response in liver (14Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to a role in the early processes of adipocyte differentiation, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are direct mediators of the acute phase response in hepatocytes (9Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and intestinal epithelial cells (8Yu S.-J. Boudreau F. Désilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30843-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Lastly, transient transfection studies have shown that C/EBP isoforms control the levels of C/EBPβ (18Chang C.-J. Shen B.-J. Lee S.-C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and C/EBPδ (19Yamada T. Tsuchiya T. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) mRNAs in many cell types by autoregulatory mechanisms. C/EBPβ, and to a larger extent C/EBPδ, are induced in rodent small intestine after systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides, both at the mRNA (6Boudreau F. Bardati T. Nadeau A. Blouin R.

Moreover, we have previously shown that C/EBP isoforms are involved in the regulation of APP genes in intestinal epithelial cells (8Yu S.-J. Boudreau F. Désilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) or its stabilization at the protein level (51Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in different cell lines. More recently, C/EBPα has been shown to inhibit cell growth by direct repression of E2F-mediated transcription (42Slomiany B.A. D'Arigo K.L. Kelley M.M. Kurtz D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5986-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and may disrupt E2F-p107 complexes (52Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in C/EBPα-dependent growth arrest in IEC-6 cells do not implicate a transcriptional regulation of p21 (data not shown). Other C/EBP isoforms may be required to control intestinal epithelial cell growth. For example, overexpression of the gadd153/CHOP C/EBP isoform inhibits the growth of many cell types (10Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), including IEC-6 cells (data not shown). In addition, we have shown that C/EBPβ LAP overexpression reduced IEC-6 cell growth, in contrast to C/EBPα p30, C/EBPβ LIP, and C/EBPδ. C/EBPβ LAP-expressing cells are characterized by a delayed down-regulation of p27Kip1 and a delayed pRb hyperphosphorylation (data not shown) in response to serum and by decreased levels of cyclin D1/2 and cyclin E. Levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip and p57INK4B are not affected. C/EBPβ has been shown to inhibit hepatoma cell proliferation (53Buck M. Turler H. Chojkier M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, C/EBPβ is required for proliferation induced by TGFα in primary hepatocytes (54Buck M. Poli V. Van der Geer P. Chojkier M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that C/EBPβ LAP overexpression leads to a delay in G1 progression of intestinal epithelial cells.The exact mechanism involved in the C/EBPβ-mediated growth delay remains to be determined. However, our results show that C/EBP isoforms may physically interact with the E2F4 transcription factor, leading to the recruitment of C/EBP isoforms to E2F DNA-binding sites. Firstly, C/EBP isoforms α p30 and β LIP are immunoprecipitated by the E2F4 antibody in IEC-6 cells overexpressing these isoforms, as determined by IP-EMSA. Secondly, the E2F4 antibody immunoprecipitates both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ isoforms from human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. Thirdly, immunoprecipitation of GFPC/EBPα p30 and GFPC/EBPβ LAP fusion proteins from 293T-overexpressing cells leads to the recovery of the E2F4 transcription factor, as determined by a supershift with a E2F DNA-binding site. These data also suggest that the minimal region involved in the interaction with E2F4 includes the C/EBP leucine zipper and that the transactivation domains of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ are dispensable since C/EBPβ LIP is devoid of most of the transactivation domains of C/EBPβ and since C/EBPα p30 lacks two of three transactivation domains, including a putative E2F homology region (52Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While all C/EBP isoforms bind to E2F4 at least by the C-terminal region, only C/EBPα p42 (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Slomiany B.A. D'Arigo K.L. Kelley M.M. Kurtz D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5986-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and C/EBPβ LAP (our results) induce growth arrest. One may speculate that the presence of the transactivation domains of C/EBPα p42 and C/EBPβ LAP in E2F complexes negatively alters the transactivation potential of E2F complexes, leading to reduced expression of E2F target genes, such as cyclin D and cyclin E, and decreased cell proliferation. In addition, the presence of these domains may in some way stabilize the interaction of these complexes to the E2F DNA-binding site.Thus, we have shown the presence of different regulatory mechanisms for C/EBP isoform as well as acute phase protein gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells. Specific C/EBP isoforms are involved in the differential expression of APP genes in response to hormones and cytokines. Furthermore, C/EBP isoforms, including C/EBPβ, may play an important role in the control of intestinal epithelial cell growth. The data presented in this study show that C/EBP isoforms are involved in the regulation of the acute phase protein gene haptoglobin. First, inhibition of C/EBP activity by the dominant negative transactivation repressor C/EBPβ LIP (40Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 559-579Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (855) Google Scholar) or by dominant negative DNA binding inhibitors (3hF, 4hF) (29Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) leads to a decrease in haptoglobin expression in response to glucocorticoids, forskolin, and IL-1. This confirms the importance of C/EBP isoforms in the regulation of haptoglobin in intestinal epithelial cells. Second, overexpression of C/EBPα p30, C/EBPβ LAP, and C/EBPδ independently leads to increased basal levels of haptoglobin. Likewise, the level of haptoglobin mRNA induction in response to glucocorticoids, forskolin, and IL-1 is increased when C/EBP isoforms are overexpressed. This confirms our previous results showing that the C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ isoforms are the most potent activators of haptoglobin expression (7Pelletier N. Boudreau F. S.-J. Yu Zannoni S. Boulanger V. Asselin C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Yu S.-J. Boudreau F. Désilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our results show that C/EBPα plays an important role in the regulation of haptoglobin in intestinal epithelial cells. It has been demonstrated by studying the neonatal acute-phase response to inflammation in C/EBPα knock-out mice that C/EBPα expression was required for haptoglobin expression in liver as opposed to lung (14Burgess-Beusse B.L. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7269-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is however surprising that C/EBPα p30 is so effective. Two isoforms of C/EBPα arise through the use of different translational initiation sites (25Lin F.-T. MacDougald O.A. Diahl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 44Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The shorter C/EBPα p30, as opposed to the full-length C/EBPα p42 protein, has a decreased transactivation potential due to the absence of two of three transactivation domains. It remains to be determined whether the capacity of C/EBPα p30 to activate haptoglobin expression depends solely on its ability to increase the endogenous levels of C/EBPβ in IEC-6 cells when overexpressed. In contrast, C/EBP isoforms are not involved in the regulation of α-acid glycoprotein by dexamethasone in intestinal epithelial cells. Firstly, overexpression of dominant negative C/EBPs, affecting either the transactivation or the DNA binding potential, does not inhibit α-acid glycoprotein induction by dexamethasone. Secondly, overexpression of specific C/EBP isoforms does not increase basal α-acid glycoprotein mRNA levels. This indicates that the main regulator of α-acid glycoprotein expression is the glucocorticoid receptor, in contrast to α-acid glycoprotein regulation in rat liver or in other species. Indeed, glucocorticoids act through a minimal steroid responsive unit composed of a glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding site overlapping C/EBP DNA-binding sites in the proximal α-acid glycoprotein promoter (45Fournier T. Medjoubi-N N. Porquet D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). In rat liver and in other species, a strong cooperation between the glucocorticoid receptor and C/EBPs is necessary for hormone induction. Our results suggest that this cooperation is not necessary for α-acid glycoprotein regulation by glucocorticoids in intestinal epithelial cells, at least in the IEC-6 cell model. Transient transfection studies have shown that C/EBP isoforms may control the levels of C/EBPβ (18Chang C.-J. Shen B.-J. Lee S.-C. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and C/EBPδ (19Yamada T. Tsuchiya T. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) mRNAs by autoregulatory mechanisms in other cell types. Furthermore, the C/EBPα promoter is autoregulated directly by C/EBPα in murine (46Legraverend C. Antonson P. Flodby P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and human cells (47Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Wilde A.M. Abdelsayed S. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dominant negative construct stably expressed in hepatoma cells inhibits the expression of C/EBPα (48Crosson S.M. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, overexpression of dominant negative forms of C/EBPs or of specific C/EBP isoforms did not affect C/EBP isoform mRNA levels. Furthermore, C/EBPα protein levels were not affected in C/EBP isoform-overexpressing cell lines. Our results suggest that C/EBP isoforms are not subject to autoregulation in IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the intriguing increase in C/EBPβ LAP and C/EBPβ LIP endogenous protein levels following C/EBPα p30 or C/EBPδ overexpression does not involve transcriptional autoregulatory mechanisms. Nothing is known of the mechanisms involved in dimerization of C/EBP isoforms in the cell. One may envision the possibility that dimers may be more stable than monomers. Increases in one isoform may alter the steady-state levels of dimers by increasing the probability of forming dimers, thereby increasing the stability of the C/EBP isoform pool. On the other hand, C/EBP isoforms may compete with other proteins known to interact with C/EBPs with less affinity. For example, C/EBPα interacts with the transcription factor NF-κB (49Vietor I. Oliveira I.C. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5595-5602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Increases in C/EBPα protein levels may favor the formation of C/EBP dimers as opposed to C/EBPα-NF-κB dimers, thus increasing overall C/EBP DNA binding activity. We have observed that C/EBPα p42 overexpression leads to growth arrest in IEC-6 cells (data not shown), as in other cell types (13Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Darlington G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4726-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). C/EBPα-dependent cell growth arrest depends on the transcriptional regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (50Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Nakanishi M. Smith J.R. Darlington G.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) or its stabilization at the protein level (51Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Peptide sequencing revealed that the protein is identical to a positive regulatory E subunit (V-ATPase E) of a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which is responsible for acidification of endosome and alkalinization of intracellular pH. The interaction between V-ATPase E and Sos-DH was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assay. A coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that a V-ATPase E protein physiologically bound to mSos1, and the protein was colocalized with mSos1 in the cytoplasm, as determined by immunohistochemistry. mSos1 was found in the early endosome fraction together with V-ATPase E and Rac1, suggesting the functional involvement of mSos1/V-ATPase E complexes in the Rac1 activity at endosomes. Overexpression of V-ATPase E in COS cells enhanced the ability of mSos1 to promote the guanine nucleotide exchange activity for Rac1 and stimulated the kinase activity of Jun kinase, a downstream target of Rac1. Thus, the data indicate that V-ATPase E may participate in the regulation of the mSos1-dependent Rac1 signaling pathway involved in growth factor receptor-mediated cell growth control."

Adenylosuccinate synthetase (IMP: l-aspartate ligase (GDP-forming), EC 6.3.4.4) catalyzes the first committed step in the de novo biosynthesis of AMP. In vertebrates the synthetase is also a component of the purine nucleotide cycle, which interconverts IMP and AMP (1Lowenstein J.M. Physiol.

Adenylosuccinate synthetases from various sources exhibit significant sequence conservation (∼40% sequence identity between eubacteria and mammals, for instance (4Guicherit O.V. Rudolph F.B.

Nonetheless, synthetases from nearly every eukaryotic organism have ∼30-residues added to their N termini and truncations at their C termini relative to the bacterial synthetases. Moreover, vertebrates express two distinct forms of adenylosuccinate synthetase (5Matsuda Y. Ogawa H. Fukutome S. Shiraki H. Nakagawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The basic isozyme (often called the muscle enzyme or AdSS1) is associated with the purine nucleotide cycle (1Lowenstein J.M.

However, recent structures of the synthetase from plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and Triticum aestivum, reveal organized active sites in the presence of GDP alone (19Prade L. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Chemla P.

Subsequent studies confirmed a random sequential kinetic mechanism for these muscle synthetases (6Cooper B.F. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B.

Matsuda Y. Ogawa H. Shiraki H. Nakagawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), but no structure of the basic isozyme has appeared in the literature. Only the cDNA encoding the mouse muscle isozyme has been cloned (4Guicherit O.V. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. Cooper B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22582-22587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reported here are first instances of heterologous overexpression and structure determination of the basic isozyme of adenylosuccinate synthetase. The enzyme is expressed in E. coli using an N-terminal, polyhistidyl tag to facilitate purification. The purified enzyme crystallizes readily in the absence of ligands. The resulting crystal structure of the ligand-free protein at 2.5 Å resolution reveals a polypeptide fold similar to those of synthetases from E. coli and plants. The active sites of the basic isozyme and the E. coli synthetase, however, differ significantly in the conformation of loops, which define, in part, the IMP and GTP binding sites. Indeed, the basic isozyme, as seen here, cannot bind IMP as does the E. coli synthetase without a conformational change involving residues that up to now have been conformationally invariant among all known synthetase structures. Adenylosuccinate synthetase (IMP: l-aspartate ligase (GDP-forming), EC 6.3.4.4) catalyzes the first committed step in the de novo biosynthesis of AMP. In vertebrates the synthetase is also a component of the purine nucleotide cycle, which interconverts IMP and AMP (1Lowenstein J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1972; 52: 382-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 2Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top.

Adenylosuccinate synthetases from various sources exhibit significant sequence conservation (∼40% sequence identity between eubacteria and mammals, for instance (4Guicherit O.V. Rudolph F.B. Kellems R.E. Cooper B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22582-22587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Nonetheless, synthetases from nearly every eukaryotic organism have ∼30-residues added to their N termini and truncations at their C termini relative to the bacterial synthetases. Moreover, vertebrates express two distinct forms of adenylosuccinate synthetase (5Matsuda Y. Ogawa H. Fukutome S. Shiraki H. Nakagawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The basic isozyme (often called the muscle enzyme or AdSS1) is associated with the purine nucleotide cycle (1Lowenstein J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1972; 52: 382-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), whereas the acidic isozyme (often called the liver enzyme or AdSS2) is associated with de novobiosynthesis of AMP (5Matsuda Y. Ogawa H. Fukutome S. Shiraki H. Nakagawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The two isozymes differ not only in their isoelectric points but also in their kinetic properties, regulation, and tissue distribution (2Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Honzatko R.B. Stayton M.M. Fromm H.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 57-102PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli is the most studied of all synthetases. Its kinetic mechanism is rapid equilibrium random (6Cooper B.F. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7323-7327Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 6-Phosphoryl-IMP is an intermediate in a two-step process that begins with the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP to the 6-keto group of IMP, followed by the displacement of Pi from the intermediate by l-aspartate to form adenylosuccinate (7Honzatko R.B.

A β2-specific NPXF motif, located in the C-terminal portion of the β2 tail, is required for Ca2+ signaling, and we show that this motif is important for the induction of allo-specific target cell lysis by cytotoxic T cells in vitro. Significantly, the Ca2+-signaling capacity of the β2 integrin is abrogated in T cells that do not express the T cell receptor but may be reconstituted by co-expression of the T cell receptor-ζ chain.

T cell receptor lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 antigen-presenting cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 cytotoxic T lymphocyte linker in T cell activation Activation of a T cell by cognate antigen is a complex series of events of which specificity and efficiency are critical for the development and maintenance of adaptive vertebrate immunity. The final outcome of T cell activation, i.e. triggering of effector functions or induction of cytokine gene expression, is dependent on the precise orchestration of plasma membrane proximal events, both at the level of the involved receptors and the subsequent cytoplasmic signal transduction cascades. The specificity of T cell activation relies on the interaction of an idiotypic TCR1 with antigenic ligand on an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The activated TCR in turn couples to an intracellular signal transduction apparatus, which is predominantly based on specific tyrosine phosphorylation events (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 2Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation of so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), present in the intracellular elements of the TCR-associated ζ chains or the CD3 complex (3Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 4Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), a cross-talk of non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk/ZAP-70 families is initiated (5Kolanus W. Romeo C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) that relays signals between the TCR and distal functions (i.e. cytokine promoter activation) (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar, 7van Leeuwen J.E. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Specific hematopoietic adaptor proteins play important roles in this information flow. Signal transduction from the TCR, however, is not sufficient to fully activate T cells. It has become evident that so-called accessory or co-stimulatory receptors, e.g. CD28, expressed at the surface of the T cell, are important determinants of this process. Co-stimulatory interactions between other T cell surface proteins and their self-ligands on APC have been hypothesized to deliver a qualitatively different “signal 2” (as to distinguish it from “signal 1” triggered by the TCR) (8Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2357) Google Scholar, 9Chambers C.A. Allison J.P. Curr. Opin.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). LFA-1 (αLβ2, CD11a/CD18) belongs to a family of heterodimeric cell surface proteins termed β2integrins, which have primarily been shown to play important roles in T cell adhesion to both endothelial cells and APC (11Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 12Lub M. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recently, LFA-1 has also been implicated in signal transduction (13Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Ledbetter J.A. Damle N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7099-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Wulfing C. Davis M.M.

In one study it was shown that the interaction of LFA-1 with its APC ligand ICAM-1 was required for potentiation of Ca2+-signaling by the TCR but was dispensable for T cell adhesion and spreading to major histocompatibility complex-antigen complexes embedded in lipid membranes (15Wulfing C. Sjaastad M.D. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6302-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, suggested that the signaling function of LFA-1 might even be more important for T cell activation than its adhesive properties. On the other hand, Zuckermanet al. (16Zuckerman L.A. Pullen L. Miller J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3259-3268PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that although LFA-1 cooperated initially with the TCR to induce proliferation of naive T cells, this signal led to apoptotic cell death after prolonged incubation periods. Finally, recent studies indicate that after stimulation with specific antigen, both the TCR and LFA-1 undergo specific reorientation and reorganization processes at the plasma membrane, forming so-called supramolecular activation clusters (20Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). A different study documented similar structures, which were referred to as the immunological synapse (21Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar, 22Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Supramolecular activation clusters also include other co-stimulatory receptors as well as intracellular signaling molecules, such as protein kinase Cθ (20Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). All these observations are consistent with the view that LFA-1 may not deliver a second signal but rather could aid in amplifying the TCR-dependent signal 1. However, its mode of action in this function is obscure. Here we use a chimeric receptor approach to investigate the formal requirements of LFA-1 cytoplasmic domain elements in T cell signal transduction. TAg-Jurkat cells and Jurkat J.RT3-T3.5 T cells deficient in surface expression of the TCR were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. The following antibodies were used in this study: antigen affinity-purified goat anti-human IgG, Fc-γ fragment-specific polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody MT-151 (kindly provided by Peter Rieber, University of Dresden), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and anti-LFA-1 antibody MEM-95 (kindly provided by Vaclav Horejsi, University of Prague, Czech Republic). All secondary anti-IgG reagents were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The cytoplasmic portions of the transmembrane chimeras were amplified using PCR techniques and cloned into a sIg expression plasmid p5C7 using the MluI andNotI restriction sites (23Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses, the coding segments were subcloned into the pTKG vector (4Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The intracellular domains of the respective transmembrane fusion proteins comprised the following amino acid sequences: residues 725–769 (ALI … AES*) of CD18, residues 1114–1170 (VGF … GKD*) of CD11a, residues 753–798 (LLM … EGK*) of CD29 and residues 183–220 (RSR … YRS*) of CD28. The sIg-TCR-ζ construct (23Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the CD4-TCR-ζ construct (4Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 24Romeo C. Kolanus W. Amiot M. Seed B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were described before. Deletion mutants of the CD18 cytoplasmic tail comprised sIg-CD18–762* residues 753–762 (ALI … TVM*) or sIg-CD18–747* residues 753–747 (ALI … SQW*). Point mutants of diverse chimeras were generated using polymerase chain reaction-based strategies and resulted in substitution of phenylalanine 766 of CD18 for either alanine or tyrosine or of tyrosine 795 of CD29 for phenylalanine. TAg-Jurkat and J.RT3-T3.5 T cells were transfected with constructs coding for the chimeric proteins by infection with recombinant vaccinia virus as described before (24Romeo C. Kolanus W. Amiot M. Seed B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, Jurkat J.RT3-T3.5 T cells were transiently transfected using the EasyjecT Plus electroporation system (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) as described previously (23Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To verify protein levels of the respective sIg chimeras, transfected TAg-Jurkat cells were lysed by adding SDS to a final concentration of 1%. After adding 3× loading buffer, samples were boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Alternatively, analysis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was performed by incubating transfected J.RT3-T3.5 T cells with anti-human IgG antibody at 2 μg of antibody/6 × 106cells for 5 min in Hanks' buffered saline solution at 37 °C before lysis with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 mmNa3VO4. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were visualized by Western blot analysis using 4G10 monoclonal antibody. Calcium mobilization analysis was performed as described before (23Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, TAg-Jurkat and J.RT3-T3.5 T cells were transfected with chimeric transmembrane constructs by infection with recombinant vaccinia virus. After 5 h cells were washed, resuspended in Hanks' buffered saline solution, and loaded with the fluorescent calcium probe Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 25 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry for 30 s before anti-human IgG antibody was added for stimulation of cells. The calcium influx was analyzed for a further 370 s, and mean values were calculated using the kinetic analysis software Multitime 3.0 (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Src-kinase inhibitor PP2 (Calbiochem) was added at 10 μmto Hanks' buffered saline solution where indicated. Calcium-free media consisted of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm EGTA, respectively. CTL clone 234 was infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses and incubated for 4 h. Cells were harvested and subsequently incubated with target cells (BW-LCL, HLA-A24+ or DS-LCL, HLA-A24−). Cell-mediated lysis was quantified with the help of a standard 4-h chromium-51 release assay as described (25Schendel D.J. Wank R. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1979; 13: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Spontaneous release was determined by incubating target cells alone in complete medium. Total release was determined by directly counting an aliquot of labeled cells. The percent cytotoxicity was calculated according to the formula % lysis = (experimental cpm − spontaneous cpm/total cpm − spontaneous cpm) × 100. Duplicate measurements of three to six step titrations of effector cells were used for all experiments. To evaluate the influence of LFA-1 on cytotoxicity, CD18 specific monoclonal antibody was incubated with clone 234 at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of target cells. The anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody MEM-95 (ascites) was used at a dilution of 1:100. After preincubation with the antibody, the standard 4-h chromium release assay was performed. Procedures for transient transfection of TAg-Jurkat cells and measurement of luciferase activity were described before (23Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of pIL2-GL2 reporter plasmid and 25 μg of respective sIg constructs were cotransfected by electroporation. After 20 h, respective samples were stimulated for 8 h as indicated with calcium ionophore A23187(0.5 μg/ml) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) or by the addition of cross-linking anti-human Ig antibody (5 μg/ml) or were left untreated. This was followed by the addition of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and scintillation counting. Integrin adhesion receptors do not bind constitutively to their ligands. A large body of data indicates that the propensity of integrin molecules to interact with cell surface receptors or extracellular matrix ligands is regulated by intracellular signaling events that in turn are triggered by “activating” receptor/ligand interactions (integrin avidity regulation, “inside-out” signal transduction) (11Diamond M.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). One example is the aforementioned TCR, the activation of which triggers enhanced binding of LFA-1 to its ligand ICAM-1 on an APC (30Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, this property of the molecule complicates the study of LFA-1-dependent signaling functions because the integrin-mediated signal will be perturbed by the activation stimulus required for the engagement of LFA-1 with its ligand. We hypothesized that clustering of chimeric single-chain receptors bearing isolated integrin cytoplasmic domains may be sufficient to induce signaling events that would, under physiological conditions, emanate from these elements in the context of the much more complex T cell activation scenario. First, fusion proteins have been employed very successfully in delineating signal transduction events triggered by the complex T cell or B cell antigen receptors (4Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 5Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31Irving B.A. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 32Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Second, strong evidence supports the notion that integrin-dependent signal transduction normally follows receptor aggregation or clustering. This not only holds true for T cells, as evidenced by the observed distribution of LFA-1 in supramolecular activation clusters (20Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar), but also is valid for non-hematopoietic cells adhering to extracellular matrix components in which integrins signal through the formation of higher order protein complexes (33Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3820) Google Scholar, 34Aplin A.E. Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The structure of the single chain receptors used in this study is shown in Fig. 1 a, and the principal design of these fusion proteins was described earlier (4Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 5Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 23Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of CD18 (β2 chain), CD11a (αL chain), or the β-cytoplasmic domain of the related β1 integrin CD29 were genetically fused to the transmembrane domain of the CD7 antigen and extended extracellularly by the CH2 and CH3 domains of human immunoglobulin G1.Secondary reagents directed against human IgG Fc fragments are used to efficiently cluster the constant immunoglobulin domains. Furthermore, the endoplasmic reticulum import signal sequence of CD5 (35Zettlmeissl G. Gregersen J.P. Duport J.M. Mehdi S. Reiner G. Seed B. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used to mediate transport of the tripartite fusion proteins to the cell surface of TAg-Jurkat cells (Figs. 1, b andc). We first investigated whether the chimeras induced signaling events in leukemic TAg-Jurkat T cells (36Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). We chose intracellular calcium mobilization, a generally accepted and important parameter of receptor proximal signaling events in T cells. Moreover, LFA-1 has been implicated in this function (13Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Ledbetter J.A. Damle N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7099-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Wulfing C. Sjaastad M.D. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6302-6307Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To this end, the fusion proteins were expressed in TAg-Jurkat cells by recombinant vaccinia viruses as described earlier (5Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium mobilization was monitored by flow cytometry using the fluorescent calcium chelator Fluo-3 (37Kao J.P. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that base-line calcium levels are similar for all chimeric constructs used. However, after clustering with antibody, specific induction of calcium mobilization was observed. A strong and persistent Ca2+-mobilization was induced by a control fusion protein bearing the full-length cytoplasmic domain of the TCR-associated ζ chain (Fig. 2 a), as described previously (4Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 31Irving B.A. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Significantly, however, an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration was also detected when the sIg-CD18 chimera was clustered but not when control protein sIg bearing no intracellular domain or sIg-CD29 was employed. The CD18-dependent Ca2+-flux appeared different from the sIg-TCR-ζ-induced signal both in onset and amplitude. We conclude from these data that the clustered cytoplasmic domain of CD18 is sufficient to induce calcium signaling in TAg-Jurkat cells. It was subsequently analyzed whether the intracellular portion of the αL chain (CD11a) bore a similar capacity. Fig. 2 b shows that this is not the case. Furthermore, co-clustering of CD18 and CD11a did not enhance the calcium signal induced by sIg-CD18 alone (not shown), which led us to conclude that the aggregation-dependent signaling elements of LFA-1 that lead to cytoplasmic calcium mobilization are located exclusively within the CD18 cytoplasmic domain. We attempted a preliminary characterization of intracellular signaling events induced by sIg-CD18 clustering and of the routes of cytoplasmic calcium mobilization. To this end, the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 was employed in calcium mobilization assays. As shown in Figs.3, a and b, the addition of 10 μm PP2 to the medium abrogated both sIg-ζ and sIg-CD18 mediated signals completely, suggesting that CD18-mediated calcium signaling depends on Src kinase activity. Is the CD18-dependent calcium signal dependent on intracellular calcium stores ? To answer this question, calcium was omitted from the medium, and the Ca2+-selective chelator EGTA was added before flux measurement. Fig. 3 c shows that sIg-ζ induces a transient calcium flux in the absence of extracellular calcium ions, consistent with the known TCR-dependent calcium mobilization from intracellular stores. However, sIg-CD18 was almost completely incapable of inducing calcium transients in the presence of EGTA. This result hints at differential requirements for the two receptors at a point further downstream in the signaling cascade. Reporter assays were then employed to study T cell signaling events that are located far downstream and which are known to be dependent on intracellular calcium mobilization. SIg-CD18 or a control construct were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the intact promoter/enhancer region of the human interleukin-2 promoter (23Zeitlmann L. Knorr T. Knoll M. Romeo C. Sirim P. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15445-15452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 d shows that cross-linking of sIg-CD18 resulted in a 5-fold, specific induction of the interleukin-2 promoter under these conditions. Moreover, co-transfection of a dominant-negative, kinase-deficient Lck construct, but not of intact Lck, abrogated CD18-dependent interleukin-2 promoter stimulation completely. These data are fully consistent with the loss of CD18-dependent calcium induction in the presence of Src kinase inhibitor PP2, and confirm a dependence of CD18 signal transduction on an Src kinase, which is likely Lck (Fig.3 a). We were interested in determining whether the expression of the TCR was important for sIg-CD18-mediated signal transduction. For these analyses Jurkat J.RT3-T3.5 cells that do not express a TCR on the cell surface were employed (38Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Expression of all constructs was highly comparable in TCR+ TAg-Jurkat cells and in J.RT3-T3.5 cells (Fig. 5and data not shown). Fig. 4 shows that Ca2+ mobilization was induced in J.RT3-T3.5 cells by the sIg-TCR-ζ chimera as predicted, since this construct is thought to function as a surrogate TCR. The sIg-CD18 fusion protein, however, did not induce cytoplasmic Ca2+-influx in the absence of the TCR. We were interested in analyzing whether this deficiency was because of a global inability of co-stimulatory molecules to function properly in the absence of the TCR or the signaling components it might assemble. Therefore, a different fusion protein was employed that bore the intact cytoplasmic domain of CD28, which has previously been implicated in Ca2+ signaling. The corresponding data are also shown in Fig. 4. It was observed that the CD28 fusion protein was functional both in TAg-Jurkat cells and in J.RT3-T3.5 cells (Fig. 4 and data not shown), although the amplitude of the Ca2+ flux in J.RT3-T3.5 was on the average lower than in TAg-Jurkat cells (data not shown). These data indicate that the CD28 fusion protein was capable of delivering signals that were independent of the TCR to a significant extent, whereas the signal induced by the CD18 chimera strictly required TCR cell surface expression.Figure 5Reconstitution of sIg-CD18-mediated signal transduction in TCR-negative Jurkat cells by co-expression of a chimeric TCR-ζ chain. a, schematic diagram of the CD4-TCR-ζ fusion protein employed to reconstitute TCR negative Jurkat cells. Jurkat J.RT3-T3.5 T cells were co-infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing sIg fusion proteins in combination with either native, full-length CD4 (CD4-control) (b) or alternatively with the CD4-TCR-ζ chimera (d). Cell surface expression of chimeras was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-human IgG or anti-CD4 antibodies.c, co-expression of the sIg chimeras with the CD4-control protein in TCR-negative Jurkat cells revealed similar results as shown in Fig. 3. e, calcium signaling after clustering of the sIg-CD18 fusion protein is rescued by co-expression of the CD4-TCR-ζ chimera. Both types of chimeric proteins could be stimulated independently, as demonstrated by the failure of sIg-control fusion protein to induce intracellular calcium influx after anti-human IgG cross-linking. Additionally, sIg-CD28-triggered calcium signaling is boosted by the co-expression of CD4-TCR-ζ. f, tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins is induced after aggregation of sIg-CD18 in Jurkat J.RT3-T3.5 T cells reconstituted with CD4-TCR-ζ (fourth lane) but not in cells expressing full-length CD4 (CD4-control, second lane). g,left panel, tyrosine phosphorylation of a 38-kDa cellular protein is induced by aggregation of sIg-CD18 or sIg-ζ but not by sIg-CD29 or control chimera (sIg). The phosphoprotein likely corresponds to the adaptor protein LAT (right panel). α-P-Tyr, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Aggregation of sIg-CD18 fails to induce calcium mobilization in T cells lacking TCR cell surface expression. The TCR-negative mutant Jurkat cell line J.RT3-T3.5 was infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing sIg chimeras and analyzed as described before. Cross-linking of the CD18 fusion protein did not result in a detectable rise of intracellular calcium concentration in this cell type. Conversely, calcium signaling mediated by sIg-TCR-ζ or sIg-CD28 appears to be at least partially independent of TCR surface expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These findings prompted us to analyze which components of the TCR were needed for CD18-dependent functions. Therefore, we adapted our system to the simultaneous use of two fusion proteins that could be independently clustered on the surface of the same cell. Fig.5 a shows the design of the additional constructs. In this system, the cytoplasmic and transmembrane portions of TCR-ζ were fused to the extracellular domain of CD4, or alternatively, full-length CD4 was used as a control. Experiments were performed to determine whether the sIg or CD4 derivatives could be co-expressed and independently manipulated on the surface of J.RT3-T3.5 cells. Fig. 5 shows that this is the case. Co-expression was monitored by flow cytometric analysis using anti-Ig antibodies and anti-CD4 antibody MT151 (Figs. 5, b andd). Clustering of the CD4-TCR-ζ fusion protein resulted in Ca2+ mobilization as expected (not s"
