https://openalex.org/W2072885702,"In the mammalian CNS, each neuron typically receives thousands of synaptic inputs from diverse classes of neurons. Synaptic transmission to the postsynaptic neuron relies on localized and transmitter-specific differentiation of the plasma membrane with postsynaptic receptor, scaffolding, and adhesion proteins accumulating in precise apposition to presynaptic sites of transmitter release. We identified protein interactions of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin 2 that drive postsynaptic differentiation at inhibitory synapses. Neuroligin 2 binds the scaffolding protein gephyrin through a conserved cytoplasmic motif and functions as a specific activator of collybistin, thus guiding membrane tethering of the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold. Complexes of neuroligin 2, gephyrin and collybistin are sufficient for cell-autonomous clustering of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. Deletion of neuroligin 2 in mice perturbs GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic transmission and leads to a loss of postsynaptic specializations specifically at perisomatic inhibitory synapses."

Although the timing of the fate switch from neurogenic to astrogenic is critical for determining the number of neurons, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that the polycomb group complex (PcG) restricts neurogenic competence of NPCs and promotes the transition of NPC fate from neurogenic to astrogenic. Inactivation of PcG by knockout of the Ring1B or Ezh2 gene or Eed knockdown prolonged the neurogenic phase of NPCs and delayed the onset of the astrogenic phase. Moreover, PcG was found to repress the promoter of the proneural gene neurogenin1 in a developmental-stage-dependent manner. These results demonstrate a role of PcG: the temporal regulation of NPC fate."
https://openalex.org/W1985962374,"H(2)O(2) acts as a signaling molecule by oxidizing critical thiol groups on redox-regulated target proteins. To explain the efficiency and selectivity of H(2)O(2)-based signaling, it has been proposed that oxidation of target proteins may be facilitated by H(2)O(2)-scavenging peroxidases. Recently, a peroxidase-based protein oxidation relay has been identified in yeast, namely the oxidation of the transcription factor Yap1 by the peroxidase Orp1. It has remained unclear whether the protein oxidase function of Orp1 is a singular adaptation or whether it may represent a more general principle. Here we show that Orp1 is in fact not restricted to oxidizing Yap1 but can also form a highly efficient redox relay with the oxidant target protein roGFP (redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein) in mammalian cells. Orp1 mediates near quantitative oxidation of roGFP2 by H(2)O(2), and the Orp1-roGFP2 redox relay effectively converts physiological H(2)O(2) signals into measurable fluorescent signals in living cells. Furthermore, the oxidant relay phenomenon is not restricted to Orp1 as the mammalian peroxidase Gpx4 also mediates oxidation of proximal roGFP2 in living cells. Together, these findings support the concept that certain peroxidases harbor an intrinsic and powerful capacity to act as H(2)O(2)-dependent protein thiol oxidases when they are recruited into proximity of oxidizable target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2152645204,"Thymus-derived lymphocytes protect mammalian hosts against virus- or cancer-related cellular alterations through immune surveillance, eliminating diseased cells. In this process, T cell receptors (TCRs) mediate both recognition and T cell activation via their dimeric alphabeta, CD3 epsilon gamma, CD3 epsilon delta, and CD3 zeta zeta subunits using an unknown structural mechanism. Here, site-specific binding topology of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and dynamic TCR quaternary change provide key clues. Agonist mAbs footprint to the membrane distal CD3 epsilon lobe that they approach diagonally, adjacent to the lever-like C beta FG loop that facilitates antigen (pMHC)-triggered activation. In contrast, a non-agonist mAb binds to the cleft between CD3 epsilon and CD3 gamma in a perpendicular mode and is stimulatory only subsequent to an external tangential but not a normal force ( approximately 50 piconewtons) applied via optical tweezers. Specific pMHC but not irrelevant pMHC activates a T cell upon application of a similar force. These findings suggest that the TCR is an anisotropic mechanosensor, converting mechanical energy into a biochemical signal upon specific pMHC ligation during immune surveillance. Activating anti-CD3 mAbs mimic this force via their intrinsic binding mode. A common TCR quaternary change rather than conformational alterations can better facilitate structural signal initiation, given the vast array of TCRs and their specific pMHC ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2160093511,"Epidemiologists and ecologists often collect data in the field and, on returning to their laboratory, enter their data into a database for further analysis. The recent introduction of mobile phones that utilise the open source Android operating system, and which include (among other features) both GPS and Google Maps, provide new opportunities for developing mobile phone applications, which in conjunction with web applications, allow two-way communication between field workers and their project databases.Here we describe a generic framework, consisting of mobile phone software, EpiCollect, and a web application located within www.spatialepidemiology.net. Data collected by multiple field workers can be submitted by phone, together with GPS data, to a common web database and can be displayed and analysed, along with previously collected data, using Google Maps (or Google Earth). Similarly, data from the web database can be requested and displayed on the mobile phone, again using Google Maps. Data filtering options allow the display of data submitted by the individual field workers or, for example, those data within certain values of a measured variable or a time period.Data collection frameworks utilising mobile phones with data submission to and from central databases are widely applicable and can give a field worker similar display and analysis tools on their mobile phone that they would have if viewing the data in their laboratory via the web. We demonstrate their utility for epidemiological data collection and display, and briefly discuss their application in ecological and community data collection. Furthermore, such frameworks offer great potential for recruiting 'citizen scientists' to contribute data easily to central databases through their mobile phone."
https://openalex.org/W2133280872,"Although there is widespread agreement that the hippocampus is critical for explicit episodic memory retrieval, it is controversial whether this region can also support indirect expressions of relational memory when explicit retrieval fails. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with concurrent indirect, eye-movement-based memory measures, we obtained evidence that hippocampal activity predicted expressions of relational memory in subsequent patterns of viewing, even when explicit, conscious retrieval failed. Additionally, activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex and functional connectivity between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were greater for correct than for incorrect trials. Together, these results suggest that hippocampal activity can support the expression of relational memory even when explicit retrieval fails and that recruitment of a broader cortical network may be required to support explicit associative recognition.

Together, these results suggest that hippocampal activity can support the expression of relational memory even when explicit retrieval fails and that recruitment of a broader cortical network may be required to support explicit associative recognition. Considerable evidence indicates that the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortical structures support long-term declarative memory (Cohen and Squire, 1980Cohen N.J. Squire L.R.

Stark C.E. Clark R.E. The medial temporal lobe.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Several theories implicate these structures specifically in conscious retrieval of past events and experiences (e.g., Moscovitch, 1995Moscovitch M.

The nature of recollection and familiarity: A review of 30 years of research.J. Mem. Lang. 2002; 46: 441-517Crossref Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). An alternative view points to a critical role for the hippocampus in the encoding and retrieval of memories for arbitrary relationships among items that co-occur in the context of some scene or event (Eichenbaum et al., 1994Eichenbaum H. Otto T. Cohen N.J. Two functional components of the hippocampal memory system.Behav. Brain Sci. 1994; 17: 449-517Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar). In general, the relational memory theory is compatible with other accounts of MTL function, as conscious recollection likely depends on the ability to encode, and subsequently retrieve, arbitrary inter-item or item-context relationships (Davachi, 2006Davachi L. Item, context, and relational episodic encoding in humans.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, Eichenbaum et al., 2007Eichenbaum H. Yonelinas A.P. Ranganath C. The medial temporal lobe and recognition memory.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 123-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). However, one area where these theories diverge concerns the role of the hippocampus in the expression of relational memory, even in the absence of awareness. Whereas some theories propose that relationally bound memory representations, supported by the hippocampus, can be expressed even when explicit reports fail (Eichenbaum et al., 1994Eichenbaum H. Otto T. Cohen N.J. Two functional components of the hippocampal memory system.Behav. Brain Sci. 1994; 17: 449-517Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar, Eichenbaum, 1999Eichenbaum H. Conscious awareness, memory and the hippocampus.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 775-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), others emphasize the tight link between hippocampal function and conscious retrieval of past events (Aggleton and Brown, 1999Aggleton J.P.

Findings from recent experiments suggest that relational memory may be evident in patterns of eye movements even when conscious recollection fails. In these experiments, participants study realistic scenes and are subsequently tested with scenes that are repeated exactly as they were studied and scenes that have been systematically manipulated. Participants typically fixate disproportionately on regions of scenes that have been manipulated, suggesting that memory for the original item-location relationships has modulated viewing patterns (e.g., Hayhoe et al., 1998Hayhoe M. Bensinger D.G. Ballard D.H. Task constraints in visual working memory.Vision Res. 1998; 38: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Henderson and Hollingworth, 2003Henderson J.M.

Experience-dependent eye movements, awareness, and hippocampus-dependent memory.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11304-11312Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Critically, these eye movement-based relational memory effects have been documented even when participants fail to explicitly detect scene changes (e.g., Hayhoe et al., 1998Hayhoe M. Bensinger D.G. Ballard D.H. Task constraints in visual working memory.Vision Res. 1998; 38: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Henderson and Hollingworth, 2003Henderson J.M. Hollingworth A.

Althoff R.R. Whitlow S. Cohen N.J. Amnesia is a deficit in relational memory.Psychol. Sci. 2000; 11: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), suggesting that eye-movement measures can be used to address questions about hippocampal involvement in relational memory retrieval even when overt behavioral reports are incorrect. Other paradigms have been used to demonstrate that memory can rapidly influence eye-movement behavior (Hannula et al., 2007Hannula D.E. Ryan J.D. Tranel D. Cohen N.J. Rapid onset relational memory effects are evident in eye movement behavior, but not in hippocampal amnesia.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2007; 19: 1690-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, Holm et al., 2008Holm L. Eriksson J. Andersson L.

The obligatory effects of memory on eye movements.Memory. 2007; 15: 508-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and that eye-movement-based memory effects can occur far in advance of explicit recognition (Hannula et al., 2007Hannula D.E. Ryan J.D. Tranel D. Cohen N.J. Rapid onset relational memory effects are evident in eye movement behavior, but not in hippocampal amnesia.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2007; 19: 1690-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, Holm et al., 2008Holm L. Eriksson J. Andersson L. Looking as if you know: Systematic object inspection precedes object recognition.J. Vis. 2008; 8: 14.1-14.7Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For example, in one study (Hannula et al., 2007Hannula D.E. Ryan J.D. Tranel D. Cohen N.J. Rapid onset relational memory effects are evident in eye movement behavior, but not in hippocampal amnesia.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2007; 19: 1690-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), eye movements were monitored during an associative recognition test in which a previously studied scene was presented (“scene cue”), and then three previously studied faces were superimposed on that scene (“test display”). It was hypothesized that the scene cue would elicit expectancies about the face with which it was paired during the study trials, and consistent with this prediction, eye movements were drawn disproportionately to the associated face just 500–750 ms after presentation of the test display. The rapid onset of this effect is notable considering that the position of the associated face could not be predicted and that 500–750 ms is only enough time to permit at most two or three fixations. Furthermore, disproportionate viewing occurred over a second in advance of overt recognition, which suggests that the effect of relational memory on eye-movement behavior might have preceded conscious identification of the match. The results described above suggest that eye movements can be used to index relational memory retrieval prior to, and possibly even in the absence of, awareness. Accordingly, in the present experiment, we used fMRI with concurrent eye tracking to test whether activity in the hippocampus and/or other MTL regions would be correlated with eye-movement-based relational memory measures even when explicit recognition has failed. Participants in this experiment studied several face-scene pairs, and on each test trial, they were presented with a studied scene, followed by a brief delay, and finally presentation of three studied faces superimposed on that scene (see Figure 1). Critically, one of the faces had been paired with the scene during the study phase (henceforth referred to as the “matching face”), whereas the other two had been paired with different scenes. We expected that presentation of the scene cue would prompt retrieval of the associated face, resulting in increased viewing of that face when the test display was presented (Hannula et al., 2007Hannula D.E. Ryan J.D. Tranel D. Cohen N.J. Rapid onset relational memory effects are evident in eye movement behavior, but not in hippocampal amnesia.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2007; 19: 1690-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The proportion of time spent viewing the matching face was used as an indirect, eye-movement-based measure of relational memory retrieval. We expected that activity in the hippocampus following the scene cue would predict subsequent expression of relational memory in eye-movement behavior, even when conscious recollection failed. Participants made accurate responses on 62.29% (SD = 11.10%) of the trials, made incorrect responses on 25.3% (SD = 12.55%) of the trials, and responded “don't know” on 12.4% (SD = 10.23%) of the trials. Response times were faster for correct (2110.17 ms; SD = 630.80) than for incorrect (2671.73 ms; SD = 850.71) trials, t(13) = 4.35, p < .001. It was predicted that the scene cue would elicit relational memory retrieval and that this would manifest as rapid, disproportionate viewing of the matching face. Such an effect could not be supported by simple influences of item familiarity, because all three faces in each test display had been seen during the study trials. However, it is reasonable to suppose that participants might spend more time fixating any face that happened to be selected, even those selected in error. To account for this possibility, we examined whether participants spent more time viewing correctly identified matching faces than faces selected incorrectly. A repeated-measures ANOVA that examined viewing-time data as a function of face type (match, selected) and time bin (0–500, 500–1000, 1000–1500, and 1500–2000 ms) revealed that more time was spent viewing correctly identified matching faces (M = 0.48; SD = 0.08) than selected faces (M = 0.40; SD = 0.04), F(1,13) = 10.88, p < 0.01. Consistent with previous results (Hannula et al., 2007Hannula D.E. Ryan J.D. Tranel D. Cohen N.J. Rapid onset relational memory effects are evident in eye movement behavior, but not in hippocampal amnesia.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2007; 19: 1690-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), disproportionate viewing of matching faces emerged 500–1000ms after the three-face test display was presented (t(13) = 3.90, Bonferroni corrected p < .01; see Figure 2). These results confirm the rapid influence of relational memory on eye movement behavior, over and above any simple effect of response intention or execution. Initial fMRI analyses examined the relationship between MTL activity and eye-movement behavior by contrasting trials according to whether participants spent a disproportionate amount of time viewing the matching face (“DPM” trials) or a disproportionate amount of time viewing one of the nonmatching faces (“DPNM” trials). The criterion for disproportionate viewing in this analysis was that the proportion of time spent viewing one face had to exceed the proportion of time spent viewing the remaining two faces by at least 10% (see Supplemental Data for details). We reasoned that, on DPM trials, participants had successfully retrieved information about the previously studied face-scene relationship that was sufficient to influence subsequent eye-movement behavior, whereas this did not occur on DPNM trials (Figure S2 illustrates the time course of these viewing effects); importantly, response times to DPM (2296.66 ms, SD = 693.96) and DPNM (2583.81 ms, SD = 825.43) trials were not significantly different, t(13) = 1.50, p = 0.16. Based on the idea that the hippocampus and adjacent MTL cortical structures are critical for relational memory retrieval, we predicted that activity in these regions during the scene cue would be greater for DPM than for DPNM trials. Consistent with this prediction, BOLD signal was greater for DPM than for DPNM trials in two regions of the right hippocampus (anterior local maximum at x = 30, y = −12, z = −24; t(13) = 4.06; posterior local maxima at x = 24, y = −27, z = −9; t(13) = 3.94), the right parahippocampal cortex (local maxima at x = 30, y = −27, z = −18; t(13) = 3.46), and bilaterally in anterior regions of the parahippocampal gyrus, which likely correspond to the perirhinal cortex (Insausti et al., 1998Insausti R. Juottonen K. Soininen H. Insausti A.M. Partanen P.V. Laakso M.P. Pitkanen A. MR volumetric analysis of the human entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar cortices.AJNR Am. J. Neuroradiol. 1998; 19: 659-671PubMed Google Scholar; left local maxima at x = −33, y = −9, z = −36; t(13) = 4.21; right local maxima at x = 33, y = −18, z = −30; t(13) = 5.31). Representative trial-averaged time courses are presented in Figure 3A. Because response accuracy was greater for DPM trials (M = 83.30%, SD = 3.56) than for DPNM trials (M = 35.20%, SD = 3.80), it could be argued that correlations between MTL activity and eye movements simply reflected explicit relational memory retrieval. Accordingly, we performed follow-up fMRI analyses to more specifically test whether MTL activity might index eye-movement-based relational memory effects even on trials for which overt recognition failed. In these analyses, we focused specifically on trials for which participants failed to identify the matching face. A median split, based on the proportion of total viewing time directed to the matching face, was used to separately bin trials that were associated with relatively high or low viewing of that face (Figure S3 illustrates the time course of these viewing effects). A mapwise analysis in which activity during the scene cue was contrasted between incorrect high- and incorrect low-viewing trials revealed suprathreshold voxels in bilateral regions of the hippocampus (left local maxima: x = −24, y = −30, z = 6; t(13) = 5.39; right local maxima: x = 27, y = −27, z = −6; t(13) = 4.14; see Figure 3B). This result implicates the hippocampus in retrieval of information about previously studied face-scene relationships that is sufficient to influence eye-movement behavior even when explicit recognition has failed. The next fMRI analysis examined MTL activity during the scene cue as a function of accuracy, irrespective of eye-movement behavior. Activity during the scene cue was greater for correct than for incorrect trials in a region of left perirhinal cortex, with an activation peak close to the one observed for the disproportionate viewing contrast (local maxima at x = −21, y = 0, z = −36; t(13) = 5.65). Surprisingly, there were no suprathreshold activity differences in the hippocampus or the parahippocampal cortex during any part of the test trial. Outside of the MTL, however, several cortical regions (see Table S1) showed increased activity during correct, as compared with incorrect trials, including left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC: local maxima at x = −48, y = 27, z = 30; t(13) = 5.36) and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC: local maxima at x = −48, y = 42, z = 0; t(13) = 8.38; see Figure 4A). Results from several studies suggest that these prefrontal regions may implement control processes that support explicit memory attributions (e.g., Dobbins and Sanghoon, 2006Dobbins I.G. Sanghoon H. Cue- versus probe-dependent prefrontal cortex activity during contextual remembering.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2006; 18: 1439-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, Ranganath et al., 2000Ranganath C. Johnson M.K. D'Esposito M. Left anterior prefrontal activation increases with demands to recall specific perceptual information.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar; for a review see Fletcher and Henson, 2001Fletcher P.C. Henson R.N. Frontal lobes and human memory: insights from functional neuroimaging.Brain. 2001; 124: 849-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether PFC activity was also correlated with relational memory as expressed indirectly in eye-movement behavior, parameter estimates for DPM and DPNM trials were extracted from each prefrontal ROI. Following presentation of the scene cue, activity in both regions was greater for DPM than for DPNM trials (left DLPFC: t(13) = 2.70, p < 0.05; left VLPFC: t(13) = 2.34, p < 0.05); local maxima identified in the direct contrast of DPM versus DPNM trials are summarized in Table S2. As indicated earlier, however, eye movements were strongly associated with behavioral response accuracy, so this result does not necessarily indicate whether activity in these ROIs was predictive of eye-movement behavior even when recognition failed. To test this possibility, parameter estimates were extracted from the prefrontal ROIs for incorrect trials on which viewing of the match was high versus low. Unlike what was observed in the hippocampus, activity in these ROIs did not differentiate between incorrect high- and low-viewing trials (all t values ≤ 1.87, all p values > 0.05); local maxima identified in the direct contrast of incorrect high- versus incorrect low-viewing trials are summarized in Table S3. Results described above are consistent with the possibility that the hippocampus supports recovery of relational memory and that this information may be communicated to prefrontal regions in order to guide overt decision behavior. If this view is correct, then one might expect increased functional connectivity between the prefrontal regions and the MTL for correct, as compared to incorrect trials. To test this prediction, we ran functional connectivity analyses using the prefrontal ROIs identified in the accuracy contrast as seed regions. Estimates of activity during each phase of each trial were separately averaged within the seed regions for correct and incorrect trials, and these estimates were correlated with estimates of activity in the rest of the brain (Rissman et al., 2004Rissman J. Gazzaley A. D'Esposito M. Measuring functional connectivity during distinct stages of a cognitive task.Neuroimage. 2004; 23: 752-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar; see Supplemental Data for details). Voxels in the MTL that showed increased correlations with prefrontal ROIs on correct, as compared to incorrect trials were then identified. There were no statistically reliable changes in connectivity between lateral prefrontal regions and MTL structures during the scene cue or the delay period. During presentation of the three-face test display, however, functional connectivity between the left DLPFC seed region and several hippocampal regions (left anterior hippocampus: x = −21, y = −18, z = −18; t(13) = 4.01; left posterior hippocampus: x = −21, y = −24, z = −9; t(13) = 4.78; right anterior hippocampus: x = 24, y = −21, z = −15; t(13) = 3.53) was increased on correct, as compared to incorrect trials (see Figure 4B). Functional connectivity was also increased between the left VLPFC seed and regions in the left hippocampus (x = −21, y = −18, z = −12; t(13) = 3.58), left parahippocampal cortex (x = −18, y = −24, z = −21; t(13) = 5.90), and left perirhinal cortex (x = −18, y = −6, z = −33; t(13) = 4.36) during presentation of the three-face test display for correct versus incorrect trials. The aim of the current investigation was to determine whether the hippocampus and adjacent MTL structures support the expression of relational memory in eye-movement behavior, even when behavioral responses are incorrect. Such an outcome would be significant because most theories emphasize the role of MTL structures in conscious retrieval of past events (Aggleton and Brown, 1999Aggleton J.P. Brown M.W.

Results showed that activity in the hippocampus during presentation of the scene cue predicted subsequent viewing of the associated face during the three-face test display, even when participants failed to explicitly identify the match. In contrast, activity in PFC regions was sensitive to subsequent response accuracy but did not predict viewing of matching faces on incorrect trials. Finally, functional connectivity between lateral PFC and hippocampus was increased during presentation of the three-face test display on correct as compared to incorrect trials. Together, these results suggest that hippocampal activity may support the expression of relational memory and that recruitment of a broader network of regions may be required to use this information to guide overt behavior. Previous evidence taken to support hippocampal contributions to memory without awareness (Chun and Phelps, 1999Chun M.M. Phelps E.A.

Gabrieli J.D. Dissociation between explicit memory and configural memory in the human medial temporal lobe.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 2192-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For example, the failure of amnesic patients to show implicit response facilitation to repeated displays in the contextual cueing task (Chun and Phelps, 1999Chun M.M. Phelps E.A. Memory deficits for implicit contextual information in amnesic subjects with hippocampal damage.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) has since been attributed to extensive, rather than hippocampally limited, MTL lesions (Manns and Squire, 2001Manns J.R. Squire L.R. Perceptual learning, awareness, and the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 2001; 11: 776-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and results from a recent fMRI experiment (Preston and Gabrieli, 2008Preston A.R. Gabrieli J.D. Dissociation between explicit memory and configural memory in the human medial temporal lobe.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 2192-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed that hippocampal activation during performance of the contextual cueing task was tied to explicit recognition of repeated displays. At first blush, these results may seem to challenge the idea that the hippocampus can support expressions of relational memory without awareness. However, it has been argued that contextual cueing may depend on configural representations supported by extrahippocampal regions such as the perirhinal cortex rather than the kind of relational memory representations thought to depend on the hippocampus (Preston and Gabrieli, 2008Preston A.R. Gabrieli J.D. Dissociation between explicit memory and configural memory in the human medial temporal lobe.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 2192-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results reported here suggest that the hippocampus can support expressions of relational memory even when behavioral responses are incorrect. These results are compelling when considered along with previous findings that show that amnesic patients fail to look disproportionately at relational changes in previously studied scenes even though college-age participants do so despite being unaware of the manipulation (Ryan et al., 2000Ryan J.D. Althoff R.R. Whitlow S. Cohen N.J. Amnesia is a deficit in relational memory.Psychol. Sci. 2000; 11: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Our results also complement previous fMRI research that has shown increased hippocampal activity during presentation of subliminally presented face-occupation pairs (e.g., Degonda et al., 2005Degonda N. Mondadori C.R. Bosshardt S. Schmidt C.F. Boesiger P. Nitsch R.M. Hock C. Henke K.

https://openalex.org/W1993042337,"Several aspects of perception, particularly those pertaining to vision, are closely linked to the occipital alpha (alpha) rhythm. However, how the alpha rhythm relates to the activity of neurons that convey primary visual information is unknown. Here we show that in behaving cats, thalamocortical neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) that operate in a conventional relay-mode form two groups where the cumulative firing is subject to a cyclic suppression that is centered on the negative alpha rhythm peak in one group and on the positive peak in the other. This leads to an effective temporal framing of relay-mode output and results from phasic inhibition from LGN interneurons, which in turn are rhythmically excited by thalamocortical neurons that exhibit high-threshold bursts. These results provide a potential cellular substrate for linking the alpha rhythm to perception and further underscore the central role of inhibition in controlling spike timing during cognitively relevant brain oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1981732883,"Background An association was previously established between facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy) and intranasal administration of an inactivated influenza virosome vaccine containing an enzymatically active Escherichia coli Heat Labile Toxin (LT) adjuvant. The individual component(s) responsible for paralysis were not identified, and the vaccine was withdrawn. Methodology/Principal Findings Subjects participating in two contemporaneous non-randomized Phase 1 clinical trials of nasal subunit vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency Virus and tuberculosis, both of which employed an enzymatically inactive non-toxic mutant LT adjuvant (LTK63), underwent active follow-up for adverse events using diary-cards and clinical examination. Two healthy subjects experienced transient peripheral facial nerve palsies 44 and 60 days after passive nasal instillation of LTK63, possibly a result of retrograde axonal transport after neuronal ganglioside binding or an inflammatory immune response, but without exaggerated immune responses to LTK63. Conclusions/Significance While the unique anatomical predisposition of the facial nerve to compression suggests nasal delivery of neuronal-binding LT–derived adjuvants is inadvisable, their continued investigation as topical or mucosal adjuvants and antigens appears warranted on the basis of longstanding safety via oral, percutaneous, and other mucosal routes."
https://openalex.org/W2012565553,"Episodic memory retrieval is thought to involve reinstatement of the neurocognitive processes engaged when an episode was encoded. Prior fMRI studies and computational models have suggested that reinstatement is limited to instances in which specific episodic details are recollected. We used multivoxel pattern-classification analyses of fMRI data to investigate how reinstatement is associated with different memory judgments, particularly those accompanied by recollection versus a feeling of familiarity (when recollection is absent). Classifiers were trained to distinguish between brain activity patterns associated with different encoding tasks and were subsequently applied to recognition-related fMRI data to determine the degree to which patterns were reinstated. Reinstatement was evident during both recollection- and familiarity-based judgments, providing clear evidence that reinstatement is not sufficient for eliciting a recollective experience. The findings are interpreted as support for a continuous, recollection-related neural signal that has been central to recent debate over the nature of recognition memory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1989768699,"Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) specify axon/dendrite fate and axonal growth of neurons through protein-protein interactions. Their functions in presynaptic biology remain unknown. Here, we identify the presynaptic N-type Ca(2+) channel (CaV2.2) as a CRMP-2-interacting protein. CRMP-2 binds directly to CaV2.2 in two regions: the channel domain I-II intracellular loop and the distal C terminus. Both proteins co-localize within presynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons. Overexpression in hippocampal neurons of a CRMP-2 protein fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein caused a significant increase in Ca(2+) channel current density, whereas lentivirus-mediated CRMP-2 knockdown abolished this effect. Interestingly, the increase in Ca(2+) current density was not due to a change in channel gating. Rather, cell surface biotinylation studies showed an increased number of CaV2.2 at the cell surface in CRMP-2-overexpressing neurons. These neurons also exhibited a significant increase in vesicular release in response to a depolarizing stimulus. Depolarization of CRMP-2-enhanced green fluorescent protein-overexpressing neurons elicited a significant increase in release of glutamate compared with control neurons. Toxin block of Ca(2+) entry via CaV2.2 abolished this stimulated release. Thus, the CRMP-2-Ca(2+) channel interaction represents a novel mechanism for modulation of Ca(2+) influx into nerve terminals and, hence, of synaptic strength."

The remarkable plasticity of the trisynaptic hippocampal network is suggested to underlie several neural processes including new acquisition of spatial memory (Goodrich-Hunsaker et al., 2008Goodrich-Hunsaker N.J.

Rearing on hind legs, environmental novelty, and the hippocampal formation.Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 17: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). While the three best-studied anatomical hippocampal subregions, CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG), must act cooperatively to produce a functional hippocampus, strong evidence demonstrates that each subregion performs its own specific, specialized operations. For example, region CA1 is involved in the temporal pattern association and temporal pattern completion aspects of memory formation (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), while subregion CA3 supports spatial pattern association and spatial pattern completion (Kesner, 2007bKesner R.P. Behavioral functions of the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus.Learn. Mem. 2007; 14: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The DG, on the other hand, orthogonalizes sensory information cumulated from the entorhinal cortex (EC) and, together with area CA3, underlies spatial pattern separation (Kesner et al., 2004Kesner R.P. Lee I. Gilbert P. A behavioral assessment of hippocampal function based on a subregional analysis.Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 15: 333-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Detection of spatial novelty depends on both area CA3 and the DG (Kesner et al., 2004Kesner R.P. Lee I. Gilbert P. A behavioral assessment of hippocampal function based on a subregional analysis.Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 15: 333-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and the perirhinal cortex (Kumaran and Maguire, 2007Kumaran D. Maguire E.A. Which computational mechanisms operate in the hippocampus during novelty detection?.Hippocampus. 2007; 17: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because novelty detection is a prerequisite for novelty exploration, plasticity mechanisms within these regions are ideally suited to serve a role in the generation of exploratory behavior, a possibility we explore here. Enhancement of plasticity via genetic manipulation in the forebrain can improve long-term spatial memory formation (Malleret et al., 2001Malleret G. Haditsch U. Genoux D. Jones M.W. Bliss T.V. Vanhoose A.M. Weitlauf C. Kandel E.R. Winder D.G. Mansuy I.M.

Here we report the emergence of specific increases in exploration, facilitated plasticity, and enhanced rapid acquisition of spatial memory following inducible, modest overexpression of neuronal calcium sensor 1 (Ncs1) selectively in the adult DG of a transgenic mouse line (DGNCS-1 mice). NCS-1 plays a critical role in several forms of neuromuscular physiology and short-term neuroplasticity (Burgoyne, 2007Burgoyne R.D.

In mammals, Ncs1 is highly expressed in the DG and is dynamically regulated during in vivo perforant path long-term potentiation (LTP) (Genin et al., 2001Genin A. Davis S. Meziane H. Doyere V. Jeromin A. Roder J. Mallet J. Laroche S. Regulated expression of the neuronal calcium sensor-1 gene during long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus in vivo.Neuroscience. 2001; 106: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but whether the increase in Ncs1 mRNA is a result of LTP or a factor in its induction or maintenance is unknown. Here we show that DGNCS-1 mice have a lower threshold and higher ceiling for LTP in the corticohippocampal medial perforant path (MPP). This is exciting because LTP is widely considered a molecular model for learning and memory in mammals, and Ncs1 is already known to control memory in C. elegans (Gomez et al., 2001Gomez M. De Castro E. Guarin E. Sasakura H. Kuhara A. Mori I. Bartfai T. Bargmann C.I. Nef P. Ca2+ signaling via the neuronal calcium sensor-1 regulates associative learning and memory in C. elegans.Neuron. 2001; 30: 241-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), an invertebrate system. Though the neural circuits important for NCS-1-mediated memory in C. elegans were established, molecular mechanisms remain elusive and no role for NCS-1 in learning and memory in mammals has been reported. An enhancement in rapid acquisition of spatial memory in DGNCS-1 mice is a compelling demonstration of a role for NCS-1 in learning and memory in higher organisms, where the nervous system is more complex (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3158) Google Scholar) and physiological correlates exist (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). NCS-1 binds dopamine type-2 receptors (D2R), regulates D2R phosphorylation through an interaction with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), and controls D2R surface expression in HEK293 cells (Kabbani et al., 2002Kabbani N. Negyessy L. Lin R. Goldman-Rakic P. Levenson R. Interaction with neuronal calcium sensor NCS-1 mediates desensitization of the D2 dopamine receptor.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8476-8486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence for an in vivo role for NCS-1 in D2R regulation. Here we show increased surface expression of D2R selectively in the DG molecular layer of DGNCS-1 mice, where dopaminergic modulation of synaptic plasticity may be critical to memory formation (Korz and Frey, 2007Korz V.

Akaishi T. Misawa M. Involvement of dopamine D(2) receptors in the induction of long-term potentiation in the basolateral amygdala-dentate gyrus pathway of anesthetized rats.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and pharmacological activation of D2R improves working memory (Wilkerson and Levin, 1999Wilkerson A. Levin E.D. Ventral hippocampal dopamine D1 and D2 systems and spatial working memory in rats.Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and alleviates scopolamine-induced passive-avoidance amnesia (Sigala et al., 1997Sigala S. Missale C. Spano P. Opposite effects of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors on learning and memory in the rat.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 336: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Yet, pharmacological antagonism of D2R can impair Morris water maze learning if administered immediately posttraining (Setlow and McGaugh, 2000Setlow B. McGaugh J.L. D2 dopamine receptor blockade immediately post-training enhances retention in hidden and visible platform versions of the water maze.Learn. Mem. 2000; 7: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and how D2R is regulated during memory acquisition is unclear. Many of these studies employed systemic injections that affect the entire CNS, whereas the function of D2Rs is likely anatomically distinct. In DGNCS-1 mice, changes to D2R surface expression in the DG MPP may directly facilitate plasticity and enhance spatial memory because these effects were blocked by a small cell-permeant D2R/NCS-1 Interfering Peptide (DNIP) designed to compete with NCS-1 binding to the D2R. Because human NCS1 expression is associated with psychiatric disorders (Koh et al., 2003Koh P.O. Undie A.S. Kabbani N. Levenson R. Goldman-Rakic P.S. Lidow M.S. Up-regulation of neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic and bipolar patients.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and D2R is a major target for antipsychotic treatment, it is also of clinical interest to investigate what role the interaction between NCS-1 and D2R plays in the mammalian nervous system. Here we restrict our focus to the DG and provide insight for how this specialized brain area controls exploration and spatial memory. We generated mice with inducible overexpression of rat Ncs1 selectively in DG granule neurons using the rtTA2-M2 system (Michalon et al., 2005Michalon A. Koshibu K. Baumgartel K. Spirig D.H. Mansuy I.M. Inducible and neuron-specific gene expression in the adult mouse brain with the rtTA2S-M2 system.Genesis. 2005; 43: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Both the tetO-ncs (GenBank construct submission FJ756409) and rtTA2 (construct described in Michalon et al., 2005Michalon A. Koshibu K. Baumgartel K. Spirig D.H. Mansuy I.M. Inducible and neuron-specific gene expression in the adult mouse brain with the rtTA2S-M2 system.Genesis. 2005; 43: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) lines were created on the identical background strain in order to exclude potential differences between genotypes arising from contaminating donor alleles (Armstrong et al., 2006Armstrong N.J. Brodnicki T.C. Speed T.P. Mind the gap: analysis of marker-assisted breeding strategies for inbred mouse strains.Mamm. Genome. 2006; 17: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By using the rat gene to create the tetO-ncs mice, silent single nucleotide divergence between mouse and rat provided a simple reverse-transcriptase-based discernment of exogenous versus endogenous Ncs-1 mRNA while conserving the NCS-1 amino acid sequence (Figure 1B). Camk2a-rtTA2 mice (rtTA2) bred to an rtTA-responsive-teto-LacZ reporter line showed prominent rtTA2 expression in the dorsal DG cells of the hippocampal formation (Figure 1C). Rat Ncs1 expression was doxycyline (dox)-dependent and only occurred in double transgenic mice (DGNCS-1) positive for both the rtTA2 and tetO-ncs transgenes (Figure 1D). Quantitative westerns of microdissected brain tissue (Figure S10 available online) showed a 40% increase in NCS-1 selectively in the DG (Figures 1E and 1F). Similarly, immunofluorescence analysis of confocal z-stacks from the MPP demonstrated a 40% increase in NCS-1 reactivity (Figures 1G–1I). Immunohistochemistry on frozen sagittal sections also demonstrated a subtle increase in NCS-1 levels selectively in the DG (Figure 1J). Because the rat and NCS-1 proteins are identical, posttranslational modifications and subcellular targeting of the exogenous protein should track the endogenous protein. Throughout all experimental analyses, the other two transgenic genotypes (tetO-ncs and rtTA2) were not statistically different from wild-type (for example: in NCS-1 DG quantification: p = 0.16, p = 0.26; in rearing in the safe environment: p = 0.16, p = 0.55; in time spent in the target quadrant of the Morris water maze: p = 0.84, p = 0.47), and the three genotypes were pooled for comparison against DGNCS-1 mice (Figures S1A and S1B). Prior to any experimentation, subjects were handled for a minimum of 10 min per day for 10 consecutive mornings. Experiments were conducted on DGNCS-1 and littermate control subjects on dox for at least 6 days. This excluded any effects due to minor weight loss (see Figure S1D). Moreover, all experiments were conducted during the same circadian window to reduce phasic variation (Cain et al., 2008Cain S.W. McDonald R.J. Ralph M.R. Time stamp in conditioned place avoidance can be set to different circadian phases.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2008; 89: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, Valentinuzzi et al., 2008Valentinuzzi V.S. Neto S.P. Carneiro B.T. Santana K.S. Araujo J.F. Ralph M.R. Memory for time of training modulates performance on a place conditioning task in marmosets.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2008; 89: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The hippocampus is suggested to be important for rearing behavior under certain conditions (Lever et al., 2006Lever C. Burton S. O'Keefe J. Rearing on hind legs, environmental novelty, and the hippocampal formation.Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 17: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus we compared rearing behavior in two separate environments using two separate cohorts of animals. In a dimly lit, nonfearful environment, DGNCS-1 subjects spent nearly twice as much time rearing compared to their littermate controls (Figure 2A). DGNCS-1 mice also spent less time inactive (still) in this environment (Figure 2C), suggesting that more time was spent exploring. We know the increase in rearing and decrease in activity is not a general effect on locomotion because there were no differences between the genotypes in any of the standard measures when we examined a second cohort of animals in an overhead-lit, fearful environment (Figures 2B and 2D), where rearing is escape-oriented. To further explore this tendency for increased exploration, we designed an experiment similar to the radial arms maze in which the latency and number of exploratory events for novel environments in either dim or bright lighting could be easily determined. We term this experiment the “New Frontier Exploration Test” (see Supplemental Data). In the dimly lit version of this task, DGNCS-1 mice demonstrated a nearly 2-fold increase in the number of frontiers visited and a nearly 2-fold decrease in the latency to explore one or all four new frontiers (Figures 2E and 2G). Yet, no genotypic differences in either measure were observed when bright overhead lighting was used (Figures 2F and 2H). DGNCS-1 subjects also spent more time exploring the holes of the hole board test (Figure 2I) and spent longer exploring the very first hole they encountered, a behavior repeated for each time they encountered a new hole (Figure 2J). Littermate control and DGNCS-1 subjects demonstrated similar anxiety as measured by the light/dark box (Figures 2K and 2L), indicating that this behavior does not confound the exploration tasks. Elevation of DG NCS-1 did not affect basal synaptic transmission along the MPP (Figures S2A and S2B), the major excitatory innervation of the hippocampus and the primary source of sensory information relayed from the EC. Synaptic responses possessed double exponential decay (not shown) as well as short-term paired-pulse depression (PPD) (Figure S2C), confirming electrode placement along the medial and not lateral perforant path (Bramham and Sarvey, 1996Bramham C.R. Sarvey J.M. Endogenous activation of mu and delta-1 opioid receptors is required for long-term potentiation induction in the lateral perforant path: dependence on GABAergic inhibition.J.

When we stimulated to induce LTP along the MPP by applying an above-threshold stimulus (four 100 Hz trains), DGNCS-1 slices demonstrated more robust plasticity than those of their littermate controls (Figure 3A). Bath application of the NMDAR antagonist D-APV abolished LTP in DGNCS-1 mice (Figure 3A). There is a strong frequency dependence for the induction of LTP in the DG, whereby tetanic stimulation with lower frequencies of the β and γ range (10–75 Hz) typically fail to elicit LTP (Rick and Milgram, 1996Rick J.T. Milgram N.W. Frequency dependence of long-term potentiation and depression in the dentate gyrus of the freely moving rat.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This high threshold for plasticity is believed to be critical for sparse encoding of the external world and to underlie learning and memory functions of the dentate (Barry et al., 2006Barry C.

Hippocampal synaptic enhancement and information storage within a distributed memory system.Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 408-415Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (897) Google Scholar). To investigate if not only the level, but also the threshold of LTP, was altered, we delivered a below-threshold stimulus using four tetanic trains at half the previous frequency. Strikingly, DGNCS-1 slices showed strong LTP even with this weak stimulation, while control slices showed very modest short-term potentiation and failed to elicit LTP (Figure 3B). DGNCS-1 slices stimulated with the below-threshold stimulus attained similar levels of LTP as compared to control slices given a strong stimulus (compare white bar in Figure 3A to black bar in Figure 3B). Maximal potentiation was also greater in DGNCS-1 mice following repetitive weak stimulation (Figure 3C). Thus, by overexpressing Ncs1 in the DG, we created a mouse with a selective enhancement in EC-DG NMDAR-dependent plasticity. Importantly, DGNCS-1 slices and littermate control slices had equivalent LTP in area CA1 (Figure 3D), further demonstrating the regional selectivity of the plasticity enhancement. Due to the role of the DG in conjunctive encoding (O'Reilly and McClelland, 1994O'Reilly R.C. McClelland J.L.

Dentate gyrus NMDA receptors mediate rapid pattern separation in the hippocampal network.Science. 2007; 317: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), it is possible that modulating NMDAR-dependent plasticity at this synapse will alter representations of the external environment. If such an alteration led to a distortion of environmental cues, it should be discernable in space-dependent, cognitive tasks. Thus, we examined the performance of the DGNCS-1 mice in two spatial learning and memory paradigms. We first chose the object recognition task because it provides an elegant method to investigate both spatial and nonspatial one-trial, nonaversive memory. Moreover, object recognition is an ethological paradigm that captures latent learning in the absence of explicit rewards. During training, DGNCS-1 and littermate control subjects spent equivalent time investigating the objects and no differences between genotypes were observed in ambulation, anxiety, grooming, or risk-assessing behaviors (Figure S3). Yet, as previously observed, DGNCS-1 subjects spent more time rearing (Figure S3). In a standard short-term memory paradigm (15 min habituation/training; see Figure S4), both DGNCS-1 and littermate control mice demonstrated a strong preference for the displaced and novel objects, suggesting the change in DG NMDAR-dependent plasticity did not disrupt spatial learning, at least not in this task (Figure 4A). This raised the exciting possibility that facilitated DG synaptic plasticity could lead to superior neural encoding of space and enhance learning. Therefore, we shortened the time given for subjects to become familiar with objects and object locations and again tested short-term memory. Remarkably, only the DGNCS-1 group showed an ability to discriminate between displaced and stationary objects in this harder version of the task (Figure 4B). It is well established that the DG is involved in short-term memory (Kesner, 2007aKesner R.P. A behavioral analysis of dentate gyrus function.Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 163: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), while the involvement of the DG in long-term memory has been less explored. We therefore trained the subjects in a third paradigm for which control animals demonstrate short-term memory (Figure S5), but not long-term memory. Remarkably, DGNCS-1 animals were still able to discriminate between displaced and stationary objects even after a 24 hr interval (Figure 4C). Therefore, DG plasticity may promote the rapid acquisition of both short- and long-term spatial memory. To investigate if the spatial memory enhancements in the DGNCS-1 mice would translate to another hippocampus-dependent task, we turned to the Morris water maze. In a stringent paradigm using ample distal spatial cues and a large platform in a small pool, subjects were trained with a single trial and then tested for retention of the platform location in a probe (no platform) trial 24 hr later. This procedure was repeated three times using three different platform locations, and the performance of each subject was averaged over all three sessions (see Figure S4 for experimental design). Not surprisingly, control animals failed to demonstrate a preference for the target quadrant during the probe trial (Figure 4D). DGNCS-1 animals, however, spent nearly 50% more time searching in the target quadrant than they did in any of the other three quadrants, suggesting they learned and recalled the platform location. Though DGNCS-1 animals did not have a faster latency to the counter location (set as twice the platform area) (Figure 4E), they did pass though it more frequently (Figure 4F) and spent more time searching that area of the maze (Figure 4G). We also assessed learning and memory i"
https://openalex.org/W2031795384,"Background The unique metabolism of tumors was described many years ago by Otto Warburg, who identified tumor cells with increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial activity. However, “aerobic glycolysis” generates fewer ATP per glucose molecule than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, so in terms of energy production, it is unclear how increasing a less efficient process provides tumors with a growth advantage. Methods/Findings We carried out a screen for loss of genetic elements in pancreatic tumor cells that accelerated their growth as tumors, and identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L28 (MRPL28). Knockdown of MRPL28 in these cells decreased mitochondrial activity, and increased glycolysis, but paradoxically, decreased cellular growth in vitro. Following Warburg's observations, this mutation causes decreased mitochondrial function, compensatory increase in glycolysis and accelerated growth in vivo. Likewise, knockdown of either mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) or cytochrome oxidase had a similar effect. Conversely, expression of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) increased oxygen consumption and decreased tumor growth. Finally, treatment of tumor bearing animals with dichloroacetate (DCA) increased pyruvate consumption in the mitochondria, increased total oxygen consumption, increased tumor hypoxia and slowed tumor growth. Conclusions We interpret these findings to show that non-oncogenic genetic changes that alter mitochondrial metabolism can regulate tumor growth through modulation of the consumption of oxygen, which appears to be a rate limiting substrate for tumor proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2162648242,"Experience-driven activity plays an essential role in the development of brain circuitry during critical periods of early postnatal life, a process that depends upon a dynamic balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals. Since general anesthetics are powerful pharmacological modulators of neuronal activity, an important question is whether and how these drugs can affect the development of synaptic networks. To address this issue, we examined here the impact of anesthetics on synapse growth and dynamics. We show that exposure of young rodents to anesthetics that either enhance GABAergic inhibition or block NMDA receptors rapidly induce a significant increase in dendritic spine density in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. This effect is developmentally regulated; it is transient but lasts for several days and is also reproduced by selective antagonists of excitatory receptors. Analyses of spine dynamics in hippocampal slice cultures reveals that this effect is mediated through an increased rate of protrusions formation, a better stabilization of newly formed spines, and leads to the formation of functional synapses. Altogether, these findings point to anesthesia as an important modulator of spine dynamics in the developing brain and suggest the existence of a homeostatic process regulating spine formation as a function of neural activity. Importantly, they also raise concern about the potential impact of these drugs on human practice, when applied during critical periods of development in infants."
https://openalex.org/W1965865340,"Electroclinical uncoupling of neonatal seizures refers to electrographic seizure activity that is not clinically manifest. Uncoupling increases after treatment with Phenobarbital, which enhances the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) conductance. The effects of GABA(A)R activation depend on the intracellular Cl(-) concentration ([Cl(-)](i)) that is determined by the inward Cl(-) transporter NKCC1 and the outward Cl(-) transporter KCC2. Differential maturation of Cl(-) transport observed in cortical versus subcortical regions should alter the efficacy of GABA-mediated inhibition. In perinatal rat pups, most thalamic neurons maintained low [Cl(-)](i) and were inhibited by GABA. Phenobarbital suppressed thalamic seizure activity. Most neocortical neurons maintained higher [Cl(-)](i), and were excited by GABA(A)R activation. Phenobarbital had insignificant anticonvulsant responses in the neocortex until NKCC1 was blocked. Regional differences in the ontogeny of Cl(-) transport may thus explain why seizure activity in the cortex is not suppressed by anticonvulsants that block the transmission of seizure activity through subcortical networks."
https://openalex.org/W1995489138,"Decorin is the archetypal small leucine rich repeat proteoglycan of the vertebrate extracellular matrix (ECM). With its glycosaminoglycuronan chain, it is responsible for stabilizing inter-fibrillar organization. Type I collagen is the predominant member of the fibrillar collagen family, fulfilling both organizational and structural roles in animal ECMs. In this study, interactions between decoron (the decorin core protein) and binding sites in the d and e1 bands of the type I collagen fibril were investigated through molecular modeling of their respective X-ray diffraction structures. Previously, it was proposed that a model-based, highly curved concave decoron interacts with a single collagen molecule, which would form extensive van der Waals contacts and give rise to strong non-specific binding. However, the large well-ordered aggregate that is the collagen fibril places significant restraints on modes of ligand binding and necessitates multi-collagen molecular contacts. We present here a relatively high-resolution model of the decoron-fibril collagen complex. We find that the respective crystal structures complement each other well, although it is the monomeric form of decoron that shows the most appropriate shape complementarity with the fibril surface and favorable calculated energies of interaction. One molecule of decoron interacts with four to six collagen molecules, and the binding specificity relies on a large number of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, primarily with the collagen motifs KXGDRGE and AKGDRGE (d and e1 bands). This work helps us to understand collagen-decorin interactions and the molecular architecture of the fibrillar ECM in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2000560379,"Regulation of translation factor activity plays a major role in protein synthesis-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity. We examined translational control across the critical period of Arc synthesis underlying consolidation of long term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of intact, anesthetized rats. LTP induction by high frequency stimulation (HFS) evoked phosphorylation of the cap-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and dephosphorylation of eIF2α on a protracted time course matching the time-window of Arc translation. Local infusion of the ERK inhibitor U0126 inhibited LTP maintenance and Arc protein expression, blocked changes in eIF4E and eIF2α phosphorylation state, and prevented initiation complex (eIF4F) formation. Surprisingly, inhibition of the mTOR protein complex 1 (mTORC1) with rapamycin did not impair LTP maintenance or Arc synthesis nor did it inhibit eIF4F formation or phosphorylation of eIF4E. Rapamycin nonetheless blocked mTOR signaling to p70 S6 kinase and ribosomal protein S6 and inhibited synthesis of components of the translational machinery. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we show that Arc protein expression depends on dual, ERK-dependent transcription and translation. Arc translation is selectively blocked by pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase (MNK), the kinase coupling ERK to eIF4E phosphorylation. Furthermore, MNK signaling was required for eIF4F formation. These results support a dominant role for ERK-MNK signaling in control of translational initiation and Arc synthesis during LTP consolidation in the dentate gyrus. In contrast, mTORC1 signaling is activated but nonessential for Arc synthesis and LTP.

https://openalex.org/W1981201955,"Addictive drugs induce a dopamine signal that contributes to the initiation of addiction, and the dopamine signal influences drug-associated memories that perpetuate drug use. The addiction process shares many commonalities with the synaptic plasticity mechanisms normally attributed to learning and memory. Environmental stimuli repeatedly linked to addictive drugs become learned associations, and those stimuli come to elicit memories or sensations that motivate continued drug use. Applying in vivo recording techniques to freely moving mice, we show that physiologically relevant concentrations of the addictive drug nicotine directly cause in vivo hippocampal synaptic potentiation of the kind that underlies learning and memory. The drug-induced long-term synaptic plasticity required a local hippocampal dopamine signal. Disrupting general dopamine signaling prevented the nicotine-induced synaptic plasticity and conditioned place preference. These results suggest that dopaminergic signaling serves as a functional label of salient events by enabling and scaling synaptic plasticity that underlies drug-induced associative memory."

The taxon shares many anatomical characters with Middle Jurassic East Asian sauropods, while it is strongly dissimilar to Lower and Middle Jurassic South American and Indian forms. A possible explanation for this pattern is a separation of Laurasian and South Gondwanan Middle Jurassic sauropod faunas by geographic barriers. Integration of phylogenetic analyses and paleogeographic data reveals congruence between early sauropod evolution and hypotheses about Jurassic paleoclimate and phytogeography.Spinophorosaurus demonstrates that many putatively derived characters of Middle Jurassic East Asian sauropods are plesiomorphic for eusauropods, while South Gondwanan eusauropods may represent a specialized line.

https://openalex.org/W2119757357,"Background Gray wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park (YNP) after a >70 year absence, and as part of recovery efforts, the population has been closely monitored. In 1999 and 2005, pup survival was significantly reduced, suggestive of disease outbreaks. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed sympatric wolf, coyote (Canis latrans), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) serologic data from YNP, spanning 1991–2007, to identify long-term patterns of pathogen exposure, identify associated risk factors, and examine evidence for disease-induced mortality among wolves for which there were survival data. We found high, constant exposure to canine parvovirus (wolf seroprevalence: 100%; coyote: 94%), canine adenovirus-1 (wolf pups [0.5–0.9 yr]: 91%, adults [≥1 yr]: 96%; coyote juveniles [0.5–1.5 yrs]: 18%, adults [≥1.6 yrs]: 83%), and canine herpesvirus (wolf: 87%; coyote juveniles: 23%, young adults [1.6–4.9 yrs]: 51%, old adults [≥5 yrs]: 87%) suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within YNP wolves and coyotes. An average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, although individuals’ odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable. Wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV) was temporally variable, with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005, and perhaps a smaller, isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of YNP in 2002. The years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence, suggesting that CDV contributed to the observed mortality. Conclusions/Significance Of the pathogens we examined, none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in YNP. However, CDV appears capable of causing short-term population declines. Additional information on how and where CDV is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected might be useful for future management of the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population."
https://openalex.org/W1963750278,"Genome-wide screens were performed to identify transmembrane proteins that mediate axonal growth, guidance and target field innervation of somatosensory neurons. One gene, Linx (alias Islr2), encoding a leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin (LIG) family protein, is expressed in a subset of developing sensory and motor neurons. Domain and genomic structures of Linx and other LIG family members suggest that they are evolutionarily related to Trk receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Several LIGs, including Linx, are expressed in subsets of somatosensory and motor neurons, and select members interact with TrkA and Ret RTKs. Moreover, axonal projection defects in mice harboring a null mutation in Linx resemble those in mice lacking Ngf, TrkA, and Ret. In addition, Linx modulates NGF-TrkA- and GDNF-GFRalpha1/Ret-mediated axonal extension in cultured sensory and motor neurons, respectively. These findings show that LIGs physically interact with RTKs and modulate their activities to control axonal extension, guidance and branching."
https://openalex.org/W2069978572,"Background Up until recently the only available experimental (high resolution) structure of a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) was that of bovine rhodopsin. In the past few years the determination of GPCR structures has accelerated with three new receptors, as well as squid rhodopsin, being successfully crystallized. All share a common molecular architecture of seven transmembrane helices and can therefore serve as templates for building molecular models of homologous GPCRs. However, despite the common general architecture of these structures key differences do exist between them. The choice of which experimental GPCR structure(s) to use for building a comparative model of a particular GPCR is unclear and without detailed structural and sequence analyses, could be arbitrary. The aim of this study is therefore to perform a systematic and detailed analysis of sequence-structure relationships of known GPCR structures. Methodology We analyzed in detail conserved and unique sequence motifs and structural features in experimentally-determined GPCR structures. Deeper insight into specific and important structural features of GPCRs as well as valuable information for template selection has been gained. Using key features a workflow has been formulated for identifying the most appropriate template(s) for building homology models of GPCRs of unknown structure. This workflow was applied to a set of 14 human family A GPCRs suggesting for each the most appropriate template(s) for building a comparative molecular model. Conclusions The available crystal structures represent only a subset of all possible structural variation in family A GPCRs. Some GPCRs have structural features that are distributed over different crystal structures or which are not present in the templates suggesting that homology models should be built using multiple templates. This study provides a systematic analysis of GPCR crystal structures and a consistent method for identifying suitable templates for GPCR homology modelling that will help to produce more reliable three-dimensional models."
https://openalex.org/W1994093923,"Lipin-1 is a protein that has dual functions as a phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP) and a nuclear transcriptional coactivator. It remains unknown how the nuclear localization and coactivator functions of lipin-1 are regulated. Here, we show that lipin-1 (including both the alpha and beta isoforms) is modified by sumoylation at two consensus sumoylation sites. We are unable to detect sumoylation of the related proteins lipin-2 and lipin-3. Lipin-1 is sumoylated at relatively high levels in brain, where lipin-1α is the predominant form. In cultured embryonic cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, ectopically expressed lipin-1α is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and the nuclear localization is abrogated by mutating the consensus sumyolation motifs. The sumoylation site mutant of lipin-1α loses the capacity to coactivate the transcriptional (co-) activators PGC-1α and MEF2, consistent with its nuclear exclusion. Thus, these results show that sumoylation facilitates the nuclear localization and transcriptional coactivator behavior of lipin-1α that we observe in cultured neuronal cells, and suggest that lipin-1α may act as a sumoylation-regulated transcriptional coactivator in brain."
https://openalex.org/W1983610014,"Opioids are commonly used as effective analgesics for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. However, considerable individual differences have been widely observed in sensitivity to opioid analgesics. We focused on a G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel subunit, GIRK2, that is an important molecule in opioid transmission. In our initial polymorphism search, a total of nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the whole exon, 5′-flanking, and exon-intron boundary regions of the KCNJ6 gene encoding GIRK2. Among them, G-1250A and A1032G were selected as representative SNPs for further association studies. In an association study of 129 subjects who underwent major open abdominal surgery, the A/A genotype in the A1032G SNP and -1250G/1032A haplotype were significantly associated with increased postoperative analgesic requirements compared with other genotypes and haplotypes. The total dose (mean±SEM) of rescue analgesics converted to equivalent oral morphine doses was 20.45±9.27 mg, 10.84±2.24 mg, and 13.07±2.39 mg for the A/A, A/G, and G/G genotypes in the A1032G SNP, respectively. Additionally, KCNJ6 gene expression levels in the 1032A/A subjects were significantly decreased compared with the 1032A/G and 1032G/G subjects in a real-time quantitative PCR analysis using human brain tissues, suggesting that the 1032A/A subjects required more analgesics because of lower KCNJ6 gene expression levels and consequently insufficient analgesic effects. The results indicate that the A1032G SNP and G-1250A/A1032G haplotype could serve as markers that predict increased analgesic requirements. Our findings will provide valuable information for achieving satisfactory pain control and open new avenues for personalized pain treatment."

When polymerase II encounters 8-oxoG in the DNA template strand, it can misincorporate adenine, which forms a Hoogsteen bp with 8-oxoG at the active center. This requires rotation of the 8-oxoG base from the standard anti- to an uncommon syn-conformation, which likely occurs during 8-oxoG loading into the active site. The misincorporated adenine escapes intrinsic proofreading, resulting in transcriptional mutagenesis that is observed directly by mass spectrometric RNA analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2018543730,"Mutations in the gene coding for AIPL1 cause Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a severe form of childhood blindness. The severity in disease is reflected in the complete loss of vision and rapid photoreceptor degeneration in the retinas of mice deficient in AIPL1. Our previous observations suggest that rod photoreceptor degeneration in retinas lacking AIPL1 is due to the massive reduction in levels of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma). To date, the crucial link between AIPL1 and the stability of PDE6 subunits is not known. In this study using ex vivo pulse label analysis, we demonstrate that AIPL1 is not involved in the synthesis of PDE6 subunits. However, ex vivo pulse-chase analysis clearly shows that in the absence of AIPL1, rod PDE6 subunits are rapidly degraded by proteasomes. We further demonstrate that this rapid degradation of PDE6 is due to the essential role of AIPL1 in the proper assembly of synthesized individual PDE6 subunits. In addition, using a novel monoclonal antibody generated against AIPL1, we show that the catalytic subunit (alpha) of PDE6 associates with AIPL1 in retinal extracts. Our studies establish that AIPL1 interacts with the catalytic subunit (alpha) of PDE6 and is needed for the proper assembly of functional rod PDE6 subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1983706294,"Einstein's original description of Brownian motion established a direct relationship between thermally-excited random forces and the transport properties of a submicron particle in a viscous liquid. Recent work based on reconstituted actin filament networks suggests that nonthermal forces driven by the motor protein myosin II can induce large non-equilibrium fluctuations that dominate the motion of particles in cytoskeletal networks. Here, using high-resolution particle tracking, we find that thermal forces, not myosin-induced fluctuating forces, drive the motion of submicron particles embedded in the cytoskeleton of living cells. These results resolve the roles of myosin II and contractile actomyosin structures in the motion of nanoparticles lodged in the cytoplasm, reveal the biphasic mechanical architecture of adherent cells-stiff contractile stress fibers interdigitating in a network at the cell cortex and a soft actin meshwork in the body of the cell, validate the method of particle tracking-microrheology, and reconcile seemingly disparate atomic force microscopy (AFM) and particle-tracking microrheology measurements of living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2084546503,"The TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase is crucial for differentiation and survival of nerve-growth-factor-dependent neurons. Paradoxically, TrkA also induces cell death in pediatric tumor cells of neural origin, via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that CCM2, a gene product associated with cerebral cavernous malformations, interacts with the juxtamembrane region of TrkA via its phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and mediates TrkA-induced death in diverse cell types. Both the PTB and Karet domains of CCM2 are required for TrkA-dependent cell death, such that the PTB domain determines the specificity of the interaction, and the Karet domain links to death pathways. Downregulation of CCM2 in medulloblastoma or neuroblastoma cells attenuates TrkA-dependent death. Combined high expression levels of CCM2 and TrkA are correlated with long-term survival in a large cohort of human neuroblastoma patients. Thus, CCM2 is a key mediator of TrkA-dependent cell death in pediatric neuroblastic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2099408708,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by contractions of D4Z4 repeats at 4q35.2 thought to induce misregulation of nearby genes, one of which, DUX4, is actually localized within each repeat. A conserved ORF (mDUX), embedded within D4Z4-like repeats, encoding a double-homeodomain protein, was recently identified on mouse chromosome 10. We show here that high level mDUX expression induces myoblast death, while low non-toxic levels block myogenic differentiation by down-regulating MyoD and Myf5. Toxicity and MyoD/Myf5 expression changes were competitively reversed by overexpression of Pax3 or Pax7, implying mechanistic similarities with the anti-myogenic activity of human DUX4. We tested the effect of mDUX expression on Xenopus development, and found that global overexpression led to abnormalities in gastrulation. When targeted unilaterally into blastomeres fated to become tail muscle in 16-cell embryos, mDUX caused markedly reduced tail myogenesis on the injected side. These novel cell and animal models highlight the myopathic nature of sequences within the FSHD-related repeat array."
https://openalex.org/W2063199147,"Background Many patients with ischemic heart disease have cardiovascular risk factors such as cigarette smoking. We tested the effect of nicotine (a key component of cigarette smoking) on the therapeutic effects of human embryonic stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hESC-ECs). Methods and Results To induce endothelial cell differentiation, undifferentiated hESCs (H9 line) underwent 4-day floating EB formation and 8-day outgrowth differentiation in EGM-2 media. After 12 days, CD31+ cells (13.7±2.5%) were sorted by FACScan and maintained in EGM-2 media for further differentiation. After isolation, these hESC-ECs expressed endothelial specific markers such as vWF (96.3±1.4%), CD31 (97.2±2.5%), and VE-cadherin (93.7±2.8%), form vascular-like channels, and incorporated DiI-labeled acetylated low-density lipoprotein (DiI-Ac-LDL). Afterward, 5×106 hESC-ECs treated for 24 hours with nicotine (10−8 M) or PBS (as control) were injected into the hearts of mice undergoing LAD ligation followed by administration for two weeks of vehicle or nicotine (100 µg/ml) in the drinking water. Surprisingly, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) showed significant improvement in the survival of transplanted hESC-ECs in the nicotine treated group at 6 weeks. Postmortem analysis confirmed increased presence of small capillaries in the infarcted zones. Finally, in vitro mechanistic analysis suggests activation of the MAPK and Akt pathways following activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Conclusions This study shows for the first time that short-term systemic administrations of low dose nicotine can improve the survival of transplanted hESC-ECs, and enhance their angiogenic effects in vivo. Furthermore, activation of nAChRs has anti-apoptotic, angiogenic, and proliferative effects through MAPK and Akt signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2014789290,"The human eye lens is composed of fiber cells packed with crystallins up to 450 mg/ml. Human γD-crystallin (HγD-Crys) is a monomeric, two-domain protein of the lens central nucleus.

INTRODUCTIONThe human lens is a tissue composed of onion-like layers of fiber cells. The lens core, or nucleus, is formed in utero and is composed of primary fiber cells. These cells are enucleated and devoid of all organelles, presumably to assist in maintaining transparency to visible light. During an individual's lifetime, lens epithelial cells, found in a single layer on the anterior portion of the lens, differentiate to become secondary fiber cells that surround the lens nucleus in layers, thus forming the lens outer cortex. Secondary fiber cells maintain their organelles and some level of protein synthesis and turnover.The primary fiber cells of the lens have no protein synthesis or turnover. Thus, proteins translated in utero must maintain their native structure and remain soluble throughout the lifetime of the individual. The α-, β-, and γ-crystallins together account for 90% of lens proteins, present in concentrations of up to 450 mg/ml (1.Fagerholm P. Philipson B. Carlström D. Curr. Eye Res. 1981; 1: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2.Slingsby C. Clout N.J. Eye. 1999; 13: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3.Siezen R.J. Wu E. Kaplan E.D. Thomson J.A. Benedek G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin provides both structural and chaperone functions in the lens, whereas the β- and γ-crystallins appear to function solely as structural proteins (4.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 5.Boyle D. Takemoto L. Exp.

The continuous exposure of these proteins to environmental stresses, such as UV light and oxidizing agents, leads to the build-up of covalent damages (7.Hanson S.R. Hasan A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp Eye Res. 2000; 71: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8.Hanson S.R. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp.

This can result in loss of native conformation and the generation of partially unfolded species that participate in aberrant protein-protein interactions. The resulting protein aggregation is likely to be a major pathway to cataract.According to the World Health Organization, cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Age-related cataract affects at least 50% of people in the United States over age 80 (10.Prevent Blindness America and NEI, National Institutes of HealthVision Problems in the U.S.: Prevalence of Adult Vision Impairment and Age-Related Eye Disease in America. 4th Ed. National Institutes of Health, Prevent Blindness America and NEI, 2008: 22-25Google Scholar). Comparison of age-related cataractons lenses with normal lenses identifies some significant differences between the two. The most obvious difference is the increase in accumulation of high molecular weight aggregates. Proteins isolated from cataractous lenses were found to be highly oxidized at cysteine and methionine residues (11.Truscott R.J. Augusteyn R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 492: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12.Truscott R.J. Augusteyn R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1977; 25: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Additional covalent modifications have been identified in aged lenses in general, including truncations (13.Ajaz M.S. Ma Z. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol.

Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3935-3943Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether these modifications, particularly the extensive oxidation, initiate the aggregation process or whether they are later effects, due to the trapping of partially unfolded species in the aggregate that are susceptible to damage. It is very plausible that accumulation of these various modifications destabilize lens crystallins, leading to their partial unfolding and exposure of hydrophobic core regions. Intermolecular interactions between these exposed regions could lead to aggregate formation, for example through a domain-swapping mechanism.Since primary lens fiber cells lack nuclei and are terminally differentiated, they have not been propagated in tissue culture. In addition, studies of the initiation and growth of cataract within the intact lens have been very limited. As a result, it has not been possible to directly identify the state of crystallin precursors to cataract within lens fiber cells or the intact lens. We have attempted to circumvent this by examining the effects of mutations that cause cataracts in mice on the properties of human crystallin proteins in vitro.Human γD-crystallin (HγD-Crys) 2The abbreviations used are: HγD-Cryshuman γD-crystallinMγS-Crysmurine γS-crystallinN-tdN-terminal domainC-tdC-terminal domainGdnHClguanidinium hydrocholorideDTTdithiothreitolWTwild type. is a monomeric, two-domain protein whose structure has been determined at 1.25 Å (20.Basak A.

It is primarily located in the central lens nucleus, the oldest region of the lens, and is therefore one of the longest lived proteins in that tissue as well as the entire human body. The two domains of HγD-Crys are connected by a short linker and interact through a set of hydrophobic interdomain contacts (22.Flaugh S.L. Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J.

The human γC-crystallin T5P and R168W mutant proteins and human γS-crystallin G18V are three more amino acid substitutions affecting γ-crystallins that are associated with cataract formation (24.Héon E.

Substitution of any of the six residues forming the hydrophobic domain interface of HγD-Crys resulted in a sharp destabilization of the native state and increased population of a partially folded intermediate with an unfolded N-td and folded C-td (22.Flaugh S.L.

Human families carrying mutations at sites in the tightly packed hydrophobic core of these proteins have not yet been reported. However, hydrophobic core mutations have been identified in murine crystallin genes (38.Graw J. Löster J. Soewarto D. Fuchs H. Reis A. Wolf E. Balling R. Hrabé de Angelis M. Mamm.

Murine γS-crystallin (MγS-Crys) is more distantly related to HγD-Crys, because the vertebrate γS-crystallin lineage is believed to have diverged from other γ-crystallins earlier (42.Wistow G.

Even considering this more distant relationship, MγS-Crys and HγD-Crys share 50% sequence identity and 70% sequence similarity.Integrity of the hydrophobic core is generally vital for maintenance of a protein's tertiary structure. Studies on the N-terminal domain of the λ repressor showed that a wide range of amino acid substitutions in the protein core altered both structure and function (43.Lim W.A. Farruggio D.C. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In particular, substitution of hydrophobic core residues with polar or charged residues resulted in large thermodynamic destabilizations in vitro. Dramatic decreases in biological activity were also observed, indicating that the structure was perturbed in vivo as well (43.Lim W.A. Farruggio D.C. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the case of SNase, the introduction of buried charges in the hydrophobic core was less disruptive due to local conformational changes that helped to stabilize the charges (44.Denisov V.P. Schlessman J.L. García-Moreno E.B. Halle B. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3982-3994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A complete set of alanine substitutions in the P22 Arc repressor protein identified many destabilizing mutations. Five key residues, when substituted, resulted in polypeptide chains that did not appear to fold or adopt the native dimeric structure of the Arc repressor (45.Milla M.E. Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Four of these five residues have hydrophobic side chains. In the 13-rung, parallel β-helix P22 tailspike adhesin, substitution with alanine of each of 140 residues in the elongated buried core resulted in folding defects for more than 100 of the mutant proteins (46.Simkovsky R.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The importance of the hydrophobic core has also been illustrated in the opposite sense, by stabilizing proteins through the introduction of hydrophobic residues. The concurrent substitution of three charged residues (Arg31, Glu36, and Arg40) with the hydrophobic residues Met31, Tyr36, and Leu40 (MYL) in the Arc repressor resulted in a mutant protein that refolded with an apparent rate constant ∼150-fold faster than the wild-type protein (47.Waldburger C.D. Jonsson T. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Investigations on the hydrophobic core of T4 lysozyme found that compensatory “size switch” mutations destabilized the protein to a lesser extent than expected for additive effects (48.Baldwin E. Xu J. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 542-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of these mutants showed that the surrounding residues shifted to some extent to help accommodate the altered side chains. Hydrophobic protein cores appear to be quite sensitive to substitutions, and maintenance of ideal packing and geometries contribute greatly to protein stability.The three amino acid substitutions, F9S in MγS-Crys (40.Sinha D.

Opacities, which increased in severity over time, were observed in the lenses of both Opj/+ and Opj/Opj mice, although the phenotypes of the homozygotes were more severe. As a function of temperature in vitro, the F9S mutant displayed a loss of secondary structure and increased propensity for aggregation, both at lower temperatures than wild type (40.Sinha D.

In transfection studies, the V76D mutant protein aggregated in both the nuclei and cytosol of cultured lens epithelial cells.To further explore the effects of mutations to residues found in the hydrophobic core of HγD-Crys, we prepared a set of three HγD-Crys proteins carrying the murine amino acid replacements. All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to study their overall conformation and thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities. Their significant destabilization highlights the importance of the tightly packed hydrophobic core of the γ-crystallins and sheds light on the possible mechanisms of congenital cataract formation associated with these mutations.DISCUSSIONAs a result of the physical integrity of the lens, it has been difficult to study cataract formation in the native environment. Thus, direct evidence linking the aggregation reactions documented in vitro with cataract formation in situ has been lacking. We have attempted to bridge this gap by characterizing the effects of mouse crystallin cataract-causing mutations on human lens crystallins.For a number of protein aggregation diseases, partially unfolded chains are thought to be the precursors in the aggregation reactions (62.Dobson C.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The γ-crystallins appear to have an extremely rigid three-dimensional structure with tight side chain packing (63.Chen J. Toptygin D. Brand L. King J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10705-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The three cataract-associated mutations were chosen to investigate the effects of mutation on the tightly packed hydrophobic core of HγD-Crys. All three mutations investigated dramatically destabilized HγD-Crys in equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments. Overall ΔG0 values were decreased by 4.6 and 5.0 kcal/mol for L5S and V75D mutant crystallins, respectively. For I90F, the ΔG0 value decreased by 7.2 kcal/mol in comparison with wild-type HγD-Crys. The site of the substitution was directly related to the domain destabilization. For the two N-td mutants, L5S and V75D, only the stability of the N-td was affected, in that its unfolding transition midpoint was lowered. The C-td unfolding transition midpoint was not affected in either case. For the I90F substitution, which is found in the C-td, a steep two-state transition was observed with no discernible intermediates. This indicates that both domains are destabilized and the entire protein is globally unfolding without significantly populated intermediates. Previous work showed that HγD-Crys folds through a three-state pathway with the C-td folding first, followed by the N-td (23.Kosinski-Collins M.S. Flaugh S.L. King J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2223-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Destabilization of the C-td may result in global protein destabilization because the domain interface, which is known to play a role in HγD-Crys stability (22.Flaugh S.L. Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), may not be in its native conformation.Wild-type HγD-Crys is resistant to thermal denaturation; its melting temperature is ∼83 °C. The three amino acid replacements lowered the melting temperatures, and the melting curves for all mutant proteins indicated a population of partially unfolded intermediates. However, because these data are based on CD measurements of overall secondary structure, decreases in melting temperature and appearance of possible intermediates cannot be attributed to specific regions of the protein's three-dimensional structure. This is in contrast to the tryptophan fluorescence unfolding data, which reports on the regions of the protein surrounding the buried tryptophans.In kinetic experiments, all three mutant proteins unfolded faster than wild-type HγD-Crys. Previously, it was shown that wild-type HγD-Crys requires 1 h in 5.5 m GdnHCl at 37 °C to unfold completely (54.Flaugh S.L. Mills I.A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30782-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, all three mutant proteins unfolded within the dead time of the experiment (∼1 s). Experimental conditions were altered to 3.5 m GdnHCl and 18 °C to slow unfolding and enable observation of the unfolding transition(s) by changes in tryptophan fluorescence. Under these altered conditions, the wild-type protein will not fully unfold. This fact alone attests to the dramatic destabilizing effects of these substitutions on HγD-Crys.Similar to the results of the equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments, the location of the mutation corresponded with the observed kinetic destabilization. For both N-td substitutions L5S and V75D, the single kinetic transition observed for each mutant protein most likely corresponded to the unfolding of the N-td. Our results further support the observation that mutations in the N-td, even at different locations within the domain, appear to solely affect that domain's stability. Mills-Henry and colleagues (61.Mills-Henry I. Stability, Unfolding, and Aggregation of the Gamma D and Gamma S Human Eye Lens Crystallins.. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA2007Google Scholar) found that the extrapolated in vitro unfolding half-time of wild-type HγD-Crys in the absence of denaturant was ∼19 years. This number is probably greatly reduced for all of the mutants investigated here. A hysteresis was observed in previous equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments, particularly for the unfolding of the N-td of full-length HγD-Crys (60.Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the domain interface contributed substantially to the kinetic stability of the protein. The large destabilization of the N-td for both the L5S and V75D proteins disrupts the interactions at the domain interface, and this may contribute to an overall destabilization of the protein. Further kinetic analysis could address this issue.In contrast, the C-td mutant I90F completely unfolded through a single observable kinetic transition, most likely the simultaneous unfolding of both domains. In agreement with equilibrium data, the disruption of the C-td by I90F resulted in destabilization of the entire protein. The N-td cannot remain folded if the C-td is unfolded in the full-length protein. However, Mills et al. showed that the isolated N-terminal domains of HγD-Crys and human γS-crystallin fold into distinct structures that exhibit the fluorescence quenching characteristic of the γ-crystallins and tryptophan fluorescence spectra similar to the full-length proteins (64.Mills I.A. Flaugh S.L. Kosinski-Collins M.S. King J.A. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 2427-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, the N-td of HγD-Crys in isolation is capable of folding. Nonetheless, in the context of the full-length protein, the C-td must be fully folded with its domain interface contacts available for proper folding of the N-td. The simplest model to explain these data is that the interface formed by the C-td is used as a template for folding of the N-td.The effects of these mutations on the kinetic and thermodynami"
https://openalex.org/W2053456134,"Neurodegenerative disorders share common features comprising aggregation of misfolded proteins, failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and increased levels of metal ions in the brain. Protein aggregates within affected cells often contain ubiquitin, however no report has focused on the aggregation propensity of this protein. Recently it was shown that copper, differently from zinc, nickel, aluminum, or cadmium, compromises ubiquitin stability and binds to the N-terminus with 0.1 micromolar affinity. This paper addresses the role of copper upon ubiquitin aggregation. In water, incubation with Cu(II) leads to formation of spherical particles that can progress from dimers to larger conglomerates. These spherical oligomers are SDS-resistant and are destroyed upon Cu(II) chelation or reduction to Cu(I). In water/trifluoroethanol (80:20, v/v), a mimic of the local decrease in dielectric constant experienced in proximity to a membrane surface, ubiquitin incubation with Cu(II) causes time-dependent changes in circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared spectra, indicative of increasing beta-sheet content. Analysis by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy reveals, in the given order, formation of spherical particles consistent with the size of early oligomers detected by gel electrophoresis, clustering of these particles in straight and curved chains, formation of ring structures, growth of trigonal branches from the rings, coalescence of the trigonal branched structures in a network. Notably, none of these ubiquitin aggregates was positive to tests for amyloid and Cu(II) chelation or reduction produced aggregate disassembly. The early formed Cu(II)-stabilized spherical oligomers, when reconstituted in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) liposomes and in POPC planar bilayers, form annular and pore-like structures, respectively, which are common to several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases, and have been proposed to be the primary toxic species. Susceptibility to aggregation of ubiquitin, as it emerges from the present study, may represent a potential risk factor for disease onset or progression while cells attempt to tag and process toxic substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2160982898,"Zinc deficiency causes oxidative stress in many organisms including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous studies of this yeast indicated that the Tsa1 peroxiredoxin is required for optimal growth in low zinc because of its role in degrading H(2)O(2). In this report, we assessed the importance of other antioxidant genes to zinc-limited growth. Our results indicated that the cytosolic superoxide dismutase Sod1 is also critical for growth under zinc-limiting conditions. We also found that Ccs1, the copper-delivering chaperone required for Sod1 activity is essential for optimal zinc-limited growth. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the important roles these proteins play under this condition. It has been proposed previously that a loss of Sod1 activity due to inefficient metallation is one source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under zinc-limiting conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that both the level and activity of Sod1 is diminished in zinc-deficient cells. However, under conditions in which Sod1 was overexpressed in zinc-limited cells and activity was restored, we observed no decrease in ROS levels. Thus, these data indicate that while Sod1 activity is critical for low zinc growth, diminished Sod1 activity is not a major source of the elevated ROS observed under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2109738819,"There is strong evidence that sensory experience in early life has a profound influence on the development of sensory circuits. Very little is known, however, about the role of experience in the early development of striatal networks which regulate both motor and cognitive function. To address this, we have investigated the influence of early environmental enrichment on motor development.Mice were raised in standard or enriched housing from birth. For animals assessed as adults, half of the mice had their rearing condition reversed at weaning to enable the examination of the effects of pre- versus post-weaning enrichment. We found that exclusively pre-weaning enrichment significantly improved performance on the Morris water maze compared to non-enriched mice. The effects of early enrichment on the emergence of motor programs were assessed by performing behavioural tests at postnatal day 10. Enriched mice traversed a significantly larger region of the test arena in an open-field test and had improved swimming ability compared to non-enriched cohorts. A potential cellular correlate of these changes was investigated using Wisteria-floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining to mark chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). We found that the previously reported transition of CSPG staining from striosome-associated clouds to matrix-associated perineuronal nets (PNNs) is accelerated in enriched mice.This is the first demonstration that the early emergence of exploratory as well as coordinated movement is sensitive to experience. These behavioural changes are correlated with an acceleration of the emergence of striatal PNNs suggesting that they may consolidate the neural circuits underlying these behaviours. Finally, we confirm that pre-weaning experience can lead to life long changes in the learning ability of mice."

The FTNF002-00 complete genome contains the RD23 deletion and represents a type strain for a clonal population from the first epidemic tularemia outbreak in Spain between 1997–1998. Here, we present the complete sequence analysis of the FTNF002-00 genome. The complete genome sequence of FTNF002-00 revealed several large as well as small genomic differences with respect to two other published complete genome sequences of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica strains, LVS and OSU18. The FTNF002-00 genome shares >99.9% sequence similarity with LVS and OSU18, and is also ∼5 MB smaller by comparison. The overall organization of the FTNF002-00 genome is remarkably identical to those of LVS and OSU18, except for a single 3.9 kb inversion in FTNF002-00. Twelve regions of difference ranging from 0.1–1.5 kb and forty-two small insertions and deletions were identified in a comparative analysis of FTNF002-00, LVS, and OSU18 genomes. Two small deletions appear to inactivate two genes in FTNF002-00 causing them to become pseudogenes; the intact genes encode a protein of unknown function and a drug:H+ antiporter. In addition, we identified ninety-nine proteins in FTNF002-00 containing amino acid mutations compared to LVS and OSU18. Several non-conserved amino acid replacements were identified, one of which occurs in the virulence-associated intracellular growth locus subunit D protein. Many of these changes in FTNF002-00 are likely the consequence of direct selection that increases the fitness of this subsp. holarctica clone within its endemic population. Our complete genome sequence analyses lay the foundation for experimental testing of these possibilities."

IntroductionThe regulation of lipid storage and lipolysis in adipocytes has important implications for the maintenance of whole body lipid homeostasis (1.Hajer G.R. van Haeften T.W. Visseren F.L. Eur. Heart J. 2008; 29: 2959-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 2.Langin D. Pharmacol. Res. 2006; 53: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Dysregulation is associated with obesity and the onset of metabolic disease, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes. An important goal for the future is to design strategies that allow us to manipulate lipid storage and so control weight gain. Fundamental to a targeted approach to controlling the storage and mobilization of lipid in adipose tissue is a detailed understanding of the cellular mechanisms and machinery that regulate lipolysis. Although the key players in this process have been identified, the precise regulation of the lipolytic machinery is not yet fully understood. In this study we have begun to address this by analyzing the earliest events in the activation of lipolysis at the cellular level.Adipocytes are specialized lipid droplet (LD) 2The abbreviations used are: LDlipid dropletHSLhormone-sensitive lipaseP-HSLphospho-HSLTGtriglyceridePKAprotein kinase AIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineFskforskolinNEFAnonesterified fatty acid. -laden cells that store large amounts of neutral lipid, predominantly as triglycerides (TG) (3.Martin S.

In response to extracellular stimulation by catecholamines, adipocytes hydrolyze stored TGs to generate free fatty acids and glycerol. In rodent adipocytes, the hydrolysis of neutral lipids is tightly regulated by a series of signal transduction pathways from the G-protein-coupled β3-adrenergic receptor that culminate at the surface of the LD (2.Langin D. Pharmacol. Res. 2006; 53: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5.Collins S. Cao W. Robidoux J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A well characterized pathway from the β3-adrenergic receptor results in the elevation of cAMP levels, activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase/protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets, including the lipid droplet scaffold/adaptor protein perilipin (6.Brasaemle D.L.

In this study, we have investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of HSL phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.In contrast to perilipin, which is constitutively associated with the LD surface, HSL is a cytosolic protein that translocates to LDs in response to catecholamine stimulation (12.Egan J.J.

Mutation of Ser-565 abolishes translocation of HSL to LDs in stimulated cells indicating a role in the activation of lipolysis (13.Su C.L. Sztalryd C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43615-43619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of peptides incorporating the Ser-565 site by 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase in vitro inhibits subsequent phosphorylation on the Ser-563 site by PKA (8.Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), indicating a functional relationship between these two sites.To examine the relationship between the specific phosphorylation events in HSL during activated lipolysis, we analyzed the distribution of phosphorylated HSL biochemically and by immunofluorescence microscopy using phospho-specific antibodies. We found both spatial and temporal differences in the progression of phosphorylation events upon acute activation of lipolysis in adipocytes. Furthermore, we found evidence that not only the phosphorylation but also the dephosphorylation of specific serines in HSL was tightly controlled. In light of these findings, we propose that distinct signaling complexes are involved in the activation of lipolysis, one at the LD surface and another distal to the LD, possibly at the cell surface. As stable association of HSL with LDs during lipolysis is dependent upon its phosphorylation on Ser-660 (13.Su C.L. Sztalryd C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43615-43619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we propose that the distal phosphorylation complex is of primary importance in the initial activation of lipolysis, and we hypothesize that the LD-associated phosphorylation complexes are important in regulating the stability and/or duration of lipolysis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have described for the first time the earliest events regulating the acute activation of lipolysis by signal transduction from the β-adrenergic receptor in adipocytes. These studies provide new insights into fundamental aspects of lipolysis. By examining the phosphorylation of HSL within adipocytes, both spatially and temporally, we have identified several important aspects of HSL regulation. First, we describe the remarkably rapid, sequential phosphorylation of specific serine residues in HSL, at spatially distinct intracellular locales. Second, we provide evidence for the presence of two distinct PKA signaling complexes directly regulating lipolysis. Finally, we describe differences in the mutually exclusive phosphorylation of two serine residues in HSL, targeted by distinct protein kinases, upon activation of lipolysis by signal transduction from the cell surface compared with the direct elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. Together, these data show that the acute stimulation of lipolysis in adipocytes by β-adrenergic receptor agonists is controlled by a complex series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, mediated by multiple signaling complexes. Although the later events occur at the surface of the LD itself, we propose that the primary signaling complex initiating lipolysis is located at the cell surface in close proximity to the β3-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 8).The phosphorylation of both HSL and perilipin A on multiple residues in basal adipocytes and during activated lipolysis has been well described (7.Anthonsen M.W. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 8.Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G.

U.S.A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the exact progression and spatial organization of distinct phosphorylation reactions is not well understood. By using the 3T3-L1 adipocyte model cell system, we have been able to examine the incredibly rapid kinetics and spatial organization of early phosphorylation of HSL, studies that would be difficult to accomplish in vivo or in primary adipocytes. Using explants of primary mouse adipose tissue, we show that identical phosphorylation responses are observed upon activation of lipolysis by β-adrenergic receptor signal transduction compared with the direct elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, as shown in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, confirming the relevancy of this system to primary adipose tissue. The results of these analyses suggest the presence of a highly organized signaling platform generating maximal phosphorylation and association with LDs within seconds rather than minutes. Our observation that P-HSLSer-660 initially appeared in the peripheral cytosol of the cell prior to its association with the LD, within the shortest time frame that we could reasonably measure (5 s), leads us to hypothesize that this phosphorylation event is mediated by a pool of PKA present at the cell surface, possibly in a complex with the β3-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 8). The appearance of both PKA-phosphorylated perilipin A and P-HSLSer-563 on the LD strongly suggests that either a second LD-associated pool of PKA is activated at the LD surface or that activated PKA is also capable of translocating to the LD surface.The initial phosphorylation of the LD scaffold/adaptor protein perilipin A was found to occur many seconds later than the phosphorylation of HSL on Ser-660, but it preceded the phosphorylation of HSL on Ser-563. As the maximal phosphorylation of HSLSer-563 closely follows the maximal phosphorylation of perilipin A, it is possible that the latter is required to stabilize HSLSer-563 at the LD surface. At present, it is unclear whether phosphorylation of Ser-563 occurs on nonphosphorylated HSL (Fig. 8A) or whether a phosphatase on the LD surface catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the Ser-565 site prior to phosphorylation on the Ser-563 (Fig. 8B). The low steady state level of Ser-563 phosphorylation of HSL in activated cells suggests that unlike Ser-660 phosphorylation, Ser-563 phosphorylation is not a requirement for translocation. At present, the functional significance of HSLSer-563 phosphorylation remains unknown.Cyclic AMP is a key signaling molecule in many different signal transduction pathways in numerous cell types. Specificity in cAMP signaling is achieved by anchoring PKA to the appropriate target compartment via an interaction with protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (23.Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Preventing PKA anchoring in adipocytes inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis showing that correct localization is a requirement for signal transduction (24.Zhang J. Hupfeld C.J. Taylor S.S. Olefsky J.M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 2005; 437: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, D-AKAP1 has been proposed to anchor PKA to the LD surface (25.Bridges D. MacDonald J.A. Wadzinski B. Moorhead G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and could therefore mediate phosphorylation of perilipin A and P-HSLSer-563. The ability of protein kinase A-anchoring proteins to form complexes with multiple components of a signaling pathway, including kinases, phosphatases, and phosphodiesterases (reviewed in Refs. 26.Beene D.L. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 27.Diviani D. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2008; 8: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) suggests that a signaling platform is likely to exist on the LD surface. Identifying the components and regulation of this complex will be an important future endeavor.Determining the molecular composition of the different lipolytic signaling complexes in adipocytes, and the mechanism by which agonist-mediated activation of lipolysis is controlled by protein kinases and phosphatases, is crucial to understanding lipolysis. Furthermore, the relationship between HSL translocation and the activity of a second major LD-associated lipase, adipocyte TG lipase, is also of primary importance. Adipocyte TG lipase catalyzes the first hydrolytic reaction of lipolysis resulting in the generation of diglyceride from TG (28.Zechner R. Kienesberger P.C. Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Lass A. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 3-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). As diglyceride is the major intracellular substrate of HSL, and it has been shown that HSL requires an intact catalytic binding site to translocate to the LD (13.Su C.L. Sztalryd C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43615-43619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it is intriguing to hypothesize that the activity of adipocyte TG lipase is required to stabilize the interaction of phosphorylated HSL with the LD by providing the substrate (diglyceride). In conclusion, we have shown that phosphorylation of key lipolytic proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is subject to regulation both spatially and temporally, demonstrating previously unknown layers of complexity in the regulation of lipolysis at the cellular level. IntroductionThe regulation of lipid storage and lipolysis in adipocytes has important implications for the maintenance of whole body lipid homeostasis (1.Hajer G.R. van Haeften T.W. Visseren F.L. Eur. Heart J. 2008; 29: 2959-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 2.Langin D. Pharmacol. Res. 2006; 53: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Dysregulation is associated with obesity and the onset of metabolic disease, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes. An important goal for the future is to design strategies that allow us to manipulate lipid storage and so control weight gain. Fundamental to a targeted approach to controlling the storage and mobilization of lipid in adipose tissue is a detailed understanding of the cellular mechanisms and machinery that regulate lipolysis. Although the key players in this process have been identified, the precise regulation of the lipolytic machinery is not yet fully understood. In this study we have begun to address this by analyzing the earliest events in the activation of lipolysis at the cellular level.Adipocytes are specialized lipid droplet (LD) 2The abbreviations used are: LDlipid dropletHSLhormone-sensitive lipaseP-HSLphospho-HSLTGtriglyceridePKAprotein kinase AIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineFskforskolinNEFAnonesterified fatty acid. -laden cells that store large amounts of neutral lipid, predominantly as triglycerides (TG) (3.Martin S.

In response to extracellular stimulation by catecholamines, adipocytes hydrolyze stored TGs to generate free fatty acids and glycerol. In rodent adipocytes, the hydrolysis of neutral lipids is tightly regulated by a series of signal transduction pathways from the G-protein-coupled β3-adrenergic receptor that culminate at the surface of the LD (2.Langin D. Pharmacol. Res. 2006; 53: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5.Collins S. Cao W. Robidoux J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2123-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A well characterized pathway from the β3-adrenergic receptor results in the elevation of cAMP levels, activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase/protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates downstream targets, including the lipid droplet scaffold/adaptor protein perilipin (6.Brasaemle D.L.

In this study, we have investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of HSL phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.In contrast to perilipin, which is constitutively associated with the LD surface, HSL is a cytosolic protein that translocates to LDs in response to catecholamine stimulation (12.Egan J.J.

DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have described for the first time the earliest events regulating the acute activation of lipolysis by signal transduction from the β-adrenergic receptor in adipocytes. These studies provide new insights into fundamental aspects of lipolysis. By examining the phosphorylation of HSL within adipocytes, both spatially and temporally, we have identified several important aspects of HSL regulation. First, we describe the remarkably rapid, sequential phosphorylation of specific serine residues in HSL, at spatially distinct intracellular locales. Second, we provide evidence for the presence of two distinct PKA signaling complexes directly regulating lipolysis. Finally, we describe differences in the mutually exclusive phosphorylation of two serine residues in HSL, targeted by distinct protein kinases, upon activation of lipolysis by signal transduction from the cell surface compared with the direct elevation of intracellular cAMP levels. Together, these data show that the acute stimulation of lipolysis in adipocytes by β-adrenergic receptor agonists is controlled by a complex series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, mediated by multiple signaling complexes. Although the later events occur at the surface of the LD itself, we propose that the primary signaling complex initiating lipolysis is located at the cell surface in close proximity to the β3-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 8).The phosphorylation of both HSL and perilipin A on multiple residues in basal adipocytes and during activated lipolysis has been well described (7.Anthonsen M.W.

By using the 3T3-L1 adipocyte model cell system, we have been able to examine the incredibly rapid kinetics and spatial organization of early phosphorylation of HSL, studies that would be difficult to accomplish in vivo or in primary adipocytes. Using explants of primary mouse adipose tissue, we show that identical phosphorylation responses are observed upon activation of lipolysis by β-adrenergic receptor signal transduction compared with the direct elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, as shown in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, confirming the relevancy of this system to primary adipose tissue. The results of these analyses suggest the presence of a highly organized signaling platform generating maximal phosphorylation and association with LDs within seconds rather than minutes. Our observation that P-HSLSer-660 initially appeared in the peripheral cytosol of the cell prior to its association with the LD, within the shortest time frame that we could reasonably measure (5 s), leads us to hypothesize that this phosphorylation event is mediated by a pool of PKA present at the cell surface, possibly in a complex with the β3-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 8). The appearance of both PKA-phosphorylated perilipin A and P-HSLSer-563 on the LD strongly suggests that either a second LD-associated pool of PKA is activated at the LD surface or that activated PKA is also capable of translocating to the LD surface.The initial phosphorylation of the LD scaffold/adaptor protein perilipin A was found to occur many seconds later than the phosphorylation of HSL on Ser-660, but it preceded the phosphorylation of HSL on Ser-563. As the maximal phosphorylation of HSLSer-563 closely follows the maximal phosphorylation of perilipin A, it is possible that the latter is required to stabilize HSLSer-563 at the LD surface. At present, it is unclear whether phosphorylation of Ser-563 occurs on nonphosphorylated HSL (Fig. 8A) or whether a phosphatase on the LD surface catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the Ser-565 site prior to phosphorylation on the Ser-563 (Fig. 8B). The low steady state level of Ser-563 phosphorylation of HSL in activated cells suggests that unlike Ser-660 phosphorylation, Ser-563 phosphorylation is not a requirement for translocation. At present, the functional significance of HSLSer-563 phosphorylation remains unknown.Cyclic AMP is a key signaling molecule in many different signal transduction pathways in numerous cell types. Specificity in cAMP signaling is achieved by anchoring PKA to the appropriate target compartment via an interaction with protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (23.Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Preventing PKA anchoring in adipocytes inhibits isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis showing that correct localization is a requirement for signal transduction (24.Zhang J. Hupfeld C.J. Taylor S.S.

Wadzinski B. Moorhead G.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 346: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and could therefore mediate phosphorylation of perilipin A and P-HSLSer-563. The ability of protein kinase A-anchoring proteins to form complexes with multiple components of a signaling pathway, including kinases, phosphatases, and phosphodiesterases (reviewed in Refs. 26.Beene D.L.

Identifying the components and regulation of this complex will be an important future endeavor.Determining the molecular composition of the different lipolytic signaling complexes in adipocytes, and the mechanism by which agonist-mediated activation of lipolysis is controlled by protein kinases and phosphatases, is crucial to understanding lipolysis. Furthermore, the relationship between HSL translocation and the activity of a second major LD-associated lipase, adipocyte TG lipase, is also of primary importance. Adipocyte TG lipase catalyzes the first hydrolytic reaction of lipolysis resulting in the generation of diglyceride from TG (28.Zechner R. Kienesberger P.C. Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Lass A. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 3-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). As diglyceride is the major intracellular substrate of HSL, and it has been shown that HSL requires an intact catalytic binding site to translocate to the LD (13.Su C.L. Sztalryd C. Contreras J.A. Holm C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43615-43619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it is intriguing to hypothesize that the activity of adipocyte TG lipase is required to stabilize the interaction of phosphorylated HSL with the LD by providing the substrate (diglyceride). In conclusion, we have shown that phosphorylation of key lipolytic proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is subject to regulation both spatially and temporally, demonstrating previously unknown layers of complexity in the regulation of lipolysis at the cellular level. In this study, we have described for the first time the earliest events regulating the acute activation of lipolysis by signal transduction from the β-adrenergic receptor in adipocytes. These studies provide new insights into fundamental aspects of lipolysis. By examining the phosphorylation of HSL within adipocytes, both spatially and temporally, we have identified several important aspects of HSL regulation. First, we describe the remarkably rapid, sequential phosphorylation of specific serine residues in HSL, at spatially distinct intracellular locales. Second, we provide evidence for the presence of two distinct PKA signaling complexes directly regulating lipolysis. Finally, we describe differences in the mutually exclusive phosphorylation of two serine residues in HSL, targeted by distinct protein kinases, upon activation of lipolysis by signal transduction from the cell surface compared with the direct elevation of intracellular cAMP levels.

https://openalex.org/W2018133767,"Mouse T cell clone 2C recognizes two different major histocompatibility (MHC) ligands, the self MHC K(b) and the allogeneic MHC L(d). Two distinct peptides, SIY (SIYRYYGL) and QL9 (QLSPFPFDL), act as strong and specific agonists when bound to K(b) and L(d), respectively. To explore further the mechanisms involved in peptide potency and specificity, here we examined a collection of single amino acid peptide variants of SIY and QL9 for 1) T cell activity, 2) binding to their respective MHC, and 3) binding to the 2C T cell receptor (TCR) and high affinity TCR mutants. Characterization of SIY binding to MHC K(b) revealed significant effects of three SIY residues that were clearly embedded within the K(b) molecule. In contrast, QL9 binding to MHC L(d) was influenced by the majority of peptide side chains, distributed across the entire length of the peptide. Binding of the SIY-K(b) complex to the TCR involved three SIY residues that were pointed toward the TCR, whereas again the majority of QL9 residues influenced binding of TCRs, and thus the QL9 residues had impacts on both L(d) and TCR binding. In general, the magnitude of T cell activity mediated by a peptide variant was influenced more by peptide binding to MHC than by binding the TCR, especially for higher affinity TCRs. Findings with both systems, but QL9-L(d) in particular, suggest that many single-residue substitutions, introduced into peptides to improve their binding to MHC and thus their vaccine potential, could impair T cell reactivity due to their dual impact on TCR binding."
https://openalex.org/W1996108245,"Background As part of a program to predict the toxicity of environmental agents on human health using alternative methods, several in vivo high- and medium-throughput assays are being developed that use C. elegans as a model organism. C. elegans-based toxicological assays utilize the COPAS Biosort flow sorting system that can rapidly measure size, extinction (EXT) and time-of-flight (TOF), of individual nematodes. The use of this technology requires the development of mathematical and statistical tools to properly analyze the large volumes of biological data. Methodology/Principal Findings Findings A Markov model was developed that predicts the growth of populations of C. elegans. The model was developed using observations from a 60 h growth study in which five cohorts of 300 nematodes each were aspirated and measured every 12 h. Frequency distributions of log(EXT) measurements that were made when loading C. elegans L1 larvae into 96 well plates (t = 0 h) were used by the model to predict the frequency distributions of the same set of nematodes when measured at 12 h intervals. The model prediction coincided well with the biological observations confirming the validity of the model. The model was also applied to log(TOF) measurements following an adaptation. The adaptation accounted for variability in TOF measurements associated with potential curling or shortening of the nematodes as they passed through the flow cell of the Biosort. By providing accurate estimates of frequencies of EXT or TOF measurements following varying growth periods, the model was able to estimate growth rates. Best model fits showed that C. elegans did not grow at a constant exponential rate. Growth was best described with three different rates. Microscopic observations indicated that the points where the growth rates changed corresponded to specific developmental events: the L1/L2 molt and the start of oogenesis in young adult C. elegans. Conclusions Quantitative analysis of COPAS Biosort measurements of C. elegans growth has been hampered by the lack of a mathematical model. In addition, extraneous matter and the inability to assign specific measurements to specific nematodes made it difficult to estimate growth rates. The present model addresses these problems through a population-based Markov model."

COX-2 is induced during inflammation and is overexpressed in colon cancer. In vitro, an 18-amino acid segment, residues 595–612, immediately upstream of the C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence is required for N-glycosylation of Asn594, which permits COX-2 protein to enter the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation system. To determine the importance of this COX-2 degradation pathway in vivo, we engineered a del595–612 PGHS-2 (Δ18 COX-2) knock-in mouse lacking this 18-amino acid segment. Δ18 COX-2 knock-in mice do not exhibit the renal or reproductive abnormalities of COX-2 null mice. Δ18 COX-2 mice do have elevated urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite levels and display a more pronounced and prolonged bacterial endotoxin-induced febrile response than wild type (WT) mice. Normal brain tissue, cultured resident peritoneal macrophages, and cultured skin fibroblasts from Δ18 COX-2 mice overexpress Δ18 COX-2 relative to WT COX-2 expression in control mice. These results indicate that COX-2 can be degraded via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway in vivo. Treatment of cultured cells from WT or Δ18 COX-2 mice with flurbiprofen, which blocks substrate-dependent degradation, attenuates COX-2 degradation, and treatment of normal mice with ibuprofen increases the levels of COX-2 in brain tissue. Thus, substrate turnover-dependent COX-2 degradation appears to contribute to COX-2 degradation in vivo. Curiously, WT and Δ18 COX-2 protein levels are similar in kidneys and spleens from WT and Δ18 COX-2 mice. There must be compensatory mechanisms to maintain constant COX-2 levels in these tissues.

These studies asked whether DHA decreases fat deposition through SAA1 and explored the mechanisms involved. We demonstrated that DHA increased human SAA1 and C/EBPβ mRNA expression in human hepatoma cells, SK-HEP-1. Utilizing a promoter deletion assay, we found that a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ)-binding site in the SAA1 promoter region between −242 and −102 bp was critical for DHA-mediated SAA1 expression. Mutation of the putative C/EBPβ-binding site suppressed the DHA-induced SAA1 promoter activity. The addition of the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 negated the DHA-induced increase in C/EBPβ protein expression. The up-regulation of SAA1 mRNA and protein by DHA was also inhibited by H89. We also demonstrated that DHA increased protein kinase A (PKA) activities. These data suggest that C/EBPβ is involved in the DHA-regulated increase in SAA1 expression via PKA-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of DHA on triacylglycerol accumulation was abolished by H89 in SK-HEP-1 cells and adipocytes, indicating that DHA also reduces lipid accumulation via PKA. The observation of increased SAA1 expression coupled with reduced fat accumulation mediated by DHA via PKA suggests that SAA1 is involved in DHA-induced triacylglycerol breakdown. These findings provide new insights into the complicated regulatory network in DHA-mediated lipid metabolism and are useful in developing new approaches to reduce body fat deposition and fatty liver.

https://openalex.org/W1732049845,"Members of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor, PPAR, subfamily of nuclear receptors display complex opposing and overlapping functions and a wide range of pharmacological and molecular genetic tools have been used to dissect their specific functions. Non-agonist bound PPARdelta has been shown to repress PPAR Response Element, PPRE, signalling and several lines of evidence point to the importance of PPARdelta repressive actions in both cardiovascular and cancer biology.In this report we have employed transient transfections and luciferase reporter gene technology to study the repressing effects of PPARdelta and two derivatives thereof. We demonstrate for the first time that the classical dominant negative deletion of the Activation Function 2, AF2, domain of PPARdelta show enhanced repression of PPRE signalling in the presence of a PPARdelta agonist. We propose that the mechanism for the phenomenon is increased RXR heterodimerisation and DNA binding upon ligand binding concomitant with transcriptional co-repressor binding. We also demonstrated ligand-dependent dominant negative action of a DNA non-binding derivative of PPARdelta on PPARgamma1 signalling. This activity was abolished upon over-expression of RXRalpha suggesting a role for PPAR/cofactor competition in the absence of DNA binding.These findings are important in understanding the wide spectrum of molecular interactions in which PPARdelta and PPARgamma have opposing biological roles and suggest novel paradigms for the design of different functional classes of nuclear receptor antagonist drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2094911199,"This study was initiated to induce experimental autoimmune anterior uveitis (EAAU) in Lewis rats by melanin-associated antigen (MAA; 22-kDa fragment of type I collagen alpha2 chain) derived from rat iris and ciliary body (CB), to localize MAA within the eye, and to investigate the possible mechanism of MAA generation in vivo. The EAAU model replicates idiopathic human anterior uveitis. Lewis rats sensitized to rat MAA developed anterior uveitis, and EAAU induced by rat MAA can be adoptively transferred to naive syngenic rats by MAA-primed T cells. Animals immunized with rat MAA developed cellular immunity to the antigen. MAA was detected only in the iris and CB of the eye. Iris and CB were the major source of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in the naive eye, and ocular expression of MMP-1 was up-regulated, whereas expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 decreased before the onset of EAAU. These results demonstrated that EAAU can be induced by autologous MAA. Uveitogenic antigen is present only in the iris and CB of the eye, and the imbalance between MMP-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 may play a role in the generation of MAA in vivo. Collectively, the evidence presented here suggests that MAA is an autoantigen in EAAU. These observations may extend to idiopathic human anterior uveitis and facilitate the development of antigen-specific therapy."

The in vitro growth and DNA synthesis of five melanoma cell lines, whose STAT3 was activated (phosphorylated), was inhibited by TPA, whereas that of WM35 and WM39 cells, whose STAT3 activity was at negligible levels, was considerably slow and not affected by TPA. Blockade of STAT3 activity by small interfering RNAs suppressed the growth of WM1205Lu cells containing constitutively activated STAT3. Treatment of WM1205Lu cells with TPA decreased both the phosphorylated STAT3 and the DNA-binding activity of STAT3. Pretreatment of WM1205Lu cells with either a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor or a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor prevented the inhibitory effects of TPA on the level of phosphorylated STAT3. The five melanoma cell lines containing phosphorylated STAT3 commonly expressed PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ. Introduction of the dominant negative mutant of one of these PKC isoforms into WM1205Lu cells inhibited the TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3. A Src inhibitor attenuated the STAT3 phosphorylation in WM1205Lu cells. These results indicate that constitutively activated STAT3 is positively regulated by c-Src and negatively regulated by a PKC-activated tyrosine phosphatase(s) in melanoma cells. Because TPA did not affect c-Src activity, we conclude that the growth inhibitory effect of TPA on melanoma cells is mediated through inactivation of STAT3 by a PKC-activated tyrosine phosphatase(s).

The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was originally identified as a DNA-binding protein that responds to stimulation by epidermal growth factor and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and has an important role in their signaling (10Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 11Zhong Z. Wen Z.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), STAT3 is normally activated in a regulated fashion when protein ligands bind cell surface STAT3 receptors. Then, STAT3 becomes activated by phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine residue (Tyr705) by Janus kinase (JAK) and dimerizes through reciprocal Src homology 2-phosphotyrosine interaction (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar). The dimeric STAT3 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to consensus STAT3 binding sequences within the promoter region of target genes and thereby activates their transcription (13Darnell Jr., J.E.

In normal cells, the duration of STAT3 activation is temporary, usually lasting from a few minutes to several hours (16Bromberg J. Chen X. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 138-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these cells, STAT3 plays crucial roles in the development of various organs and in cell proliferation (17Levy D.E.

In this study, we investigated the possibility that STAT3 is involved in the TPA-induced growth inhibition of melanoma cells. We have found that TPA inhibits both the growth and the DNA synthesis, concomitant with a decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 levels, of melanoma cells containing constitutively activated STAT3 but not of cells lacking activated STAT3. Furthermore, we have revealed that the TPA-induced decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 levels is due to the dephosphorylation of STAT3 by a TPA-activated protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase)(s). Antibodies against STAT3 phosphorylated on Tyr705 (pY-STAT3) and STAT3 phosphorylated on Ser727 (pS-STAT3) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-STAT3, anti-actin, anti-protein kinase C (PKC) α, and anti-PKCβII antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Seven human melanoma cell lines from primary (WM35, WM39, WM98-1, and WM115) and metastatic (WM164, WM239A, and WM1205Lu) lesions were kindly provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). The detailed character of these melanoma cells has been described previously (25Hsu M.-Y. Elder D.E. Herlyn M. Human Cell Culture. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 259-274Google Scholar). The melanoma cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) containing 5% FCS (Biowest, Miami, FL), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml Fungizone in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Where indicated, melanoma cells were infected with adenovirus vectors or transfected with siRNAs and then further cultured as described under each experiment. Immunoblot analysis for the determination of total STAT3, pY-STAT3, pS-STAT3, actin, PKCα, PKCβII, PKCδ, and PKCϵ was carried out essentially as described previously (26Oka M. Hitomi T. Okada T. Nakamura S. Nagai H. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Kikkawa U. Ichihashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min. Immunoblot analysis for the determination of total c-Src and phospho-c-Src was carried out essentially as described previously (27Yamamoto N. Mammadova G. Song R.X. Fukami Y. Sato K. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4623-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were extracted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 200 μg of Triton X-100-solubilized proteins and 1.5 μg of anti-c-Src antibody overnight at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatants was measured using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein extracts from the supernatants of samples for total STAT3, pY-STAT3, pS-STAT3, actin, PKCα, PKCβII, PKCδ, and PKCϵ, and the immunoprecipitates from samples for total c-Src and phospho-c-Src were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min at room temperature and then probed with each primary antibody. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (for total STAT3, pY-STAT3, pS-STAT3, and actin), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse (for PKCα, PKCβII, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and total c-Src), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit (for phospho-c-Src) antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) were employed as the secondary antibodies. The oxidative reaction by peroxidase was detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). The color reaction for alkaline phosphatase was carried out using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega) as substrates. DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine essentially as described previously (28Oka M. Ogita K. Ando H. Kikkawa U. Ichihashi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 567-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in EMEM containing 5% FCS and then cultured for 24 h. The cells were then cultured for a further 24 h with no additives or with the addition of 0.1% DMSO (control) or 100 nm TPA. Cells were pulsed with 1 mCi/well [3H]thymidine for the last 6 h of incubation, and the radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The recombinant adenovirus vectors encoding the dominant negative mutants of PKCα (DN-PKCα), PKCδ (DN-PKCδ), and PKCϵ (DN-PKCϵ), which have been described previously (29Han J.M. Kim Y. Lee J.S.

The adenovirus carrying the β-galactosidase gene (LacZ) from Escherichia coli, which has been described previously (31Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Izumu Saito (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), was designated AxLacZ and used as a control virus. Infection with the adenoviruses did not affect cell viability at the doses used in this study. STAT3 siRNA was performed with double-stranded siRNAs against STAT3 (si-1, 5′-AAC UUC AGA CCC GUC AAC AAA dTdT-3′ and 3′-dTdT GAA GUC UGG GCA GUU GUU U-5′; si-2, 5′-AAC AUC UGC CUA GAU CGG CUA dTdT-3′ and 3′-dTdT GUA GAC GGA UCU AGC CGA U-5′), and the negative control siRNA (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) was performed using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA-binding activity of STAT3 was determined using the TransAMTM STAT3 transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. TPA-, IL-6-, or mock-treated WM1205Lu cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Five micrograms of extracted protein were used in the assay. The TransAMTM STAT3 transcription factor assay kit contains a 96-well plate with immobilized oligonucleotides encoding a STAT3 consensus site (5′-TTCCCGGAA-3′). The active form of STAT3 contained in the cell extract specifically binds to these oligonucleotides. The primary antibody used to detect STAT3 recognizes both the α and β isoforms of human STAT3. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody provides a sensitive colorimetric readout that is quantified by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm. Differences between results were assessed for significance using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. As an initial step in determining the possible involvement of STAT3 in the TPA-induced growth inhibition of melanoma cells, the effects of TPA on the in vitro growth, DNA synthesis, and STAT3 activity in seven human melanoma cell lines was investigated (Figs. 1 and 2). TPA significantly inhibited the in vitro growth as well as DNA synthesis of WM98-1, WM115, WM164, WM239A, and WM1205Lu cells, whereas it did not affect those of WM35 and WM39 cells (Fig. 1). All seven melanoma cell lines expressed similar levels of total STAT3 protein (Fig. 2A). However, STAT3 was phosphorylated (activated) on Tyr705 in the five cell lines whose growth was inhibited by TPA, whereas the activation level of STAT3 in WM35 and WM39 cells, whose growth was not inhibited by TPA, was at negligible levels. In addition, the in vitro growth (Fig. 1A) and DNA synthesis (Fig. 2B) of WM35 and WM39 were relatively lower than those of the other five cell lines. These results suggest that STAT3 plays an important role in the growth of melanoma cells and that constitutively activated STAT3 is related to TPA-induced growth inhibition of melanoma cells. To evaluate the role of STAT3 in melanoma growth directly, the effect of the siRNAs of STAT3 on melanoma growth was examined in WM1205Lu cells (Fig. 3). Knockdown of STAT3 by siRNAs in WM1205Lu cells significantly reduced the expression of total STAT3 as well as the phosphorylation of STAT3 concomitant with a decrease in the growth of the cells. These results indicate that the STAT3 activity positively regulates the growth activity of melanoma cells.FIGURE 2STAT3 is activated in human melanoma cells. A, whole cell extracts from the seven human melanoma cell lines used in Fig. 1 were prepared, and the phosphorylation level of pY-STAT3 as well as the expression of total STAT3 (t-STAT3) were determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-pY-STAT3 and anti-STAT3 antibodies, respectively. Expression of actin was also examined (top three panels). The relative amount of pY-STAT3/t-STAT3 was calculated (bottom panel). The ratio of pY-STAT3 to total STAT3 in WM35 cells is represented as 1. B, the seven melanoma cell lines used in A were seeded at 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and grown for 48 h in EMEM containing 5% FCS. [3H]Thymidine was added for the last 6 h of the incubation, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by scintillation counting. [3H]Thymidine incorporation/mg DNA was calculated for each cell line, and data are expressed as relative [3H]thymidine incorporation/mg of DNA. The value of WM35 cells is represented as 1, and data are shown as mean ± S.D. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3STAT3 is involved in melanoma growth. WM1205Lu cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. On the following day (day 0), the cells were transfected with control siRNA (40 nm) or STAT3 siRNAs, si-1 and si-2 (40 nm). Left, on day 6 the triplicate dishes were trypsinized, and the cell number was counted (left). Data are expressed as fold increase of cell number from day 0 to day 6 and are shown as mean ± S.D. (n = 3; **, p < 0.01). Right, 24 h after siRNA transfection, the phosphorylation level of pY-STAT3 as well as the expression of total STAT3 (t-STAT3) and actin was analyzed as in Fig. 2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, the effect of TPA on the tyrosine phosphorylation state and the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 in melanoma cells was investigated using WM1205Lu cells, which contain phosphorylated STAT3. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in the melanoma cells was markedly suppressed in a time-dependent manner within 60 min of TPA treatment, and the suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation lasted for at least 24 h (Fig. 4A). The DNA-binding activity of STAT3 was also suppressed by TPA time-dependently from 60 min after TPA treatment (Fig. 4B), but it was not significantly altered within 30 min after TPA treatment. The discrepancy between the changes in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of STAT3 is explained under “Discussion.” To examine whether the TPA-induced decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 is due to dephosphorylation of STAT3 by PTPase(s), WM1205Lu, WM239A, WM98-1, and WM35 cells were incubated for 30 min with sodium orthovanadate prior to the addition of TPA. The TPA-induced decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 was almost completely inhibited by the pretreatment with vanadate (Fig. 5A, vanadate (+)), indicating that the TPA-induced decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 is mediated through activation of a PTPase(s). Treatment with sodium orthovanadate alone increased the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in WM1205Lu cells, but not in WM35 cells (Fig. 5B). Because the major intracellular receptor for TPA in cells is PKC (32Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PKC is involved in the TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3. Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X almost completely inhibited the TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 6A), indicating that PKC activation is involved in the TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3. PKC consists of multiple isoforms that are divided into three groups depending on their structural differences: cPKC (classical or conventional PKC), consisting of the α, βI, βII, and γ isoforms; nPKC (new or novel PKC), consisting of the δ, ϵ, η, and θ isoforms; and aPKC (atypical PKC), consisting of the ζ and λ isoforms (32Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). PKCβI and PKCβII are splicing variants: expression of the former is restricted to certain tissues, whereas the latter is the predominant form generated from the PKCβ gene. Of these PKC groups, cPKC and nPKC but not aPKC are activated by TPA (32Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). The expression of cPKC and nPKC isoforms in the 7 melanoma cell lines used in this study was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6B). Rat brain was used as a positive control because all PKC antibodies used react with both the human and rat PKC proteins (33Oka M. Ogita K. Ando H. Horikawa T. Hayashibe K. Saito N. Kikkawa U. Ichihashi M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ were detected in all melanoma cell lines, although the amount of PKCα protein in WM35 and WM39 cells was considerably less than in the other five cell lines. PKCβII was detected in only the WM35 and WM39 cell lines. PKCγ was detected in none of the seven melanoma cell lines (data not shown). To examine whether the PKC isoforms that are commonly expressed in melanoma cells containing constitutively active STAT3 are responsible for the TPA-induced activation of the PTPase(s), dominant negative forms of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ were introduced into WM1205Lu cells using adenovirus vectors (Fig. 6C). The TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly suppressed by the introduction of the dominant negative mutant of PKCα, PKCδ, or PKCϵ, indicating that these PKC isoforms are involved in the TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3. Expression of the dominant negative forms of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ blocked both the TPA-induced inhibition of in vitro growth (Fig. 6D) and DNA synthesis (Fig. 6E). It has been reported that c-Src contributes to the constitutive activation of STAT3 in melanoma cells by phosphorylating STAT3 (21Niu G. Bowman T. Huang M. Shivers S. Reintgen D. Daud A. Chang A. Kraker A. Jove R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In WM1205Lu cells, c-Src was constitutively activated, and PP2, a Src-specific inhibitor, but not PP3, an inactive analogue of PP2, inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 concomitant with an inhibition of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 7A). This indicated that STAT3 is in part positively regulated by c-Src in melanoma cells. TPA did not, however, affect c-Src activity (Fig. 7C), indicating that TPA-induced STAT3 dephosphorylation is not due to an inhibition of c-Src activity. TPA did not affect the activity of two other representative Src family kinases, Fyn and c-Yes, in WM1205Lu cells (data not shown). It has been shown that activation of STAT3 in some melanoma cell lines relies on JAK (34Kreis S. Munz G.A. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation level of STAT3 was not affected either at 1 h (data not shown) or 3 h after JAK inhibitor I treatment in WM1205Lu cells (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that the fast Tyr705 dephosphorylation of STAT3 in melanoma cells upon TPA treatment (Figs. 4A and 5A) cannot be attributed to the inhibition of Src or JAK family kinases. It is predicted that Tyr705 phosphorylation is not sufficient for the obligatory role of STAT3 (19Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Ser727 phosphorylation in STAT3 enhances the transcriptional activity of STAT3 and is required for maximal activation of STAT3 signaling (19Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of TPA on the phosphorylation status of Ser727 in WM1205Lu cells (Fig. 8). STAT3 was constitutively phosphorylated on Ser727 in the cells. TPA treatment induced a transient (∼1 h) increase in the phosphorylation level of Ser727. Then, the phosphorylation level of Ser727 decreased and became lower than in untreated cells at 3 and 6 h after treatment. In the present study, we have shown that STAT3 plays a crucial role in the growth of melanoma cells. We have also demonstrated that STAT3 activity is in part positively regulated by c-Src and negatively regulated by a PKC-activated PTPase(s) in melanoma cells. TPA inhibits the growth of melanoma cells containing activated STAT3 but not of cells lacking activated STAT3. Furthermore, TPA-induced growth inhibition of melanoma cells is associated with dephosphorylation of STAT3 without affecting c-Src tyrosine kinase activity. Thus, we conclude that the growth-inhibitory effect of TPA on melanoma cells is mediated through dephosphorylation of STAT3. We have shown that melanoma growth is positively regulated by STAT3, which is consistent with the previous report (21Niu G. Bowman T. Huang M. Shivers S. Reintgen D. Daud A. Chang A. Kraker A. Jove R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, it is obvious that STAT3 activity is not the sole positive regulator of melanoma growth from the following facts: First, the growth activity of melanoma cell lines does not directly correlate with the levels of STAT3 activity. Second, blockade of STAT3 activity only partially inhibits the growth of melanoma cells. Third, WM35 and WM39 cells containing a negligible amount of the active form of STAT3 still grow. In contrast to the idea that constitutively activated STAT3 positively regulates melanoma growth, it has been reported that several external signals such as IL-6 and oncostatin M induce melanoma growth inhibition through activation of STAT3 (35Kortylewski M. Heinrich P.C. Mackiewicz A. Schniertshauer U. Klingmüller U. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Horn F. Behrmann I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3742-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 36Lacreusette A. Nguyen J.M. Pandolfino M.C. Khammari A. Dreno B. Jacques Y. Godard A. Blanchard F. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that constitutively activated STAT3 and external signal-induced activation of STAT3 affect melanoma growth differently. In normal cells, the level and duration of STAT3 activation are controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including dephosphorylation of the receptor complex or nuclear STAT3 dimers by PTPases, interaction of activated STAT3 with inhibitory molecules in the protein inhibitors of the activated STAT (PIAS) family, and feedback inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 pathway by the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein through inhibition and/or degradation of JAKs (37Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, 38Kubo M. Hanada T. Yoshimura A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Conversely, we have shown in this study that STAT3 is constitutively activated in most of the melanoma cell lines used, which is consistent with a previous report (21Niu G. Bowman T. Huang M. Shivers S. Reintgen D. Daud A. Chang A. Kraker A. Jove R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the mechanisms of the constitutive activation of STAT3 in cancer cells are varied (20Bromberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Previous (21Niu G. Bowman T. Huang M. Shivers S. Reintgen D. Daud A. Chang A. Kraker A. Jove R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7001-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and our present studies show that c-Src activity is involved in the constitutive activation of STAT3 in melanoma cells. Although treatment with JAK inhibitor I for at least 3 h did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of STAT3 in WM1205Lu cells (Fig. 7B), JAK inhibitor I treatment for 18 h reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation level of STAT3 (data not shown). These results indicate that JAKs, in addition to c-Src, contribute to the basal phosphorylation level of STAT3 in melanoma cells as reported previously (34Kreis S. Munz G.A. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) but not to the TPA-induced dephosphorylation of STAT3. The TPA- and PKC-activated PTPase(s) targeting the constitutively activated STAT3 in melanoma cells remain to be identified. In WM1205Lu cells the TPA-induced dephosphorylation was not observed on either STAT1 or STAT5, which are also constitutively activated in the cells (data not shown), indicating that the PKC-activated PTPase(s) preferentially dephosphorylate STAT3. Conversely, our results indicate that the PTPase(s) are activated either directly or indirectly by at least three isoforms of PKC, PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ, suggesting that the PTPase(s) can be regulated by multiple signaling pathways. Further study is required to identify the PKC-activated STAT3-dephosphorylating PTPase(s) and to clarify the regulation mechanism of the PTPase(s). It is also important to examine whether the PTPase(s) play a role in the external signal induced activation-inactivation cycle of STAT3. The results in Fig. 4B show that the levels of DNA-binding activity of STAT3 between 10 and 30 min after TPA treatment remain at higher levels than those expected from the level of Tyr705 phosphorylation. The apparent dissociation of DNA-binding activity of STAT3 from the level of Tyr705 phosphorylation may be ascribed to the transient increase in the level of Ser727 phosphorylation that contributes to an increase in DNA-binding activity of STAT3 (19Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Constitutively activated STAT3 is found in a variety of cancer cells and is regarded as an attractive molecular target for cancer therapy (39Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6613-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 40Xi S. Gooding W.E. Grandis J.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 41Jing N.

Herlyn M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1059: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown that down-regulation of STAT3 activity by either TPA or siRNAs leads to an efficient growth inhibition of melanoma cells. In addition, it has been shown, using in vivo tumor models, that murine B16 melanoma tumors regress after inhibition of constitutively activated STAT3 by gene therapy with a dominant negative STAT3 (44Niu G. Heller R. Catlett-Falcone R. Coppola D. Jaroszeski M. Dalton W. Jove R. Yu H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5059-5063PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the PKC-dependent STAT3-dephosphorylating PTPase(s) may lead to improved melanoma therapy through modulation of STAT3 activity."

The Ser/Thr kinase 35 (STK35, Clik1) is a member of the NKF 4 (New Kinase Family 4) in the kinome with unknown substrates and biological functions. Various high throughput studies indicate that STK35 could be involved in various human diseases such as colorectal cancer and malaria.In this study, we found that the previously published coding sequence of the STK35 gene is incomplete. The newly identified sequence of the STK35 gene codes for a protein of 534 amino acids with a N-terminal elongation of 133 amino acids. It has been designated as STK35L (STK35 long). Since it is the first of further homologous kinases we termed it as STK35L1. The STK35L1 protein (58 kDa on SDS-PAGE), but not STK35 (44 kDa), was found to be expressed in all human cells studied (endothelial cells, HeLa, and HEK cells) and was down-regulated after silencing with specific siRNA. EGFP-STK35L1 was localized in the nucleus and the nucleolus. By combining syntenic and gene structure pattern data and homology searches, two further STK35L1 homologs, STK35L2 (previously known as PDIK1L) and STK35L3, were found. All these protein kinase homologs were conserved throughout the vertebrates. The STK35L3 gene was specifically lost during placental mammalian evolution. Using comparative genomics, we have identified orthologous sets of these three protein kinases genes and their possible ancestor gene in two sea squirt genomes.We found the full-length coding sequence of the STK35 gene and termed it as STK35L1. We identified a new third STK35-like gene, STK35L3, in vertebrates and a possible ancestor gene in sea squirt genome. This study will provide a comprehensive platform to explore the role of STK35L kinases in cell functions and human diseases."

Two separate genes encode the catalytic (AChE) and collagen tail (ColQ) subunits of the hetero-oligomeric collagen-tailed AChE forms expressed in skeletal muscle (for review, see Refs. 1.Massoulié J.

A single ColQ-AChE molecule consists of three catalytic AChE tetramers attached to a triple-helical collagen-like tail composed of three separate ColQ molecules. In some species and in some muscles, one (A4) or two (A8) tetramers of AChE attached to the triple helical ColQ subunits are observed. Each ColQ strand binds covalently to a tetramer of catalytic subunits, and each tetramer in turn consists of two dimers, with one dimer having its two C-terminal cysteine residues covalently linked to cysteine residues at the N terminus of ColQ. The other two catalytic subunits are also disulfide-linked to each other through the same residues (4.Rosenberry T.L. Richardson J.M.

Physiologically the expression of the synaptic ColQ-AChE form is regulated by the incoming nerve and by depolarization of the cell membrane (6.Vigny M. Di Giamberardino L. Couraud J.Y. Rieger F.

J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 743-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In rats, for example, muscle paralysis due to denervation or induced pharmacologically leads to dramatic decrease in AChE transcripts and their accumulation at junctional sarcoplasm (12.Michel R.N.

Avian systems behave differently; the addition of veratridine or scorpion venom (ScVn) to cultured avian muscle tissues, maintaining sodium channels in the open state and, thus, chronically depolarizing the membrane, results in increased levels of ColQ-AChE activity and decreased ColQ and AChE mRNAs (15.Rossi S.G. Vazquez A.E. Rotundo R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 919-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Rossi S.G. Katz S. Rotundo R.L. J. Physiol. 1998; 92: 486-487Google Scholar, 17.Ruiz C.A. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21488-21495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In parallel, there is a large increase in ColQ-AChE as well as an increase in cell surface enzyme activity and clusters of active enzyme molecules. In contrast, when tetrodotoxin (TTX) is added to maintain sodium channels in the closed state, the levels of ColQ-AChE activity decrease and of ColQ and AChE mRNAs increase (15.Rossi S.G. Vazquez A.E. Rotundo R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 919-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Rossi S.G. Katz S. Rotundo R.L. J. Physiol. 1998; 92: 486-487Google Scholar, 17.Ruiz C.A. Rotundo R.L. J.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Yet in the presence of TTX there is a significant decrease in ColQ-AChE expression as well as a decrease in cell surface enzyme activity and clusters of AChE (15.Rossi S.G. Vazquez A.E. Rotundo R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 919-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Rossi S.G. Katz S. Rotundo R.L. J. Physiol. 1998; 92: 486-487Google Scholar, 19.Rubin L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 7121-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Under both experimental conditions, chronically or blocked membrane depolarization, the levels of AChE catalytic subunit mRNA correlate positively with total AChE activity but not with the levels of catalytically active ColQ-AChE (15.Rossi S.G. Vazquez A.E. Rotundo R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 919-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Rossi S.G. Katz S. Rotundo R.L. J. Physiol. 1998; 92: 486-487Google Scholar). These observations suggest that post-translational regulation occurs at the level of assembly. One possible mechanism to control the expression of ColQ-AChE could be by regulating the rate of assembly of catalytic and collagen tail subunits. The globular dimeric and tetrameric AChE forms are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-translationally processed in the ER and Golgi apparatus (20.Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21.Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13186-13194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Rotundo R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3146-3152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, ER molecular chaperones are likely to be involved in regulating ColQ-AChE assembly. It has previously been reported that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor biogenesis is regulated in part by the chaperone calnexin (24.Chang W. Gelman M.S. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28925-28932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25.Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Prives J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17064-17072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Presumably this occurs by increasing the efficiency of subunit folding. In addition, AChE catalytic subunits are stabilized by three intrachain disulfide bonds (28.Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar, 29.Bourne Y. Taylor P. Bougis P.E. Marchot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2963-2970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); therefore, ER thiol oxidoreductases must be involved in their folding, providing additional candidates for regulating AChE biogenesis. Members of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family are the known ER-resident thiol oxidoreductases. They catalyze formation and isomerization of intra- and interchain disulfides bridges. Moreover, PDI is also the β-subunit of prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H), an α2/β2 hetero-tetramer localized in the ER that catalyzes co-translationally the hydroxylation of proline residues in Xaa-Pro-Gly sequences on single collagen polypeptide chains, which is an obligatory posttranslational modification before trimerization of the collagen strands (for review, see Ref. 30.Wilkinson B. Gilbert H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Until trimerization occurs, PDI retains unassembled pro-collagen propeptides in the ER (31.Bottomley M.J. Batten M.R. Lumb R.A. Bulleid N.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1114-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that PDI is required for ColQ and AChE assembly and maturation and may play a regulatory role controlling collagen-tailed AChE forms expression post-translationally. We now show that inhibition of thiol oxidoreductase activity in primary quail myotubes decreases expression of all intracellular AChE forms. Knockdown of PDI results in a decrease of all collagen-tailed AChE forms and cell surface AChE clusters. Conversely, overexpression of PDI, endoplasmic reticulum protein 72 (Erp72), or calnexin in muscle cells enhances expression of all collagen-tailed AChE forms including the synaptic ColQ-AChE, with PDI having the most dramatic effect with a 100% increase in intracellular ColQ-AChE and cell surface enzyme activity. In addition, we show that levels of PDI are regulated by muscle activity and correlate with the levels of ColQ-AChE. Finally, we demonstrate that PDI interacts directly with AChE during AChE folding. Together our results show that catalytically active ColQ-AChE expression can be regulated by molecular chaperones posttranslationally at the level of individual subunit folding and/or at the level of assembly of catalytic and collagen tail subunits. More importantly, our studies suggest that there may be more competition for ER chaperone-assisted folding than previously thought. Primary myoblasts were obtained from the pectoral muscles of 10-day-old quail embryos and plated at 5 × 104 cells/ml in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM 210; Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% chicken embryo extract, 10% horse serum (GemCell), and 0.1% gentamicin (Invitrogen). The quail muscle cultures (QMCs) were fed with fresh medium on days three and five after plating, and on day three the medium was supplemented with 10−6 m cytosine-arabinoside (Sigma) to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Cultures were maintained in a 39 °C in a water-saturated incubator with 5% CO2. To study the newly synthesized AChE, QMCs were treated with 10−4 m diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature followed by 3 washes in PBS alone to remove unreacted DFP. The cultures were then returned to the incubator to recover in complete medium with or without additional treatments as described. When used, 6-day-old QMCs were pretreated with 5.4 μm α-amanitin (Fluka) for 30 min and/or 10−4 m DFP for 10 min. The cells were then treated with 20 μm ScVn (Sigma) or 5 μm TTX (Sigma) with or without 5.4 μm α-amanitin for 12 h. In other studies, 6-day-old QMCs were treated with 10−4 m DFP for 10 min and allowed to recover for 24 h in the presence of 1 mm bacitracin, a thiol oxidoreductase activity inhibitor, or incubated for 10 min with 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) added directly to the culture medium, washed, and allowed to recover in complete medium for up to 30 min before extraction and analysis. The oligomeric forms of AChE were extracted with borate extraction buffer (20 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and the protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml) and pepstatin (2 μg/ml). After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, 150-μl aliquots of crude cell extract pooled from triplicate samples were analyzed by velocity sedimentation in a Beckman SW41ti rotor at 36 × 103 rpm for 16 h on 5–20% sucrose gradients in extraction buffer without bovine serum albumin. To separate G4 and A4, Triton X-100 was replaced by 0.5% Brij-98, and the gradients were run in a Beckman SW41ti rotor at 40 × 103 rpm for 22 h. The fractions were collected and assayed for AChE activity using the Ellman assay (32.Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Feather-stone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21510) Google Scholar). Chicken PDI (chPDI) and Erp72 (chErp72) cDNAs were cloned into pTarget (Promega) by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA isolated from primary chick embryo fibroblast cultures using primers based on the respective sequences identified as GI:11809988 and GI:57530767, available from the NCBI data base. The cloned cDNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and included the endogenous leader sequences at the 5′ end and the ER retention signal at the 3′ end to ensure ER localization of the encoded proteins. A 900-bp quail PDI (qPDI) cDNA fragment was cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) by reverse transcription-PCR from QMC total RNA using ACCTGCTCGTGGAGTTC as forward and GGCTGCTTGTCCCAGTC as reverse primers. The primers matched conserved regions among human, cow, mouse, rat, and chicken PDI cDNAs, all available from the NCBI data base. Based on the sequence of the cloned qPDI cDNA fragment, we designed and cloned in pSilencer 3.0-H1 (Ambion) three different qPDI shRNAs: qPDI shRNA1, CAGCGACCATAGTGATAAT; qPDI shRNA2, AAGGACGTAACAACTTTGA; qPDI shRNA3, CCAGTGAAGTGGTTGTGAT. All experiments carried out here were done using qPDI shRNA2. QMCs were transfected with plasmids encoding quail ColQ (pTarget-qColQ), chPDI (pTarget-chPDI), chErp72 (pTarget-Erp72), canine calnexin (pBK-calnexin) (a generous gift from Dr. Joav Prives, Stony Brook, NY), qPDI shRNA (pSilencer H1 qPDI shRNA), or qColQ (pSilencer H1 qColQ shRNA) using Exgen-500 (Fermentas) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. In parallel, control groups were transfected with empty pTarget or enhanced green fluorescent protein shRNA (pSilencer H1 EGFPshRNA). For immunofluorescence studies, a plasmid encoding red fluorescent protein pHcRed1-N1 (Clontech) was used to identify transfected cells. Primary QMCs were incubated on a shaker platform at 4 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.6, per 35-mm culture dish containing 1 mm acetylcholine and 105 cpm of [3H]acetylcholine iodide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). At 60 min of incubation, 100 μl of aliquots were removed and counted in a liquid scintillation counter using the two-phase system as previously described (33.Rotundo R.L. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1980; 22: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Blanks for background subtraction consisted of collagen-coated tissue culture dishes without cells. Six-day-old QMCs and HEK 293 cells stably expressing human AChE catalytic subunit (HEK 293-hAChE) (hAChE cDNA was the generous gift of Dr. Andrew Engel, Mayo Medical School) growing on 35-mm dishes were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated with complete medium with or without 5 mm DTT for 20 min at 37 °C in the case of HEK 293-hAChE or 39 °C for the QMCs. After treatment, the DTT was removed by washing twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the cells were allowed to recover for 0, 5, 10, or 15 min in regular medium at the appropriate temperature. Cells were then extracted in RIPA buffer as indicated below, and the total cell extracts were used for coimmunoprecipitation studies. Six-day-old QMCs or HEK 293-hAChE cells previously treated with DTT as described above were extracted on ice for 20 min in RIPA buffer (0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce) and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) to preserve PDI-substrate complexes. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material. The RIPA-soluble fractions were incubated with either 4 μl of rabbit anti-PDI (Stressgen), 10 μg of mouse anti-avian AChE 1A2 (21.Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13186-13194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 10 μg of mouse anti-hAChE AE2 (34.Fambrough D.M. Engel A.G. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), or mouse IgG or rabbit IgG alone for 2 h at 4 °C. Then 10 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the mixture, and incubation was continued overnight. The beads were subsequently washed three times with RIPA buffer and one time with PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture followed by resuspension in 2× reducing SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris base, pH 6.5, 6% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm DTT, bromphenol blue). The samples were then used to detect coimmunoprecipitated AChE or PDI by Western blot analysis. All incubations were done at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Primary QMCs treated with ScVn and TTX as described above were extracted in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation, samples containing 50 μg of total protein were run in 10% reducing SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman) and blocked with 1% powdered skim milk (Carnation) for 1 h, incubated with mouse anti-PDI monoclonal antibody 1D3 (Abcam) (1:1000), washed 4 times with 0.025% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse peroxidase antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals), and developed with West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). All immunoprecipitated samples were treated, run, and analyzed under identical conditions. The PDI was detected using anti-PDI antibody (1:5000) and minimal cross-reacting goat anti-rabbit peroxidase (Jackson Immunochemicals) as second antibody. To detect quail AChE, mouse monoclonal antibody 1A2 (1.6 μg/ml) followed by goat anti-mouse peroxidase antibody was used. To detect hAChE, we biotinylated an equimolar mixture of AE2 and AE3 mouse monoclonal antibodies (34.Fambrough D.M. Engel A.G. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) using EZ-Link NHS-PEO Solid Phase Biotinylation kit (Pierce). These biotinylated antibodies were used at a concentration of 0.6 μg/ml followed by incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase 1:20,000 (Pierce). In all cases the positive bands were developed with West Pico chemiluminescent substrate. The integrated density of Western blot bands was determined using ImageJ software from the NIH. Primary QMCs were blocked for 20 min with 1% bovine serum albumin and then sequentially incubated with mouse anti-avian AChE antibody 1A2 for 1 h followed by 20 μg/ml Alexa 488-donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst dye to stain the nuclei. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7, for 20 min. Between incubations the cells were washed 4 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution. All images were acquired with identical exposure parameters using a Leica DMR-A or DMI 6000 fluorescence microscopes operated by 3i Slidebook 4.0 software. We previously studied the regulation of the structural ColQ subunit at the transcriptional level (17.Ruiz C.A. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21488-21495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). During QMC development and as a function of muscle activity, we observed a lack of correlation between the levels of total AChE activity on the one hand and ColQ subunit mRNAs as well as the levels of ColQ-AChE activity expressed in QMCs on the other. This was most apparent when muscle activity was up or down-regulated using sodium channel agonists or antagonists (17.Ruiz C.A. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21488-21495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To determine whether changes in muscle activity could regulate ColQ-AChE expression at the post-transcriptional level, we treated QMCs with ScVn or TTX in the presence or absence of 4.9 μg/ml α-amanitin to inhibit transcription of mRNA precursors by Pol II. In addition, the QMCs were treated with DFP, a membrane-permeable organophosphate that irreversibly blocks all cell-associated AChE activity. The cells were then allowed to synthesize new AChE molecules for 12 h before extraction and analysis of the expressed AChE forms by velocity sedimentation. As published previously by us and by others (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 2.Legay C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 49: 56-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3.Rotundo R.L. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 743-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), maintaining sodium channels in the open state with ScVn up-regulated expression of synaptic ColQ-AChE (Fig. 1A), whereas blocking membrane depolarization with TTX resulted in a decrease of ColQ-AChE (Fig. 1C). In α-amanitin-treated QMC, total AChE activity was decreased. Nevertheless, the ColQ-AChE form increased (Fig. 1B) or decreased (Fig. 1D) when the cells were treated with ScVn or TTX, respectively. These observations were consistent among three independent experiments in which each experimental group consisted of triplicate cultures. Thus, inhibiting transcription did not affect the manner in which muscle activity regulated ColQ-AChE assembly. As usual, a small percentage of the newly synthesized AChE is assembled into synaptic ColQ-AChE form. The relative proportion of AChE forms in QMCs from Fig. 1, A and B, is different from that in Fig. 1, C and D, because they belong to two separate sets of primary cultures. In general the relative amount of the ColQ-AChE form varies from one set of cultures to the other. There are many factors that affect it including the time of the year, source of quail eggs, age of embryos, and age of cultures as well as the lots of horse serum and chicken embryo extract used to supplement the medium. ColQ-AChE is a secreted molecule assembled from 2 different types of subunits, 12 globular catalytic subunits arranged as tetramers and a 3-stranded collagen-like molecule that is covalently attached via disulfide bonds. Based on these structural features of collagen-tailed AChE and the experimental evidence that muscle activity regulates ColQ-AChE expression post-transcriptionally, we postulated that among the multiple ER molecular chaperones, PDI would be one likely candidate to be involved in catalyzing ColQ and AChE assembly. In addition, it could potentially play a regulatory role should the availability of chaperones become limiting. We, therefore, asked whether PDI was required for the expression of collagen-tailed AChE forms. First, we determined the effect of bacitracin, a thiol oxidoreductase activity inhibitor (35.Clive D.R. Greene J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36.Osborne C.K. Monaco M.E. Lippman M.E. Kahn C.R. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 94-102PubMed Google Scholar), on catalytically active AChE expression in QMCs. We compared both the intracellular steady state and newly synthesized AChE levels in the presence or absence of bacitracin. Inhibition of thiol oxidoreductase activity while the QMCs were recovering from DFP treatment resulted in a decrease of all newly synthesized catalytically active AChE forms, including the ColQ-AChE form (Fig. 2). The percent decrease for the G1+G2, G4+A4, and ColQ-AChE (A12) pool was 18, 36, and 30%, respectively. These results indicate that thiol oxidoreductase activity is required for folding of catalytically active AChE molecules. However, all PDI family members bear thiol oxidoreductase activity, and skeletal muscle fibers appear to express at least three variants (37.Haugstetter J. Blicher T. Ellgaard L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8371-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38.Knoblach B. Keller B.O. Groenendyk J. Aldred S. Zheng J. Lemire B.D. Li L. Michalak M. Mol. Cell.

Pathol. 2004; 164: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine whether PDI was specifically required for ColQ-AChE expression, we transfected QMCs with a plasmid encoding a qPDI-shRNA to selectively knock down PDI expression without affecting other thiol oxidoreductases. All intracellular collagen-tailed AChE forms were down-regulated when PDI was knocked down by the qPDI shRNA. Nevertheless, the pool of monomers and dimers remained unaffected (Fig. 3A). This experiment is representative of three independent experiments. In this case the percent decrease for the G4+A4 and ColQ-AChE pool was 37 and 55%, respectively.FIGURE 3PDI is required for catalytically active collagen-tailed AChE form expression. A, primary QMCs were transfected with pSilencer qPDI shRNA (open diamonds) or qColQ shRNA (open circles). The AChE forms were fractionated by velocity sedimentation in 5–20% sucrose gradients. G1, G2, and G4 refer to AChE monomers, dimers, and tetramers, and A4, A8, and A12 refer to the various collagen-tailed forms consisting of one, two, or three tetramers attached to the ColQ subunit, respectively. EGFP shRNA (solid circles) was used as negative control. Expression of the synaptic ColQ-AChE and the collagen-tailed A4 forms was decreased in muscle cells when either PDI or ColQ was knocked down specifically by the shRNAs. Panel B, relative PDI content was determined by a Western blot of triplicate QMC crude extracts from cells transfected with either EGFP shRNA (control) or PDI shRNA.

https://openalex.org/W2086415397,"Background Earlier we have reported translational control of interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) by internal initiation (Dhar et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 2007). The results implied possible role of IRF2 in controlling the intricate balance of cellular gene expression under stress conditions in general. Here we have investigated the secondary structure of the Internal Ribosome Entry Site of IRF2 RNA and demonstrated the role of PTB protein in ribosome assembly to facilitate internal initiation. Methodology/Principal Findings We have probed the putative secondary structure of the IRF2 5′UTR RNA using various enzymatic and chemical modification agents to constrain the secondary structure predicted from RNA folding algorithm Mfold. The IRES activity was found to be influenced by the interaction of trans-acting factor, polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB). Deletion of 25 nts from the 3′terminus of the 5′untranslated region resulted in reduced binding with PTB protein and also showed significant decrease in IRES activity compared to the wild type. We have also demonstrated putative contact points of PTB on the IRF2–5′UTR using primer extension inhibition assay. Majority of the PTB toe-prints were found to be restricted to the 3′end of the IRES. Additionally, Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra analysis suggested change in the conformation of the RNA upon PTB binding. Further, binding studies using S10 extract from HeLa cells, partially silenced for PTB gene expression, resulted in reduced binding by other trans-acting factors. Finally, we have demonstrated that addition of recombinant PTB enhances ribosome assembly on IRF2 IRES suggesting possible role of PTB in mediating internal initiation of translation of IRF2 RNA. Conclusion/Significance It appears that PTB binding to multiple sites within IRF2 5′UTR leads to a conformational change in the RNA that facilitate binding of other trans-acting factors to mediate internal initiation of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2022871070,"A new study by Yao et al. in the current issue of Cell proposes that a novel vesicular protein, dubbed Flower, regulates endocytosis by controlling presynaptic Ca2+ levels. This finding is intriguing not only for its implications for vesicle cycling, but also for the multitude of Ca2+-dependent processes at play in presynaptic nerve terminals. A new study by Yao et al. in the current issue of Cell proposes that a novel vesicular protein, dubbed Flower, regulates endocytosis by controlling presynaptic Ca2+ levels. This finding is intriguing not only for its implications for vesicle cycling, but also for the multitude of Ca2+-dependent processes at play in presynaptic nerve terminals. It is well established that activation of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca2+ channels triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, leading to release of neurotransmitter. Lately, much attention has turned to the role of Ca2+ on the other side of the synaptic vesicle cycle, in which vesicular membrane and protein are retrieved from the plasma membrane by the process of endocytosis. Although the mechanistic details of endocytosis are still being clarified, it is clear from studies using diverse experimental preparations and paradigms that endocytosis, like exocytosis, is regulated by Ca2+ (Ceccarelli and Hurlbut, 1980Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2001Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Nat.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Where exactly does the Ca2+ that modulates endocytosis come from? This unresolved issue has important implications for the relationship between exocytosis and endocytosis. One possibility is that endocytic processes respond to Ca2+ entry through the same Ca2+ channels that trigger exocytosis. However, exocytosis and endocytosis do not necessarily occur at the same site, they have different time courses, and they may have different dependencies on Ca2+ concentration (Heuser and Reese, 1973Heuser J.E. Reese T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 315-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, Hosoi et al., 2009Hosoi N. Holt M. Sakaba T.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11793-11802Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It might be expected then that having different sources of Ca2+ could permit finer control over distinct aspects of the vesicle cycle. But, if there are distinct Ca2+ signals, how can they be coordinated to support the balance between exocytosis and endocytosis necessary for maintained synaptic transmission? In the current issue of Cell, Yao et al., 2009Yao C.K. Lin Y.Q. Ly C.V. Ohyama T. Haueter C.M. Mosieenkiova-Bell V.Y. Wensel T.G. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2009; 138: in pressAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar identify a novel Ca2+ channel localized to synaptic vesicles. They propose that the insertion of this channel in the plasma membrane provides a source of Ca2+ that selectively regulates endocytosis, but not exocytosis, and could provide a critical link between these different phases of the synaptic vesicle cycle. The new work by Yao et al. arose from a forward genetic screen for synaptic transmission mutants in Drosophila. Out of a number of mutations identified in this screen, two mapped to a gene with previously unknown function that the authors named “flower,” since a phenotypic consequence of the mutations was the breakup of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) into florets of tiny, synaptic boutons. Using several immunolabeling approaches, Yao et al. demonstrated that the B isoform of the Flower protein, the only one of three splice variants expressed in the nervous system, is primarily associated with synaptic vesicles with some additional expression at the presynaptic membrane. The vesicular localization of Flower suggested to Yao et al. a potential role in synaptic vesicle trafficking. Indeed, anatomical and functional analysis of the mutants revealed multiple phenotypic features reminiscent of previously identified mutants deficient in synaptic vesicle endocytosis including larger synaptic vesicles, an increase in the appearance of endocytic intermediates at terminals, and greater depression of excitatory junction potential amplitudes recorded at the NMJ at moderate stimulus frequencies. Compared to those of control flies, flower mutant NMJ terminals also exhibited less depolarization-induced uptake of the styryl dye FM1-43, which fluorescently labels endocytosed membranes, consistent with a deficit in endocytosis. What is Flower doing on vesicles and how does its function contribute to endocytosis? The flower gene is evolutionarily conserved from worms to humans, and Yao et al. noticed that the highest amino acid sequence homology between species occurs within the predicted transmembrane (TM) regions of the Flower protein (three or four TM domains were predicted from the primary amino acid sequence). The authors were particularly intrigued by a conserved glutamate-alanine-proline (EAP) sequence in the second predicted TM domain (TM2) of all Flower homologs because Ca2+ selectivity in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is thought to rely upon conserved glutamate or aspartate residues in the pore region of these channels. Further, similar amino acid sequences were observed in the ion selectivity region of the Ca2+-permeable TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels and the EAP-containing region within TM2 of Flower. Although the predicted membrane topology of Flower is unlike that of voltage-gated channels (four repeated domains of six TM regions) or TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels (six TM regions in each subunit), the authors note that examples of four-TM-domain proteins that form calcium channels do exist. Thus, Yao et al. hypothesize that Flower forms a Ca2+-permeable channel in the synaptic vesicle membrane. Yao et al. could not achieve membrane expression of Flower in standard heterologous expression systems and were therefore not able to directly test the possible Ca2+ permeability of Flower using electrophysiology. The authors instead examined this issue by expressing the B isoform of Flower in Drosophila salivary gland cells, which are secretory cells that do not normally express Flower. Flower expressed in salivary gland cells localized to the cell surface and resulted in the gradual intracellular accumulation of Ca2+, as assessed by Ca2+ imaging. Importantly, mutation of the predicted second TM glutamate residue to an uncharged glutamine residue reduced Ca2+ accumulation to baseline levels. To rule out the possibility that Flower expression was gating Ca2+ permeability of a different protein endogenous to salivary gland cells, Yao et al. also reconstituted purified Flower protein into proteoliposomes. Consistent with the formation of a Ca2+-permeable channel, liposomes containing Flower exhibited significantly more uptake of radioactively labeled Ca2+ ions compared to empty liposomes. Finally, the authors reasoned that if Flower forms a Ca2+channel, its expression at the presynaptic membrane, which they had previously established, might measurably alter presynaptic resting Ca2+ levels. In fact, when they measured resting Ca2+ levels in NMJ boutons, they observed a significant decrease in Ca2+ in flower mutants compared to controls that was at least partially rescued by reintroduction of wild-type Flower into the mutants. When these lines of evidence for the Ca2+ permeability of Flower are considered together, it seems likely that this protein represents a novel route for Ca2+ entry to the presynaptic terminal. Yao et al. conclude that Flower forms Ca2+ channels in vesicle membranes and that their presence regulates endocytosis. The authors suggest a model in which Flower is associated with synaptic vesicles at rest, but after insertion into the presynaptic plasma membrane upon full-fusion exocytosis, Ca2+ influx through Flower contributes to the Ca2+ signal mediating endocytic reuptake of vesicular membrane (including Flower itself) (see Figure 7E of Yao et al., 2009Yao C.K. Lin Y.Q. Ly C.V. Ohyama T. Haueter C.M. Mosieenkiova-Bell V.Y. Wensel T.G. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2009; 138: in pressAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hence, Flower is a channel in effect “gated” by the synaptic vesicle cycle. This self-regulatory mechanism presents a conceptually satisfying solution to the problem of maintaining a balance between exocytosis and endocytosis at the synapse; with increasing levels of exocytosis, more Flower is inserted into the synaptic membrane and the ensuing increase in Ca2+ triggers higher levels of endocytosis. If Flower selectively associates with vesicular proteins, it could even enhance the efficiency of synaptic vesicle recycling by providing a local signal for the selective reuptake of critical vesicular constituents. It should be mentioned that Yao et al. did not explicitly link the Ca2+ channel behavior of Flower to a direct role in endocytosis. Their data leaves open the possibility that disruption of a separate function of Flower, distinct from or in addition to its ability to conduct Ca2+ ions, may account for the endocytosis defects in flower mutants. This possibility could potentially be addressed by assessing the effect of introducing Flower with the TM2 domain glutamate-to-glutamine mutation (which the authors showed abolishes Ca2+ permeability) into flower mutant flies. Since this point mutation should affect Ca2+ entry through Flower while leaving intact other potential functional domains, the prediction would be that the endocytosis deficiencies of flower mutants would not be rescued in such an experiment. Nevertheless, the discovery of a novel presynaptic Ca2+ source has significant ramifications for the regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ levels that extend beyond synaptic vesicle endocytosis. The resting [Ca2+]i of synaptic terminals is a critical determinant of several fundamental presynaptic properties including the probability of neurotransmitter release and the mobilization of vesicles between reserve and readily-releasable pools (Neher and Sakaba, 2008Neher E. Sakaba T. Neuron. 2008; 59: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Even small changes in resting Ca2+ levels may have significant effects on presynaptic function. For example, in some mammalian nerve terminals, vesicle release probability is enhanced by small depolarizations that elicit increases in background presynaptic [Ca2+] of less than 100 nM (Awatramani et al., 2005Awatramani G.B. Price G.D. Trussell L.O. Neuron. 2005; 48: 109-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Since the membrane distribution of Flower is proposed to depend on the recent history of exocytosis, this protein could provide a means to regulate resting presynaptic [Ca2+]i and, accordingly, presynaptic function in relation to recent patterns of activity. Because the suggestion that Flower is a novel Ca2+ source has many potential consequences for synaptic transmission, it will be critical to obtain direct evidence that it is in fact a Ca2+ channel. Thus, future studies will need to achieve successful membrane expression of Flower in a heterologous system amenable to patch-clamp analysis. Likewise, clear demonstration that Flower is in fact inserted into the presynaptic membrane and alters terminal Ca2+ levels upon exocytosis would further cement an important role for Flower in presynaptic physiology. Beyond clarifying these issues, numerous additional questions will blossom forth from the study of Yao et al., as befits the first description of a new synaptic protein. Most non-Drosophila neurobiologists will ask about the targeting and function of Flower homologs in other species. In regards to its contribution at synapses, how does Ca2+ flux through Flower compare to that mediated by other sources such as voltage-gated channels, and do their relative contributions change under specific conditions? Is Flower activity selectively associated with specific presynaptic spike patterns? Since kinetically distinct modes of endocytosis appear to have different requirements for Ca2+ (Wu et al., 2009Wu X.S. McNeil B.D. Xu J. Fan J. Xue L. Melicoff E. Adachi R. Bai L. Wu L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), answering these questions may shed light on regulatory mechanisms underlying different endocytic pathways. If the proposed role for Flower proves ubiquitous, what would this mean for “kiss-and-run” exocytosis, in which the protein would have no access to plasma membrane? The discovery of Flower by Yao et al. provides an exciting new perspective on endocytosis. Further study may bear unexpected fruit for other aspects of presynaptic function as well."

In particular, markers of exposure to different types of respiratory pathogens may yield diverse sets of markers that can be used to differentiate exposure. We examine a mouse model of aerosol exposure to known Gram negative bacterial pathogens, Francisella tularensis novicida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mice were subjected to either a pathogen or control exposure and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at four and twenty four hours post exposure. Small protein and peptide markers within the BALF were detected by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) and analyzed using both exploratory and predictive data analysis methods; principle component analysis and degree of association. The markers detected were successfully used to accurately identify the four hour exposed samples from the control samples. This report demonstrates the potential for small protein and peptide marker profiles to identify aerosol exposure in a short post-exposure time frame."
