https://openalex.org/W2155707112,"Copy number variation (CNV) of DNA sequences is functionally significant but has yet to be fully ascertained. We have constructed a first-generation CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Europe, Africa or Asia (the HapMap collection). DNA from these individuals was screened for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number variable regions (CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses, covering 360 megabases (12% of the genome) were identified in these populations. These CNVRs contained hundreds of genes, disease loci, functional elements and segmental duplications. Notably, the CNVRs encompassed more nucleotide content per genome than SNPs, underscoring the importance of CNV in genetic diversity and evolution. The data obtained delineate linkage disequilibrium patterns for many CNVs, and reveal marked variation in copy number among populations. We also demonstrate the utility of this resource for genetic disease studies."

We report here the positional cloning of Gpc-B1 , a wheat quantitative trait locus associated with increased grain protein, zinc, and iron content. The ancestral wild wheat allele encodes a NAC transcription factor ( NAM-B1 ) that accelerates senescence and increases nutrient remobilization from leaves to developing grains, whereas modern wheat varieties carry a nonfunctional NAM-B1 allele. Reduction in RNA levels of the multiple NAM homologs by RNA interference delayed senescence by more than 3 weeks and reduced wheat grain protein, zinc, and iron content by more than 30%."
https://openalex.org/W2088513836,"Cardiogenesis requires the generation of endothelial, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, thought to arise from distinct embryonic precursors. We use genetic fate-mapping studies to document that isl1(+) precursors from the second heart field can generate each of these diverse cardiovascular cell types in vivo. Utilizing embryonic stem (ES) cells, we clonally amplified a cellular hierarchy of isl1(+) cardiovascular progenitors, which resemble the developmental precursors in the embryonic heart. The transcriptional signature of isl1(+)/Nkx2.5(+)/flk1(+) defines a multipotent cardiovascular progenitor, which can give rise to cells of all three lineages. These studies document a developmental paradigm for cardiogenesis, where muscle and endothelial lineage diversification arises from a single cell-level decision of a multipotent isl1(+) cardiovascular progenitor cell (MICP). The discovery of ES cell-derived MICPs suggests a strategy for cardiovascular tissue regeneration via their isolation, renewal, and directed differentiation into specific mature cardiac, pacemaker, smooth muscle, and endothelial cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2034206562,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a phylogenetically widespread gene-silencing process triggered by double-stranded RNA. In plants and Caenorhabditis elegans , two distinct populations of small RNAs have been proposed to participate in RNAi: “Primary siRNAs” (derived from DICER nuclease-mediated cleavage of the original trigger) and “secondary siRNAs” [additional small RNAs whose synthesis requires an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP)]. Analyzing small RNAs associated with ongoing RNAi in C. elegans , we found that secondary siRNAs constitute the vast majority. The bulk of secondary siRNAs exhibited structure and sequence indicative of a biosynthetic mode whereby each molecule derives from an independent de novo initiation by RdRP. Analysis of endogenous small RNAs indicated that a fraction derive from a biosynthetic mechanism that is similar to that of secondary siRNAs formed during RNAi, suggesting that small antisense transcripts derived from cellular messenger RNAs by RdRP activity may have key roles in cellular regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1988451304,"Despite recent advances in delineating the mechanisms involved in cardiogenesis, cellular lineage specification remains incompletely understood. To explore the relationship between developmental fate and potential, we isolated a cardiac-specific Nkx2.5+ cell population from the developing mouse embryo. The majority of these cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes and conduction system cells. Some, surprisingly, adopted a smooth muscle fate. To address the clonal origin of these lineages, we isolated Nkx2.5+ cells from in vitro differentiated murine embryonic stem cells and found ∼28% of these cells expressed c-kit. These c-kit+ cells possessed the capacity for long-term in vitro expansion and differentiation into both cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells from a single cell. We confirmed these findings by isolating c-kit+Nkx2.5+ cells from mouse embryos and demonstrated their capacity for bipotential differentiation in vivo. Taken together, these results support the existence of a common precursor for cardiovascular lineages in the mammalian heart. Despite recent advances in delineating the mechanisms involved in cardiogenesis, cellular lineage specification remains incompletely understood.

We confirmed these findings by isolating c-kit+Nkx2.5+ cells from mouse embryos and demonstrated their capacity for bipotential differentiation in vivo. Taken together, these results support the existence of a common precursor for cardiovascular lineages in the mammalian heart. The mammalian heart develops through a series of carefully orchestrated events and contains three major lineages—myocardial, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. The developmental precursor for myocardial cells is most commonly ascribed to the cardiogenic mesoderm arising from cells in the primitive streak (Garcia-Martinez and Schoenwolf, 1993Garcia-Martinez V. Schoenwolf G.C. Primitive streak origin of the cardiovascular system in avian embryos.Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Hatada and Stern, 1994Hatada Y. Stern C. A fate map of the epiblast of the early chick embryo.Development. 1994; 120: 2879-2889PubMed Google Scholar). These cells migrate bilaterally into the anterolateral mesoderm to form the primary heart field, adopt a crescent shape, and fuse at the midline to produce a linear heart tube composed of an outer epithelial myocardium and an inner endothelium (Rosenquist and DeHaan, 1966Rosenquist G.C. DeHaan R.L. Migration of precardiac cells in the chick embryo: a radioautographic study.Carnegie Inst. Washington Contrib. Embryol. 1966; 38: 111-121Google Scholar, Srivastava and Olson, 2000Srivastava D. Olson E.N. A genetic blueprint for cardiac development.Nature. 2000; 407: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Subsequent morphogenetic events give rise to a mature four-chambered heart. The origin of the endocardium is unclear. Earlier studies in chick support the existence of distinct progenitor cell populations within the primitive streak for myocardium and endocardium prior to their migration into the cardiogenic mesoderm (Coffin and Poole, 1988Coffin J.D. Poole T.J. Embryonic vascular development: Immunohistochemical identification of the origin and subsequent morphogenesis of the major vessel primordial in quail embryos.Development. 1988; 102: 735-748PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies on gene expression and differentiation potential of mesodermal explants point to the existence of a bipotential precursor cell (Eisenberg and Bader, 1995Eisenberg C.A. Bader D. QCE-6: A clonal cell line with cardiac myogenic and endothelial cell potentials.Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using a retroviral labeling technique to tag single cells in early mesoderm, Cohen-Gould and Mikawa found no simultaneously labeled endocardial and myocardial cells at the linear heart tube stage (Cohen-Gould and Mikawa, 1996Cohen-Gould L. Mikawa T. The fate diversity of mesodermal cells within the heart field during chicken early embryogenesis.Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies support an early separation of endocardial and myocardial lineages in the developing chick heart, most likely prior to or during gastrulation. It remains to be seen whether early separation of these lineages occurs in the mouse embryo. The embryonic development of vascular smooth muscle cells takes place later than that of myocardial or endocardial cells. As such, diverse tissue sources have been described to give rise to smooth muscle cells in different organs (Stavros and Majesky, 1996Stavros T. Majesky M.W. Smooth muscle lineage diversity in the chick embryo.Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 430-445Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For example, aortic smooth muscle cells have dual origins in the neural crest and the lateral plate mesoderm (Le Lievre and Le Douarin, 1975Le Lievre C.S. Le Douarin N.M. Mesenchymal derivatives of the neural crest: analysis of chimeric quail and chick embryos.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1975; 34: 125-154PubMed Google Scholar, Waldo and Kirby, 1993Waldo K.L. Kirby M.L.

Development of the aortic vessel wall as defined by vascular smooth muscle markers and extracellular matrix markers.Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The proepicardial organ, a dorsomesodermal structure, gives rise to the epicardium, a tissue that undergoes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation to generate the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the coronary arteries (Mikawa and Gourdie, 1996Mikawa T. Gourdie R.G. Pericardial mesoderm generates a population of coronary smooth muscle cells migrating into the heart along with ingrowth of the epicardial organ.Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 221-232Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar). It appears that smooth muscle cells have a less distinct developmental origin in general and are recruited locally from mesenchymal precursors and differentiate in response to specific tissue signals. While these pioneering studies provide a conceptual framework for understanding the relative contributions to cardiac morphogenesis by cells of distinct origin, recent investigations suggest multipotential progenitors exist for cells of the mesodermal lineage. Using rare recombination events to genetically mark single cells in the developing embryo, Esner et al. have demonstrated a common precursor for skeletal muscle and aortic smooth muscle cells (Esner et al., 2005Esner M. Meilhac S.M. Relaix F. Nicolas J.-F. Cossu G. Buckingham M.E. Smooth muscle of the dorsal aorta share a common clonal origin with skeletal muscle of the myotome.Development. 2005; 133: 737-749Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similarly, cells of the cranial pharyngeal mesoderm, a population that normally gives rise to head musculature, can contribute to the developing cardiac outflow tract (Tirosh-Finkel et al., 2006Tirosh-Finkel L. Elhanany H. Rinon A. Tzahor E. Mesoderm progenitor cells of the common origin contribute to the head musculature and the cardiac outflow tract.Development. 2006; 133: 1943-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, progenitor cells capable of differentiating into endothelial and smooth muscle cells have recently been described (Ema et al., 2003Ema M. Faloon P. Zhang W.J. Hirashima M. Reid T. Stanford W.L. Orkin S. Choi K. Rossant J. Combinatoriall effects of Flk1 and Tal1 on vascular and hematopoietic development in the mouse.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 380-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Detailed lineage analyses of smooth muscle cells at the base of aorta and pulmonary artery have revealed an unexpected origin from the secondary heart field, a recently described cell population arising dorsomedial to the primary heart field and thought to give rise to only the myocardium of the outflow tract, right ventricle, and ventricular septum (Verzi et al., 2005Verzi M.P. McCulley D.J. De Val S. Dodou E. Black B.L. The right ventricle, outflow tract, and ventricular septum comprise a restricted expression domain within the secondary/anterior heart field.Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, Waldo et al., 2005Waldo K.L. Hutson M.R. Ward C.C. Zdanowicz M. Stadt H.A. Kumiski D. Abu-Issa R. Kirby M.L. Secondary heart field contributes myocardium and smooth muscle to the arterial pole of the developing heart.Dev. Biol. 2005; 281: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these vascular smooth muscle cell progenitors express Nkx2.5, a lineage marker associated with myocardial progenitor cells. Indeed, lineage analysis of the progenies of Nkx2.5+ cells using locus-specific Cre recombinase approaches revealed that multiple cell types (including outflow tract smooth muscle cells and yolk sac endothelial cells) express this gene (Moses et al., 2001Moses K.A. DeMayo F. Braun R.M. Reecy J.L. Schwartz R.J. Embryonic expression of an Nkx2-5/Cre gene using ROSA26 reporter mice.Genesis. 2001; 31: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Stanley et al., 2002Stanley E.G. Biben C. Elefanty A. Barnett L. Koentgen F. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Efficient Cre-mediated deletion in cardiac progenitor cells conferred by a 3'UTR-ires-Cre allele of the homeobox gene Nkx2-5.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 431-439PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies raise the possibility that developmental multipotentiality is more pervasive than previously expected. None of these studies, however, attempted to define the identity of these putative progenitor cells by prospectively isolating and characterizing their multilineage differentiation. To investigate the relationship between developmental fate and potential of embryonic cardiac progenitor cells, we isolated early Nkx2.5-expressing cells from the developing mouse heart and demonstrated their differentiation into both beating cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells. To address whether bipotential differentiation occurred at a single cell level, we isolated Nkx2.5+ cells from in vitro differentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells and showed that a c-kit+ subpopulation harbors enhanced capacity for in vitro expansion and bipotential differentiation from a single cell. To explore these ES cell-based findings in an embryological context, we isolated c-kit+ Nkx2.5+ cells from the developing mouse embryo and demonstrated their ability to undergo both myocardial and smooth muscle cell differentiation in vivo. Taken together, these data support the divergence of smooth muscle and myocardial lineages from a common cardiovascular precursor in the developing heart field. Nkx2.5 is one of the earliest cardiac transcription factors expressed in the developing heart field. The expression domain of murine Nkx2.5, however, encompasses many tissues, including the thyroid, pharynx, stomach, and spleen (Moses et al., 2001Moses K.A. DeMayo F. Braun R.M. Reecy J.L. Schwartz R.J. Embryonic expression of an Nkx2-5/Cre gene using ROSA26 reporter mice.Genesis. 2001; 31: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To achieve cardiac-specific eGFP expression, we utilized a 2.1 kb enhancer located 9.5 kb upstream of the translation start site of murine Nkx2.5 (Lien et al., 1999Lien C.-L. Wu C. Mercer B. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Control of early cardiac-specific transcription of nkx2-5 by a GATA-dependent enhancer.Development. 1999; 126: 75-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) along with a 500 bp Nkx2.5 base promoter to generate transgenic mouse lines expressing eGFP specifically in the developing heart (Figure 1A). The expression of eGFP in embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) cells could only be observed by flow cytometry (data not shown) but not by whole mount fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1B). This expression, however, was easily detectable from E8.5 until E11.5 (Figure 1B). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of eGFP+ cells precisely in the myocardial layer (M) but not the endocardial (E) layers (Figure 1C, b′ and f′ insets). At E8.5, the expression of eGFP (Figure 1C, b′ inset) overlapped partially with that of isl1 (Figure 1C, c′ and inset with arrows), which marks exclusively progenitor cells for the secondary heart field (Cai et al., 2003Cai C.-L. Liang X. Shi Y. Chu P.-H. Pfaff S.L. Chen J. Evans S. Isl1 identifies a cardiac progenitor population that proliferates prior to differentiation and contributes a majority of cells to the heart.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). eGFP expression overlapped completely with sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (Sarc. MHC) (Figure 1C, d′), an early myocardial marker in the primary heart field. At E10.5, a minor cell population in the outflow tract (OFT) beyond the endocardial cushion (EC) coexpresses Nkx2.5 (via eGFP) (Figure 1C, i′) and isl1 (Figure 1C, j′ and inset). The expression of isl1, however, is found predominantly in the dorsomesocardium and the neural crest at E9.5 in a nonoverlapping manner with Nkx2.5 (Figure S1, E9.5 isl1 and inset). The low number of coexpressed isl1+ and Nkx2.5+ cells can be explained by the fact that Nkx2.5+ cells here are mostly derivatives of the primary heart field or that isl1 expression may have declined prior the onset of Nkx2.5 expression in the secondary heart field (Cai et al., 2003Cai C.-L. Liang X. Shi Y. Chu P.-H. Pfaff S.L. Chen J. Evans S. Isl1 identifies a cardiac progenitor population that proliferates prior to differentiation and contributes a majority of cells to the heart.Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 877-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, Laugwitz et al., 2005Laugwitz K.-L. Moretti A. Lam J. Gruber P. Chen Y. Woodard S. Lin L.Z. Cai C.-L. Lu M.M. Reth M. et al.Postnatal isl1+ cardioblasts enter fully differentiated cardiomyocyte lineages.Nature. 2005; 433: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Interestingly, coexpression of early myocardial (Sarc. MHC) and smooth muscle (smooth muscle actin-α [SMAα]) markers were found in looping heart tube at E9.5 (Figure S1). The expression of definitive myocardial genes such as cardiac troponin T (cTnT) was absent at these stages of cardiac development (Figure 1C, g′) and appeared only after E11.5 (Figure S1, E11.5). Likewise, expression of the definitive marker for smooth muscle lineage, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), was absent in myocardial cells at E9.5 and initiated in vascular smooth muscle cells of the thoracic cavity at E11.5 (Figure S1). The expression of eGFP diminished by E11.5 during myocardial maturation, in contrast with the expression of endogenous Nkx2.5 that is sustained throughout cardiac development (Lien et al., 1999Lien C.-L. Wu C. Mercer B. Webb R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Control of early cardiac-specific transcription of nkx2-5 by a GATA-dependent enhancer.Development. 1999; 126: 75-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of E9.5 heart cells by flow cytometry showed a range of eGFP expression levels within each heart, consistent with the presence of a mixed population of progenitor cells and differentiating cardiomyocytes (Figure 1D). The percentage of eGFP+ heart cells also decreases from E8.5 to E15.5 (Figure 1E). It appears that the expression of eGFP directed by this Nkx2.5 cardiac enhancer is specific for cells at the progenitor stage of development. To assess the potential of Nkx2.5+ cells to spontaneously differentiate into chamber-specific myocytes and conduction system, we isolated eGFP+ cells from E9.5 transgenic hearts by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and cultured them in vitro. As expected, greater than 87% of these cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes and conduction system cells (Figure 2A and Video S1). Electrophysiological analysis at a single-cell level confirmed their maturation into conduction system cells as well as atrial and ventricular myocytes (Figure 2A). We observed that 92% ± 4% of the eGFP+ cells survived the sorting procedure. Of these, ∼12% were immature in appearance (arrows) and formed clusters when plated at low density (Figure 2B). Within these clusters, some cells differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes (arrowheads) and vascular smooth muscle cells (asterisks). The expression of differentiated myocardial (cTnT) and smooth muscle cell (SM-MHC) markers was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 2C). Quantitatively, cells within each cluster possessed modest capacity for spontaneous differentiation in vitro into either myocardial (9.4%) or smooth muscle (15.3%) lineages (Figure 2D). The expression of endothelial cell markers (Flk1 and Tie-2) was not observed (data not shown), supporting an early separation of endothelial and myogenic lineages. The capacity for the Nkx2.5+ cells to undergo smooth muscle differentiation suggests either common expression of Nkx2.5 in two distinct lineages or the existence of a common progenitor for both cell types. To ascertain whether a single cell can undergo bipotential differentiation into both myocardial and smooth muscle cells, we dissected E7.5 and 8.5 mouse embryos and deposited FACS-purified single eGFP+ cells into individual wells of a 96-well plate. However, we were unable to induce expansion or terminal differentiation of these cells at single-cell density despite repeated attempts. As an alternative approach, we isolated Nkx2.5-eGFP+ cells from in vitro differentiated ES cells to address whether clonal differentiation into myocardial and smooth muscle cell lineages can occur from a single progenitor cell. ES cells can differentiate upon withdrawal of leukemia inhibitor factor to express lineage markers in a temporal pattern similar to that of the developing embryo (Figure 3A). To generate an Nkx2.5-eGFP ES cell line, we introduced the Nkx2.5 cardiac enhancer-eGFP transgene into CJ7 ES cells and selected transgenic clones that expressed eGFP specifically in beating cell clusters at day 9 of differentiation (Figure 3B and Video S2). To confirm the cardiac specificity of eGFP expression in vivo, ES cell clones were introduced into E3.5 blastocysts to generate E10.5 chimeric embryos. These embryos express eGFP exclusively in the developing outflow tract and common ventricle (Figure S2A) mirroring that of the transgenic mice (Figure 1B). To assess the identity of these eGFP+ cells, eGFP+ and eGFP− cells were segregated by FACS from day 5 in vitro differentiation transgenic ES cells (Figure 3C, middle panel). The purity of the sorted eGFP+ cells was confirmed by reanalysis of the eGFP+ population (>93%) (Figure 3C, right panel). The segregation of cardiac from noncardiac cells was supported by expression analysis of lineage markers within each sorted population (Figure 3D). As expected, the expression of markers for noncardiovascular lineages (e.g., hematopoietic and skeletal muscle) was found predominantly in the eGFP− subpopulation. Consistent with this, eGFP+ cells also preferentially differentiated into cardiomyocytes, as assessed by the presence of beating cell clusters (Figure 3E). Furthermore, the commitment of these eGFP+ cells into a cardiogenic fate was supported by the inability of growth factor supplementation to direct these cells into neuronal, hematopoietic, or skeletal muscle fates when compared with undifferentiated ES cells (Figure S2B). These eGFP+ cells exhibited high capacity for in vitro expansion as demonstrated by their ability to undergo >90 passages in culture. Analysis of the progeny of eGFP+ progenitors by immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of both cardiomyocytes and smooth muscle cells (Figure 3F). To investigate the commitment of eGFP+ cells for myogenic differentiation in vivo, we injected FACS-purified eGFP+ cells from day 5 in vitro differentiated ES cells into the hindlimbs of syngeneic mice (1 × 106 cells/limb; N = 15) to achieve stable engraftment (Figure 4A). Control injections using undifferentiated transgenic ES cells (1 × 106 cells/limb, N = 5) were performed in parallel. As expected, undifferentiated ES cell-injected limbs formed progressively enlarging teratomas at 7, 21, and 35 days postinjection (Figure 4B). These teratomas were comprised of cells from all three germ layers, including neurons, glandular epithelia, blood, bone, and trachea. Injection of eGFP+ cells failed to generate teratomas (0 of 15). Instead, they infiltrated existing skeletal muscle bundles at day 7 postinjection (Figure 4C, D7 arrows). At 35 days postinjection, sprouts of new myofibrils were found within areas of cell injection (Figure 4C, D35 arrows). Immunohistochemical staining revealed the coexpression of eGFP with GATA-4, cardiac MHC, and cTnT in some cells. The expression of SMAα was also detected, but in a nonoverlapping pattern with eGFP. This is more likely due to the downregulation of eGFP expression in transplanted cells that have differentiated towards smooth muscle lineage and not from the detection of endogenous smooth muscle cells. Since the expression of Nkx2.5 marks a mixture of progenitors and immature myocytes, we sought to identify surface markers that predict progenitor status within Nkx2.5+ cells. We examined the expression of >30 surface proteins using commercially available flow cytometry competent antibodies and found a modest level of c-kit and Sca-1 expression, but no expression of endothelial or hematopoietic lineage markers (Figure 5A). The expression levels of CD71 (transferrin receptor) and CD29 (integrin β1) were high, but the expression of these markers failed to correlate with progenitor cell status (data not shown). We fractionated Nkx2.5+ cells based on their c-kit expression and found that the c-kit+ cells appeared less differentiated morphologically than c-kit− cells (Figure 5B, upper panels). Consistent with this, c-kit+ cells also possessed 40-fold greater capacity for proliferation than c-kit− cells (Figure 5B, lower left panel). c-Kit− cells, on the other hand, were more likely to form beating cardiomyocytes (Figure 5B, lower right panel). The expression of Sca-1 did not distinguish proliferating from differentiating cells (data not shown). Using c-kit as a marker for a progenitor cell subpopulation within Nkx2.5+ cells, we investigated the capacity for a single c-kit+Nkx2.5+ cell to differentiate into both myocardial and smooth muscle lineages. c-Kit+Nkx2.5+ single cells were plated into each well of 96-well plates on day 0 and cultured in vitro until day 13 (Figure 5C). Approximately 5% of 672 plated cells survived single cell cloning. Examination of cells within each well on day 13 revealed three distinct patterns of differentiation. Approximately 42% of the single cell clones differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes (clones 1–13) and expressed α-cardiac actin and ventricular myosin light chain (MLCv) (Figure 5D, blue bars). Thirty-two percent differentiated into cells expressing smooth muscle markers, SM22α and SMAα, and failed to beat spontaneously (clones 22–31) (Figure 5D, red bars). The remaining wells (clones 14–20) contained both beating cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, confirming their bipotential differentiation from a single cell (Figures 5C and 5D and Video S3). The ES-cell studies above suggest that early Nkx2.5+ progenitors expressed c-kit. We investigated whether c-kit+Nkx2.5+ cells are present in the developing heart field in vivo. Flow cytometry analysis of embryonic hearts from Nkx2.5-eGFP transgenic mice revealed that 13% ± 6% of E8.5 eGFP+ cells express c-kit (Figure 6A). This expression decreased with myocardial maturation, such that by day15.5, c-kit expression was nearly undetectable within the Nkx2.5+ population. The expression of Sca-1 within eGFP+ cells appeared later at E13.5 and increased with myocardial differentiation (Figure 6A). To assess whether c-kit expression confers progenitor cell status within Nkx2.5+ cells, we separated E8.5 eGFP+ cells based on their level of c-kit expression and analyzed their cell morphology and differentiation status by quantitative and qualitative PCR. As shown in Figure 6B, c-kit+ cells appeared to be morphologically less differentiated compared with c-kit− cells. Gene expression analysis confirmed that c-kit− cells were more differentiated and preferentially expressed myocardial and smooth muscle lineage markers compared with c-kit+ cells (Figure 6C). These c-kit+ cells are unlikely to originate from hematopoietic sources, as blood-forming cells have not entered the heart tube at this stage of embryonic development. To determine the role of Sca-1 expression, we fractionated E15.5 eGFP+ heart cells based on their Sca-1 status. We found the expression of Sca-1 did not predict progenitor cell status within eGFP+ cells (Figure S3A). The expression of c-kit in eGFP+ cells was further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis of frozen sections from E9.5 and E10.5 hearts (Figure S3B). Interestingly, c-kit+Nkx2.5+ cells localized in the outer layer of compact myocardium, suggesting that the niche for these developing progenitor cells is adjacent to the epicardium. This observation is consistent with an essential role for epicardial-secreted factors that stimulate myocardial cell proliferation and expansion of the compact myocardial layer (Lavine et al., 2005Lavine K. Yu K. White A.C. Zhang X. Smith C. Partanen J. Ornitz D.M. Endocardial and epicardial derived FGF signals regulate myocardial proliferation and differentiation in vivo.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We postulated that smooth muscle cell differentiation from a common progenitor cell results in an alteration of its molecular phenotype from that of differentiating myocardial cells. To test whether the continued expression of eGFP could distinguish myocardial from smooth muscle cells, we isolated eGFP+ cells from E9.5 Nkx2.5-eGFP transgenic mouse hearts and allowed them to undergo spontaneous differentiation in vitro (Figure 6D, a′). Following 3 days of culture, we separated cells that continued to express eGFP from cells that became eGFP− and analyzed their gene expression. We observed a clear segregation of myocardial lineage markers into the eGFP+ population and smooth muscle markers into the eGFP− population (Figure 6D, b′). The maintenance of Nkx2.5 expression appeared to characterize myocardial differentiation from a bipotent-progenitor cell. To establish whether c-kit+Nkx2.5+ cells can undergo bipotential differentiation in vivo, we employed a well-established chick xenograft transplantation assay and injected freshly isolated c-kit+eGFP+ heart cells (∼2500 cells/heart) from E9.5 Nkx2.5-eGFP/ROSA-LacZ double-heterozygous mouse embryos into each of stages 8–13 chick embryos (Figure 6E) (N = 15). One of five surviving embryos demonstrated engraftment of transplanted cells at the aortic arch/ branchial vessel region. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed smooth muscle cell differentiation and integration of LacZ+ cells into an existing blood vessel (Figure 6E, a′–d′). Myocardial differentiation occurred as well (Figure 6E, e′–g ′), but these cells appeared unable to integrate into chick myocardium, presumably due to their ectopic site of engraftment. In this paper, we explored the developmental progression from precardiac mesoderm to myocardial commitment using a genetic tagging approach that allowed for the prospective isolation of cardiac progenitor cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that a c-kit+Nkx2.5+ population differentiates spontaneously into both myocardial and smooth muscle cells, as revealed by in vitro differentiation of ES cells and by embryonic transplantation studies. These bipotent progenitors appear unable to form hematopoietic, neuronal, or skeletal muscle cells; thus, they represent a population that is restricted with respect to other lineages. Taken together, these studies support a new paradigm for cardiovascular development involving the divergence of myocardial and smooth muscle cell lineages from a common precursor in the primordial heart field. Prior lineage tracing studies in mice have demonstrated diverse developmental origins for vascular smooth muscle cells. In particular, the cardiac neural crest can give rise to vascular smooth muscle cells of the aortic arch, as well as of the coronary vessels (Le Lievre and Le Douarin, 1975Le Lievre C.S.

We observed a neural representation of predicted perception in the medial frontal cortex, while human subjects decided whether visual objects were faces or not. Moreover, perceptual decisions about faces were associated with an increase in top-down connectivity from the frontal cortex to face-sensitive visual areas, consistent with the matching of predicted and observed evidence for the presence of faces."

Bmal1 –/– mice lose circadian rhythmicity but also display tendon calcification and decreased activity, body weight, and longevity. To investigate whether these diverse functions of BMAL1 are tissue-specific, we produced transgenic mice that constitutively express Bmal1 in brain or muscle and examined the effects of rescued gene expression in Bmal1 –/– mice. Circadian rhythms of wheel-running activity were restored in brain-rescued Bmal1 –/– mice in a conditional manner; however, activity levels and body weight were lower than those of wild-type mice. In contrast, muscle-rescued Bmal1 –/– mice exhibited normal activity levels and body weight yet remained behaviorally arrhythmic. Thus, Bmal1 has distinct tissue-specific functions that regulate integrative physiology."

These paired seismic discontinuities are attributed to a phase change from perovskite to post-perovskite and then back to perovskite as the temperature increases with depth. Iron enrichment could explain the occurrence of post-perovskite several hundred kilometers above the core-mantle boundary in this warm, chemically distinct province. The double phase-boundary crossing directly constrains the lowermost mantle temperature gradients. Assuming a standard but unconstrained choice of thermal conductivity, the regional core-mantle boundary heat flux (approximately 85 +/- 25 milliwatts per square meter), comparable to the average at Earth's surface, was estimated, along with a lower bound on global core-mantle boundary heat flow in the range of 13 +/- 4 terawatts. Mapped velocity-contrast variations indicate that the lens of post-perovskite minerals thins and vanishes over 1000 kilometers laterally toward the margin of the chemical distinct region as a result of a approximately 500-kelvin temperature increase."
https://openalex.org/W2092999119,"Although the local resistivity of semiconducting silicon in its standard crystalline form can be changed by many orders of magnitude by doping with elements, superconductivity has so far never been achieved. Hybrid devices combining silicon's semiconducting properties and superconductivity have therefore remained largely underdeveloped. Here we report that superconductivity can be induced when boron is locally introduced into silicon at concentrations above its equilibrium solubility. For sufficiently high boron doping (typically 100 p.p.m.) silicon becomes metallic. We find that at a higher boron concentration of several per cent, achieved by gas immersion laser doping, silicon becomes superconducting. Electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements show that boron-doped silicon (Si:B) made in this way is a superconductor below a transition temperature T(c) approximately 0.35 K, with a critical field of about 0.4 T. Ab initio calculations, corroborated by Raman measurements, strongly suggest that doping is substitutional. The calculated electron-phonon coupling strength is found to be consistent with a conventional phonon-mediated coupling mechanism. Our findings will facilitate the fabrication of new silicon-based superconducting nanostructures and mesoscopic devices with high-quality interfaces."

Ecological theory associated with these abundance distributions implies that complex ecosystems are far more common among Meso-Cenozoic assemblages than among the Paleozoic assemblages that preceded them. This transition coincides not with any major change in the way fossils are preserved or collected but with a shift from communities dominated by sessile epifaunal suspension feeders to communities with elevated diversities of mobile and infaunal taxa. This suggests that the end-Permian extinction permanently altered prevailing marine ecosystem structure and precipitated high levels of ecological complexity and alpha diversity in the Meso-Cenozoic."

https://openalex.org/W2018153321,"Human mitochondrial glutaredoxin 2 (GLRX2), which controls intracellular redox balance and apoptosis, exists in a dynamic equilibrium of enzymatically active monomers and quiescent dimers. Crystal structures of both monomeric and dimeric forms of human GLRX2 reveal a distinct glutathione binding mode and show a 2Fe-2S-bridged dimer. The iron-sulfur cluster is coordinated through the N-terminal active site cysteine, Cys-37, and reduced glutathione.

Glutaredoxins (GLRXs) 4The abbreviations used are: GLRX, glutaredoxin; MES, 2-morpholinoethane-sulfonic acid. are evolutionarily conserved, glutathione-dependent oxidoreductases that are critically involved in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis (1Holmgren A.

The enzymes belong to the thioredoxin-fold superfamily of proteins and catalyze a broad spectrum of thiol-disulfide reactions using two distinct reaction mechanisms that require either 1 or 2 cysteines in a Cys-X-X-Cys active site motif. Reduction of protein and low molecular weight disulfides proceeds through a dithiol mechanism that results in an intramolecular disulfide that is reduced by two molecules of glutathione through a glutathione-protein mixed disulfide intermediate. In contrast, glutathionylation and deglutathionylation reactions require only the more N-terminal cysteine. In these reactions, a GLRX-glutathione mixed disulfide occurs that is either formed or reduced by one molecule of glutathione (1Holmgren A. Johansson C. Berndt C. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Lillig C.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To date, three low molecular weight GLRXs with 15–34% sequence identity and distinct active site motifs have been described in mammalian cells. The well studied cytosolic glutaredoxin 1 (GLRX1) is a 12-kDa protein that contains the classical Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys motif. GLRX1 supplies electrons to ribonucleotide reductase, catalyzes disulfide-dithiol exchanges in proteins or small molecules such as dehydroascorbate, and is intimately involved in transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, and apoptotic processes (1Holmgren A. Johansson C. Berndt C. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Lillig C.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin 2 (GLRX2) is a 16-kDa protein directed either to the nucleus or to the mitochondria through differential splicing of the first exon (3Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Human GLRX2 contains a 37CSYC40 active site motif with a serine residue replacing the conserved proline and has several biochemical properties that distinguish it from GLRX1, perhaps as a result of this substitution (4Johansson C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7537-7543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). First, GLRX2 catalyzes more efficiently monothiol-mediated protein deglutathionylation reactions due to its high affinity for glutathione-protein mixed disulfides and has been shown to catalyze the reversible glutathionylation of complex I and other proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane (5Beer S.M. Taylor E.R. Brown S.E. Dahm C.C. Costa N.J. Runswick M.J. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47939-47951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Second, GLRX2 is not inhibited by oxidation of structural cysteine residues (3Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Third, in addition to receiving reducing equivalents from glutathione, GLRX2 can also receive electrons from thioredoxin reductase (4Johansson C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7537-7543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).

It is of particular interest that GLRX5 is targeted to mitochondria like GLRX2 and that GLRX5 participates in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters (10Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G.

Previous experimental results provide substantial evidence for a critical role of GLRX2 as a sensor of the mitochondrial redox status. The small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of mitochondrial GLRX2 resulted in dramatically increased sensitivity toward apoptotic stimuli such as doxorubicin or phenylarsine oxide (12Lillig C.H.

A. 2004; 101: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of GLRX2 prevented cardiolipin oxidation, cytochrome c release, and induction of apoptosis (13Enoksson M. Fernandes A.P. Prast S. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Importantly, mitochondrial GLRX2 exists in two distinct states in vivo: the catalytically competent monomeric form and a recently discovered inactive dimeric state that contains an iron-sulfur cluster. Under conditions of oxidative stress, there is a transition from the inactive dimer to active monomeric GLRX2 initiated by decreased GSH/GSSG ratios (14Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this instance, loss of the cluster through change of the redox status creates a catalytically active protein. An in-depth spectroscopic characterization of dimeric human GLRX2 by Lillig et al.

The same study determined the stoichiometry to be two iron and two sulfide atoms per dimer, suggesting that the cluster served to mediate dimerization. However, there are conflicting reports of the residues responsible for coordinating the iron-sulfur cluster. Based upon mutagenic data, it was proposed that 2 cysteines outside the active site coordinate the cluster (14Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast, Feng et al. (15Feng Y. Zhong N. Rouhier N. Hase T. Kusunoki M. Jacquot J.P. Jin C. Xia B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7998-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) presented NMR data suggesting that poplar glutaredoxin C1 coordinates an iron-sulfur cluster through the N-terminal active-site cysteines and two glutathione molecules. We have determined the crystal structures of human GLRX2 in monomeric and dimeric forms, which reveal novel details of glutathione binding and provide clear proof for iron coordination through 2 active-site cysteines. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of Recombinant Human GLRX2—A template plasmid encoding for full-length human GLRX2 was obtained from Invitrogen. Two constructs lacking the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (comprising GLRX2 core residues 56–164 and 41–164) were cloned into pNic28-Bsa4, a pET21a-derived expression vector with a tobacco etch virus cleavable N-terminal His6 tag. Since the length of the mature protein after mitochondrial import is unknown, two clones were constructed. The shorter clone was designed to coincide with the N terminus of human GLRX1, whereas the longer construct (containing an additional 15 amino acids) corresponds to a clone used in previous biophysical characterization (3Lundberg M.

Expression plasmids were transformed into a phage-resistant derivative of BL21(DE3) carrying a plasmid for rare codon expression. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to cultures grown in TB (Terrific Broth) medium to A600 = 3.4, and then cultures were further incubated at 18 °C overnight. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, protease inhibitors (Complete, Sigma) and lysed using a high pressure homogenizer. Cell debris and nucleic acids were removed by the addition of 0.15% polyethyleneimine followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g, and the supernatant was further clarified by filtration. The proteins were purified using nickel-affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare), and monomeric and dimeric GLRX2 were separated by gel filtration chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and concentrated in an Amicon 5K centrifugal concentrator. Monomeric and dimeric GLRX2 were analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy (Labtech, Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer), and the molecular mass was verified by electrospray mass ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent LC/MSD time-of-flight). Aerobic Crystallization of Reduced Monomeric GLRX2 in Complex with Glutathione—Reduced glutathione to a final concentration of 10 mm was added to the dimeric fraction of GLRX2Δ1–55 prior to concentration. Crystals in the form of thin rods were grown by vapor diffusion at 20 °C in a sitting drop consisting of 50 nl of protein (18 mg/ml) and 100 nl of precipitant solution containing 0.1 m citrate, pH 3.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350. The crystal was transferred to a cryoprotectant prepared from precipitant solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) 1,2-propanediol before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. Anaerobic Crystallization of dimeric GLRX2 with an Iron-Sulfur Cluster—Dimeric GLRX2Δ1–40 for anaerobic crystallization was purified as described above except all buffers contained 10 mm reduced glutathione and were degassed and purged with argon (14Lillig C.H.

The protein was concentrated to 11.5 mg/ml and stored under nitrogen. A sitting drop consisting of 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of well solution was equilibrated against well solution containing 1.6 m MgSO4, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, in a glove box under argon to prevent oxidation of the iron-sulfur cluster. Under these conditions, brown, hexagonal plate-shaped crystals appeared and grew to a maximum dimension of ∼75 μm over 6 weeks. A single crystal was transferred to a cryoprotectant of 1.7 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement—A fluorescence scan was performed on the crystal grown anaerobically to identify the metal atoms present, and data sets for monomeric and dimeric crystal forms of GLRX2 were collected at the Swiss Light Source beamline X10SA. For the monomer, initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement using PHASER (16Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The protein residues in the models are numbered to be consistent with previous literature and thus are offset -40 residues from the gene-derived sequence. Biochemical Characterization—To provide insight into glutathione binding and coordination of the iron-sulfur cluster in human GLRX2, we have crystallized both monomeric and dimeric forms of the protein in the presence of reduced glutathione. Two truncated versions of GLRX2, containing the core sequence without the mitochondrial targeting signal, were expressed and purified. Both constructs behaved identically during purification, and the additional residues at the N terminus of the longer construct were disordered and not visible in the electron density maps. Molecular masses were confirmed by mass spectrometry, indicating the presence of one intramolecular disulfide bond. Monomeric and dimeric GLRX2 were separated by gel filtration chromatography and analyzed by UV spectroscopy (see supplemental materials). Both fractions generated one band of ∼16 kDa when analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels. Measurement of specific activity indicated that the majority of enzymatic activity was contained within the monomeric fraction. The dimeric fraction of GLRX2 was visibly brown and showed strong absorbance peaks at 320 and 420 nm, consistent with protein containing an iron-sulfur complex (14Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Crystals that were grown anaerobically exhibit strong fluorescence emission at a wavelength in agreement with the presence of iron. Attempts to crystallize the monomer fraction from gel filtration chromatography were abandoned once it was apparent that the dimer dissociated into monomers during aerobic crystallization. Structure of Monomeric Human GLRX2—Aerobic crystallization resulted in dissociation of the dimeric GLRX2 to a reduced monomer in complex with glutathione. GLRX2 adopts the fold of the thioredoxin superfamily, a central mixed β-sheet sandwiched between α-helices. GLRX2 contains 4 cysteines, organized in two pairs that are in close proximity to each other. The first pair (Cys-37, Cys-40) is reduced and is embedded in the conserved cysteine-rich motif that is known to be involved in catalysis. The second pair (Cys-28, Cys-113) forms a disulfide and is on the distal side of the molecule away from the catalytic pair. This second pair is completely conserved in GLRX2 proteins and not found in GLRX1 or GLRX5 enzymes (Fig. 1). Importantly, the cystine bridge formed between these residues likely increases protein stability by anchoring the N- and C-terminal helices. Furthermore, this internal disulfide provides an explanation why GLRX2 is resistant to oxidation of structural cysteines (3Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) since there are no free cysteines to further oxidize. Recently, the apo-structure of human GLRX2 was determined by NMR (2CQ9),5 and comparison with our crystal structure in complex with GSH indicates that the largest differences occur in the loop region preceding helix 2. This region contains the N-terminal catalytic cysteine; thus, the differences are likely due to glutathione binding. Glutathione is bound to the active site of the GLRX2 monomer. The glutathione nestles into a groove on the surface of GLRX2, and each residue in the glutathione tripeptide makes several polar contacts with the protein (Fig. 2A). The glutamate carboxylate forms hydrogen bonds with backbone amides of Ala-94 and Thr-95 as well as the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-95. The cysteine main chain has two interactions with the backbone nitrogen and oxygen of Val-81, and the glycine carboxylate is engaged in polar interactions with the side chains of Lys-34 and Gln-69. In addition, the aliphatic portion of the glutathione glutamate packs against the phenolic ring of Tyr-39, and there are three ordered water molecules mediating interactions between the ligand and protein. Although the glutathione is in a conformation where it could form a disulfide with the protein, the distance between the sulfur atoms is >2.8 Å, indicating that this bond is likely to be reduced. By comparison, the distance between sulfur atoms in the structural disulfide is <2.1 Å. Glutathione bound in this orientation would probably prevent glutathionylated substrates from binding under reducing conditions and might explain the observed lower turnover compared with human GLRX1 (3Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This ligand binding behavior may also be the reason for the observed affinity of GLRX2 for GSH-Sepharose, a characteristic that distinguishes GLRX2 from other glutaredoxins (20Lundberg M. Holmgren A. Johansson M. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 45: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A search of the Protein Data Bank for glutaredoxins with a glutathione bound retrieved the following three structures: human glutaredoxin 1 (1B4Q) (21Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Escherichia coli glutaredoxin 1 (1GRX) (22Sodano P. Xia T.H. Bushweller J.H. Bjornberg O. Holmgren A. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and E. coli glutaredoxin 3 (3GRX) (23Aslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M. Bergman T. Ponstingl H. Jornvall H. Otting G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6736-6745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All are NMR structures of a glutathione-protein mixed disulfide with the N-terminal cysteine in the catalytic motif. For the E. coli enzymes, this covalent bond is the main interaction between glutathione and the protein, although GLRX3 has two additional polar contacts: the glutathione glutamate nitrogen to a threonine hydroxyl and the glutathione cysteine oxygen to a valine main-chain amide. Comparison of human GLRX1 (21Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and GLRX2 indicates that the interaction between the glutathione glutamate carboxylate and the main-chain amide is preserved, but no side-chain interaction occurs in this area, and in GLRX1, the glutathione glycine carboxylate interacts only with the side chain of Arg-67. Perhaps the most important difference in ligand binding between the two human structures is that the Glu-Cys peptide bond of glutathione is flipped, with the peptide bond in the GLRX1 structure having an opposite orientation than in the other glutaredoxin structures. At present, no structural information is available for the monothiol active-site GLRX5 or any of its orthologs. Although GLRX5 has only a single cysteine in its Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser active-site motif, it has been shown to have thiol reductase activity (11Tamarit J. Belli G. Cabiscol E. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25745-25751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and it has been further demonstrated that a 2nd cysteine, Cys-117, is essential for the catalytic activity. Ala-94 in GLRX2, the residue equivalent to Cys-117 in human GLRX5, maps to a region on the surface of GLRX2 adjacent to the active site, indicating that the reaction for GLRX5 likely proceeds through a dithiol mechanism with the second Cys residue located outside the classical Cys-X-X-Cys active-site motif. Structural Organization of Dimeric GLRX2 Containing a [2Fe-2S]2+ Cluster—The GLRX2 dimer is composed of two GLRX2 protein chains, an inorganic 2Fe-2S cluster, and 2 glutathione molecules (Fig. 2B). The non-catalytic cysteine pair has been proposed to mediate dimerization by coordinating the iron-sulfur cluster for the following reasons; this extra pair is not conserved in other GLRXs, only GLRX2 is known to form an iron-sulfur-containing dimer, and mutation of these residues abrogated dimer formation during recombinant bacterial expression (14Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast to this prediction, the dimeric crystal structure reveals that the cluster is coordinated through Cys-37, the N-terminal cysteine in the active-site Cys-Ser-Tyr-Cys motif. Although the cluster itself is planar, each iron atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by Cys-37, two sulfur atoms, and a cysteine contributed by glutathione. The two inorganic sulfides bridge both iron atoms (Fig. 2C). Due to steric requirements, the side chains of Ser-38 and Tyr-39 adopt different rotamers when the cluster is bound. The tyrosine side chain adopts a high energy conformation (chi2 ∼100°), shielding one side of the cluster from solvent and from oxidative degradation. Although the glutathione must move ∼1.5 Å to accommodate the cluster, it remains tightly bound as the polar interactions with the protein are largely unchanged, and additional interactions are found with the second protein chain. In the glutathione molecule most closely associated with chain B, additional interactions are found with the Ser-36 main chain and the Ser-38 side chain on monomer A. The glycine carboxylate for glutathione associated with chain A is in an alternate conformation where it loses its contacts with Lys-34 and Gln-69, whereas the cysteine sulfur forms an additional contact with the hydroxyl of Ser-38 on chain B. Thus, movement of the side chain of Ser-38 is important not only to accommodate the cluster but also because it forms additional interactions with the glutathione from the adjacent monomer. It is likely that a proline at this position, as occurs in GLRX1, will discourage cluster coordination by reducing the flexibility of the protein backbone, and furthermore, the proline side chain would not be able to form favorable interactions with the neighboring glutathione molecule. Biological Implications of Mitochondrial GLRX2—The physiological role of mitochondrial GLRX2 is not fully understood at the present time; however, the crystal structures explain several observed features. Previous studies (12Lillig C.H. Lonn M.E. Enoksson M. Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) have revealed that GLRX2 is central in mitochondrial redox regulation. An RNA interference-induced GLRX2 knockdown sensitized mitochondria toward oxidative damage and apoptosis (12Lillig C.H. Lonn M.E. Enoksson M. Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating that GLRX2 could be an interesting intervention point in cancer therapy for sensitizing cells for apoptotic stimuli. It is conceivable that GLRX2 has several roles due to its enzymatic function in glutathionylation and deglutathionylation reactions. In the mitochondria, free protein thiols are present in higher concentration than GSH. Because of their higher abundance, protein thiols are primary scavengers for reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative damage, and as a consequence, are glutathionylated (24Hurd T.R. Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Beer S.M. Brown S.E. Filipovska A. Murphy M.P. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is likely that GLRX2 has a direct role in “protein repair” by restoring the free thiol state. A further striking feature of GLRX2 is that it appears to be destined to function enzymatically primarily under oxidative conditions. First, high GSH/GSSG ratios will drive the GLRX2 equilibrium into a quiescent dimeric Fe-S-bound form (12Lillig C.H. Lonn M.E. Enoksson M. Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Lonn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8168-8173Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), which can readily be activated as soon as the GSH/GSSG ratio drops under oxidative conditions. Second, GSH appears to be a direct inhibitor, as demonstrated by the non-productive complex of monomeric GLRX2 with reduced glutathione. Third, uncharacteristic of other GLRXs, GLRX2 can be reduced directly by thioredoxin reductase (4Johansson C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7537-7543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), indicating a role under increased oxidative stress. It therefore seems that this tight control of GLRX2 activity, through sequestration into a resting dimeric state and inhibition by GSH, coupled with its intrinsically lower activity, is of major biological importance for mitochondrial homeostasis. Clearly, further experiments are necessary to dissect the role of GLRX2 in mitochondrial redox control and to investigate possible interactions with other mitochondrial thiol scavengers such as lipoic acid, which has also been shown to be involved in mitochondrial redox control (25Arivazhagan P. Ramanathan K. Panneerselvam C. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2001; 12: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Bast A. Haenen G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Yi X. Maeda N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 8387-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance, dihydrolipoamide can supply electrons to GLRX2 (28Porras P. Pedrajas J.R. Martinez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Johansson C. Holmgren A. Barcena J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating a connection between lipoic acid or its derivatives and GLRX2 in redox control. Thus, GLRX2 is likely implicated in aging mechanisms as mitochondrial oxidative stress and redox control are central to neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases (29Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 58: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 30Singh K.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1067: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Storz P. Sci. STKE 2006. 2006; : RE3Google Scholar). It is interesting to observe that biological functions of GLRXs include repair, signaling, and assembly functions. At present, it cannot be excluded that GLRX2 has a function in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, as has been recently shown for GLRX5 (6Wingert R.A. Galloway J.L. Barut B. Foott H. Fraenkel P. Axe J.L. Weber G.J. Dooley K. Davidson A.J. Schmid B. Paw B.H. Shaw G.C. Kingsley P. Palis J. Schubert H. Chen O. Kaplan J. Zon L.I. Nature. 2005; 436: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). GLRX2 is the first member of the mitochondrial glutaredoxins to have its crystal structure determined, and it would therefore be interesting to investigate and compare the structure with the monothiol active site GLRX5 that is involved in the maturation and assembly of Fe-S cluster proteins. Note Added in Proof—While in press, a recent biochemical study confirmed the structural conclusions drawn in this study on GLRX2 Fe-S coordination (Berndt, C., Hudemann, C., Hanschmann, E. M., Axelsson, R., Holmgren, A., and Lillig, C. H. (2007) Antioxid. Redox Signal. 9, 151–157).

https://openalex.org/W1982218922,"γ-Carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins is dependent on formation of reduced vitamin K1 (Vit.K1H2) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it works as an essential cofactor for γ-carboxylase in post-translational γ-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins. Vit.K1H2 is produced by the warfarin-sensitive enzyme vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) of the vitamin K cycle that has been shown to harbor a thioredoxin-like CXXC center involved in reduction of vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide (Vit.K>O). However, the cellular system providing electrons to the center is unknown. Here data are presented that demonstrate that reduction is linked to dithiol-dependent oxidative folding of proteins in the ER by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Oxidative folding of reduced RNase is shown to trigger reduction of Vit.K>O and γ-carboxylation of the synthetic γ-carboxylase peptide substrate FLEEL. In liver microsomes, reduced RNase-triggered γ-carboxylation is inhibited by the PDI inhibitor bacitracin and also by small interfering RNA silencing of PDI in HEK 293 cells. Immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE of microsomal membrane proteins demonstrate the existence of a VKOR enzyme complex where PDI and VKORC1 appear to be tightly associated subunits. We propose that the PDI subunit of the complex provides electrons for reduction of the thioredoxin-like CXXC center in VKORC1. We can conclude that the energy required for γ-carboxylation of proteins is provided by dithiol-dependent oxidative protein folding in the ER and thus is linked to de novo protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1979489699,"The mutants H250A and D197A of Agp1 phytochrome from Agrobacterium tumefaciens were prepared and investigated by different spectroscopic and biochemical methods. Asp-197 and His-250 are highly conserved amino acids and are part of the hydrogen-bonding network that involves the chromophore. Both substitutions cause a destabilization of the protonated chromophore in the Pr state as revealed by resonance Raman and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. Titration experiments demonstrate a lowering of the pKa from 11.1 (wild type) to 8.8 in H250A and 7.2 in D197A. Photoconversion of the mutants does not lead to the Pfr state. H250A is arrested in a meta-Rc-like state in which the chromophore is deprotonated. For H250A and the wild-type protein, deprotonation of the chromophore in meta-Rc is coupled to the release of a proton to the external medium, whereas the subsequent proton re-uptake, linked to the formation of the Pfr state in the wild-type protein, is not observed for H250A. No transient proton exchange with the external medium occurs in D197A, suggesting that Asp-197 may be the proton release group. Both mutants do not undergo the photo-induced protein structural changes that in the wild-type protein are detectable by size exclusion chromatography. These conformational changes are, therefore, attributed to the meta-Rc → Pfr transition and most likely coupled to the transient proton re-uptake. The present results demonstrate that Asp-197 and His-250 are essential for stabilizing the protonated chromophore structure in the parent Pr state, which is required for the primary photochemical process, and for the complete photo-induced conversion to the Pfr state.

Phytochromes are photoreceptors of plants, bacteria, and fungi that are most sensitive in the red and far-red region of the visible spectrum (1Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley Press, Weinheim, Germany2005Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Three different bilin chromophores are incorporated into phytochromes: plants utilize phytochromobilin and cyanobacteria use phycocyanobilin (PCB), 5The abbreviations used are: PCB, phycocyanobilin; Agp1, Agrobacterium phytochrome 1; BV, biliverdin; Pr, red-absorbing form of phytochrome; Pfr, far-red absorbing form of phytochrome; CBD, chromophore binding domain; RR, resonance Raman; ip, in-plane. whereas other bacteria and fungi incorporate biliverdin (BV), the evolutionarily most ancient chromophore (2Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In all phytochromes, the bilin is covalently attached via its ring A ethylidene (phytochromobilin/PCB) or vinyl (BV) side chain to a cysteine residue. The position of this cysteine, however, is different in the BV binding and the phytochromobilin/PCB binding species and is located close to the N terminus and in the GAF domain of the protein, respectively (2Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phytochromes are photochromic pigments that, upon light absorption, can be reversibly switched between the physiologically inactive and the active form. These two forms are denoted according to the absorption maxima as red-absorbing form Pr and far-red absorbing form Pfr. Upon light absorption in the Pr state, the tetrapyrrole chromophore undergoes a double bond Z → E isomerization at the C-D methine bridge to yield the photoproduct lumi-R, which thermally relaxes via several meta intermediate states to the Pfr form (3Tu S.L. Lagarias J.C. Briggs W.R. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley Verlag, Weinheim, Germany2005: 121-149Google Scholar). So far, most of the knowledge about the reaction mechanism of the photoconversion and about the underlying structural changes has been provided by spectroscopic studies. Only recently the first three-dimensional structure of a phytochrome has been determined (4Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The structure, which refers to the Pr state of the chromophore binding domain (CBD) of DrBphP, a BV binding phytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, allows identification of the amino acids that are critical for protein-chromophore interaction. Because these amino acids are well conserved among the different phytochrome sequences, one may expect common structural motifs for the chromophore binding pockets and similar reaction mechanisms for all phytochromes. In the CBD of DrBphP, the chromophore adopts a ZZZssa geometry, corresponding to the Z configuration for all methine bridge double bonds and a syn conformation for the A-B and B-C bridges, whereas the C-D methine bridge single bond is in the anti conformation. Except for the syn conformation of the A-B methine bridge, the same geometry was predicted for the phytochromobilin chromophore in the Pr state of plant phytochromes on the basis of resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations (5Mroginski M.A. Murgida D.H. Von Stetten D. Kneip C. Mark F. Hildebrandt P. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16734-16735Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For both classes of phytochromes, RR spectroscopy has shown that the respective Pr and Pfr forms contain a protonated (cationic) chromophore (6Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E.

These results are in agreement with conclusions from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiments with oat phytochrome (8Foerstendorf H. Mummert E. Schäfer E. Scheer H. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10793-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and have been confirmed by NMR studies on the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 (9Strauss H.M. Hughes J. Schmieder P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8244-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous RR experiments with pea phytochrome suggested that the Pr → Pfr photoconversion involves a transient deprotonation of the chromophore in the formation of a meta-R-like (“bleached”) intermediate (10Mizutani Y. Tokutomi S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Together with stationary pH electrode measurements of different fragments of pea phytochrome (11Tokutomi S. Yamamoto K.T. Furuya M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 47: 439-445Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) these results have been interpreted in terms of sequential proton release and uptake in the Pr → Pfr pathway where proton release is associated with the deprotonation of the chromophore (10Mizutani Y. Tokutomi S. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, no kinetic evidence for this reaction scheme was provided, and the reprotonation of the chromophore in the formation of Pfr was not included. The proposed model remained thus speculative. In a recent study on the BV binding phytochrome Agp1 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens it was conclusively demonstrated by RR spectroscopy and flash photolysis that deprotonation of the tetrapyrrole in the meta-Rc state, the precursor of Pfr, is coupled to the release of a proton to the external medium, followed by reprotonation of the chromophore and proton re-uptake upon Pfr formation (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N. Mroginski M.A. Otto H. Murgida D.H. Heyn M.P. Hildebrandt P. J. Biol.

Transient proton release and uptake could also be observed in the Pr → Pfr photoconversion of Cph1 (12van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that proton translocations in the chromophore binding pocket are of fundamental importance for the Pr → Pfr photoconversion and specifically for the final reaction step of the Pfr formation.

Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) shows that many amino acids in the binding pocket form a hydrogen bonding network with the chromophore and two water molecules (Fig. 10). The goal of the present work is to analyze the structural and functional role of the 2 highly conserved amino acids Asp-197 and His-250 that are hydrogen bonded to the chromophore. For this purpose the mutants D197A and H250A were prepared and characterized. A H250A mutant of full-length Agp1 has been characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy (14Lamparter T. Carrascal M.

The present work shows that in both Agp1 mutants the protonation of the Pr chromophore is affected, that the photoconversion is incomplete, and that the chromophore of the photoproducts is deprotonated. In this respect, the mutant photoproducts are different from that of the wild type, i.e. Pfr, which has a protonated chromophore (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N.

Sequence Alignment and Analysis of Hydrogen Bonding—The selection of 46 protein sequences of phytochrome homologs was identical to that of a phylogenetic study published earlier (2Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Protein alignments were performed using ClustalX, version 1.8 (19Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35618) Google Scholar), with the “gap opening” and “gap extension” parameters set to 50 and 0.5, respectively. Potential hydrogen bonds were analyzed using the program HBPLUS (20McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol.

Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Cloning of Agp1-M15 and Mutants, Protein Expression and Purification—Cloning of the Escherichia coli expression vector pAG1-M15 was described previously (22Scheerer P. Michael N. Park J.H. Noack S.

This vector encodes for a truncated version of Agp1 that lacks the histidine kinase and has additional histidines at its C terminus for affinity purification. The D197A and H250A mutants were cloned with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. For protein expression, 4-liter E. coli cultures were grown, collected, and extracted as described (22Scheerer P. Michael N. Park J.H. Noack S. Förster C. Hammam M.A.S. Inomata K. Choe H.W. Lamparter T. Krauss N. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 153: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Following affinity purification, the apoprotein was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and stored at concentrations of ∼20 mg/ml in a buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, at -80° until further use. To this solution, 2 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) and BV (5 mm methanol stock solution; Frontier Scientific, Carnforth, UK) were added. Unless indicated otherwise, the final molar concentration of BV was ∼50% higher than that of the protein. After completion of assembly, the holoprotein was passed over a NAP desalting column (GE Healthcare) to remove free chromophore and residual ammonium sulfate and to allow for buffer exchange. The final buffer was 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8; for flash photolysis and transient protonation measurements, phytochrome was dissolved in 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. The holoprotein assembly kinetics was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy as described (23Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Assembly and Photoconversion—The absorbance increase at 700 nm was monitored after mixing 7 μm biliverdin, 2 mm dithiothreitol with 14 μm apoprotein (final concentrations) at 18 °C. For photoconversion, the sample was irradiated with red light of 655 nm/50 μmol m-2 s-1 from a light-emitting diode for 2 min. Flash Photolysis and Protonation Kinetics—Flash photolysis measurements were performed as described for full-length Agp1 (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N.

Photoconversion was induced by a 695-nm 10-ns laser flash and monitored at various wavelengths in the Soret (360-450 nm) and Q-band (600-800 nm) regions. The samples were used for repetitive measurements. Before each laser flash, the accumulation of the Pr state of Agp1-M15 wild-type and D197A samples was increased by irradiation with 784-nm light (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T.

Because of the low dark conversion rate single flash traces were acquired for H250A; each sample was exposed to six flashes at most. Photo-induced proton exchange with the external medium was monitored by using appropriate pH indicator dyes as described (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N.

Stopped-flow Measurements—Stopped-flow-induced pH jumps were performed as described (24Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T.

The D197A mutant was initially suspended in 5 mm Tris buffer at pH 6.5. After 1:1 mixing with 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, the final measured pH was 7.9. Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—RR spectra were measured at -140 °C using liquid nitrogen-cooled cryostats as described previously (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N.

The protein concentration was ∼200 mg/ml (50 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8). The energetic proximity of the 1064-nm excitation line with respect to the Q-band electronic transition of tetrapyrroles provides a substantial (pre-)resonance enhancement of the Raman bands of the chromophores in the Pr and Pfr states such that contributions from the apoprotein remain negligibly small. Only for phytochrome states with reduced Q-band oscillator strengths such as the meta-Rc intermediate is the resonance enhancement lower and Raman bands from the apo-protein (e.g. at 1450 and 1650 cm-1) become detectable (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N. Mroginski M.A. Otto H. Murgida D.H. Heyn M.P. Hildebrandt P. J. Biol.

In all RR spectra shown in this work, a linear background was subtracted. When necessary, residual spectral contributions from Pr or Pfr were also subtracted. Truncation and Mutations of Agp1—All experiments of the present study were performed with recombinant, affinity-purified Agp1-M15, which lacks the C-terminal histidine kinase module and comprises the N-terminal 504 amino acids with the PAS (named for period, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator and single-minded proteins) (27Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R674-R677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GAF (named for cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, adenylate cyclase, and Fhl proteins) (28Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and PHY (specific for photochromic phytochromes) domains and additional 6 C-terminal histidine residues for affinity purification (22Scheerer P.

For both the Pr and Pfr state, UV/visible and RR spectra of Agp1-M15 are identical to those of the Agp1 full-length protein (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N.

This agreement also holds for the photoconversion intermediates and kinetics studied in flash photolysis experiments, which reveal three components with time constants similar to those of the full-length protein, i.e. 350 μs, 3.6 ms, and 290 ms for the lumi-R → meta-Ra, meta-Ra → meta-Rc, and meta-Rc → Pfr transition, respectively. Like the full-length protein, Agp1-M15 shows transient proton release and uptake that are linked to the formation of meta-Rc and Pfr, respectively. Thus, these findings indicate that the histidine kinase module has only negligible influence on the spectral properties and the photoconversion kinetics of Agp1 such that the truncated Agp1-M15 is referred to as “wild-type” protein. The crystal structure of the CBD of DrBphP (4Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) showed that 22 amino acids are located at a distance of <4 Å to the chromophore. Among them, Asp-207, His-260, and His-290 are of particular interest with respect to chromophore protonation. In phycocyanin (30Schirmer T. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 677-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which is spectrally similar to the Pr form of phytochromes (31Arciero D.M. Bryant D.A. Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18343-18349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the carboxylate side chain of an aspartate residue serves as a counterion for the protonated PCB chromophore. Histidine residues play important roles in the differential chromophore protonation of sensory rhodopsin (32Zhang X.N. Spudich J.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1516-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alignment of 46 phytochrome protein sequences (2Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showed that all 3 amino acids are conserved in 44 or 45 of the selected homologs, including Agp1. The present work is focused on Asp-197 and His-250 of Agp1, which are homologous to Asp-207 and His-260 of DrBphP. For the present work, we generated both the D197A and the H250A mutants of Agp1-M15. Both mutants incorporated the BV chromophore in a covalent manner, although their assembly rates were significantly reduced. In the wild-type protein, the slow component of the assembly kinetics (24Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13684-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is associated with a time constant of less than 20 s, whereas for H250A and D197A the time constants have been determined to be 2 and 20 min, respectively (data not shown). The absorption spectrum of the D197A mutant differs significantly from that of the wild type. Specifically, the intensity ratio of the Q (∼700 nm) and Soret (∼380 nm) absorption bands in the UV-visible spectrum, typically 2:1 in the wild-type protein, is reversed (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of the H250A mutant in the Pr state is similar to that of the wild type except for a slight broadening of the Q-band and an increase of the Soret band (Fig. 1). Thus, the Pr spectrum of H250A is intermediate between that of the wild type and D197A. The H250A mutant displays the same spectral and photoactive properties as its full-length version (14Lamparter T. Carrascal M. Michael N. Martinez E. Rottwinkel G. Abian J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3659-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Protonation of the Chromophore in the Pr State—The absorption spectra of the Pr form of the wild type and both mutants are strongly pH dependent, in particular in the Q-band (see Fig. 2, A-C). Analyzing the pH dependence of the UV-visible absorption spectra on the basis of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pKa values of 7.2, 8.8, and 11.1 were determined for D197A, H250A, and the wild-type protein, respectively (Fig. 2D). The respective Hill coefficients of 0.85, 1.02, and 0.81 suggest that one proton is involved. Similar spectrophotometric titration experiments with the cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 led to a pKa value of 9.5 (12van Thor J.J. Borucki B. Crielaard W. Otto H. Lamparter T. Hughes J. Hellingwerf K.J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11460-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which was attributed to the deprotonation of the PCB chromophore on the basis of a comparison with the pH-dependent spectra of the model compound octaethylbiliverdin (33Mizutani Y. Tokutomi S. Aoyagi K. Horitsu K. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10693-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we show by RR spectroscopy that in Agp1 the underlying acid-base reaction is also linked to the deprotonation of the chromophore (Fig. 3). The RR spectra of protonated (cationic) linear methine-bridged tetrapyrroles display a band between 1580 and 1550 cm-1 that originates from the N-H in-plane (ip) bending of the ring B and C N-H groups (6Kneip C. Hildebrandt P. Schlamann W. Braslavsky S.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 16: 15185-15192Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In wild-type Agp1-M15 (pH 7.8), this band is found at 1573 cm-1 and it disappears upon H/D exchange (Fig. 3A) (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T. Michael N. Mroginski M.A. Otto H. Murgida D.H. Heyn M.P. Hildebrandt P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34358-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The corresponding N-D ip mode is observed at 1078 cm-1 (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). The intensity of the N-H ip mode is strongly reduced in the spectrum of the D197A mutant measured at a pH of 7.8, implying that the chromophore is largely in the non-protonated (neutral) form as expected from the pKa value of 7.2 (Fig. 3B). Correspondingly, a substantial fraction of the chromophore is protonated at pH 6.3 as indicated by the N-H ip mode at 1570 cm-1, which disappears in D2O (Fig. 3C). The pH-dependent protonation of the chromophore is also reflected by the intensity increase of the N-D ip from pH 7.8 to pH 6.3 (supplemental Fig. S3). For H250A (pKa = 8.8) the chromophore is expected to be largely protonated at pH 7.8 as confirmed by the RR spectrum (Fig. 3D). The fraction of the protonated chromophore is identified on the basis of the N-H ip mode (1573 cm-1), which shifts down to 1080 cm-1 in D2O, whereas the smaller fraction of the unprotonated chromophore is reflected by the increased intensity at 1599 cm-1 as compared with the wild-type protein. This band is assigned to the C = C stretching mode of the methine bridges of the non-protonated chromophore and corresponds to the strong 1593 cm-1 band of the D197A mutant at pH 7.8. The direction of the pKa shift in D197A suggests that the negatively charged group of Asp-197 serves as the counterion of the chromophore. The structure of the CBD of DrBphP shows, however, that at least in that smaller crystalline fragment, the Asp-197 side chain points outward away from the chromophore (4Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3RR spectra of the Pr states of wild-type Agp1-M15 at pH 7.8 (A), D197A at pH 7.8 (B), D197A at pH 6.3 (C), and H250A at pH 7.8 (D) measured at -140 °C.

A similar reduced Q-band intensity has also been observed in the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the cryotrapped meta-Rb intermediate of oat phytochrome, which is in equilibrium with meta-Rc (34Eilfeld P. Rüdiger W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C-J. Biosci. 1985; 40: 109-114Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild-type meta-Rc state (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S. Lamparter T.

However, the RR spectra of the photoproducts of both D197A and H250A display far reaching similarities with that of the meta-Rc intermediate of wild-type Agp1 (7Borucki B. Von Stetten D. Seibeck S.

https://openalex.org/W2013961365,"Gene expression in metazoans is regulated not only at the level of individual genes but also in a coordinated manner across large chromosomal domains (for example centromeres, telomeres and imprinted gene clusters) and along entire chromosomes (for example X-chromosome dosage compensation). The primary DNA sequence usually specifies the regulation of individual genes, but the nature of cis-acting information that controls genes over large regions has been elusive: higher-order DNA structure, specific histone modifications, subnuclear compartmentalization and primary DNA sequence are possibilities. One paradigm of chromosome-wide gene regulation is Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation in which a large dosage compensation complex (DCC) is targeted to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to repress transcript levels by half. This essential process equalizes X-linked gene expression between the sexes (XO males and XX hermaphrodites). Here we report the discovery and dissection of cis-acting sites that mark nematode X chromosomes as targets for gene repression by the DCC. These rex (recruitment element on X) sites are widely dispersed along X and reside in promoters, exons and intergenic regions. rex sites share at least two distinct motifs that act in combination to recruit the DCC. Mutating these motifs severely reduces or abolishes DCC binding in vivo, demonstrating the importance of primary DNA sequence in chromosome-wide regulation. Unexpectedly, the motifs are not enriched on X, but altering motif numbers within rex sites demonstrates that motif co-occurrence in unusually high densities is essential for optimal DCC recruitment. Thus, X-specific repression is established through sequences not specific to X. The distribution of common motifs provides the foundation for repression along an entire chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2023201096,"Human maintenance DNA cytosine methyltransferase (DNMT1) regulates gene expression in a methylation-dependent and -independent manner. Anti-apoptotic survivin gene down-regulation is mediated by p53 recruitment of DNMT1 to its promoter. Survivin inhibits programmed cell death, regulates cell division, and is expressed in cancer cells. The survivin gene promoter is CG-rich containing several Sp1 canonical, Sp1-like, cell cycle-dependent element/cell cycle gene homology region, and p53-binding sites. Here we demonstrate that Sp1 transcription factor(s) play a role in transcriptional activation of the survivin promoter in Drosophila and human cells. Sp1 inhibition in vivo by mithramycin A leads to down-regulation of a luciferase reporter driven by the human survivin promoter in transfected cells. Mithramycin A or Sp1-specific short interfering RNA down-regulated the endogenous survivin gene expression, confirming Sp1 as the primary determinant for transcriptional activation. Furthermore, immobilized DNMT1 ligand bound to seven consensus amino acids corresponding to the N-terminal region of the Sp class of transcription factors in a phage display analysis. In the co-immunoprecipitation assay, the endogenous Sp1 or Sp3 pulled down DNMT1 and methyltransferase activity. Similarly, a glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay between DNMT1 and Sp1 demonstrates a direct interaction between the two proteins. Fluorescent fusions of DNMT1 and Sp1 co-localized in the mammalian nucleus, thus supporting binary complex formation between both the proteins. The kinetics of survivin promoter occupancy via chromatin immunoprecipitation following doxorubicin treatment show the presence of Sp1 and gradual accumulation of transcriptional repressors p53, DNMT1, histone methyltransferase G9a, and HDAC1 onto the promoter along with histone H3K9me2.

In cancer cells de-regulation of genetic control of cell death and cell survival is common. Members of the inhibitor of apoptosis gene families have emerged as unique regulators of cell death (1Schimmer A.D. Welsh K. Pinilla C. Wang Z. Krajewska M. Bonneau M.J. Pedersen I.M. Kitada S. Scott F.L. Bailly-Maitre B. Glinsky G. Scudiero D. Sausville E. Salvesen G. Nefzi A. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Reed J.C.

One such member is Survivin, expressed exclusively in fetal and cancer cells but not in normal adult cells. Survivin binds to the mitotic spindle during mitosis and is thought to be responsible for anti-apoptotic activity in cancer cells via aberrant interaction with the mitotic spindle. There is also speculation that the Survivin protein can bind caspase-3 (an enzyme required for apoptosis) and inhibit its function. Architecturally the survivin gene promoter contains several Sp1 canonical, Sp1-like, and p53-binding elements, suggesting participation of the Sp1 transcription factor and/or p53 in gene regulation. Furthermore, survivin transcription is down-regulated by the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin, which mediates p53 induction in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J.

In the same study, binding of p53 to the survivin promoter is shown using immunoprecipitation with p53 antibodies, and overexpression of p53 led to down-regulation of Survivin. However, deletion and mutation analysis of p53-binding sites in the survivin promoter suggested that neither p53-binding site is required for survivin gene repression, although overexpression of wild type p53 led to repression of the survivin promoter in various cell types. It was also suggested that modification of chromatin in the survivin promoter might play a significant role in silencing of survivin gene transcription by p53 (3Mirza A. McGuirk M. Hockenberry T.N. Wu Q. Ashar H. Black S. Wen S.F. Wang L. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. Nielsen L.L. Pickett C.B. Liu S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor p53 gene product is a key transcriptional activator/repressor. Its function is to eliminate and inhibit the proliferation of abnormal cells, thereby preventing neoplastic development. The p53 signaling pathway is in standby mode in normal cells and may be activated by cellular stress such as DNA damage or strand breaks, and in turn may activate programmed cell death. When the p53 gene is mutated, cells cannot respond correctly to various signals and are predisposed to neoplastic development. Indeed, in many cancers p53 gene mutation is common. p53 is shown to be associated with several protein factors that help transcriptional activation or repression of p53-responsive genes. The mechanism of p53-mediated repression is facilitated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) in association with the core repressor protein Sin3a. The p53-Sin3a complex targets HDACs to p53-repressive promoters to create a chromatin environment nonconducive for transcription (4Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor p53 is also shown to interact with Sp1 (5Lagger G. Doetzlhofer A. Schuettengruber B. Haidweger E. Simboeck E. Tischler J. Chiocca S. Suske G. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2669-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Koutsodontis G. Vasilaki E. Chou W.C. Papakosta P. Kardassis D. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which is also believed to be a key element in regulation of important biological processes controlled by p53 via p21 gene activation such as DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Sp1 was one of the first mammalian transcription factors to be cloned (7Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). It is a member of the family of transcription factors with a zinc finger-type DNA binding domain that binds GC-rich sequences, including GC and GT boxes (8Giglioni B. Comi P. Ronchi A. Mantovani R. Ottolenghi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Sp1 transcription factor is essential for mammalian development since Sp1 knock-out mice die approximately at day 11.5 of gastrulation (10Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Sp1 is also required for terminal cell differentiation. This transcription factor undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation (11Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 12Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), indicating secondary modifications may regulate its biological function. Earlier studies indicate that Sp1 is responsible for recruitment of TATA-binding proteins to the promoter and fixing the transcription start site of TATA-less genes (13Liao W.C. Geng Y. Johnson L.F. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Lu J. Lee W. Jiang C. Keller E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5391-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Most housekeeping genes are TATA-less and contain CpG islands (16Cross S.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Often embedded within the CpG islands are the Sp1-binding sites. Binding of Sp1 transcription factors on the CpG-rich regions protects it from de novo methylation (17Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegfried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Sp1 transcription factors contain regions that are crucial for transactivation, DNA binding, and oligomerization and were identified using Drosophila SL2 cell lines that are naturally deficient in the Sp class of transcription factors and their related activities. The N-terminal glutamine, serine/threonine-rich domains of Sp1 are essential for transcriptional activation (18Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is shown to be involved in interaction with other transcription factors (19Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sp1 interacts physically and cooperates functionally with several sequence-specific activators such as NF-κB, GATA, YY1, E2F1, pRb, SREBP1, and p53 (20Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Sp1 is also shown to bind human maintenance DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase (DNMT1) in vivo via immunoprecipitation of HeLa cell nuclear extract (21Song J. Ugai H. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19897-19904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Like Sp1, human DNMT1 is known to be associated with several different proteins during DNA replication and to participate in transcriptional regulation (22Pradhan S. Esteve P.O. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 109: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). DNMT1 has two domains. The N terminus and the C terminus are known as regulatory and catalytic regions, respectively. The N terminus is shown to recruit transcriptional repressors such as histone deacetylases (23Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), Sin3a (24Geiman T.M. Sankpal U.T. Robertson A.K. Chen Y. Mazumdar M. Heale J.T. Schmiesing J.A. Kim W. Yokomori K. Zhao Y. Robertson K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2716-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and retinoblastoma (25Pradhan S. Kim G.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) to specific classes of promoters for transcriptional gene silencing. For example, recruitment of HDACs alters the acetylation status of the histones on chromatin, thus making the promoter less accessible to transcription factors. Alternatively, DNMT1 may be recruited by specific transcription factors such as p53 (27Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or PML-RAR (28Di Croce L. Raker V.A. Corsaro M. Fazi F. Fanelli M. Faretta M. Fuks F. Coco F.Lo Kouzarides T. Nervi C. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Science. 2002; 295: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 29Di Croce L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for hypermethylation of responsive promoters. The above phenomenon of methylation-independent and -dependent gene repression by DNMT1 makes it an ideal transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, DNMT1 can also recruit de novo methyltransferases such as DNMT3A and DNMT3B for DNA methylation (30Kim G.D. Ni J. Kelesoglu N. Roberts R.J. Pradhan S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4183-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In colorectal cancer cells, DNMT1 and DNMT3B are essential for maintenance of genomic methylation (31Rhee I. Bachman K.E. Park B.H. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Schuebel K.E. Cui H. Feinberg A.P. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Baylin S.B. Vogelstein B. Nature. 2002; 416: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Although de novo methyltransferases participate in maintenance of DNA methylation, they may recruit other transcriptional repressors such as RP58 and HDACs for methylation-independent gene repression (32Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Godin N. Kasai M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Furthermore, homozygous deletion of DNMT1 or DNMT3A and DNMT3B leads to embryonic lethality (33Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3159) Google Scholar, 34Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar) like that of Sp1 null mice (10Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) suggesting involvement of these proteins in mammalian development. In cancer cells, aberrant methylation of the tumor suppressor gene promoters is a hallmark (35Jair K.W. Bachman K.E. Suzuki H. Ting A.H. Rhee I. Yen R.W. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 36Kondo Y. Issa J.P. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2004; 23: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and overexpression of DNMT1 has been speculated (37Etoh T. Kanai Y. Ushijima S. Nakagawa T. Nakanishi Y. Sasako M. Kitano S. Hirohashi S. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells gene expression is coordinated with precision. Therefore, aberrant expression of a key gene often leads to failure of cellular function, ultimately challenging the very survival of a cell. In human cells the balancing act between transcriptional activators and repressors brings harmony to transcription of a gene. Generally the proximal part of a human gene contains DNA sequences that can bind transcription factor(s) and other transcriptional co-activator(s). In our previous work in colorectal carcinoma cells (27Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that survivin gene regulation is mediated by both epigenetic factors in conjunction with p53. After DNA damage, the survivin promoter was found to be hypermethylated, and chromatin immunoprecipitation shows the presence of p53-, DNMT1-, and K9-methylated H3s (27Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Pradhan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1000-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These observations gave a snapshot of the repressed promoter, but it did not address the transition between an actively expressed to a repressed survivin promoter. In this study we have worked to identify transcriptional activators/repressors of the survivin promoter and their dynamics during transcriptional activation and repression upon DNA damage. Cell Culture and Constructs—All the following cell lines were obtained from the ATCC: Jurkat (human T cell lymphoblast), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney), and COS-7 (SV40 transformed fibroblast). Cells were grown as per ATCC recommendations. Cultures of Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cell line 2 (SL2) were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 27 °C. Parental HCT116 and p53 knock-out cell lines p53-/- (HCT116 p53-/-) were grown as described previously (38Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). Doxorubicin was dissolved in Me2SO and mithramycin A in methanol. To generate DNA damage, cells were treated for up to 48 h with 1 μm doxorubicin. For mithramycin A treatment, cells were incubated for up to 48 h with 100 nm mithramycin A. For transient transfections, cells were pretreated with different concentrations of mithramycin A for an hour before transfections. All GST-DNMT, DNMT1fl-InCDB, and DNMT1Δ580-InCBD constructs have been described previously (30Kim G.D. Ni J. Kelesoglu N. Roberts R.J. Pradhan S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4183-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).

DsRed-Sp1 and pPACDNMT1/p53 constructs were made by PCR cloning. SpII, Cdc25C (pcdc25C-luc), Cdc2 (pcdc2-luc), pPAC-Sp1, and -Sp3 plasmids are described elsewhere (2Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T.

Immunoprecipitation, GST Pulldown, and Western Blot Analysis—Antibodies for p53, p21, and Survivin were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-DNMT1 antibody was from New England Biolabs. Antibodies for PCNA, Sp1, Sp3, and HDAC1 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Nuclear extracts were made as described previously (41Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). All the pulldowns were performed as described previously (30Kim G.D. Ni J. Kelesoglu N. Roberts R.J. Pradhan S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4183-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis (NIH image 1.59) was done on two independent blots. For peptide competition assay, GST fusion DNMT1 (DNMT1-(788–1109)) was incubated with competitor peptide (TLPSPLLTVH) or a nonspecific (KFPSSPLRIPGGNIYISPLKSP) peptide for 30 min. The interaction between DNMT1 and Sp1 was probed by Western blot analysis. DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase Assay—Methyltransferase assays were carried out at 37 °C for 30–60 min in duplicate with a total volume of 25 μl of reaction mix. Reaction conditions were as described previously (42Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Transient Transfections, Luciferase Assay, and Immunocytochemistry—For transient transfections, COS-7 and HEK293 cells were incubated with a mixture of DNA and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 1 μg/3 μl. The Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect DNA into SL2 cells. As an internal control, a constant amount of pCMVβ (Clontech), a vector containing the β-galactosidase gene, was also co-transfected. Forty eight hours post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized with β-galactosidase activity. For cytochemistry, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid and visualized using a confocal microscope with a 63×/1.4 oil Zeiss objective lens at 488 nm for GFP-DNMT1 and 583 nm for DsRed-Sp1 fusions using Apotome device. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—HEK293 and HCT116 cells were grown on 150-mm dishes and were treated with 100 nm mithramycin A and/or 1 μm doxorubicin. After 24 h of treatment, 1% formaldehyde was added for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link proteins to DNA. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed with SDS lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). The lysates were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. After 10-fold dilution of the sonicated cell supernatants in ChIP dilution buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) supplemented with protease inhibitors, immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C with rotation by using 4 μgof anti-Sp1, anti-DNMT1, anti-p53, anti-G9a (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-dimethylated H3K9 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-HDAC1 polyclonal antibodies for 2–4 mg of protein. Monoclonal GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used as a control. 40 μl of protein G coupled to magnetic beads pre-adsorbed with salmon sperm DNA were added to the chromatin-antibody complexes for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. The beads were then isolated and washed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The protein-DNA complexes were eluted with a buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. The protein DNA cross-links were reversed by incubating the eluates with NaCl (5 m) for 6 h at 65°C.A small portion of samples was tested first for their content in DNMT1, Sp1, or p53 by Western blot. To the rest of the samples, proteinase K (New England Biolabs) was added for 1 h at 45 °C,andthe DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed for the presence of survivin gene (GenBank™ accession number U75285) promoter sequence by PCR with proximal (GACCACGGGCAGAGCCACGCGGCG and GCGCCCTGGGCAACCGTCTCCACC) and distal (TCCTGGAACTCGGTTTTGAG and ACCACTTTGGGGCAGAGATG) primer sets. PCR was performed using the following amplification parameters. After a hot start, the cycling parameters were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for a total of 30 cycles. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide and were observed under UV light. Phage Display Assay—Human DNMT1 with fused intein chitin binding domain (full-length DNMT1, DNMT1fl-InCBD; N-terminal 580 deletion DNMT1, DNMT1Δ580-inCBD) was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system, and these fusions were incubated with chitin magnetic beads. Enzymes bound to the beads were isolated as depicted in Fig. 3A and incubated with a Ph.D.-12 phage display peptide library (New England Biolabs). After several washes, phages specifically bound to DNMT1 were isolated by incubating phage DNMT1fl-InCBD in 50 mm dithiothreitol. This process cleaves the DNMT1 from the InCBD fusion tag resulting in isolation of DNMT1 and the bound phages, whereas the In-CBD tag remains on the magnetic matrix. The phages were amplified for another round of bio-panning. The bio-panning procedure was repeated two more times to enrich specific DNMT1-binding phages. Sp1 Knockdown Assay—HCT116 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with two different Sp1 Validated Stealth™ RNAi duplex sequences (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For control transfection, a Stealth™ RNAi negative control duplex was used (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, Western blots were performed. Sp1 Transcription Factor Is Crucial for Transcriptional Activation of the survivin Promoter—Sequence analysis of the survivin promoter in both human (43Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar) and mouse (44Li F. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3143-3151PubMed Google Scholar) genes reveals the absence of a TATA box. A CpG island lies upstream of the transcription start site with at least seven putative Sp1 transcription factor-binding sites. Deletion analysis of the survivin promoter correlated promoter activity in the presence of Sp1-binding sites in a transfection assay (44Li F. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3143-3151PubMed Google Scholar). Also prominent in the promoter region are two putative p53-binding sites (Fig. 1A). To examine the functional association between Sp1-like transcription factors and the p53 tumor suppressor, we transfected SpII, a luciferase reporter plasmid construct under human survivin promoter regulation (2Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), in combination with Sp1 or Sp1 and p53 into COS-7 cells, and we then measured luciferase activity. Overexpression of Sp1 in the COS-7 cells leads to ∼8-fold transcriptional activation of the survivin promoter, and this transactivation was strongly repressed in the presence of p53 (Fig. 1B) suggesting that the presence or absence of p53 directly affects survivin expression. We further deleted the p53-binding sites of the SpII plasmid to create SpIIΔp53, a plasmid also lacking two Sp1-binding sites, and used it as a negative control (Fig. 1A) for luciferase activity assay in the presence of exogenous p53 and/or Sp1 in COS-7 cells. Luciferase activity was not strongly affected in the presence of exogenous p53 in the SpIIΔp53 transfection assay confirming that p53-binding sites are crucial for survivin promoter repression. Introduction of Sp1 alone or with p53 in the SpIIΔp53 transfection assay did not affect the promoter activity, despite the presence of five more Sp1-binding sites on the deletion survivin promoter (Fig. 1B). These data suggest Sp1 can be recruited onto the survivin promoter for transactivation of the gene, and p53 can act as a negative modulator of the survivin promoter. In the above experiments (Fig. 1B), mammalian cells such as COS-7 contain the endogenous Sp1 class of transcription factors, which may influence the gene expression pattern. Thus, to avoid influence of the endogenous Sp1 class of transcription factors on transgene activation, we chose Drosophila embryo-derived cell line SL2 for our studies. These cells are devoid of the Sp1 class of transcription factors or Sp1-associated activities. Thus they represent a unique biological system to study Sp1-dependent transcriptional mechanisms. Both Sp1 and Sp3 expression constructs were transfected either in combination with SpII or SpII and p53. As in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B), Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors were able to transactivate the survivin promoter between 12- and 37-fold, and this transactivation was significantly reduced in the presence of p53 in SL2 cells, suggesting that p53 is capable of transcriptional repression despite the presence of Sp1 or Sp3 (Fig. 1C). To unequivocally confirm that the Sp1 class of transcription factors is indeed involved in survivin gene activation in human cells, we transfected HCT116 cells with a construct containing full-length Sp1, and we performed Western blot analysis on the total cell extract 48 h post-transfection to assess the changes in the level of Sp1 and survivin (Fig. 1D). Indeed, the Survivin level was up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner despite the presence of the endogenous Sp1 correlating with the amount of the transfected plasmid. The level of control PCNA remained similar (Fig. 1D). To confirm the role of Sp1 in transactivation, we co-transfected the Sp1 expression plasmid with two other positive controls, Cdc2 and Cdc25C, and compared the promoter activity to SpII wild type and SpIIΔp53 in SL2 cells. Cdc25C, Cdc2, and survivin (SpII) promoters were up-regulated, but SpIIΔp53 displayed ∼5-fold reduced transactivation, suggesting Sp1-binding sites are crucial for transactivation (supplemental Fig. 1). These experiments clearly demonstrate the transcriptional activation of the survivin promoter is dependent on Sp1 and Sp3, and p53 is a potent survivin down-regulator in the mammalian and insect cell system.

https://openalex.org/W1977106716,"The Artemis nuclease is required for V(D)J recombination and for repair of an as yet undefined subset of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks. To assess the possibility that Artemis acts on oxidatively modified double strand break termini, its activity toward model DNA substrates, bearing either 3′-hydroxyl or 3′-phosphoglycolate moieties, was examined. A 3′-phosphoglycolate had little effect on Artemis-mediated trimming of long 3′ overhangs (≥9 nucleotides), which were efficiently trimmed to 4–5 nucleotides. However, 3′-phosphoglycolates on overhangs of 4–5 bases promoted Artemis-mediated removal of a single 3′-terminal nucleotide, while at least 2 nucleotides were trimmed from identical hydroxyl-terminated substrates. Artemis also efficiently removed a single nucleotide from a phosphoglycolate-terminated 3-base 3′ overhang, while leaving an analogous hydroxyl-terminated overhang largely intact. Such removal was completely dependent on DNA-dependent protein kinase and ATP and was largely dependent on Ku, which markedly stimulated Artemis activity toward all 3′ overhangs. Together, these data suggest that efficient Artemis-mediated cleavage of 3′ overhangs requires a minimum of 2 nucleotides, or a nucleotide plus a phosphoglycolate, 3′ to the cleavage site, as well as 2 unpaired nucleotides 5′ to the cleavage site. Shorter 3′-phosphoglycolate-terminated overhangs and blunt ends were also processed by Artemis but much more slowly. Consistent with a role for Artemis in repair of terminally blocked double strand breaks in vivo, human cells lacking Artemis exhibited hypersensitivity to x-rays, bleomycin, and neocarzinostatin, which all induce 3′-phosphoglycolate-terminated double strand breaks.

The Artemis genetic locus was identified by virtue of its association with a form of B–T–NK+ severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) 2The abbreviations used are: SCID, severe combined immune deficiency; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; DSB, double strand break; PG, phosphoglycolate; TDP1, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. 2The abbreviations used are: SCID, severe combined immune deficiency; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; DSB, double strand break; PG, phosphoglycolate; TDP1, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine. in humans, designated RS-SCID (radiation-sensitive SCID) (1Moshous D.

Hecht S.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 711-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that during DSB repair in vivo, Artemis may trim overhangs that otherwise cannot be processed to give ligatable ends. About half of DNA breaks induced by ionizing radiation bear 3′-phosphoglycolate (3′-PG) termini in various contexts (7Henner W.D. Rodriguez L.O. Hecht S.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 711-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that must be removed in order to allow gap filling by DNA polymerases μ and λ and ligation by DNA ligase IV (8Valerie K.

Although tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP1) is the only identified enzyme capable of processing 3′-PGs on 3′ overhangs (9Inamdar K.V. Pouliot J.J. Zhou T. Lees-Miller S.P. Rasouli-Nia A.

Tatavarthi H. Lupski J.R. Valerie K. Povirk L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an alternative pathway for processing of these lesions in vivo. Because Artemis-deficient cells exhibit significant sensitivity to ionizing radiation, yet have only a small DSB repair defect, we assessed the possibility that Artemis functions in processing overhanging 3′-PG termini. We purified recombinant Artemis and examined the activity of this protein on a variety of oligomeric and plasmid substrates bearing 3′-overhangs. We further investigated the relevance of Artemis to the repair of 3′-PG terminated DSBs by measuring the toxicity of drugs known to induce such breaks in normal and Artemis-deficient cells. Protein Expression and Purification—Artemis expression constructs were derived from full-length Artemis cDNA as described previously (2Li L. Moshous D. Zhou Y. Wang J. Xie G. Salido E. Hu D. de Villartay J.P. Cowan M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6323-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Full-length Artemis protein was purified from SF9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus generated by subcloning Artemis cDNA into pFASTBAC-HT (Invitrogen). Briefly, the amino-polyhistidine-tagged Artemis was extracted and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography with standard protocols (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing Artemis were dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin (HCB), containing 0.1 m NaCl. The affinity-purified protein was loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl in HCB. Aliquots of Artemis-containing fractions were snap-frozen and stored at –70 °C. Protein from these aliquots was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry and identified as Artemis. Endonuclease and exonuclease activities were verified by standard biochemical assays, and aliquots were discarded after four or fewer freeze/thaw cycles. Ku70/80 was purified from insect cells coinfected with a mixture of recombinant baculovirus harboring the human KU70 and KU80 genes, and DNA-PKcs was purified from HeLa cells, both as described previously (11Yannone S.M. Roy S. Chan D.W. Murphy M.B. Huang S. Campisi J. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38242-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard (Bio-Rad), and protein purity was evaluated by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. When necessary, proteins were diluted immediately before use in reaction buffer lacking ATP either on ice (Artemis, DNA-PKcs) or at 22 °C (Ku). DNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides were purchased from Qiagen or Integrated DNA Technologies. All labeled oligomers were purified by gel electrophoresis followed by reverse-phase HPLC. The yield of each oligomer was determined by integrating the absorbance at 260 nm recorded on an in-line UV monitor. To generate 3′-PG oligomers with the sequence CGAGGAACGCG(An)CG (0 ≤ n ≤ 4), 5′-32P-end-labeled oligomers CGAGGAACGCG(An)CGCCC were treated with bleomycin plus H2O2, and the desired 14–17-base 3′-PG products were isolated from a sequencing gel and purified by HPLC (12Chen S. Hannis J.C. Flora J.W. Muddiman D.C. Charles K. Yu Y. Povirk L.F. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The terminal structure and purity of the 14-base (n = 1) 3′-PG oligomer was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry and fragmentation-based chemical sequencing. Treatment of the other (n = 0 and 2–4) oligomers with bleomycin likewise resulted in efficient site-specific cleavage at the -CGCCC site near the 3′ end, as judged by the appearance of a prominent band with the expected mobility (supplemental Fig. 1). Upon extraction from the gel, each such oligomer eluted as a single well defined peak from reverse-phase HPLC. The terminal structure and purity of each putative 3′-PG oligomer was confirmed by quantitative conversion to the corresponding 3′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl oligomers by treatment with tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase and polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase, which in every case induced the expected shifts in electrophoretic mobility (supplemental Fig. 1). An analogous oligomer (n = 1) bearing a 3′-phosphotyrosyl terminus was purchased from Midland Certified Reagents. The 9- and 11-base 3′-PG oligomers CGAGGAACG and CGAGGAACGCG were similarly prepared as described previously and their structures verified by mass spectrometry (12Chen S. Hannis J.C. Flora J.W. Muddiman D.C. Charles K. Yu Y. Povirk L.F. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The 36-base 3′-PG or 3′-hydroxyl oligomers were prepared by ligating the corresponding labeled 14-mers to the 22-mer GCCATGTACTTGGATGATCTAT in the presence of the complementary 20-mer GCGTTCCTCGATAGATCATC and were again gel/HPLC-purified. Partial duplexes were annealed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA by heating a mixture of labeled oligomer and a 1.5-fold excess of unlabeled complement to 80 °C followed by slow cooling to 10 °C over a period of 3 h. Internally labeled plasmid substrates with various overhangs were constructed by ligating 3′-PG, 3′-phosphotyrosyl, or 3′-hydroxyl oligomers (9–24 bases in length) into plasmids with an 11-base 5′ overhang, as described (13Bennett R.A. Gu X.Y. Povirk L.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1996; 70: 623-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each plasmid was gel-purified and eluted, and the concentration was determined from the 260 nm peak of the absorbance spectrum. Nuclease Assays—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and either 5 nm oligomeric substrate or 1 nm plasmid substrate were prepared at 22 °C. In some cases, a blunt-ended double-stranded 35-mer (4 nm to 1 μm) was also included (3Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Ku was added, and the mixture was immediately vortexed and briefly centrifuged. DNA-PKcs was then added followed immediately by Artemis, and the reaction was mixed by pipeting and placed in a 37 °C bath. Reactions with oligomeric substrates were stopped by addition of 10 μl of formamide containing 20 mm EDTA, and the DNA was heat-denatured and analyzed on sequencing gels. Reactions containing plasmid substrates were stopped by addition of 20 μl of 10 mm EDTA, 0.45 m sodium acetate, 100 μg/ml tRNA, followed immediately by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was cut with AvaI (20 units, 6 h, 37 °C) or TaqαI (hereafter referred to as TaqI; 20 units, 4 h, 65 °C) in 50 μl of the buffer supplied by the vendor (New England Biolabs). In some cases 0.25 mm CoCl2 and 0.1 mm ddGTP were subsequently added, and the samples were treated with 20 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37°C. DNA was precipitated, dissolved in formamide, heat-denatured, and analyzed on sequencing gels. The AvaI and TaqI cleavage sites differ by one nucleotide; however, as expected these two enzymes always gave essentially identical results in parallel experiments. Cell Lines and Proliferation Assays—Fibroblast lines were established from skin biopsies from SCIDA patients 04 and 05 and an unrelated immunologically normal individual (AK). Early passage cultures were immortalized by introduction of human telomerase reverse transcriptase cDNA using methods previously described (6Wang J. Pluth J.M. Cooper P.K. Cowan M.J. Chen D.J. Yannone S.M. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 556-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Yannone S.M. Roy S. Chan D.W. Murphy M.B. Huang S. Campisi J. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38242-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were either irradiated using a Pantak® x-ray generator operating at 320 kV/10 mA with 0.5 mm copper filtration or exposed to genotoxic drugs for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then labeled by the addition of fresh medium containing 10 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) for 24–35 h. Cells were harvested, fixed, and stained using standard procedures, and cell cycle distribution and BrdUrd incorporation were analyzed with a Beckman-Coulter EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer using XL Data Acquisition software and WinMDI 2.8 or FlowJo 8.1 software packages. The fraction of proliferating cells (F) was calculated by scoring the percent of intact cells staining positive for BrdUrd and normalizing to the untreated control of the same cell line (≥10,000 events were scored for each point). To quantitatively compare the toxicity of each agent toward SCIDA and normal cells, relative toxicity at each radiation dose or drug concentration was calculated as ln(F1)/ln(F2), where F1 and F2 are the proliferating fractions, normalized to untreated controls, for SCIDA and normal cells, respectively. This parameter was relatively constant over a range of concentrations even in the case of bleomycin, which typically shows a distinct upward concavity in the response. Trimming of Long 3′-PG-terminated Overhangs by Artemis—DSBs induced by radiation and other free radical-based toxins commonly bear 3′-PG termini (7Henner W.D. Rodriguez L.O. Hecht S.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 711-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dedon P.C. Goldberg I.H. Chem. Res.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2995-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which block polymerase and ligase activities as well as most human exonucleases. The Artemis nuclease, which reportedly shortens long 3′ overhangs, could thereby resolve PG and other blocked termini on 3′ overhangs of DSBs. To determine whether the endonucleolytic activity of Artemis was affected by the presence of PG termini, an internally labeled 3′-PG or 3′-hydroxyl-terminated 36-mer was annealed to 21-, 23-, and 27-base complementary strands to yield substrates with 15-, 13-, and 9-base 3′ overhangs. As expected, Artemis treatment of the 3′-hydroxyl substrates resulted in efficient trimming of overhangs (Fig. 1A) (17Ma Y. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 15-base (36/21 substrate) and 13-base (36/23 substrate) overhangs were each predominantly shortened to a 5-base overhang, yielding 26- and 28-base products, respectively. The 9-base overhang (36/27p substrate) was trimmed predominantly to a 4-base overhang (31-mer) rather than 5-base overhang. The PG-terminated 15- and 13-base overhangs were likewise trimmed predominantly to 5-base overhangs, whereas the 9-base overhang was trimmed to a 4-base overhang. These cleavage patterns and levels of activity are essentially identical to those obtained with the analogous 3′-hydroxyl overhangs (compare Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that PG moieties several bases from the cleavage site had little or no effect on the efficiency or specificity of Artemis-mediated DNA cleavage. In all cases, 38–60% of the substrate was cleaved, with the major product accounting for 50–66% of the total. A substrate composed of a 19-mer annealed to the labeled 36-mer, with 19 bp of duplex DNA and a 17-base overhang, sustained at least 3-fold less Artemis-mediated cleavage than the other substrates and showed altered specificity (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this inefficiency was because of the 19-bp duplex being too short to accommodate the Ku-DNA-Artemis complex, or the 17-base overhang being too long to allow efficient cleavage, we prepared substrates having the same 23-bp duplex DNA and differing only in the length of the 3′ single-stranded overhangs, 13, 19, and 25 bases. Artemis nuclease cleaved all three substrates, with comparable efficiency and essentially identical specificity, with the dominant 5-base overhang (28-mer) product accounting for 44–52% of total cleavage in each case (Fig. 1C). A substrate having only 19 bp of duplex DNA (48/19) sustained 50% less cleavage, and the usual 5-base overhang specificity was lost, with an 11-base overhang (30-mer) being the most frequent product (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data indicate that Artemis is capable of trimming 3′ overhangs at least as long as 25 bases, with the incision site being predominantly 5 nucleotides from the double strand/single strand transition. As footprinting studies indicate that Ku plus DNA-PKcs protects ∼28 bp at a DNA end (18Lee J.W. Inamdar K.V. Hannah M.F. Lees-Miller S.P. Povirk L.F. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2003; 42: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the apparent requirement for at least ∼20 bp of duplex DNA for proper binding and alignment of the nuclease complex is not surprising. Control reactions here and throughout reveal that Artemis, Ku, and DNA-PKcs protein preparations are free of significant contaminating nucleases. A Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel showing the purity of preparations of DNA-PKcs, Ku70/80, and Artemis is shown (Fig. 1D). DNA-PKcs and Ku Dependence of Artemis Activity on Long 3′ Overhangs—Previous work with immunoconjugated Artemis immobilized on agarose beads suggested that Artemis nuclease cleaved long 3′ overhangs to a length of ∼5 bases, in a reaction that required DNA-PKcs but was unexpectedly independent of the presence or absence of Ku (3Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). To assess the DNA-PKcs and Ku dependence of DNA cleavage by purified soluble Artemis, a substrate having 23 bp of duplex DNA and a 13-base 3′-hydroxyl-terminated 3′ overhang (36/23-mer, as above but labeled at the 5′ end rather than internally) was reacted with Artemis plus DNA-PK component proteins (Fig. 2A). As expected, cleavage of this substrate was completely dependent on Artemis, DNA-PKcs, and ATP and yielded a 5-base overhang as the predominant product (49% of total cleavage in Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 8). A time course showed that the cleavage pattern was established within the first few minutes of the reaction (Fig. 2B), consistent with endo- rather than exonucleolytic cleavage. In addition, the similarity of the cleavage patterns between the end-labeled (Fig. 2) and internally labeled (Fig. 1) substrates indicates that there was negligible degradation of the 5′ termini of these substrates. Although Ku was not strictly required for cleavage, the addition of purified Ku70/80 stimulated Artemis nuclease activity 4-fold, in a DNA-PKcs- and ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). Previous studies, showing Ku-independent Artemis activity, included excess 35-bp blunt-ended DNA in Artemis nuclease reactions to ensure robust activation of DNA-PKcs and phosphorylation of Artemis (3Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). However, in reactions containing soluble recombinant Artemis, addition of the same 35-bp duplex did not stimulate cleavage, even in the absence of Ku (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 7 and 9). Moreover, in reactions containing Ku, the addition of excess 35-bp duplex reduced Artemis-mediated cleavage of the radiolabeled substrate 3-fold (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 8 and 10; see supplemental Fig. 2). A titration of 35-bp duplex into Artemis nuclease reactions containing Ku clearly showed that there was no stimulatory effect at any concentration (Fig. 2C). Thus, the labeled substrate, at a concentration of ∼5 nm, appears to be sufficient to promote activation of DNA-PK and Artemis. Quantification of triplicate experiments with 240 nm Artemis revealed that Ku stimulated overall cleavage by ∼2-fold at 13 nm and 4-fold 65 nm (Fig. 2D). Most notably, this stimulatory effect was almost completely abolished by the presence of excess DNA ends (Fig. 2D), thus explaining the lack of stimulation by Ku in previous work where excess 35-bp duplex was routinely added to Artemis reactions (3Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Titrations with limiting Artemis revealed that Ku stimulated Artemis activity over a wide range of Artemis concentrations (Fig. 2E). In the presence of Ku, the concentration of Artemis required for a given level of cleavage was 10-fold lower than in its absence. To generate substrates more similar to DSBs produced in vivo (i.e. having very long duplex regions and short overhangs), a3′-resected plasmid with an 11-base 5′ overhang was prepared, to which various 5′-labeled oligomers were ligated. Processing of 3′ overhanging termini on these substrates was analyzed by cutting the treated plasmid with TaqI or AvaI to release the labeled oligomer from the end, as described previously (19Lee J.W. Blanco L. Zhou T. Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wang Z. Povirk L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Consistent with data obtained using the oligomeric substrates, assays with a plasmid bearing a 13-base overhang revealed a significant stimulatory effect of Ku on Artemis nuclease activity over a range of Artemis concentrations (Fig. 2F), with a maximum stimulation of 6-fold when Artemis was limiting (1–10 nm). Titrations with limiting DNA-PKcs revealed that Ku stimulation of Artemis is DNA-PKcs concentration-dependent and that optimal nuclease activity required DNA-PKcs concentrations that approach molar equivalence with Artemis (Fig. 2G). Taken together, these data are most consistent with Ku stimulating Artemis activity through enhancing assembly or recruitment of Artemis/DNA-PKcs to DNA termini, thereby increasing nuclease activity. Ku-dependent Serial Cleavage of 3′ Overhangs—To examine in more detail the effect of Ku on the kinetics and specificity of cleavage, the same plasmid substrate used above was treated with Artemis in the presence or absence of Ku for various times, and the percentage of uncleaved substrate as well as of individual cleavage products was quantified (Fig. 3). Quantification of uncleaved substrate as a function of time reveals that the rate of Artemis/DNA-PKcs-mediated cleavage was three times faster in the presence of Ku than in its absence (Fig. 3A). As expected, bands corresponding to the trimmed overhangs were only detected when the internally labeled DNA end was released as an oligomer by treatment with TaqI, and nuclease activity was ATP-, DNA-PKcs-, and Artemis-dependent (Fig. 3B). Notably, the addition of Ku also markedly altered the digestion pattern for the 3′ overhang (Fig. 3B). In the absence of Ku, the predominant cleavage product was a 5-base overhang (40% of total cleavage), with significant amounts of 2–4- and 6-base overhang products also being apparent. In contrast, a 3-base overhang product consistently dominated the products in reactions containing Ku. To investigate further this Ku-induced change in product distribution, reaction products were examined at various reaction times (Fig. 3C). In the presence of Ku, the proportion of 5-base overhang decreased from 56% of total cleavage at 2 min to only 6% at 60 min, whereas the proportion of 3-base overhang increased from 10 to 54%, becoming the dominant product by 60 min. Moreover, the appearance of the 3-base product was concomitant with the decrease in the 5-base product (Fig. 3D). These data are consistent with a two-step reaction, wherein the 5-base product is the substrate for a secondary nuclease cleavage yielding the 3-base product. Notably, in the absence of Ku this crossover pattern was not apparent (Fig. 3E), and the distribution of products was essentially invariant over the course of the reactions. In addition, this same effect was observed in titrations with limiting Ku, namely the appearance of the 3-base product accompanied by the loss of the 5-base product (as well as the 6-base product) as Ku concentrations increased (Fig. 3F). A more detailed curve-fitting analysis indicated that these kinetics could be accurately described by a two-step model, and that although Ku accelerated the initial generation of the 5-base overhang 3-fold, Ku increased the rate of its conversion to 3-base overhang by ∼20-fold (supplemental Fig. 3). 3′-Phosphoglycolate Termini Alter Artemis Nuclease Specificity on Shorter Overhangs—3′-PG blocking groups did not alter Artemis/DNA-PK endonuclease activity when on long 3′ overhangs distal to the cleavage site (Fig. 1). To determine the effect of 3′-PG closer to the site of nuclease activity, plasmid substrates with 3–6-base overhangs, bearing either 3′-PG or 3′-hydroxyl termini, were constructed (Fig. 4A) and subjected to treatment with Artemis/DNA-PK for 2–30 min. For a 6-base 3′-hydroxyl overhang substrate, little if any single-nucleotide trimming was observed; 2-base removal was predominant (60% of cleavage products at 5 min), with some 3- and 4-base removal also being evident (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the 3′-PG substrate showed, in addition to these products, subtle but detectable removal of a single 3′-PG nucleotide (Fig. 4C). However, this 5-base overhang product was evident only at early time points. At later times, the abundance of both the 5-base and 4-base overhangs diminished, with concomitant increases in the 3- and 2-base overhangs (Fig. 4D). These results are consistent with a secondary cleavage that removes two additional bases, as seen above with the 13-base overhang substrate. The analogous hydroxyl-terminated substrate (Fig. 4B) also showed a time-dependent increase in the relative abundance of shorter reaction products, albeit less apparent than with the 3′-PG substrate. This is likely because the initial cleavage reaction proceeded more slowly (see supplemental Fig. 4). The influence of 3′-PG on Artemis nuclease specificity was much more evident on substrate sets with 5- and 4-base overhangs (Fig. 5). For a 5-base 3′-hydroxyl overhang, two-nucleotide trimming was dominant (78% of cleavage products at 5 min), and single-nucleotide trimming was <5%, whereas for the analogous PG-terminated substrate single-nucleotide removal accounted for nearly half (48%) of the total initial cleavage (Fig. 5A). This single-nucleotide removal was 10-fold greater in the presence of Ku than in its absence, reflecting both an overall increase in cleavage and a change in cleavage specificity. The resulting 4-base overhang reached"

In cultured neurons, inhibition of protein phosphatases converted phosho-Ser8 p35 to dual phospho-Ser8/Thr138 p35 and conferred resistance to calpain cleavage.

These results suggest phosphorylation of Thr138 predominantly defines the susceptibility of p35 to calpain-dependent cleavage and that dephosphorylation of this site is a critical determinant of Cdk5-p25-induced cell death associated with neurodegeneration. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) 2The abbreviation used is: Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5. 2The abbreviation used is: Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5. is a unique member of the Cdk family. Its activity in postmitotic neurons is completely dependent upon association with one of two neuronal specific activators, p35 or p39. Cdk5/p35 is involved in a panoply of processes critical to central nervous system function both during development and throughout maturity including neuronal migration during corticogenesis, neurite outgrowth, regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle, neurotransmitter release, and postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor regulation and signaling (1Tang D.

The mechanisms by which Cdk5 activity is normally regulated remains to be fully delineated. Furthermore, because aberrant Cdk5 activity has been implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases (4Shelton S.B. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 5Tsai L.H. Lee M.S. Cruz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), identifying the biochemical mechanisms contributing to deregulation of Cdk5 is of substantial biomedical relevance. Deregulation of Cdk5 results from removal of the first 98 amino acids of p35 by the Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, calpain, leaving Cdk5 associated with the N-terminal truncated form p25. Cleavage of p35 to p25 changes the subcellular distribution of active Cdk5 from membranes to the cytosolic fraction (6Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H.

Cdk5/p25 has also been implicated in ischemia-induced neuronal loss in the hippocampus via increased phosphorylation of the NR2A subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (12Wang J. Liu S.

Ca2-dependent activation of the cytoplasmic protease calpain is involved in apoptotic and necrotic cell death (18Suzuki K. Hata S. Kawabata Y. Sorimachi H.

Calpain generally recognizes motifs between conformational domains and cleaves substrate proteins in a limited manner, although the physiological function of calpain activity remains unclear. In some cases calpain cleavage is suspected to be a signaling process. Calpain-mediated cleavage of many proteins including neurofilament proteins (19Pant H.C. Biochem.

However, how such signaling works and the mechanisms of phosphorylation-dependent inhibition are unknown. Previously we demonstrated that Cdk5 phosphorylated p35, that p35 occurred as a phosphoprotein in neurons, and that the phosphorylation state of p35 affected its susceptibility to calpain cleavage (23Saito T. Onuki R. Fujita Y. Kusakawa G. Ishiguro K. Bibb J.A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospho-p35 predominates in fetal rat brain and is resistant to the cleavage by calpain, whereas unphosphorylated p35 present during adulthood is more vulnerable to calpain-dependent cleavage. Here we report that Ser8 and Thr138 of p35 serve as the sites of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation. Furthermore, phosphorylation at these sites reduces the susceptibility of p35 to calpain cleavage. Moreover, specific dephosphorylation of Thr138 increases the susceptibility of p35 to the cleavage by calpain in adult rat brains, suggesting that the phosphorylation of this site is a particularly critical determinant of Cdk5-dependent neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative diseases.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody were from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system was from Amersham Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan) and the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate system was from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Plasmid Construction of Mutant p35—The Ala mutants at Ser8, Thr138, Ser170, or Thr197 (S8A, T138A, S170A, or T197A) were generated using p35 as a template by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used were 5′-GTGCTGTCCCTGGCTCCCAGCTACC-3′ and 5′-GGTAGCTGGGAGCCAGGGACAGCAC-3′ for S8A, 5′-TCCGCAGGGGCGCCCAAACGGGTCAT-3′ and 5′-ATGACCCGTTTGGGCGCCCCTGCGGA-3′ for T138A, 5′-CTGAAGCACCTGGCCCCCACGGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCCGTGGGGGCCAGGTGCTTCAG-3′ for S170A, and 5′-GGCTTCATCGCGCCGGCCAACGTGGT-3′ and 5′-ACCACGTTGGCCGGCGCGATGAAGCC-3′ for T197A.

Expression and Metabolic Phosphorylation of p35 in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of Cdk5 and p35 was performed by the Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For metabolic phosphorylation of p35, transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 3.7 MBq of [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. In some cases, roscovitine (50 μm) was added to inhibit Cdk5 activity 2 h before metabolic labeling. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were suspended in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) containing 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Pefabloc SC (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and lysed by freezing and thawing. The extract was obtained as a supernatant of centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min. p35 was isolated from the extract by immunoprecipitation with C19 anti-p35 antibody. 32P incorporation into p35 was detected by a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) after SDS-PAGE. Neuronal Culture, Metabolic Phosphorylation of p35, and Adenoviral Expression of p35—Cerebral cortical neurons were prepared from rat brains at embryonic day 17 as described previously (28Tokuoka H. Saito T. Yorifuji H. Wei F. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1059-1068PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal cultures were used 7 days after plating. In some experiments, 0.1 μm okadaic acid was added to the culture medium for the final 2 h of a 4-h labeling period. MG132 (50 μm) was also added 1 h before the addition of okadaic acid to suppress proteosome-dependent degradation of p35. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, neurons were lysed with RIPA buffer. The supernatant of centrifugation at 17,000 × g was immunoprecipitated with C19 and phosphorylation of p35 was detected as described above. Adenoviral expression vectors encoding p35 or p354A were infected into rat primary cortical neurons cultured for 5 days in vitro. Two days after infection, neurons were treated with 5 μm Ca2+ ionophore A23187 for 1 h, and the cleavage of p35 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-p35 antibody (C19). Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Map Analysis—Metabolically phosphorylated p35 was digested with 50 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) in 10 mm (NH4)2CO3 overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptides were subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis using a thin layer cellulose (TLC) plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (29Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A.

Preparation of Antibodies against Phosphorylated Ser8 (Anti-Ser(P)8) and Thr138 (Anti-Thr(P)138) of p35—Non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides, “LSLSPSYRKRC” and “LSLpSPSYRKRC” for anti-Ser(P)8, and “ITSAGTPKRVIRC” and “ITSAGpTPKRVIRC” for anti-Thr(P)138, were chemically synthesized, and the phosphorylated peptides, LSLpSPSYRKRC and ITSAGpTPKRVIRC, were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the cysteine residue attached to the C terminus by AnyGen (Kwang-ju, Korea). Anti-Ser(P)8 or anti-Thr(P)138 antibody generated by immunizing rabbits was affinity purified by peptide columns, the non-phosphorylated peptide negatively and the phosphorylated peptide positively using SulfoLink (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression of Cdk5-p35 in COS-7 Cells, Cleavage of p35 to p25 by Calpain, and Dephosphorylation of p35—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin. Transfection of Cdk5, p35, μ-calpain, and the small subunit of calpain was performed by the Polyfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain in COS-7 cells was induced by treatment of COS-7 cells with 10 μm ionomycin at 37 °C for 30 min. To increase the phosphorylation status of p35, COS-7 cells were treated with 0.1 μm okadaic acid for 3 h before treatment with ionomycin. For inhibiting the Cdk5 activity, cells were treated with 50 μm roscovitine for 2 h before treatment with ionomycin. For inhibiting the calpain activity, cells were treated with 10 μm calpain inhibitor IV for 2 h before treatment with ionomycin. To increase the calpain activity, μ-calpain and the small subunit of calpain were coexpressed in COS-7 cells with Cdk5 and p35. Dephosphorylation of p35 expressed in HEK293 cells was performed in the cell extract (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) by incubation with bacterial alkaline phosphatase (20 unit/ml, Wako, Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Preparation of the rat brain extracts and immunoprecipitation of Cdk5-p35 were done as described previously (23Saito T. Onuki R. Fujita Y.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1059-1068PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedgord, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO). The reactions were detected using an ECL system for horseradish peroxidase or the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate system for alkaline phosphatase and quantified by densitometry using NIH Image software. All experiments in this study were performed more than three times with similar results and representative results are shown in the figures. p35 Is Phosphorylated at Ser8 and Thr138 by Cdk5—Substantial evidence has been presented to suggest that Cdk5 autophosphorylates its activator p35 in vitro and in cultured cells (24Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 30Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

Commun. 1998; 252: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To further investigate this autophosphorylation, we expressed both Cdk5 and p35 in HEK293 cells and cultured them with [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h in the absence or presence of the Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine. 32P incorporation was readily detected in p35 immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts by autoradiography (Fig. 1A). The highest levels of radiolabeled p35 were immunoprecipitated from cells cotransfected with Cdk5 (Fig. 1A, lane 4), but not with kinase-dead Cdk5 (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Furthermore, a large portion of the radioactivity associated with p35 could be attenuated by treating the cells with roscovitine (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Interestingly radiolabeled p35 was detected in cells transfected with p35 alone (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Moreover, treatment of cells transfected with p35 alone with roscovitine reduced radiolabeled p35 to almost undetectable levels (Fig. 1A, lane 3), suggesting that the endogenous Cdk5 was responsible for phosphorylation of p35 in the absence of exogenous Cdk5. Cdk5 is a proline-directed protein kinase and exhibits the requirement of Pro following the substrate Ser/Thr sites, with a preference for the consensus motif Ser/Thr-Pro-X-His/Lys/Arg. There are only four Ser/Thr-Pro sites, Ser8, Thr138, Ser170, and Thr197, within the primary sequence of p35 (Fig. 1B). Only Thr138 is encompassed within a consensus motif sequence (138TPKR), although Ser8 is also followed by two positively charged amino acid residues (8SPSYRK). Based on these observations, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace Ser8 or Thr138 with Ala residues and the resulting plasmid was used together with one encoding Cdk5 to cotransfect HEK293 cell cultures. Mutation of Ser8 or Thr138 resulted in a large loss in radiolabel associated with immunoprecipitated p35 (data not shown). To further characterize the phosphorylation of p35, radiolabeled protein immunoprecipitated from cotransfected cells was next analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping after trypsin digestion (Fig. 1C). Two radioactive spots representing two tryptic phosphopeptides were derived from wild-type p35. The S8A mutation resulted in disappearance of one of these phosphopeptides (spot 1), whereas the T138A mutation caused lose of the other phosphopeptide (spot 2). Taken together, these data indicate that p35 is phosphorylated by Cdk5 in transfected HEK293 cell cultures at two proline-directed sites, Ser8 and Thr138. Phosphorylation at Ser8 or Thr138 in p35 Suppresses the Calpain-dependent Cleavage of p35 to p25—Previously, we presented data suggesting that Cdk5-dependent autophosphorylation of p35 affected its susceptibility to cleavage by calpain (23Saito T. Onuki R. Fujita Y. Kusakawa G. Ishiguro K. Bibb J.A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the potential role of p35 phosphorylation in controlling calpain cleavage, p35 and Cdk5 were next exogenously expressed in COS-7 cells. In preliminary analyses, cotransfected COS-7 cells were treated with various concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophores, A23187 or ionomycin, or an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ pumps, thapsigargin. For each of these treatments, a small but distinct amount of p25 was found to be produced by immunoblotting the cell lysates (data not shown). However, the largest amount of p35 cleavage was consistently derived using ionomycin. Therefore, 10 μm ionomycin was selected as the method of choice for calpain activation in this paradigm. A time course for p25 generation in COS-7 cells treated with 10 μm ionomycin is shown in Fig. 2A. After 30 min of ionomycin treatment, p25 can be clearly observed, with levels increasing thereafter until 24 h with mild attenuation of p25 levels at 3 h. Based on these results, the 30-min time point with 10 μm ionomycin was chosen for all subsequent experiments as the minimal treatment necessary to induce the cleavage of p35 to p25. To demonstrate that p25 production in response to ionomycin was indeed calpain-dependent, cells were either left untreated or treated with ionomycin in the absence or presence of 10 μm calpain inhibitor IV (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Treatment of cells with the calpain inhibitor resulted in a reduction in p25 levels both in the absence and presence of ionomycin. Furthermore, p35 cleavage was increased substantially by coexpression of μ-calpain (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). This effect corresponded to increased active μ-calpain levels as assessed in immunoblots using an antibody to this cleaved form of the protease (27Zhang J. Miyamoto K. Hashioka S. Hao H.P. Murao K. Saido T. Nakanishi H. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 142: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the predominant form of endogenous calpain in COS-7 cells is m-calpain, active μ-calpain was detected only in cultures transfected with the corresponding plasmid encoding μ-calpain (Fig. 2B, second panel). Calpain activity was also assessed by immunoblot analysis of calpain-dependent cleavage of spectrin, a major component of the neuronal cytoskeleton (26Takano J. Tomioka M. Tsubuki S. Higuchi M. Iwata N. Itohara S. Maki M. Saido T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16175-16184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Spectrin cleavage closely mirrored p25 production in response to ionomycin and μ-calpain expression and was similarly blocked by calpain inhibition (Fig. 2B, third panel). These results demonstrate that p25 generation is tightly coupled to calpain activity. Having established optimal conditions for p25 generation and demonstrated calpain dependence, the effect of phosphorylation on the cleavage of p35 was next assessed (Fig. 3A). Treatment of COS-7 cells expressing p35 and Cdk5 with ionomycin resulted in increased p25 levels, as observed earlier. Pretreatment with roscovitine resulted in increased basal levels of p25, as well as the levels achieved in response to ionomycin (Fig. 3A, compare lane 3 with lane 1 and lane 4 with lane 2). Furthermore, increased basal and ionomycin-induced levels were observed in cells transfected with p35 alone in comparison to those expressing both exogenous Cdk5 and p35. These results further confirm that calpain-dependent cleavage of p35 is inhibited via autophosphorylation by Cdk5. To more specifically investigate the regulation of calpain cleavage of p35 by Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of Ser8 and Thr138, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was again taken (Fig. 3B). The ability of ionomycin to induce p25 generation was substantially enhanced by the 2A (Ser8 and Thr138 to Ala) double mutation. On the other hand, the 2E (Ser8 and Thr138 to Glu) phosphomimetic double mutation substantially attenuated this effect. These observations indicate that the ability of Cdk5-dependent autophosphorylation to protect p35 from calpain cleavage occurs through phosphorylation of Ser8 and/or Thr138. Phosphorylation-dependent cleavage was also examined in neurons. p35 or p354A was expressed in primary cultured neurons and the cleavage was compared by immunoblotting with C19 after Ca2+ ionophore A23187 treatment for 1 h. Upper bands of p35 and p25 exogenously expressed p35 species with FLAG tag at the C-terminal. p354A was cleaved more than the wild type of p35 (compare p25-F in lanes 4 and 6 of Fig. 3C). Exogenously expressed p35 appeared to be more resistant to calpain cleavage than endogenous p35 by unknown reasons. The individual contribution of each of these two sites to this regulatory mechanism was further evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, mutation of either Ser8 or Thr138 to Ala enhanced p25 generation in response to ionomycin treatment of COS7 cells cotransfected with Cdk5 and each of the respective forms of p35, suggesting phosphorylation of both of these sites contributes to protection of p35 from calpain cleavage. Phosphorylation at Ser8 and Thr138 of p35 in Cultured Cortical Neurons and Rat Brains—To further assess the physiological role of Cdk5-depedent phosphorylation of these two sites in regulating the cleavage of p35 to p25, the phosphorylation state of Ser8 and Thr138 was evaluated in cultured cortical neurons and intact brain tissue. Phosphorylation of p35 was first examined in cultured cortical neurons metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate by two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analyses (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, maps of radiolabeled p35 immunoprecipitated from cultured neurons produced a single major spot that corresponded to the phosphopeptide (spot 1 of Fig. 1C) associated with phospho-Ser8.

Immunoprecipitation and blue native electrophoresis showed that F1F0-ATP synthase assembles correctly in homoplasmic mutant mitochondria. The mutants exhibited a tendency to have an increased sensitivity to subsaturating amounts of oligomycin; this provided further evidence for complete assembly and tight coupling between the F1 and F0 sectors. Furthermore, human ATP synthase dimers and higher homo-oligomers were observed for the first time, and it was demonstrated that the mutant enzymes retain enough structural integrity to oligomerize. A reproducible increase in the proportion of oligomeric-to-monomeric enzyme was found for the T8993G mutant suggesting that F1F0 oligomerization is regulated in vivo and that it can be modified in pathological conditions. Despite correct assembly, the T8993G mutation produced a 60% inhibition in ATP synthesis turnover. In vitro denaturing conditions showed F1F0 instability conferred by the mutations, although this instability did not produce enzyme disassembly in the conditions used for determination of ATP synthesis. Taken together, the data show that the primary molecular pathogenic mechanism of these deleterious human mitochondrial mutations is functional inhibition in a correctly assembled ATP synthase.

Structural instability may play a role in the progression of the disease under potentially denaturing conditions, as discussed. The F1F0-ATP synthase is a ubiquitous enzyme that works as a rotary motor, harnessing the electrochemical proton gradients to carry out ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi. It is composed of a membrane-embedded proton-translocating sector (F0), coupled to a soluble sector (F1) that contains catalytic sites for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. Several of the most deleterious human mitochondrial diseases, such as the maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS) 3The abbreviations used are: MILS, maternally inherited Leigh syndrome; BN-PAGE, blue native-PAGE; IF1, F1-ATPase inhibitor protein; NARP, neurogenic ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa; OSCP, oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; SMP, submitochondrial particles; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. 3The abbreviations used are: MILS, maternally inherited Leigh syndrome; BN-PAGE, blue native-PAGE; IF1, F1-ATPase inhibitor protein; NARP, neurogenic ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa; OSCP, oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; SMP, submitochondrial particles; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.

The same single point mutation can produce either MILS or NARP, depending on the mtDNA mutation load (1Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaum A. Clarke J.T. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N.

The mtDNA mutations most frequently associated with NARP or MILS are T8993G, T8993C, T9176G, and T9176C, which replace the conserved leucine residues at positions 156 or 217 of subunit 6 by arginine or proline, respectively (6Vazquez-Memije M.E.

These functional defects could be caused either by impairment of enzyme assembly or by proton conduction blockade in a completely assembled enzyme. In both scenarios, there would be fewer functional F0 sectors, and thus ATP synthesis inhibition would occur. Topology models indicate that NARP/MILS mutations cluster in the most conserved region of human subunit 6 (6Vazquez-Memije M.E. García J.J. Garcia J.J.

The core of this conserved region is an essential arginine residue (Arg-159 in the human enzyme) that undergoes a sequential interaction with the essential carboxyl in each c subunit during enzyme rotation and proton translocation (24Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, NARP/MILS mutations could hinder proton translocation by charge redistributions or subtle structural changes in the interface of subunit 6 and the barrel of c subunits (7Schon E.A. Santra S.

On the other hand, the transmembrane location of NARP/MILS mutations may induce subunit mis-folding and interfere with the assembly of the complete F1F0. In this scenario soluble F1 and incomplete F1F0 complexes would be found in mitochondria, as reported for mtDNA-less Rho0 cells lacking ATP6 and ATP8 (9Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H.

Hofmann S. Brandt U. Schagger H. Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, a normal content of F1F0 subunits, including subunit 6, was found in the enzyme isolated from patient cultured fibroblasts (9Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To establish the molecular mechanism through which NARP/MILS mutations induce disease, it is crucial to determine unambiguously whether these point mutations impair F1F0 assembly. Most of the previous structural studies have been done with heteroplasmic cells, where wild type and mutant ATP6 genes are co-expressed. To avoid wild type complementation in ATP synthase assembly or function, we used homoplasmic T8993G and T8993C cultured human cells to assess conclusively the effect of these mutations on the assembly of the ATP synthase. A novel immunoprecipitation procedure (28Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. J. Biol.

In parallel, blue native electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Here we demonstrate that ATP6 mutations do not impair dimerization and homo-oligomerization of the human F1F0. Functional and instability defects produced in the whole F1F0 by these mutations are assessed and discussed. Cell Cultures—T8993G and T8993C patient skin fibroblasts were kindly provided by Professor Brian H. Robinson (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Control human MRC5 fibroblasts were purchased from In Vitro S.A. Homoplasmic T8993G cybrids (produced by the fusion of enucleated patient skin fibroblasts with Rho0 143B/TK– osteosarcoma cells) and control Rho+ 143B/TK– osteosarcoma cells were derived from cell cultures at the laboratory of Prof. Rosalba Carrozzo, as described in Ref. 20Carrozzo R.

Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies, 12F4AD8, anti-α, anti-OSCP, and anti-IF1, were from Mitosciences and were used according to the manufacturer. DNA Isolation, PCR, and RFLP—Total DNA was isolated from 1 × 106 cells. A segment of the ATP6 gene was amplified by PCR; products were digested with the endonuclease MspI (Promega) and separated in PAGE for RFLP analysis.

Where indicated, prior to solubilization, human mitochondrial membranes were obtained by subjecting mitochondria to an osmotic shock, as described previously (9Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H.

Digitonin or n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma) was used for mitochondrial protein extraction. Titration curves were carried out to establish the appropriate detergent amounts to extract intact F1F0 complexes in its monomeric and oligomeric forms. ATPase activity was developed in native gels as described previously (34Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Single native lanes were submitted to second dimension SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies as described previously (35Bravo C. Minauro-Sanmiguel F.

ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis Assays—Spectrophotometric measurements of ATP synthesis rates coupled to NADP+ reduction were carried out at 340 nm with 30 μg of isolated mitochondria as described (36Trautschold I.L.W. Schweitzer G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1995Google Scholar), including 100 μm diadenosine pentaphosphate to inhibit adenylate kinase activity. Alternatively (see Fig. 5A), the phosphorylation of ADP by inorganic phosphate (32Pi) was used to determine ATP synthesis (8Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. DeVivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis rates were measured spectrophotometrically with mitochondrial membranes obtained by osmotic shock, using an ATP-regenerating system, as described before (9Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Where indicated, prior to measurements, mitochondrial membranes were resuspended in “activation conditions” consisting of 125 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated at the indicated times at 40 °C to release the inhibitory protein (IF1). Control “nonactivation conditions” were 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and protease inhibitors (as above). To verify IF1 release, membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, and supernatants were assayed by Western blot for the presence of IF1. ATP hydrolysis carried out by SMP was measured by the colorimetric determination of Pi released from ATP, as reported (8Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. DeVivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Other Methods—Protein was measured by a modified Lowry method (see Ref. 37Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Densitometry analyses were carried out with Alpha-DigiDoc computer software coupled to a Kodak DC290 digital camera. T8993G Mutation Loads—We studied two human cell cultures harboring the T8993G mutation, namely skin fibroblasts and cybrids, with their respective controls. The T8993G mutant mtDNA load was determined in each cell culture by RFLP with the endonuclease MspI on a 764-bp ATP6 gene fragment. The wild type restriction pattern was absent from mutant samples (<1% of total DNA, by densitometry analysis), regardless of the amount of genomic DNA used for amplification (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, we confirmed that the cells used in this study are homoplasmic for the T8993G mutation. Homoplasmic T8993G Mutants Show Decreased ATP Synthesis—Oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthesis rates of homoplasmic T8993G mitochondria decreased to 40% of their respective controls (Fig. 1, A and B). This further confirms the homoplasmicity of the studied samples, because only the homoplasmic T8993G mutation results in 60% inhibition of ATP synthesis rates (9Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Small amounts of wild type mtDNA complement substantially the ATP synthase activity; accordingly, mitochondria with 91% mutant load have only a 25% ATP synthesis inhibition (9Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Osteosarcoma mitochondria had 30% higher synthesis rates than those obtained from fibroblasts, probably because of a better yield of coupled mitochondrial membranes. However, the ATP synthesis rates of the four cell types showed a similar inhibition when incubated with saturating concentrations of oligomycin (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunoprecipitation of the Human F1F0 Complex from Homoplasmic Control and T8993G (L156R) Mitochondria—Aggeler et al. (28Aggeler R. Coons J. Taylor S.W. Ghosh S.S. Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A.

Because the antibody recognizes the native F1 portion, 4J. J. García, unpublished observations. enzyme assembly can be tested with this procedure, i.e. in the properly assembled F1F0 complex, F0 subunits will co-immunoprecipitate with the F1 portion. By SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitated samples and band densitometry analyses, it was possible to estimate the ratio of F0 to F1 subunits. Subunit 6 was present at similar intensity ratios in the immunoprecipitated F1F0 complexes from control and mutant mitochondria (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, assembly of the human F1F0-ATP synthase was not prevented by the L156R mutation, neither in fibroblasts (Fig. 2A) nor in cybrids (Fig. 2B). In both cell types, the protein yields of immunoprecipitated F1F0 were similar between control and mutant mitochondria. These results are consistent with those previously obtained with the human ATP synthase isolated by affinity chromatography from heteroplasmic (91%) T8993G mitochondria (9Garcia J.J. Ogilvie I. Robinson B.H. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As in that study, the F1F0 subunits resolved here were α, β, γ, b, OSCP, d, and subunit 6; however, small subunits of F1 (ϵ, IF1) and F0 (e, f, g, F6, A6L, and c) were not resolved. For the gel shown in Fig. 2B, mitochondrial membranes were obtained by osmotic shock prior to solubilization and immunoprecipitation. This improved the purity of the enzyme, and it was useful to analyze the amount of F1 subunits released from mitochondria by osmotic shock as markers of ATP synthase disassembly. The content of subunits α, OSCP, and IF1 was similar in the supernatants of shocked control and mutant mitochondria, as shown by Western blot (supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, no differences in subunit content or intensity ratios were found between F1F0 immunoprecipitated from whole or osmotic-shocked mitochondria (not shown). Taken together, these results confirm that the mutant subunit 6 incorporates properly into the fully assembled human F1F0-ATP synthase. Native Electrophoresis of Control, T8993G, and T8993C Mitochondria—We used blue native-PAGE to compare the amounts of native monomeric and oligomeric F1F0 extracted from control and mutant mitochondria, as an alternative method to check for assembly defects caused by subunit 6 mutations. To compare the effects of leucine 156 substitutions by arginine or proline, we included T8993G (L156R) and T8993C (L156P) human fibroblast mitochondria. Fig. 3, A and B, shows the bands corresponding to the native oxidative-phosphorylation complexes I, III, IV and V, obtained from dodecyl maltoside mitochondrial extracts. The band containing F1F0 (complex V) was assigned by in-gel development of ATPase activity and by the subunit pattern found in second dimension SDS-PAGE (not shown). The complete monomeric F1F0 was present in similar amounts in control and mutant mitochondria (both L156R and L156P) as confirmed by densitometry ratios of complex V (ATP synthase) and complex III (dimeric bc1) (Fig. 3, A and B). To detect small amounts of incomplete F1F0 or soluble F1 as markers of enzyme disassembly, individual BN-PAGE lanes were submitted to second dimension SDS-PAGE and anti-α Western blotting. In control (Fig. 3C) as well as in L156R (Fig. 3D) mitochondria, α subunits were detected only in two positions of the blot, corresponding to the BN-PAGE migration of monomeric F1F0 and F1, respectively. Equivalent results were obtained for L156P mutants (not shown). These experiments demonstrated that small quantities of F1 are detectable in human mitochondrial extracts, but these are not increased in mutant samples as compared with controls. Taken together the data confirm that L156R and L156P NARP/MILS mutations do not impair monomeric F1F0 assembly. Mitochondrial F1F0 can further assemble into dimers (30Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W.

Commun. 2005; 329: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that control cristae morphology. Therefore, to explore F1F0 oligomerization in the L156R/L156P human mutants, mitochondrial digitonin extracts were subjected to BN-PAGE, followed by second dimension SDS-PAGE and α subunit immunodetection. The α subunits were found at the positions corresponding to the migration of F1F0 supercomplexes (Vn) (31Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) and monomeric F1F0 (V) in BN-PAGE (Fig. 4, A–E). The identity of the supercomplexes as ATP synthase homo-oligomers was corroborated by parallel analyses of bovine heart mitochondria (not shown). From the several oligomeric forms of the human ATP synthase detected, the most abundant had an apparent mass of 1400 kDa and migrated between the monomeric complex I (1000 kDa) and the supercomplex composed by I + III2 (1500 kDa), thus corresponding to dimeric F1F0. This dimer dissociated progressively as the digitonin concentration was raised in parallel to an enrichment of monomeric F1F0 (Fig. 4, A–E). On the other hand, larger F1F0 oligomers showed a lower mobility than the I + III2 supercomplex (see far left side of Fig. 4, A–C) and therefore are likely composed by ATP synthase trimers and/or tetramers. However, formation of ATP synthase hetero-oligomers, i.e. associations with other mitochondrial proteins such as adenine nucleotide and Pi carriers as in the ATP synthasome (39Ko Y.H. Delannoy M.

In addition to stabilization of acetylated histones, HDAC inhibitors stabilize the acetylation of a number of transcription factors, including p53. This study investigates the action of two HDAC inhibitors, CG-1521 and trichostatin A, which stabilize Ac-Lys-373 p53 and Ac-Lys-382 p53, respectively, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Real-time PCR demonstrates that CG-1521 induces p21 transcription whereas trichostatin A does not alter the steady state level of p21 mRNA.

These data highlight the profound effects of post-translational modification, including acetylation, on the function of p53.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDI, HDAC inhibitor; TSA, trichostatin A; p53RE, p53 response element; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; POL II, polymerase II; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; CBP, CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein. are a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes that act in concert with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to modulate the acetylation status of histones and a number of other regulatory and structural proteins. In humans at least 14 HDACs have been identified that can be divided into two or three classes based on phylogenetic analysis (1.Gregoretti I.V. Lee Y.M. Goodson H.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). These proteins have been localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that they have diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates. HDAC inhibitors (HDI) have shown considerable promise as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and a number of other diseases. The most studied HDIs, such as sodium butyrate, trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, valproic acid, and trapoxins, have divergent structures, and to date there is little information regarding the structure-function relationship of HDIs, the specificity of the HDIs for individual HDACs, or the biological processes these compounds affect, even though some of these compounds are in phase I and II clinical trials (2.Piekarz R. Bates S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 2289-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The efficacy of individual HDIs is likely to be dependent on which HDACs are expressed in the target tissue and the selectivity of the inhibitors for the specific HDACs present in the cell. The p53 tumor suppressor exerts antiproliferative effects, including growth arrest and apoptosis, in response to various types of stress (3.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). Mutations within the p53 gene have been documented in more than half of all human tumors, and even in cells that retain wild-type p53 other defects in the p53 pathway play an important role in tumorigenesis (4.Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Most of the tumor-suppressive functions of p53 have been attributed to the ability of the protein to act as a transcriptional modulator of downstream target genes, particularly those involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (5.Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 6.Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism by which p53 is activated by cellular stress is not fully understood. It is generally accepted that post-translational modifications of p53, including phosphorylation and acetylation, play important roles in the stabilization and activation of p53 (7.Appella E. Anderson C.W. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2000; 48: 227-245PubMed Google Scholar). Several lysine (Lys) residues in the C-terminal domain of p53 can be acetylated, including Lys-320, Lys-373, and Lys-382 (8.Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 9.Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Because these sites are also the target for mdm2-mediated ubiquitination, acetylation of these sites leads to an increase in the steady state level of p53. Thus HDIs that prevent the deacetylation of the protein effectively stabilize the acetylated isoforms of p53 by blocking mdm2-mediated ubiquitination (10.Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition to increasing the steady state level of the p53, acetylation stimulates the sequence-specific binding of p53 and its transcriptional activation of downstream target genes such as p21 (11.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 12.Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar); however, the identities of the specific HATs and HDAC enzymes that modulate the acetylation status of p53 protein and the functions of the acetylated isoforms in transcriptional regulation are still largely unknown. We have previously shown that two HDIs, CG-1521 (7-phenyl-2,4,6-hepta-trienoic hydroxamic acid) and TSA, stabilize acetylation of p53 at Lys-373 and Lys-382, respectively, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In these cells, acetylation of Lys-373 p53 correlates with both cell cycle arrest and cell death, whereas acetylation of Lys-382 p53 only correlates with cell cycle arrest (13.Roy S. Packman K. Jeffrey R. Tenniswood M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This suggests that the selective stabilization of the acetylated isoforms by individual HDIs modulates the expression of different subsets of genes. In this report we show that site-specific stabilization of acetylated p53 results in the formation of mutually exclusive transcriptional complexes that are differentially recruited to the p53 response elements (p53REs) in the promoter of the p21 gene, leading to profoundly different effects on the assembly of the basal transcriptional apparatus. These data provide a mechanistic explanation for the selective effects of these two HDIs and suggest that the design of selective HDIs will provide exceptional opportunities for tailored therapies based on the knowledge of which HDACs are active in target cells. Cell Culture−LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas, Fort Collins, CO). Cells were routinely passaged every 3–4 days. Drug Treatments−LNCaP cells were treated with 7.5 μm CG-1521 (Errant Gene Therapeutics, LLC, Chicago, IL) or 5 μm TSA (T8552; Sigma) dissolved in Me2SO. Nuclear Fractionation−Cells were scraped, pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C, resuspended in ice-cold wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and pelleted at 1500 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended with three volumes of Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and 20 mm NaF) and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 1500 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in Buffer A, sonicated for 20 s, and stored at -20 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay−Co-immunoprecipitation of Ac-Lys-373 p53 and Ac-Lys-382 p53 was performed with nuclear fraction of LNCaP cells treated with 7.5 μm CG-1521 and 5 μm TSA (standardized in our previous work) (13.Roy S. Packman K. Jeffrey R. Tenniswood M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) for 8 h separately and in combination, along with untreated nuclear fractions using the ProFound™ mammalian co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce Biotech). Western Blot Analysis−20 μl of the eluant from the co-immunoprecipitation assay were solubilized in loading buffer containing 5% 1 m dithiothreitol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Transfer of proteins was confirmed by Ponceau-S staining (BDH, Dorset, England). Immunoblots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-Ac-Lys-373 p53 (06-916; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-Ac-Lys-382 p53 (01-010-179M; American Proteomics, Carlsbad, CA), mouse anti-androgen receptor (Clone G122-25, 554224; BD Biosciences), mouse anti-acetyl-lysine (Clone 4G12, 05-515: Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-p300 (C-20, SC-585; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-CBP (C-1, SC-7300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Brm (N-19, SC-6450; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-BRG1 (H-88, SC-10768; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-HNF-3α/β (Foxa1) (C-20, SC-6553; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Foxm1 (C-20, SC-26688; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Pol II (C-18, SC-5943; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-TFIIH p62 (Q-19, SC-292; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-Ran (C-20, SC-1156; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in blocking solution (5% milk in 0.05% phosphate-buffered saline-Tween). Specific antibody binding was detected by goat anti-mouse (170-6516; Bio-Rad), goat anti-rabbit (170-6515; Bio-Rad), or donkey anti-goat (SC-2020; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:5000 or 1:10000 in blocking solution and autoradiographed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The membranes were stripped with Western Re-Probe™ buffer (786-119; Geno Technology, St. Louis, MO). Reverse Transcription PCR−Total RNA was extracted from LNCaP cells untreated and treated with 7.5 μm CG-1521 or 5 μm TSA for the indicated times (0–72 h) using the Qiagen RNeasy™ Midi kit (75144; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription PCR reactions were performed with 1.5 μg of RNA samples using Taqman® reverse transcription reagents (N8080234; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, 1 h at 37 °C, and 5 min at 95 °C and kept at 4 °C until further analysis. Each sample was replicated three times from three independent sets of RNA preparations. Quantitative Real-time PCR−Real-time SYBR Green probes for p21 gene were designed using Primer Express™ 1.5 (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). p21 forward 5′-CCT AAT CCG CCC ACA GGA A-3′ and p21 reverse 5′-ACC TCC GGG AGA GAG GAA AA-3′. SYBR Green reactions were performed using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (4309155; Applied Biosystems). SYBR Green reactions were performed using an ABI Prism™ 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) and incubated for 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C for 50 cycles. Relative expression levels of p21 in real time were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCT method (14.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124877) Google Scholar) and presented as ratio to the expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Each sample was replicated twice from three independent sets of RNA preparations. Results are tabulated as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Means were considered statistically significant (*) at p < 0.05. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay−LNCaP cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish in 20-mm dishes (08772E; Fisher Scientific), treated with 7.5 μm CG-1521 or 5 μm TSA, and harvested after 8 h of treatment. Cells were scraped from the dish and collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were then cross-linked with a 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of glycine to 125 mm final concentration for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Cells were then pelleted at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay kit (17-295; Upstate Biotechnology). 1.5% of the diluted sample was set aside as the input DNA. For immunoprecipitation, the sample was precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with 75 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose-50% slurry (16-157C; Upstate Biotechnology) before addition of indicated antibodies. The antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation assay were: anti-total p53 mouse monoclonal (05-224; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Ac-Lys-373 p53 rabbit polyclonal (06-916; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Ac-Lys-382 p53 rabbit polyclonal (01-010-179M; American Proteomics, Carlsbad, CA), anti-p300 mouse monoclonal (554215; BD Biosciences), anti-CBP rabbit polyclonal (SC-369; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 mouse monoclonal (05-614; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-HDAC2 rabbit polyclonal (07-222; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Pol II (H-224) rabbit polyclonal (SC-9001; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TBP mouse monoclonal (AB818; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), or anti-TFIIH (Q-19) rabbit polyclonal (SC-292; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 2 μg of each antibody were added to the reactions and incubated overnight at 4 °C. An isotype control was performed in the presence of the respective IgGs. Collection of the antibody-histone complex was performed by addition of 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose-50% slurry for 1 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads containing the antibody-histone complex were collected by gentle centrifugation (3000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C) and washed several times, and immunocomplexes were eluted twice for 15 min each at room temperature with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. Cross-linking was reversed by addition of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl (20-159; Upstate Biotechnology) to 500 μl of eluates and incubating for 4 h at 65 °C. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and 1 μg of purified DNA was used as a template in PCR reactions using primers for -1.3 kb p53RE, -2.4 kb p53RE, and p21 basal promoter (15.Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1015-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and -5 kb control region in the p21 promoter (16.Saramaki A. Banwell C.M. Campbell M.J. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (supplemental data). All reactions were incubated initially for 5 min at 95 °C and then for 45 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 61.5 °C (65.5 °C for basal promoter), and 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles, with the final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. Amplification products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide. 1.5% of total input DNA was subjected to PCR (Input). PCR products for -1.3 and -2.4 kb p53REs, -5 kb control region, and p21 basal promoter were 197, 282, 500, and 214 bp, respectively, and were quantified by densitometry using Scion Image software (Scion Corp, Frederick, MD). Percentage of immunoprecipitated DNA was calculated by comparison to input signals and plotted as bar graphs with statistical significance (*) measured at p < 0.01. Data represent the average of three independent sets of experiments. Statistical Analysis−All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was used to assess statistical significance between means. Differences between means were considered significant when p < 0.05 using the Bonferroni post-test. All statistical analyses were performed with the GraphPad Instat software (Intuitive Software for Science, San Diego, CA). Ac-Lys-373 p53 and Ac-Lys-382 Associate with Mutually Exclusive Transcription Factors−Treatment with CG-1521 induces the formation of Ac-Lys-373 p53, whereas treatment with TSA induces Ac-Lys-382. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of p53 after treatment shows that Ac-Lys-373 p53 is also phosphorylated at Ser-15, whereas Ac-Lys382 p53 is not (Fig. 1A). The stabilization of Ac-Lys-373 p53 in response to CG-1521 correlates with the substantial (20-fold) increase in the steady state levels of p21 mRNA, measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 1B), suggesting that CG-1521 up-regulates p53-mediated p21 transcription. In marked contrast TSA does not alter the steady state level of p21 mRNA at any time point, suggesting that the post-translational modifications induced by these HDIs have very different effects on the transcriptional activity of p53. Co-immunoprecipitation using site-specific antibodies demonstrates that treatment with CG-1521 or TSA induces a striking segregation of transcription factors associated with Ac-Lys-373 p53 (after treatment with CG-1521) and Ac-Lys-382 p53 (after treatment with TSA) (Fig. 2A). In particular, p300 is found exclusively associated with Ac-Lys-373 p53, whereas CBP is only bound to Ac-Lys-382 p53. Brg-1 and Brm-1, components of the SWI/SNF complex, also segregate in mutually exclusive fashion. Baf60, a regulatory subunit of the Brg-1 complex, segregates with Ac-Lys-373 p53, whereas Brm-1 associates exclusively with Ac-Lys-382 p53. The androgen receptor (which is itself acetylated) and the forkhead transcription factors Foxa1 and Foxm1 also segregate only with complexes containing Ac-Lys-373 p53. Because Pol II and TFIIH, components of the basal machinery, are associated with both Ac-Lys-373 p53 and Ac-Lys-382 p53, both complexes appear to be capable of initiating transcription. Simultaneous treatment of LNCaP cells with CG-1521 and TSA shows that acetylation of the Lys-373 and Lys-382 sites is not mutually exclusive and p53 can be simultaneously acetylated at both sites (Fig. 2B). However, because the dual acetylated Ac-Lys-373/382 p53 associates preferentially with p300 and not CBP, modification of Lys-373 appears to dictate the assembly of transcriptional complexes. Acetylated p53 Isoforms Assemble Different Cofactor Complexes on the p21 Promoter−We have used ChIP to investigate the assembly of transcription factors on the p21 promoter after treatment of LNCaP cells with CG-1521 and TSA. The p21 promoter contains two well characterized p53REs at -2.4 and -1.3 kb upstream of the transcription start site (15.Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1015-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The relative enrichment of specific transcription factors at each site after treatment with CG-1521 and TSA was determined after chromatin immunoprecipitation using PCR primers flanking these two sites. Prior to treatment, p53 is associated mainly with the -2.4 kb site. Treatment with CG-1521 significantly increases the binding of Ac-Lys-373 p53 at both p53Res, but most significantly at the -1.3 kb site. In contrast, TSA slightly increases the binding of Ac-Lys-382 p53 to the -2.4 kb site and to a lesser extent to the -1.3 kb site (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 4B, the two acetylated p53 isoforms recruit different cofactor complexes to the p53REs. Ac-Lys-373 p53 selectively recruits p300 to -2.4 and -1.3 kb p53REs, whereas Ac-Lys-382 p53 recruits CBP to the two sites. This is entirely concordant with the co-immunoprecipitation data presented in Fig. 2A. Although both HDAC1 and HDAC2 are associated with -2.4 and -1.3 kb sites prior to treatment, Ac-Lys-373 p53 selectively stabilizes the binding of HDAC1 to both p53REs, whereas HDAC2 is not found in the complexes on either response element. This is consistent with our earlier observation that treatment with CG-1521 leads to rapid degradation of HDAC2 (13.Roy S. Packman K. Jeffrey R. Tenniswood M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). TSA on the other hand stabilizes Ac-Lys-382 p53 and enhances the formation of transcription complexes containing CBP and HDAC2, but not HDAC1. As shown in Fig. 4C, these complexes have markedly different abilities to recruit components of the basal transcription apparatus, namely TATA box-binding protein (TBP), RNA polymerase II, and TFIIH. Prior to treatment, RNA Pol II and TBP already associate with the basal promoter of the p21 gene but TFIIH is not associated with the complex. After treatment with CG-1521, there is a substantial increase in binding of TBP to the basal promoter and TFIIH is recruited to the basal promoter, coinciding with a decrease in RNA Pol II occupancy, which is consistent with the initiation of transcription. In contrast, after treatment with TSA, neither TBP nor TFIIH is associated with the basal promoter and binding of RNA Pol II to the basal promoter is significantly reduced. This most likely reflects the decreased occupancy of the TATA box by TBP. These data indicate that a preassembled initiation complex containing a paused RNA Pol II is present at the p21 promoter. Binding of Ac-Lys-373 p53 and its associated cofactors (including p300 and HDAC1), to the p53REs leads to the recruitment of TFIIH to the basal transcriptional complex and activation of RNA Pol II. In contrast, even though Ac-Lys-382 p53 and its associated cofactors (CBP and HDAC2) bind to the p53REs, the complexes do not initiate the assembly of RNA Pol II on the basal promoter (Fig. 5). The importance of histone acetylation in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression has been recognized for many years (17.Gershey E.L. Vidali G. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5018-5022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the role of HATs and HDACs in regulating chromatin conformation has been studied extensively (18.Davie J.R. Hendzel M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19.Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 2004; 91: 137-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It has also become apparent over the last five years that many nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates are also acetylated. This includes transcription factors such as p53 (20.Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene. 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), the forkhead transcription factors (21.Motta M.C. Divecha N. Lemieux M. Kamel C. Chen D. Gu W. Bultsma Y. McBurney M. Guarente L.

Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 938-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 24.Soucek K. Kamaid A. Phung A.D. Kubala L. Bulinski J.C. Harper R.W. Eiserich J.P. Prostate. 2006; 66: 954-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and signaling molecules such as PTEN (25.Okumura K. Mendoza M. Bachoo R.M. Depinho R.A. Cavenee W.K. Furnari F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26562-26568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This has led to the realization that acetylation is an important intracellular signaling pathway analogous to phosphorylation (20.Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene. 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells express several HATs, including P/CAF, p300, CBP, and Tip60 (26.Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28.Halkidou K. Cook S. Leung H.Y. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. Eur. Urol. 2004; 45: 382-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the NAD+-dependent class III enzyme Sirt1 (29.Li J. Wang E. Rinaldo F. Datta K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5510-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of individual HDIs on these cells represents a composite effect on the biology of cells that have similar HATs and HDACs. Comparison of the effects of CG-1521 and TSA, two hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors, has shown that despite the similarity in structure these compounds have very different effects on LNCaP cells. CG-1521 induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis, whereas TSA induces G1/S arrest but does not induce apoptosis (13.Roy S. Packman K. Jeffrey R. Tenniswood M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These two compounds induce markedly different effects on the acetylation status of p53: CG-1521 stabilizes Ac-Lys-373 p53 whereas TSA stabilizes Ac-Lys-382 p53. Our previous studies have shown that Lys-320 is constitutively acetylated in LNCaP cells and the acetylation at Lys-320 is not affected by CG-1521 or TSA (13.Roy S. Packman K. Jeffrey R. Tenniswood M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Acetylation of p53 at either Lys-373 or Lys-382 blocks the mdm2-mediated ubiquitinylation of p53, which increases the steady state level of the acetylated proteins. However, as the data presented here show, the differences in acetylation status are not due solely to the increased steady state levels of p53. The ability of the different acetylated isoforms to recruit distinct co-activator complexes to the p21 promoter is the major factor in determining the downstream events associated with these HDIs. Ac-Lys-373 p53 recruits p300, forkhead transcription factors, the androgen receptor, and Brg-1. When assembled on the p53REs in the p21 promoter, this complex induces the assembly of TBP, RNA Pol II, and TFIIH on the basal promoter and initiates p21 transcription. In contrast, Ac-Lys-382 p53 recruits CBP and Brm-1 to the p53REs in the proximal p21 promoter, but this complex does not recruit TBP, RNA Pol II, or TFIIH to the basal promoter, suggesting that Ac-Lys-382 p53 promotes the assembly of a non-functional complex on the p21 promoter. Thus, in addition to the general effects on steady state mRNA levels, these HDIs have specific effects on the assembly of transcription complexes, at least on the p21 promoter. These data lend support to the concept proposed by Knights et al. (30.Knights C.D. Catania J. Di Giovanni S. Muratoglu S. Perez R. Swartzbeck A. Quong A.A. Zhang X. Beerman T. Pestell R.G. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) that distinct p53 acetylation cassettes influence gene expression. Genome-wide array suggests that, in addition to p21, CG-1521 modulates the expression of 233 genes in total, of which a highly circumscribed group of 40 genes are involved in cell cycle, cell proliferation, or cell death. In contrast, TSA modulates over 1700 genes, 1400 of which are down-regulated. Of these, 150 genes are associated with cell cycle, cell proliferation, or apoptosis as described by Gene Ontology (GeneSpring GX 7.2 software; Agilent Technologies). 4S. Roy and M. Tenniswood, unpublished data. This extensive transrepression of gene expression has also been noted in the p53-mediated response to hypoxia (31.Hammond E.M. Mandell D.J. Salim A. Krieg A.J. Johnson T.M. Shirazi H.A. Attardi L.D. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although it is tempting to attribute the dramatic difference in the effects of CG-1521 and TSA solely to the site of acetylation in the C-terminal domain of p53, Ac-Lys-373 p53 is also selectively phosphorylated in the N-terminal domain at Ser-15. Based on the available evidence it is not possible to determine whether one or both post-translational modifications are necessary for the assembly of the active transcription complex on the p21 promoter. Nevertheless, these data suggest that the effects of CG-1521 and TSA are attributable, at least in part, to the selective effects of the HDIs on HDAC activities that lead to differences in the p53-mediated induction of p21 transcription. However, because HDACs have multiple target proteins and the specificity of the HDIs has not been precisely delineated, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the overall biological effect of these compounds, particularly the global effects of TSA, is due to the acetylation of other transcription factors. In summary, although the interactions between HATs, HDACs, and HDIs are clearly complex and not fully understood, the data presented here demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDACs is possible and can lead to significant changes in gene expression through the acetylation of transcription factors such as p53. This holds out promise that tailored therapies based on a more refined knowledge of the cellular HDAC composition will be possible. We thank Jennifer Welsh for excellent technical assistance and Drs. JoEllen Welsh, Kevin Vaughan, and Edward Hinchcliffe for valuable insight into this report."
https://openalex.org/W2010490271,"Polo kinases have crucial conserved functions in controlling the eukaryotic cell cycle through orchestrating several events during mitosis. An essential element of cell cycle control is exerted by altering the expression of key regulators. Here we show an important function for the polo kinase Cdc5p in controlling cell-cycle-dependent gene expression that is crucial for the execution of mitosis in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, we find that Cdc5p is temporally recruited to promoters of the cell-cycle-regulated CLB2 gene cluster, where it targets the Mcm1p-Fkh2p-Ndd1p transcription factor complex, through direct phosphorylation of the coactivator protein Ndd1p. This phosphorylation event is required for the normal temporal expression of cell-cycle-regulated genes such as CLB2 and SWI5 in G2/M phases. Furthermore, severe defects in cell division occur in the absence of Cdc5p-mediated phosphorylation of Ndd1p. Thus, polo kinase is required for the production of key mitotic regulators, in addition to previously defined roles in controlling other mitotic events."

https://openalex.org/W2012269771,"DNA damage triggers multiple checkpoint pathways to arrest cell cycle progression. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an important regulator of several events during mitosis. In addition to Plk1 functions in cell cycle, Plk1 is involved in DNA damage check-point in G2 phase. Normally, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) is a key enzyme involved in G2 phase cell cycle arrest following DNA damage, and inhibition of Plk1 by DNA damage during G2 occurs in a ATM/ATR-dependent manner. However, it is still unclear how Plk1 is regulated in response to DNA damage in mitosis in which Plk1 is already activated. Here, we show that treatment of mitotic cells with doxorubicin and γ-irradiation inhibits Plk1 activity through dephosphorylation of Plk1, and cells were arrested in G2 phase. Treatments of the phosphatase inhibitors and siRNA experiments suggested that PP2A pathway might be involved in regulating mitotic Plk1 activity in mitotic DNA damage.

Mitotic catastrophe of mammalian cells results from a combination of deficient cell cycle checkpoints (DNA damage checkpoint and spindle assembly checkpoint) and cellular damage. The failure to arrest the cell cycle progression before or at mitosis causes aberrant chromosomal segregation and asymmetric division with the consequent generation of aneuploidy, which may lead to oncogenesis (1Castedo M.

One of the most intriguing features of Plk1 is the dynamic change of its subcellular localization and kinase activity during mitosis. Plk1 localizes on centrosome during mitosis before anaphase, and moves into the kinetochore/centromere during anaphase, suggesting that Plk1 may regulate chromosome and chromatin separation during this period (14Arnaud L.

In addition to the roles during mitotic progression, several experiments in budding yeast and mammalian cells have shown that Plk1 may be involved in a DNA checkpoint pathway. Cdc5, the polo-like kinase in budding yeast, is controlled by the DNA damage checkpoint. In cdc13-arrested cells, Cdc5p-associated kinase activity is high, and its modification is dependent upon the factors required to activate the DNA damage checkpoint including Mec1p, Mec2/Rad53p, and Rad9p (20Cheng L.

DNA damage in G2 phase establishes a block to mitotic entry, and mitotic cells remain arrested at mitosis when exposed to DNA damage agents. Plk1 is inhibited by DNA damage in G2 and mitosis, and its inhibition appears to have a critical role in DNA damage responses. Significantly, expression of constitutively activated mutant of Plk1 can overcome these arrests induced by DNA damage, suggesting that Plk1 is an important target of the DNA damage checkpoint (22Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Several reports from mammalian cell studies show that inhibition of Plk1 by DNA damage occurs in an ATM- or ATR-dependent fashion (23van Vugt M.A. Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and that Plk1 and Chk2 interact and co-localize to centrosome and midbody (24Tsvetkov L. Xu X. Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8468-8475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These reports on chk2 and Plk1 partly explain how Plk1 is regulated and functions in DNA damage responses and checkpoint pathway. Moreover, Plk1 phosphorylates Chk2 in vitro (24Tsvetkov L. Xu X. Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8468-8475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Plk1 was also identified as new putative target protein of Chk2 through protein data base searching and in vitro kinase assays (25Seo G.J. Kim S.E. Lee Y.M. Lee J.W. Lee J.R. Hahn M.J. Kim S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although there are many reports on these issues, it is still unclear about the dependence or connection between Plk1 and ATM/Chk, and Plk1 functions in this pathway. Here, we show the inhibition of Plk1 and its effects in mitotic DNA damage. Inactivation of Plk1 is possibly caused by dephosphorylation through the action of protein phosphatase in mitotic DNA damage. Cell Culture and Treatments—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To arrest in mitosis, cells were treated with nocodazole (200 ng/ml) for 16 h, and collected by mitotic shake-off. For DNA damage, doxorubicin (5 μm) was treated for 1 h, or 10–20 Gy of γ-ray was irradiated. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS buffer thoroughly and incubated for each indicated time in fresh medium. To inhibit phosphatases, cells were pretreated with okadaic acid (Alexis) or tautomycin (Alexis) for 4 h before treatment of doxorubicin. Determination of G1, G2, or Mitotic Phase—For mitotic spread assay, cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa staining solution as described previously (26Chow J.P. Siu W.Y. Fung T.K. Chan W.M. Lau A. Arooz T. Ng C.P. Yamashita K. Poon R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3989-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). G1 and G2 cells were determined by the intensity of Giemsa signal and the nuclear membrane staining by lamin antibody (anti-lamin A/C antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mitotic cells were determined by scattered chromosomes and nuclear membrane breakdown. Flow Cytometry and Microscopy—For flow cytometry, cells were harvested and fixed in ice cold 80% ethanol. Cells were washed with PBS, stained with propidium iodide (40 μg/ml) and 100 μg/ml RNaseA, and were analyzed by flow cytometry of 10000 events (Cell Quest, Becton Dickinson). The data were processed with ModFit software for DNA distribution analysis. For microscopic analysis, cells were cultured on glass coverslips, which is coated with fibronectin solution (Sigma). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and ice cold methanol. After a rinse with PBS, cells were blocked in PBS-10% goat serum for 30 min. Cells were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin antibody (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-MPM-2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) for detection of centrosome and mitotic cells, respectively. After overnight treatment, cells were stained with goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Their fluorescence signals were detected and captured by confocal microscopy (LSM510). The percentage of MPM-2-positive cells was counted using fluorescence microscopy (Axioskop 40, Zeiss). Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For Western blotting, cell lysate (100–300 μg/lane) was electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE (low bis gel, 120:1) to detect endogenous phospho-Plk1 (27Jang Y.J. Ma S. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44115-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and blocked in TBST with 5% skim milk. After incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-Plk1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin B1 and anti-phospho-histone H3(Ser10) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were visualized using ECL TM system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation of Plk1, cell lysate (500 μg) was incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Plk1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and protein A/G-agarose bead. Beads were washed thoroughly and used for in vitro kinase assay. PP2A Phosphatase Assay by Immunoprecipitation—PP2A phosphatase assay was performed by Malachite Green phosphate detection system (Upstate Biotechnology). In Brief, Endogenous PP2A was immunoprecipitated by anti-PP2A antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) from cell lysates. Beads were washed with TBS, followed by wash with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 μm CaCl2. Synthetic phosphopeptide (KRpTIRR) were incubated with the immunoprecipitate at 30 °C, and degradation of phosphopeptide was detected by Malachite Green phosphate detection solution at 650 nm. PP2A siRNA Design, Preparation, and Transfection—SiRNA duplexes were synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). All siRNA duplexes have the sense strand sequence of 5′-N19-dTdT-3′, where N19 is the target sequence in PP2A-D (NM_002715) and PP2A-E (NM_004156) and dTdT is 2-nt 3′ overhang. Antisense strand has the sequence complementary to N19 and dTdT 3′ overhang sequence. All six siRNAs were designed by Turbo si-Designer™ (Bioneer) and their N19 target sequences were as follows: PP2A-D-1446, 5′-CACATGGACCAAAAGATGT-3′; PP2A-D-1523, 5′-CAGTTCATTGCATGCTGAA-3′; PP2A-D-2212, 5′-CATTGTTGGTGTGCACTTT-3′; PP2A-E-1297, 5′-CACATCATGGACCAAATGT-3′; PP2A-E-1550, 5′-CACAAGCTAACTTCCACTA-3′; PP2A-E-1720, 5′-GTCATGACAGTGCTTGCAT-3′. After validation of silencing efficiency, we choose two constructs, PP2A-D-1446 and PP2A-E-1720 for further study. Twenty-four hours before transfection, HeLa cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, cells were washed once with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and 500 μl of Opti-MEM was added to each well. For each transfection, 3.5 μl of Lipofectamine was mixed with 250 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, siRNA (final concentration of 100 nm) was added to 250 μl of Opti-MEM and the mixture was added to the Lipofectamine mixture and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature to allow complex formation. The solutions were added to the cells in the 6-well plate to the final volume of 1 ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of the transfection solution for 6 h. The Opti-MEM medium containing the complexes was then replaced with 2 ml of standard growth media and cultured at 37 °C for 18 h. Twenty-four hours after transfection, total RNA was isolated from transfected cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and subjected to Northern blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, transfected cells were treated with nocodazole (200 ng/ml) at 36 h after transfection. After 16 h, doxorubicin (5 μm) was added to the culture and incubated for 1 h. Cells were trypsinized and washed twice with 2 ml of 1× PBS. Cells were cultured for 5 h before harvested. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed with 8 μg of total RNA as previously described (28Choi Y.C. Gu W. Hecht N.B. Feinberg A.P. Chae C.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The filters were first probed with PP2A cDNAs and rehybridized with β-actin cDNA as a control to normalize for sample variation. The probes labeled were prepared with 670 bp of the PP2A-α cDNA 3′-UTR region (NM_002715, nucleotide 1341–2010), 600 bp of PP2A-β cDNA 3′-UTR region (NM_004156, nucleotide 1171–1770), and 788 bp of the β-actin cDNA (NM_001101, nucleotide 433–1220) by using a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Plk1 and Inhibition of Plk1 Activity by Treatment with DNA Damage Agents—Previously, we reported that Plk1 is phosphorylated on threonine 210 during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, and that this phosphorylation is correlated with Plk1 activation (27Jang Y.J. Ma S. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44115-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As shown in lane 2 of Fig. 1, endogenous Plk1 in mitotic nocodazole-treated HeLa cells is highly phosphorylated and activated, whereas Plk1 in G2 cells is not phosphorylated and inactive (Fig. 1, lane 1). As demonstrated in our previous report (27Jang Y.J. Ma S. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44115-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the phosphorylated form of Plk1 (the upper band on the gel in Fig. 1, indicated by phospho-Plk) is correlated with active Plk1; therefore, we used this modification of Plk1 as an assay for activated Plk1 in the present study. Because DNA damage can occur during mitosis as well as interphase, we investigated how cells overcome DNA damage in the mitotic phase when Plk1 is fully activated. For this study, HeLa cells were synchronized at prometaphase by nocodazole treatment for 16 h, followed by doxorubicin treatment for 1 h to induce DNA damage. The cells were then transferred to fresh medium and incubated. As expected, Plk1 was highly phosphorylated and activated following nocodazole treatment (Fig. 2, lane 3). Five hours after removing the nocodazole, endogenous Plk1 remained in the phosphorylated form, but its kinase activity had slightly decreased (Fig. 2, lane 4). Just after doxorubicin treatment, Plk1 was phosphorylated and activated, similar to Plk1 without doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2, lane 1); however, when doxorubicin-treated mitotic cells were incubated in fresh medium for more than 5 h to induce continuous mitosis, endogenous Plk1 was dephosphorylated, and its kinase activity decreased (Fig. 2, lane 2). These data showed that doxorubicin treatment inhibits the kinase activity of Plk1 through dephosphorylation. To confirm the inactivation of Plk1 by DNA damage over time, mitotic HeLa cells were treated with or without doxorubicin for 1 h, washed, and incubated. After incubation, cells were harvested and endogenous Plk1 was analyzed. As expected, after 5 h most of the untreated cells were still in the mitotic phase (Fig. 3A, panel 5). After 7 h of incubation in fresh medium, more than 40% of the cells had reentered mitosis, and cells at the G1 phase could be observed (Fig. 3A, panel 6). The G1 population was identified by the level of cyclin B1, which decreased after 7 h of incubation (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4 in the upper panel). Although the percentage of G1 cells increased and the amount of endogenous Plk1 decreased, Plk1 remained phosphorylated and activated (Fig. 3B, lane 4 in the middle and lower panels). However, endogenous Plk1 in mitotic HeLa cells treated with doxorubicin was rapidly dephosphorylated, and its activity clearly decreased after a 7-h incubation in fresh medium (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–8).FIGURE 3DNA-damaged mitotic cells are accumulated in the 4N DNA stage. HeLa cells were synchronized in prometaphase by nocodazole treatment. After 16 h, cells were treated with or without doxorubicin for 1 h as previously described. Cells were transferred into fresh medium and harvested after incubation for indicated times (1, 3, 5, and 7 h). A, DNA contents of cells harvested after incubation during indicated times. After ethanol-fixation, cells were treated with propidium iodide and analyzed by FACScan™. noco, cells synchronized in mitosis; noco+doxo, cells treated with nocodazole following doxorubicin treatment. B, Plk1 protein was detected by anti-Plk1 immunoblot (α-Plk1). The Plk1 immunoprecipitate was used in the kinase assay (casein). Endogenous cyclin B1 and the phosphorylated histone were detected by anti-cyclin B1 and anti-p-histone (Ser-10) antibodies, respectively (α-CycB1 and α-p-His). Lanes 1 and 5, 1-h incubation; lanes 2 and 6, 3 h; lanes 3 and 7, 5 h; lanes 4 and 8, 7 h. C and D, quantification of cell population in A. Total numbers of G2/M cells were analyzed by ModFit™ (C). Mitotic cell populations were detected and counted by immunostaining with anti-MPM2 antibody (D). E, centrosome and nucleus in normal cells and in cells treated with nocodazole and doxorubicin. Nuclei and centrosomes were detected with propidium iodide and tubulin antibody, respectively.

F, quantification of cell population in E. Cell phenotypes in the cell cycle stage are indicated by confocal images. In mito, all kinds of mitotic cells are counted. G, mitotic spread assay in normal cells and in cells treated with nocodazole and doxorubicin. Giemsa-stained types were classified, counted, and quantified as percentage.

Cells were treated with drugs and incubated under the same conditions as E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, the DNA content in the cells indicated that the mitotic cells with DNA damage did not exit mitosis and did not enter the next round of cell division (Fig. 3, A, panels 8–12 and C). The association of DNA with histones results in densely packed chromatin, which restricts the binding of proteins involved in gene transcription to DNA. Histone H3, the core protein in nucleosomes, is phosphorylated at the end of prophase at two major mitosis-specific sites: Ser-10 and Ser-28 (30Shibata K. Inagaki M. Ajiro K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the histones in DNA-damaged cells disappeared rapidly, meaning that the cells had returned to interphase (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–8 in α-p-His). As the cells entered G1, the histone phosphorylation signal weakened (lane 4 in α-p-His). These data indicated that cells with damaged DNA remain in prometaphase, and that the Plk1 activity is diminished. Analysis by the ModFit program revealed that the population of doxorubicin-treated cells with 4N DNA (G2/M phase) was unchanged after the 7-h incubation, whereas the cells with undamaged DNA entered G1. To determine the status of the DNA-damaged mitotic HeLa cells after incubation, we used several approaches. First, cells were immunostained with anti-MPM2 antibody, and then the MPM2-positive mitotic cells were counted. Mitotic cells treated with nocodazole were not arrested in mitosis after nocodazole removal, and the number of MPM2-positive cells decreased. Although the cells with damaged DNA displayed a 4N DNA content (Fig. 3, A and C), more than 50% of the cells appeared to be in mitosis, and both the MPM2 and histone phosphorylation signals had decreased (Fig. 3, B, lowest panel and D). Moreover, the cells were well attached to the culture dish (Fig. 3E, panel c), in contrast to the round shape of mitotic cells (Fig. 3E, panel a). We then examined the centrosomes by γ-tubulin immunostaining. Normally, the number and position of centrosomes change during cell cycle progression (Fig. 3F, photographs). Immediately following 16 h of nocodazole treatment, the cells were round and mostly unattached to the culture dish, the centrosomes were apparently separated, and their nuclear boundaries were not detectable by lamin antibody (Fig. 3, E, panel a and H, upper panels). After 7 h, several cells were at the G1 stage and were well attached with intact nuclear envelopes (Fig. 3H, middle panels). At this stage, it was difficult to locate the centrosomes in each cell (Fig. 3E, panel b). Cells damaged by doxorubicin, however, were not round or well attached like the undamaged cells after the 7-h incubation, but their centrosomes were detectable and slightly separated. Moreover, these cells exhibited intact nuclear envelopes (Fig. 3E, panel c and H, lowest panels). These phenotypes suggest that most of the mitotic cells with DNA damage were in G2 or early mitosis, and not in prometaphase anymore after the 7-h incubation. DNA damage during mitosis may inhibit cell cycle progression as a result of Plk1 inactivation and return cells to early mitosis. The percentage of cells with DNA damage that contained prometaphasic figures decreased significantly after incubation in fresh medium (Fig. 3G, black bar in panel b), whereas the percentage of cells containing G2/prophasic figures increased (Fig. 3G, gradient bar in panel b). The features of G2 cells are that DNA content is 4N, the Giemsa signal is increased, and the nuclear membrane is still remained (Fig. 3, A–H). The cells without DNA damage showed an increase in G1 figures (weak Giemsa signal and intact nuclear membrane) in fresh medium (Fig. 3, G, gray bar in panel a and H, middle panels). Similar to doxorubicin, when mitotic cells were irradiated with 10 Gy and 20 Gy of γ-rays, dephosphorylation of Plk1 was induced, and the cells were arrested at the 4N DNA stage, indicating that the phenomena described above are not doxorubicin-specific effects (Fig. 4). Cells given 20 Gy of γ-rays remained at the 4n stage after a 7-h incubation, whereas G1 cells were detected 5 h after irradiation with 10 Gy (Fig. 4A). In mitotic-irradiated cells, Plk1 was dephosphorylated in a manner similar to Plk1 in doxorubicin-treated cells (Fig. 4B). PP2A Is Involved in Dephosphorylation of Plk1 in Mitotic Cells with DNA Damage—During normal cell division, the level of Plk1 increases from G2 to mitosis, and the protein is modified by an upstream kinase (27Jang Y.J. Ma S. Terada Y. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44115-44120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At the end of mitosis and cytokinesis, Plk1 is degraded by an anaphase-promoting complex, indicating that Plk1 inactivation by dephosphorylation may play a major role in Plk1 down-regulation. We showed that inactivation of Plk1 by dephosphorylation occurs in response to DNA damage during mitosis, suggesting that protein phosphatase(s) might be involved in mitotic Plk1 inactivation after DNA damage. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase family contains four distinct groups: protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), protein phosphatase-2B (PP2B, also called calcineurin), and protein phosphatase-2C (PP2C) (31Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Among the numerous family members, PP1 and PP2A are referred to as the two principal enzymes because they are ubiquitous and have broad specificity (31Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). By using two specific phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and tautomycin, we sought to determine the phosphatase(s) that might be involved in regulating Plk1 in mitotic DNA-damaged cells. Okadaic acid has a 100-fold greater specificity for PP2A than for PP1. In contrast, tautomycin specificity for PP1 is 10-fold greater than for PP2A. The specificity of these inhibitors allowed the activities of the individual phosphatases to be analyzed. Treatment of HeLa cells with various concentrations of okadaic acid for 4 h before DNA damage did not affect PP1 activity (Fig. 5B, white bars), but PP2A activity decreased in proportion to the amount of okadaic acid used (Fig. 5B, black bars). Moreover, treatment with 10 μm tautomycin for 4 h before DNA damage did not affect PP2A activity, whereas PP1 activity was inhibited (Fig. 5D, white bars). Western blot analyses with anti-PP1/-PP2A specific antibodies did not reveal any significant changes because of treatment with 100 nm okadaic acid, 10 μm tautomycin, or doxorubicin (Fig. 5, A and C). These data indicate that 100 nm okadaic acid inhibited PP2A activity in mitotic HeLa cells, and that 10 μm tautomycin inhibited PP1 activity. Notably, the effective concentrations of these phosphatase inhibitors in HeLa cells are in agreement with the results of a previous report (32Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Ful"

To address this point we generated Fe65 knockout (KO) mice. These mice do not show any obvious phenotype; however, when fibroblasts (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), isolated from Fe65 KO embryos, were exposed to low doses of DNA damaging agents, such as etoposide or H2O2, an increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress, compared with wild type animals, clearly emerged. Accordingly, brain extracts from Fe65 KO mice, exposed to non-lethal doses of ionizing radiations, showed high levels of γ-H2AX and p53, thus demonstrating a higher sensitivity to X-rays than wild type mice. Nuclear Fe65 is necessary to rescue the observed phenotype, and few minutes after the exposure of MEFs to DNA damaging agents, Fe65 undergoes phosphorylation in the nucleus. With a similar timing, the proteolytic processing of APP is rapidly affected by the genotoxic stress: in fact, the cleavage of the APP COOH-terminal fragments by γ-secretase is induced soon after the exposure of cells to etoposide, in a Fe65-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that Fe65 plays an essential role in the response of the cells to DNA damage. Fe65 interacts with the cytosolic domain of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP).

These results demonstrate that Fe65 plays an essential role in the response of the cells to DNA damage. Fe65, together with Fe65L1 and Fe65L2, belongs to a small protein family having the characteristics of adaptor proteins, as they possess three protein-protein interaction domains, one WW and two phosphotyrosine binding domains (1Russo T. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Zambrano N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Fe65 also interacts, through its central phosphotyrosine binding domain with the low density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein LRP and with the ApoE receptor and experimental evidence indicates that a trimeric complex exists including LRP, Fe65, and APP (5Kinoshita A.

The same phosphotyrosine binding domain is also responsible for the interaction of Fe65 with the histone acetyl transferase Tip60 (8Cao X. Sudhof T.C.

The function of this complex network of protein-protein interactions is still not understood. The involvement of Mena and Abl and the possible competition of Fe65 with Dab-1 for the interaction with APP support the results indicating the role of Fe65 in cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration (13Sabo S.L. Ikin A.F. Buxbaum J.D. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Sabo S.L. Ikin A.F. Buxbaum J.D. Greengard P. J.

On the other hand, the interaction of Fe65 with several proteins whose main location is the nucleus has suggested that Fe65 could also have nuclear functions. This possibility is supported by the observations that overexpression of Fe65 results in its accumulation in the nucleus and APP functions as an extranuclear anchor that prevents Fe65 nuclear translocation (8Cao X.

Relevant information about the possible functions of Fe65 comes from the analysis of knock-out animals. In Caenorhabditis elegans a single gene encodes a proteins very similar to the mammalian Fe65s. This orthologue, named feh-1, interacts with the nematode orthologue of APP (22Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Arbucci S. Gianni D. Russo T. Bazzicalupo P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1411-1422PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous worms for the feh-1 gene deletion show a pharyngeal phenotype represented by a higher rate of pumping compared with the wild type animals. The ablation of both the feh-1 alleles results in the block of the worm development at the embryonic stage; a number of embryos escape this block and the development proceeds to the L1 larval stage (22Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Arbucci S. Gianni D. Russo T. Bazzicalupo P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1411-1422PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse, the double knock-out of Fe65 and Fe65L1 genes shows significant defects in the development of the central nervous system (23Guenette S. Chang Y. Hiesberger T. Richardson J.A. Eckman C.B. Eckman E.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that resemble those observed in the APP;APLP1;APLP2 gene knock-out mice (24Herms J. Anliker B. Heber S. Ring S. Fuhrmann M. Kretzschmar H. Sisodia S. Muller U. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4106-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Understanding the functions of Fe65 proteins is obviously linked to the relevance of APP and its proteolytic processing to Alzheimer disease (AD). There is in fact a convincing and large collection of data that supports the crucial role played by the β-amyloid peptides, derived from the processing of APP, in the pathogenesis of the disease (25Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2004; 44: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). However, the functions of APP and the mechanisms governing its amyloidogenic processing are not fully understood. Herein we report results demonstrating that the ablation of the Fe65 gene in the mouse is associated with an increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and suggest that Fe65 is involved in the molecular machinery of the cellular response to genotoxic stress. Fe65 Knock-out Mice, Knock-out Mice Embryonic Fibroblast Generation—Fe65 KO mice were obtained as described in the supplemental material (part 1). For generation of mouse embryo fibroblast lines, E13.5 embryo bodies devoid of heads and liver were trypsinized and plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% Newborn Calf Serum (HyClone), 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 1% minimal essential medium-non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Immortalized lines were obtained following spontaneous recovery of the primary cultures from proliferation crisis. These lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Chemicals and Treatments—Etoposide (VP-16, Calbiochem, 100 mm stock in Me2SO) was used 15 or 40 μm. H2O2 was diluted from a 30% w/w aqueous solution (Sigma) immediately before cell treatment in complete medium. Chronic treatments with 2 μm γ-secretase inhibitor IX (Calbiochem) were performed by repeated supplementation of the compound, every 4 h, over 24 h. To induce genotoxic stress in mice, these were exposed to 0.5 or 1 gray doses of 6-MV x-ray from a linear accelerator (Primus, Siemens). Generation of the Recombinant Constructs and Transfections—pRC-CMV-NES-myc and pRC-CMV-mutNES-myc vectors were obtained by cloning in the pRC-CMV (Invitrogen) the sequence of NES-myc and mutNES-myc using NotI/ApaI restriction sites. NES-myc and mut NES-myc ds DNA were obtained by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides (see supplemental material (part 2)). The FE65-NES and Fe65-NESm constructs were obtained by cloning into the pRC-CMV-NES-myc and pRC-CMV-mutNES-myc vectors, respectively, the FE65 cDNA amplified by PCR with the primers reported in supplemental material (part 2) and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. MEFs were transfected at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and with 4 μg each of cDNA and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 for 12 h before changing medium. Comet Assay—The neutral comet assay was carried out according to manufacturer's recommendations (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Slides were incubated for 30 min in lysis buffer and for 40 min in alkaline solution (pH >13), and comet tails were generated by a 10 min electrophoresis in TBE buffer at 20 V, room temperature. Slides were stained with SYBER Green and DNA migration was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMS 4000B). The tail moment and the tail length were determined using the software package “comet assay II” (Perceptive Instruments, Suffolk, UK). A minimum of 50 cells per experiment was analyzed. All the experiments were done in triplicate. Protein Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts (total and fractionated) were obtained as described (9Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de C ia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 50 μg (or the indicated amounts) of each extract were electrophoresed on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel under reducing conditions. Western blot experiments were carried out as described (9Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de C ia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For p-ATM Western blot, proteins were separated on 5% low bis acrylamide gels (acrylamide:bis ratio 5:0.17). The antibodies used and their dilutions were: anti-H2AX (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., 1:1000); anti-p53 (Ab-1) (Upstate Biotechnology, 10 μg/ml), anti-phospho-p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), anti-Fe65 (9Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de C ia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); anti-γH2AX (Ser139) (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000); antiphospho ATM (Ser 1981) (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), anti-APP C-term (A8717 Sigma, 1:4000), anti-Nijmegan breakage syndrome (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500), anti-lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:250), anti-β-actin (Sigma, 1:1000), antimyosin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), anti-tubulin (Sigma, 1:1000). Fe65 KO MEFs Are Highly Sensitive to DNA Damage—To explore the functions of Fe65 and of the Fe65/APP complex we generated Fe65 knock-out mice (see supplemental material (part 1)). These mice do not show any obvious phenotypes up to 12 months of age. The most conceivable explanation of these findings is that Fe65L1 and/or Fe65L2 compensate for the absence of Fe65, thus allowing the animal to develop and live normally. However, we explored whether in stressful conditions the amount of Fe65 proteins in Fe65 knock-out cells could be not enough to arrange an adequate cellular response and this could result in a defect that unmasks the function of the protein. According to this hypothesis, normal MEFs show a dose dependent increase of DNA damages upon the exposure for 30 min to etoposide or H2O2; comet assay demonstrated that at concentrations of 15 μm, the two agents have only marginal effects (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, three Fe65 KO MEFs derived from three independent embryos showed at these low concentrations high levels of DNA damage (Fig. 1B). The response of the Fe65KO MEFs to DNA damaging agents was apparently normal as demonstrated by the activation of ATM and by the phosphorylation of Nijmegan breakage syndrome, one of the substrates of ATM (Fig. 1C). The only differences were the higher levels of H2AX histone phosphorylation (γ-H2AX) and the accumulation of p53 observed in KO MEFs exposed to low doses of VP16 compared with wild type animals (Fig. 1D). Effects of DNA Damage in Fe65 KO Mice—The differences observed between wild type and Fe65 KO MEFs could imply an abnormal response of Fe65 KO mice to DNA damage. Therefore, we analyzed the sensitivity of our KO mice to x-ray-induced DNA damage. KO male mice of 3 months of age and normal mice, sex and age matched and belonging to the same litter, were exposed to non-fatal, low doses (0.5 and 1 gray) of ionizing radiations. As shown in Fig. 1E, 2.5 h after the exposure to ionizing radiations brain extracts from Fe65 KO mice showed higher levels of phosphorylated γ-H2AX and a higher p53 accumulation compared with those of wild type mice. The latter are clear signs of the high sensitivity of Fe65 KO mice to DNA damaging agents. Fe65 Should Be Present in the Nucleus to Rescue the Hypersensitivity of Fe65 KO MEFs to Genotoxic Stress—It was well demonstrated that the overexpression of Fe65 in different cell lines is accompanied by the accumulation of the protein in the nucleus and APP functions as an extranuclear anchor preventing Fe65 nuclear translocation (8Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 15Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the COOH-terminal fragment of APP resulting from the cleavage catalyzed by γ-secretase was found in the nucleus associated with Fe65 (16Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40288-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that the processing of APP could be involved in the mechanism regulating Fe65 availability in the nucleus. On the other hand, APP cytodomain is phosphorylated at Thr-668 and this phosphorylation decreases the affinity of APP for Fe65 (26Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a second mechanism to regulate the nuclear availability of Fe65. Therefore, we addressed the question of whether the phenotype we observed in the Fe65 KO MEFs is related to Fe65 functions requiring its presence in the nucleus. To test this point we generated two expression vectors encoding Fe65 fused at the COOH terminus to the nuclear export signal of the MAPKK or Fe65 fused to a mutated, nonfunctional, version of this NES, as described previously in Ref. 27Cao X. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24601-24611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar. The transfection of the Fe65-NES protein showed no rescue of the phenotype, while the Fe65 fused to the mutatant form of the NES had the same effect as the wt Fe65 (see Fig. 2). Fe65 and APP Modifications Induced by Genotoxic Stress—The finding that Fe65 should be present in the nucleus to rescue the Fe65 KO phenotype suggested us to explore nuclear Fe65 upon genotoxic stress. Therefore, we monitored nuclear Fe65 at various times after the exposure of wild type MEFs to 40 μm etoposide (see Fig. 3A). We previously demonstrated that our polyclonal antibody against Fe65 recognizes in nuclear extracts several bands, the slowest migrating ones are erased by the alkaline phosphatase treatment (9Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de C ia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The etoposide treatment induced a rapid modification of the pattern of the Fe65 bands after 5 and 10 min. Thereafter, the basal pattern was restored (20 min) and remained unchanged for several hours. The amount of cytosolic Fe65 was not affected by the etoposide treatment. This rapid modification of Fe65 as a consequence of the exposure of the cells to DNA damage agents suggests its involvement in the early steps of the cellular response to the genotoxic stress. The proteolytic processing of APP could be involved in the phenomenon, because of the interaction of APP with Fe65. Therefore, we measured the amount of the APP COOH-terminal fragments (CTF) derived from the cleavage of APP by α-or β-secretase, C83 and C99, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3B, in the wild type, untreated MEFs, only the C83 band is clearly visible; upon the treatment with 40 μm etoposide, the amount of APP-CTF is drastically decreased within few minutes and returned to basal levels 2 h later. This decrease is clearly dependent on the induction of the cleavage of CTF by γ-secretase; in fact, the pretreatment of the MEFs with DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor, prevents the observed decrease of APP-CTF (see Fig. 3C). Furthermore, both APP and APP-CTF in cells pretreated with DAPT and exposed to etoposide seem to accumulate up to levels higher than those present in cells treated only with DAPT. These finding suggest a relationship between Fe65 modifications and the cleavage of the APP-CTF. To explore this point we analyzed the cleavage of APP-CTF in Fe65 KO MEFs. As shown in Fig. 3D, in these cells the treatment with etoposide does not induce any changes in the amount of App-CTF, thus further supporting that APP processing is dependent on Fe65 modification induced by genotoxic stress. The phenotype of Fe65 KO cells and mice described in this paper establishes a link between the function of this protein and the cellular machinery devoted to protect from and/or respond to DNA damages. Previous results suggested that Fe65 could have some nuclear functions, considering its presence in the nucleus and its interaction with several nuclear proteins. These results supported the hypothesis that Fe65 could be involved in the regulation of transcription, although most of them rely on the use of reporter gene assays. Our present results do not exclude this possibility, because dysregulation of specific genes, involved in the control of genome integrity and/or in DNA repair, could significantly contribute to the observed phenotype. The timing of the modifications of the nuclear Fe65 and of the APP processing we observed in normal MEFs exposed to the genotoxic stress indicates that nuclear Fe65 is modified before (5 and 10 min) the cleavage of APP-CTFs (10, 15, and 20 min). This suggests that the cleavage of APP does not trigger the translocation of Fe65 in the nucleus. On the contrary, it favors the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of APP cytodomain at Thr-668, which decreases the affinity of APP for Fe65, induces the nuclear translocation of a small subset of phosphorylated Fe65 molecules (26Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The activation of the cleavage of APP-CTF following the genotoxic stress is clearly dependent on Fe65, because it is completely abolished in cells lacking Fe65. This result confirms that the processing of APP is significantly dependent on its cross-talk with Fe65 (28King G.D. Scott Turner R. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The relationship between the phenotype we observed in Fe65 KO mice with those described in the feh-1 KO worms and in the Fe65; Fe65L1 double KO mice is not obvious (29Wang B. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Shimizu K. Ware C.B. Liggitt D.H. Jin L.W. Cool B.H. Storm D.R. Martin G.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the nematode, the KO of the feh-1 gene leads to an early arrest of the embryo development in about 50% of the cases (22Zambrano N. Bimonte M. Arbucci S. Gianni D. Russo T. Bazzicalupo P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1411-1422PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining embryos skip this block and proceed to the L1 larval stage. This high percentage of surviving embryos suggests that stochastic events contribute to the early block of development. One possibility to be explored is that KO embryos have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage, thus in many cases they do not survive up to the larval stages. This hypothesis fits with the notion that DNA-damage-induced checkpoint is silenced during early stages of embryo development (30Holway A.H. Kim S.H. La Volpe A. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to ensure that cell cycle progression is not hampered by DNA damage. In the Fe65;Fe65L1 double KO mice the phenotype observed (23Guenette S. Chang Y. Hiesberger T. Richardson J.A. Eckman C.B. Eckman E.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), mainly characterized by focal heterotopias of neurons likely due to the pial basement membrane disruption and intriguingly similar to that observed in APP;APLP1;APLP2 mice (24Herms J. Anliker B. Heber S. Ring S. Fuhrmann M. Kretzschmar H. Sisodia S. Muller U. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4106-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), is very likely due to the impairment of an unknown Fe65 function different from that responsible for the phenotype we are describing. However, it should be considered that numerous human genetic diseases due to mutations of the DNA damage response machinery are also characterized by marked neurological defects (31Rolig R.L. McKinnon P.J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 417-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This close association has been interpreted either by hypothesizing a particular sensitivity of the neuronal cells to DNA damage or to the possibility that proteins involved in the response to DNA damage and cell cycle control also have additional and distinct functions in neurons. The possible relevance of these results to the pathogenesis of AD remains to be addressed. There are several observations that suggest exploring whether an altered processing of APP, and in turn a modification of its functions, could negatively affect the response of the neurons to DNA damage in AD brain, thus leading to chronic accumulation of DNA damages that could significantly contribute to the neuronal loss characteristics of AD pathology. In agreement with this possibility, it was reported that AD brains show high incidence of nuclei containing DNA strand breaks (32Adamec E. Vonsattel J.P. Nixon R.A. Brain Res. 1999; 849: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts and lymphocytes from AD patients, exposed to DNA damaging agents, show more DNA strand breaks than the cells from normal subjects (33Parshad R.P. Sanford K.K. Price F.M. Melnick L.K. Nee L.E. Schapiro M.B. Tarone R.E. Robbins J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Second, it should be taken into account that numerous results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of β-amyloid peptides could be dependent on its prooxidant activity (34Reddy P.H. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), which could favor oxidative DNA damage. Third, an altered response of neurons to DNA damage in AD is also suggested by the reexpression of cell cycle proteins observed in AD brain (for a review, see Ref. 35Herrup K. Neve R. Ackerman S.L. Copani A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9232-9239Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This reexpression occurs a long time before the death of the neuron, thus it is hard to be considered part of a suicide mechanism to eliminate damaged cells. On the contrary, it could represent part of a mechanism to protect the cell by favoring the repair of DNA damages, also considering that cell cycle reentry also occurs in neurons treated with DNA damaging agents (36Kruman I.I. Wersto R.P. Cardozo-Pelaez F. Smilenov L. Chan S.L. Chrest F.J. Emokpae R. Gorospe M. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 2004; 41: 540-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (307) Google Scholar).

Sup35p consists of a 685-amino acid polypeptide chain that can be divided into three distinct regions. The N-terminal domain, extending from residue 1 to 123 (Sup35pN), is enriched in uncharged polar residues and is indispensable for prion behavior. The conserved and highly charged middle region (Sup35pM) has probably a structural function. It modulates [PSI+] propagation and extends from amino acid residues 124 to 253 (8Liu J.J. Sondheimer N.

Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 25Xu S. Bevis B. Arnsdorf M.F. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, later kinetic studies indicate that the smallest stable amyloid-forming species are made of no more than three Sup35pNM molecules and that the fibrils grow by addition of monomeric Sup35pNM to their ends (26Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; e329: 1582-1589Google Scholar). The majority of in vitro studies on the assembly of Sup35p have been performed using its prion-determining region (Sup35pNM) as fibrils made of Sup35pNM assembled in vitro propagate [PSI+] when reintroduced in yeast cells (27Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 28King C.Y. Diaz-Avalos R. Nature. 2004; 428: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Little is known about the assembly of full-length Sup35p. It is therefore not clear whether the functional C-terminal domain of the protein affects assembly. We set up a systematic comparison of the biochemical and assembly properties of full-length Sup35p, as Sup35p is not degraded in cells exhibiting the [PSI+] trait. Our findings validate the wide use of Sup35pNM as an adequate tool for studies of the nature of amyloids and some aspects of the Sup35p aggregation process. However, we present here differences in the assembly of Sup35p and its NM fragment underlining the usefulness of full-length Sup35p in studying prion propagation both in vivo and in vitro. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Full-length Sup35p was cloned and purified as reported previously (24Krzewska J. Melki R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 822-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A PCR product of the NM fragment was cloned as NdeI-BamHI fragment into pET15b vector. Sup35pNM was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-CodonPlus, in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.5–0.7. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer A (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded directly onto the chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with linear gradients of imidazole (20–500 mm). Fractions containing Sup35pNM were concentrated (VivaSpin 10,000 concentrators) and loaded onto the Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Fractions containing Sup35pNM were further concentrated and stored at –80 °C. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Sup35p was dialyzed against the assembly buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2) and loaded onto Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in assembly buffer. Chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min at 8 °C. Fractions (600 μl) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Sedimentation Velocity—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a 60 Ti four-hole rotor and cells with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Samples were centrifuged at 40,000 and 60,000 rpm at 10 °C. Radial scans of absorbance at 276 nm were taken at 6-min intervals. Data analysis to provide the apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients was performed using the software SVEDBERG and DCDT+ (29Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 156-170Google Scholar). GTPase Activity Measurements—GTP hydrolysis at 20 °C was measured in assembly buffer containing 1 mm [γ-32P]GTP by extraction of the [32P]phosphomolybdate complex formed in 1N HCl as described (30Melki R. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8921-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Assembly of Sup35 into Protein Fibrils—Sup35p was dialyzed against the assembly buffer. To remove urea, Sup35pNM was loaded onto NAP-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the assay buffer. Sup35p was supplemented with GTP and an ATP/GTP-regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 7 °C with gentle agitation. At regular time intervals, aliquots were removed and the assembly reaction was monitored using a Thioflavin T binding assay (31McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T binding was measured by averaging the emission signal over 60 s using a Quantamaster QM 2000–4 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., Lawrenceville, NJ). The lag time was estimated from the first derivative of the assembly kinetics. Preparation of Spheroplasts for Transformation and Infectivity Assays—Spheroplasts of [psi–] yeast strain were prepared and transformed as described previously (27Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Sup35 and Sup35pNM were assembled as described above. The fibrils were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at the early stages of steady state, resuspended with 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 m sorbitol and 10 mm CaCl2, and sonicated. The final concentration of fibril particles in infection experiments was 3 μm. Electron Microscopy—Samples of fibrillar Sup35p and Sup35pNM were negatively stained on carbon-coated grids (200 mesh) with 1% uranyl acetate and examined in a Philips EM 410 electron microscope. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a J810 (Jasco) spectropolarimeter using a 0.2-mm path length cuvette. Ten independent scans were recorded at 20 °C in the assembly buffer at a protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. Spectra were then overlaid and averaged. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (14 × 15 × 0.15 cm) following the standard method of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 27: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, imaged using a Sony CCD camera, and further analyzed on a Macintosh computer (Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, CA) using NIH image software (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Secondary and Quaternary Structures of Soluble Full-length Sup35p—Recombinant full-length Sup35p has a molecular mass of 74 kDa upon analysis by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), consistent with the calculated mass of full-length Sup35p (76,551 Da), and elutes from Superose 12 gel filtration columns in a single peak with apparent mass of 130 kDa (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether the elution behavior of Sup35p from the size exclusion column is due to its oligomerization or to its behavior as a non-globular protein, we carried out sedimentation velocity experiments and analyzed them to yield the apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients, g*(s). Measurements were done at 8 and 5 μm of Sup35p and Sup35pNM. The raw distribution of sedimentation coefficients (symbols in Fig. 1C) were fitted by nonlinear least squares procedures (solid lines) as described by Philo (29Philo J.S. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 156-170Google Scholar). The data fit very well to a single-component system with sedimentation coefficients of 2.85 and 1.8 s for Sup35p and Sup35pNM, respectively. No concentration-dependent oligomerization was observed. The sedimentation coefficient of 1.9 s previously reported for Sup35pNM (26Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; e329: 1582-1589Google Scholar) is consistent with that that we measured. The sedimentation coefficient of Sup35p is low and suggests that the protein has an elongated shape with a calculated friction coefficient 1.807. The overall secondary structure of Sup35p and Sup35pNM were probed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig. 1D). Sup35pNM displays a far-UV CD signal representative of a molecule rich in random coils, in agreement with previous observations (33Scheibel T. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 2001; 8: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas Sup35p is α-helical. The CD difference spectrum (not shown) of Sup35p and Sup35pNM confirms the high α-helical content of the C-terminal domain of Sup35p. The Sup35p Fibrils Retain a Native C-terminal Domain—Sup35p assembles into long straight fibrils that are 25 nm wide and over 1 μm long (24Krzewska J. Melki R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 822-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Functional Sup35p binds and hydrolyzes GTP (3Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I.

Chem. 2004; 279: 45693-45700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether the native structure of Sup35p is retained within the fibrils, the ability of Sup35p to bind and hydrolyze GTP was assessed during assembly (Fig. 2A). The data clearly show that GTP hydrolysis occurs during the assembly of Sup35p at steady state and at a steady rate. In contrast, no GTPase activity is detected during the assembly of Sup5pNM. To further compare the GTPase activities of soluble and fibrillar Sup35p, we monitored GTP hydrolysis of soluble and preassembled Sup35p at identical protein concentrations. The data presented in Fig. 2B show that nucleotide exchange occurs at the same rate on the two forms of the protein. Following exchange, GTP is hydrolyzed at very similar rates by soluble and fibrillar Sup35p. The specific activities, calculated from the slopes of the linear rates of hydrolysis, for Sup35p during the early and late stages of assembly, are 6.5 and 7.8 min–1, respectively. These data suggest that fibrils of Sup35p contain native-like catalytic/functional domains. It is worth noting that the assembly kinetics of Sup35p into fibrils, monitored using thioflavin T binding, in the absence and the presence of GTP are identical. Furthermore, the fibrils appear morphologically indistinguishable in the electron microscope (data not shown). The Critical Concentrations of Sup35p and Sup35pNM Assemblies Are of the Same Order of Magnitude—To further characterize the assembly process and its dynamic aspect, we determined the critical concentrations of Sup35p assembly into fibrils and compared this constant with that of Sup35pNM under the same experimental conditions. The kinetic parameters for elongation of Sup35p and Sup35pNM fibrils can be determined using Oosawa's plot (34Oosawa F. Asakura S. Horecker B. Kaplan N.O. Matmur J. Scheraga H.A. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., London1975: 41-55Google Scholar) of the monomer concentration dependence of the rate of growth, J(c). The following equation describes polymer growth: J(c) = dc/dt = k+[P]c – k– [P] in the case of a reversible polymerization. c and P represent the concentrations of monomer and polymer elongating sites, respectively; k+ and k– are the rate constants for monomer association to and dissociation from polymer ends. According to this equation, k+ is easily derived from the slope of the plot, while k– is given by the extrapolation of J(c) at c = 0. The critical concentration is given by solving J = 0 (intercept on the c axis). In the case of an irreversible polymerization, which is the case for Sup35p assembly as fibrillar Sup35p does not disassemble upon dilution, 3J. Krzewska and R. Melki, unpublished observations. the above equation becomes J(c) = k+ [P]c. Fig. 3 shows the initial growth rates of preformed Sup35p and Sup35pNM fibrils (1 μm) followed by thioflavin T binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble Sup35p and Sup35pNM (2–6 μm). Control reactions, where both soluble proteins (6 μm) were incubated under the same experimental conditions with no added nuclei, demonstrate the absence of de novo nucleation and assembly throughout the measurements. The J(c) plots derived from the data in Fig. 3, A and B, are presented in Fig. 3C. The critical concentrations of Sup35p and Sup35pNM are 2.5 and 0.8 μm, respectively. Size of Sup35p Nuclei—The nucleus is a stable oligomer that has equal probabilities of lateral or longitudinal interaction with an additional molecule (34Oosawa F. Asakura S. Horecker B. Kaplan N.O. Matmur J. Scheraga H.A. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., London1975: 41-55Google Scholar). The formation of nuclei occurs during the lag phase preceding Sup35p assembly. The size of the nucleus is equal to 2m – 1, where m is the value of the slope of the log/log plot of the lag time versus the concentration of assembling proteins. The lag time that precedes Sup35p assembly is highly dependent on Sup35p concentration and decreases from 26 to 3 h upon increasing the protein concentration from 5 to 12 μm (Fig. 4A). The value of m derived from the kinetics presented in Fig. 4A is 3.4 (Fig. 4C); thus, Sup35p nuclei are made of six molecules. In comparison, the value of m derived from the data obtained under the same experimental conditions for Sup35pNM (Fig. 4B) is 2 (Fig. 4C), indicating that Sup35pNM nuclei are made of three molecules. The latter observation is fully consistent with results obtained under slightly different experimental conditions (26Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; e329: 1582-1589Google Scholar). The finding that full-length Sup35p and Sup35pNM nuclei differ in size might either reflect structural differences or differences in their intrinsic stabilities. The Elongation Rate of Sup35pNM Fibrils Is Significantly Greater than That of Full-length Sup35p Fibrils—To determine whether the difference in the size of Sup35p and Sup35pNM nuclei reflects a difference in their intrinsic stability or structural features, the elongation rates of increasing concentrations of preformed Sup35p and Sup35pNM fibrils in the presence of a constant amount of full-length Sup35p (Fig. 5A) and Sup35pNM (Fig. 5B) were compared. As expected, the elongation rates of the different fibrils vary linearly with the amount of added seeds in the range 0.1–2 μm (Fig. 5C). However, when the rates for Sup35p and Sup35pNM are compared a 4.5-fold greater seeding activity of Sup35pNM is observed as compared with that of full-length Sup35p (Fig. 5C). To further reveal potential structural differences in Sup35p and Sup35pNM fibrils, cross-seeding experiments where fibrils of full-length Sup35p were used to induce the assembly of soluble Sup35pNM, and vice versa, were carried out (Fig. 6). A seeding activity is observed in all cases; however, the seeding capacity of fibrillar Sup35pNM in the presence of soluble Sup35pNM is 2.5-fold higher than that in the presence of full-length Sup35p. Similarly, the seeding capacity of fibrillar Sup35p in the presence of soluble Sup35pNM is 2.5 lower than that of fibrillar Sup35pNM. These results suggest either that fibrillar Sup35pNM and Sup35p differ structurally or that the rearrangements of the C-terminal domain or local rearrangements within this domain in full-length Sup35p constitute a limiting reaction in the assembly process. To further document the structural differences in the assembly of Sup35p and Sup35pNM, the soluble forms of the two polypeptides (5 μm) were mixed and their assembly compared with that of Sup35p and Sup35pNM (5 and 10 μm). The data presented in Fig. 7A clearly show that the assembly kinetic of mixed Sup35p and Sup35pNM is identical to that of full-length Sup35p (10 μm) and differs significantly from that of Sup35pNM (10 μm). When the fibrils obtained upon mixing soluble Sup35p and Sup35pNM are examined in the electron microscope, they are indistinguishable from that made of full-length Sup35p (Fig. 7, B–D). We conclude from these observations that soluble Sup35p and Sup35pNM co-assemble efficiently. We further conclude that the incorporation of Sup35pNM into mixed fibrils yields polymers that possess overall the shape of fibrils made of full-length Sup35p.FIGURE 7Co-assembly of Sup35p and Sup35pNM.

Scale bar, 0.48 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fibrillar Sup35p Induces [PSI+] Appearance—The overexpression of Sup35p in vivo leads to induction of a range of [PSI+] prion strains that are distinguishable based on (i) the efficiency of suppression of the stop codon in ADE1 gene that shows when the cells are grown on a rich medium through the colony color (red or various shades of pink) and (ii) their stability (homogeneous versus sectored colonies) (5Cox B.S. Tuite M.F. McLaughlin C.S. Yeast. 1988; 4: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To establish whether Sup35p fibrils induce [PSI+] appearance in a manner similar to Sup35pNM, we carried out spheroplast transformation experiments of [psi–] cells containing a nonsense mutation in the ade1 gene by preformed Sup35p and Sup35pNM fibrils (26Collins S.R. Douglass A. Vale R.D. Weissman J.S. PLoS Biol. 2004; e329: 1582-1589Google Scholar). Co-transformation with URA3 plasmid allowed selection of the fraction of yeast that had taken up material from solution. Transformants were selected on plates that were devoid of uracil. Ura+ colonies were streaked on modified YEPD plates where [psi–] and [PSI+] yeast show red and white (strong) or pink (weak) color phenotypes, respectively. The infection efficiencies of full-length Sup35p and Sup35pNM fibrils (3 μm) determined from counting the white and red/pink colonies are 27 ± 5 and 11 ± 2%, respectively (Fig. 8). Preformed Sup35p fibrils not only display higher infectivity as compared with Sup35pNM but also induce strong [PSI+] with a higher frequency. Indeed, 64% of the colonies exhibited a strong [PSI+] phenotype when transformed by fibrils made of full-length Sup35p in contrast with only 10% for Sup35pNM (not shown). The vast majority of in vitro studies on the assembly of Sup35p have been carried on so far using Sup35pNM fragment. The prion-determining region of Sup35pNM is certainly an important tool for studies of the nature of amyloids, because many kinetic features of Sup35pNM assembly are common for other amyloidogenic proteins (35Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 36Chen S. Ferrone F.A. Wetzel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11884-11889Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 37Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4694-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and fibrils made of Sup35pNM assembled in vitro propagate [PSI+] when reintroduced in yeast cells (27Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 28King C.Y. Diaz-Avalos R. Nature. 2004; 428: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, as the occurrence of the [PSI+] is not accompanied by Sup35p degradation, for a better understanding of the conversion of soluble Sup35p into prion particles it is important to investigate the assembly properties of the full-length protein. Such studies have only been initiated recently (24Krzewska J. Melki R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 822-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 38Shorter J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), supposedly because of difficulties in purification and handling full-length Sup35p, a highly aggregation-prone polypeptide. Here we have compared the assembly properties of Sup35pNM and full-length Sup35p as the functional C-terminal domain of the protein may affect the reaction. We have shown that full-length Sup35p assembles in a manner similar to its NM fragment. Both polypeptides exhibit cooperative assembly and concentration dependence. However, the lag phases and extent of assembly as measured by thioflavin T binding show significant differences. Although the critical concentrations for assembly of both polypeptides are in the μm range, that of Sup35p is higher than that of Sup35pNM. The finding that Sup35p nuclei are composed of six molecules whereas that of Sup35pNM are made of three molecules indicates that the two kinds of nuclei have different geometries. This might reflect a different packing of Sup35pNM domains, either free or when attached covalently to the C-terminal domain of the protein. Alternatively, this could also be due to a direct contribution of the C-terminal domain to Sup35p oligomerization. We also showed that the elongation rate of preformed Sup35pNM seeds is significantly greater than that of full-length Sup35p. When fibrillar Sup35pNM is used to seed the assembly of soluble Sup35pNM and full-length Sup35p, a higher cross-seeding capacity is observed in a homologous, as compared with a heterologous, system. This suggests either that fibrillar Sup35pNM and Sup35p differ structurally or that local rearrangements within the C-terminal domain in full-length Sup35p constitute a limiting reaction in the assembly process. Furthermore, it is worth noting that whereas soluble Sup35p is purified under native conditions, recombinant Sup35pNM is recovered from inclusion bodies and refolded from denaturant. Although the overall secondary structure and assembly kinetics of Sup35pNM purified under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions are similar (33Scheibel T. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Stuct. Biol. 2001; 8: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is possible that the ensemble of conformational states adopted by Sup35pNM following its renaturation differs to some extent from that of the NM domain in full-length Sup35p. In that case, the observed differences in cross-seeding capacities would reflect either a poorly populated, assembly-competent conformation of the NM domain in full-length Sup35p, a limiting step upon displacement of the equilibrium between the assembly-incompetent and assembly-competent conformations toward the latter form, or both. Overall, the data presented here suggest that the differences in the assembly process of Sup35p and Sup35pNM are worth being taken into account when drawing general conclusions on Sup35p assembly when Sup35p fragments or short oligopeptides are used. Similar to Sup35pNM, fibrils made in vitro of full-length Sup35p are infectious. This infectivity is either the consequence of prion induction or conversion. Indeed, upon induction of a prion phenotype different prion strains may be generated. These strains are defined from their capacity to reproduce pre-existing strains, i.e. the efficiency in stop codon read-through. As we do not present hereinafter a characterization of the strains generated upon transformation of yeast cells, we will refer to [PSI+] trait appearance upon treatment of the cells with fibrillar Sup35p and Sup35pNM as an induction of [PSI+]. The observed difference in the induction of [PSI+] trait appearance by fibrillar Sup35p and Sup35pNM suggests that the two macromolecular assemblies either somehow differ structurally or penetrate the cells with different efficiencies. It is also possible that the increased ability of Sup35p fibrils to induce [PSI+] is the consequence of differences in the interaction of the two kinds of polymers with the cellular pool of molecular chaperones. Indeed, fibrillar Sup35p and Sup35pNM most likely expose to the solvent surface areas with different properties. The reintroduction of full-length Sup35p fibrils in the cells should not therefore affect the molecular chaperone homeostasis to the same extent as that of Sup35pNM fibrils that are expected to bind molecular chaperones in a manner similar to other glutamine-rich polypeptides (39Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A differential interaction between fibrillar Sup35p or Sup35pNM and molecular chaperones could lead to the depletion of specific molecular chaperones from the cellular pool and perturbed homeostasis. Such changes might (i) impact [PSI+] propagation as it is highly dependent on the expression levels of a number of molecular chaperones (40Tuite M.F. Cox B.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 878-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and/or (ii) have major effects, in particular in cells where the folding capacities are limited, as the expression of polyglutamine expansions disrupts the global balance of protein-folding quality control, resulting in the loss of function of diverse metastable proteins (10Gidalevitz Y. Ben-Zvi A. Ho K.H. Brignull H.R. Morimoto R.I. Science. 2006; 311: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Our recent in vitro studies revealed that the assembly of Sup35p can be finely tuned by the amount of available molecular chaperones (24Krzewska J. Melki R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 822-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus the finding that the efficiency of [PSI+] induction by Sup35p fibrils is higher than that of Sup35pNM fibrils certainly requires further investigation. The depletion of the functional pool of molecular chaperones within the cells by one kind of fibril might also allow the de novo formation of Sup35p propagons, thus leading to the observed increased efficiency of [PSI+] occurrence. Further identification of the molecular chaperones that bind to fibrillar Sup35p and Sup35pNM upon addition of the fibrils into yeast cell extracts by proteomic, biochemical, and structural approaches should allow a better understanding of the differences in the efficiency of [PSI+] induction. A quantitative analysis of [PSI+] induction by Sup35p and Sup35pNM fibrils pre-incubated in the presence of the molecular chaperones identified by the approach described above should allow assessment of the specific effect of each molecular chaperone, which in turn will contribute to the identification of the most infectious Sup35p particles and the characterization of [PSI+] propagation process.

https://openalex.org/W2022794050,"Purβ is a gene regulatory factor belonging to a family of highly conserved nucleic acid-binding proteins related by their ability to preferentially bind single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences rich in purine nucleotides. In conjunction with Purα, Purβ has been implicated in transcriptional and translational repression of genes encoding contractile proteins found in the heart and vasculature. Although several models of sequence-specific DNA recognition, strand separation, and activator inhibition by oligomeric Purα and Purβ have been proposed, it is currently unclear whether protein-protein interaction is a prerequisite to, or a consequence of nucleic acid binding. In this study, a recombinant protein purification scheme was devised to yield homogenous mouse Purβ devoid of nucleic acid. Recombinant Purβ was then subjected to light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses to assess the size, shape, and oligomeric state of the purified protein in solution. Results of laser light scattering and sedimentation velocity experiments indicated that Purβ reversibly self-associates in the absence of nucleic acid. Both approaches independently showed that the hydrodynamic shape of the Purβ homodimer is markedly asymmetric and non-spherical. Sedimentation velocity analyses indicated that dimeric Purβ has a sedimentation coefficient of 3.96 Svedberg, a frictional coefficient ratio (f/f0) of 1.60, and a hydrodynamic radius of 4.43 nm. These values were consistent with those determined by independent dynamic light scattering studies. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses confirmed that Purβ self-associates in a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium characterized by a Kd = 1.13 ± 0.27 μm.

Purα and Purβ are members of a highly conserved family of nucleic acid-binding proteins related by primary structure and a propensity to interact with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SMαA, smooth muscle α-actin; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; LLS, laser light scattering; DLS, dynamic light scattering; RI, refractive index; Ni-NTA, nickelnitrilotriacetic acid; DT, translational diffusion coefficient. or RNA sequences rich in purine nucleotides (for review, see Ref. 1Gallia G.L. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The founding member of this family, Purα, was initially identified by virtue of its ability to bind in a strand-specific manner to (GGN)n repeat-containing sequences (so called PUR elements) commonly found in gene flanking regions and in or near origins of DNA replication (2Bergemann A.D.

Purβ was similarly identified based on PUR element-dependent expression cloning using regulatory ssDNA sequences derived from human c-myc (2Bergemann A.D. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and mouse smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA) genes (13Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P. K Strauch A. R Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26726-26733Google Scholar). Like Purα, Purβ has also been reported to function as a transcription factor and, in the case of genes encoding SMαA and α-myosin heavy chain, to act in concert with Purα to repress gene expression at the level of transcription and translation (14Kelm Jr., R.J.

Hence, in addition to their ability to bind ssDNA in a sequence-specific manner, interaction with RNA appears to be a critical biochemical property of the Pur family of proteins for modulation of mRNA translation and transport (16Chepenik L.G.

R Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26726-26733Google Scholar). Biochemical investigation of deletion mutants has shown that each protein possesses a minimal ssDNA/RNA binding domain composed of a unique set of highly homologous sequence repeats (4Johnson E.M.

The most significant sequence differences between Purα and Purβ exist near the N and C termini, suggesting that each protein may have evolved to perform distinct functions (13Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P. K Strauch A. R Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26726-26733Google Scholar). Purα and Purβ have been reported to bind to a PUR element in a highly asymmetric polypurine/polypyrimidine tract located in the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SMαA gene (22Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that strand-specific binding by Purα/Purβ to this element disrupts a core MCAT enhancer motif, thereby repressing SMαA promoter activity in cultured fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (23Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). That Purα and Purβ function as inhibitors of SMαA expression is of particular interest due to the essential role played by SMαA in vascular contraction (24Schildmeyer L.A. Braun R. Taffet G. Debiasi M. Burns A.E. Bradley A. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), cell motility (25Ronnov-Jessen L. Petersen O.W. J.

Matsuzaki M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2288-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Despite biochemical similarities, gain-of-function studies suggest that Purα and Purβ are not redundant in terms of their transcriptional repressor activity toward the full-length mouse SMαA promoter in transfected vascular smooth muscle cells (21Kelm Jr., R.J.

In light of the specific protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-protein interactions attributed to Purα and Purβ and their potential relevance in modulating cell growth and differentiation, a need has emerged for the elucidation of the biophysical factors governing nucleic acid recognition. The mechanism of DNA binding is of particular interest since DNA is thought to exist primarily in a double-stranded B-form helical configuration in vivo. Because Purα and Purβ preferentially bind to ssDNA or, in some cases, stem-loop (non-B-form) structures (30Ban C. Chung S. Park D.S. Shim Y.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e110Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), this aspect of Pur protein function has been investigated to a greater degree. Several reports have indicated that Purα is capable of helix destabilization despite showing no intrinsic helicase or ATPase activity (31Darbinian N. Gallia G.L. Khalili K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Wortman M.J. Johnson E.M. Bergemann A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1743: 64-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This has led to speculation that Pur proteins may promote strand displacement by opportunistic binding to transiently formed ssDNA structures. This notion is supported by the finding that the 5′-MCAT enhancer region of the SMαA promoter has the propensity to adopt a partially unpaired configuration in response to transforming growth factor β1 signaling (33Becker N.A. Kelm Jr., R.J. Vrana J. A Getz M. J Maher, III L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15384-15391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another potentially important aspect of DNA binding that was hinted at by previous studies involves the oligomeric state of Pur proteins in the presence and absence of ssDNA. Experiments reported by Kelm et al. (22Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J. J Elder P. K Strauch A. R Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggested that Purα and Purβ bound to a SMαA promoter-derived PUR element as either hetero- or homodimeric nucleoprotein complexes. However, the conditions used in those experiments did not permit determination of whether or not dimerization was a prerequisite for, or a consequence of ssDNA binding. In this regard, a report by Gallia et al. (34Gallia G.L. Darbinian N. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 334-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) has pointed to a critical role for RNA in mediating self-association of Purα. In the present study we elucidate the quaternary structure of purified recombinant Purβ by employing hydrodynamic and thermodynamic approaches to examine the macromolecular character of nucleic-acid free Purβ in solution. Size exclusion chromatography coupled to static and dynamic light scattering-based detection systems revealed Purβ to be an asymmetric protein capable of homodimeric self-association. This principal finding was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation which established that mouse Purβ does indeed exist in a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium characterized by a dissociation constant of ∼1 μm in the absence of nucleic acid. Hydrodynamic analyses further suggested that homodimeric Purβ assumes a non-spherical conformation in solution. We propose a model in which dimerization may affect ssDNA binding in a manner regulated by a mass action-governed self-association of Purβ. This type of a mechanism may be particularly relevant to pathophysiological states of the heart and vasculature where elevated Purβ levels have been noted (15Gupta M. Sueblinvong V. Raman J.

Cell pellets equivalent to 4 liters were allowed to thaw in 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and completely resuspended on ice. Protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A were each added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 0.1 mm. Lysis was facilitated by the addition of egg white lysozyme (Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubation on ice for 20 min with occasional stirring. The cell suspension was sonicated with a Branson Sonifier model 150 (setting 10) for a total of six 10-s bursts with 1-min incubations on ice between bursts. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. A total of 5 ml of 50% Ni-NTA-agarose slurry (Qiagen) was added to the cleared lysate followed by 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 1 m. Bovine pancreatic DNase I and RNase A (Sigma) were each added to 59 and 92 units/ml, respectively (based on manufacturer specified activities), and the lysate-Ni-NTA-agarose mixture was slowly rocked for 2 h at room temperature. The lysate-resin mixture was then gently centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to pellet the Ni-NTA-agarose. Supernatant was removed, and 25 ml of buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol plus protease inhibitors) was added to the resin. The mixture was then incubated ∼14 h at 4 °C with slow rocking. Gentle centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C was used to pellet the resin, which was subsequently resuspended in buffer A and loaded into a 1.5-cm diameter column. The rest of the purification procedure was carried out at room temperature. The resin was washed with buffer A until the absorbance of the flow through at 280 nm reached a base-line level (A280 ≤ 0.02). N-HisPurβ was eluted by application of buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Eluted protein was concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Centriprep YM-10, Millipore). Size exclusion chromatography was carried out on a 1.5 × 98-cm column packed with Sephacryl ® 200 HR resin (Sigma) equilibrated in buffer E (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The optical density of the eluate was monitored with a GE Healthcare model UV-1 UV-visible detector. The column was calibrated using bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c protein standards (Sigma). Fractions corresponding to the major peak of dimeric N-HisPurβ were pooled and concentrated as described above. Quality Control Measures and Quantification of N-HisPurβ—Relative purity of N-HisPurβ was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of protein reduced with 300 mm β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% (40:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) mini-gels. Preparations used for hydrodynamic studies were judged to be >95% homogenous under reducing conditions. To assess the level of nucleic acid contamination, base-line-corrected absorbance spectra of purified N-HisPurβ were obtained using a Cary Bio100 dual beam spectrophotometer (Varian). A theoretical molar extinction spectrum of N-HisPurβ was calculated using SEDNTERP software (36Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) based on the method of Pace et al. (37Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically assuming an extinction coefficient of 18,610 m–1 cm–1 at a wavelength of 280 nm and a monomeric relative molecular weight of 35,168.6 (calculated using SEDNTERP). As an extra quality control measure, purified N-HisPurβ (1.4 mg in 500 μl), was extracted twice with an equal volume of buffered phenol followed by extraction with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and an equal volume of chloroform. The aqueous phase of the extract was lyophilized and redissolved in ultrapure water 3 times and then dissolved one final time in 200 μl of ultra pure water. A base-line-corrected absorbance spectrum of the lyophilized extract was obtained to ensure the absence of a peak at 260 nm. Light Scattering Analysis of N-HisPurβ—Molecular mass and hydrodynamic radius measurements of N-HisPurβ in solution were made by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)-coupled light scattering techniques. These experiments were performed at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Biophysics Facility, Yale University, New Haven, CT as described (38Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Techniques. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A comprehensive description of the experimental system and methods used for analysis of laser light scattering (LLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) data are provided in the online data supplement. Sedimentation Velocity Analysis of N-HisPurβ—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman/Coulter Optima XL-I/XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An50Ti rotor. Radial concentration distributions were measured at 50,000 rpm and 4 °C using Rayleigh interference optics. Protein samples were gel filtered over a 1.5 × 98-cm Sephacryl ® 200 HR size-exclusion column pre-equilibrated and eluted with buffer E as a final step before sedimentation. The fraction corresponding to the absorbance maximum of the presumed dimeric peak was used to prepare a dilution series of N-HisPurβ over a 10-fold concentration range starting at 43.5 μm. The reference buffer consisted of a buffer E eluate from the size exclusion column. Blank-subtracted Rayleigh interference scans were recorded at 1-min intervals. Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed by the dc/dt method to generate apparent sedimentation coefficient distributions, g(s*) (40Stafford W.F. II I Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), with the use of DCDT+ software (41Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Direct fitting of time-resolved concentration difference curves (Δc versus radius) to numerical solutions of the Lamm equation describing multiple, interacting species models and kinetic models was performed using SEDANAL v4.3 software (42Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Temperature-corrected values for the partial specific volume of N-HisPurβ (ν¯) as well as density (ρ) and viscosity (η) of buffer E were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (36Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Resulting values are as follows: ν¯ = 0.7109 ml g–1, ρ = 1.0149 g ml–1, and η = 0.1635 g cm–1 s–1. Molecular shape modeling was also carried out with SEDNTERP. Protein integrity was assessed after sedimentation by SDS-PAGE to ensure that the samples were intact. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis of N-HisPurβ—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out in cells fitted with six-sector charcoal-Epon centerpieces (1.2-cm path). Protein and reference buffer samples were prepared as described above. A dilution series of N-HisPurβ was made from the dimeric peak fraction off SEC over a 10-fold concentration range. Sedimentation was carried out at rotor speeds of 22,000, 28,000, and 35,000 rpm at 4 °C. Five scans were averaged to remove noise. Equilibrium was judged to be achieved by the superposition of scans taken 6 h apart and by analysis with the MATCH package implemented by HETEROANALYSIS software (43Cole J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 212-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine the stoichiometry of the reaction and the associated equilibrium constant, blank corrected sedimentation equilibrium data were fit using the HETEROANALYSIS software to expansions of the general Equation 1. A(r,λ)=∑iϵi,λ/ci,0exp[Mi∗ϕ(r2−r02)] (Eq. 1) Equation 1 represents a summation over all species i, where A(r, λ) is the radius-dependent absorbance at radial position r and wavelength λ, ϵiλ is the molar extinction coefficient, l is the path length, ci0 is the molar concentration of the ith species at the arbitrary reference radial position r0, Mi* refers to the buoyant molecular weight of the ith species equal to Mi(1−ν¯iρ), where Mi is the relative molecular weight, ν¯i is the partial specific volume, and ρ is the solvent density. ϕ is equal to ω2/RT, in which ω is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant (8.314 × 107 erg/mol·K), and T is the absolute temperature. Model specific expansions of Equation 1 included single ideal species, single non-ideal species, monomer-N-mer equilibria, monomer-dimer with incompetent monomer, monomer-dimer with incompetent dimer, and monomer-N-mer-Q-mer equilibria. Model-specific equations are listed as supplemental material. Purification of Nucleic Acid-free Recombinant Purβ—To investigate the self-association of N-HisPurβ it was essential to ensure that preparations of the recombinant protein be devoid of co-purifying DNA and/or RNA. To accomplish this task we developed a protocol that included nucleases during E. coli lysis and performed Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography under high ionic strength conditions to promote removal of weakly associated nucleic acids. A final SEC step was also included to eliminate high molecular weight aggregates and low molecular weight fragments. Using the method described herein, N-HisPurβ was purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Although the molecular weight of N-His-Purβ calculated on the basis of its amino acid sequence is 35,168.6, it appears to migrate by SDS-PAGE as an ∼43-kDa peptide under reducing conditions. The unusual electrophoretic mobility of the recombinant protein is consistent with the reported mobility of native Purβ expressed in fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (13Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P. K Strauch A. R Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26726-26733Google Scholar, 23Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggests that the His tag is not the major contributing factor to the non-ideal electrophoretic behavior of N-HisPurβ. To assess the extent of nucleic acid contamination, we compared the absorbance spectrum (normalized to the molar extinction at 280 nm of 18,610 m–1 cm–1) to a hypothetical molar extinction spectrum of N-HisPurβ, generated from amino acid content (Fig. 1B). This comparison showed only minimal deviations between the calculated and experimental spectra in the region around 260 nm. It would be predicted that stoichiometric quantities of co-purifying nucleic acids would result in a large spectral difference in this range since nucleoside-5′-monophosphates have a molar extinction coefficient on the average of 104 M–1 cm–1 at or near 260 nm (44Cavaluzzi M.J. Borer P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Furthermore, absorbance spectra of phenol-chloroform extracts of purified N-HisPurβ preparations showed no species with a λmax of 260 nm (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that the preparations of N-His-Purβ used in this study were free of co-purifying nucleic acids. Based on information obtained while optimizing the purification protocol, buffer E (see “Experimental Procedures”) was chosen as the buffer condition for all sedimentation and light-scattering experiments. We have determined that the solubility of N-HisPurβ relies heavily on ionic strength and reducing agent concentration (data not shown). Dialysis of protein at moderate concentrations (∼1 mg/ml) and low salt conditions leads to loss of protein (likely deposition on vessel surface, as sample can be recovered by the addition of high salt buffers). The salt concentration of buffer E (200 mm NaCl) was determined to be the minimum quantity to limit this effect and to maximize N-HisPurβ stability. Hydrodynamic Analysis of Recombinant Purβ by Size Exclusion Chromatography-coupled Light Scattering Techniques—A series of physical techniques that make use of macromolecular light scattering phenomena were used to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of N-HisPurβ in solution. SEC-LLS-DLS is a well suited means of investigating the hydrodynamic character of proteins. It is non-destructive, and each individual light scattering detection technique can be performed in series after a size fractionation step. The use of SEC as a preliminary step to light scattering can eliminate some of the ambiguity created in performing weight-average measurements (38Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. J. Biomol. Techniques. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 45Takagi T. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 506: 409-416Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The results of applying the SEC-LLS to solutions of N-His-Purβ reveal an asymmetric distribution of refractive index (RI) and molar mass measurements in the sole eluting peak of N-HisPurβ, as compared with a bovine serum albumin standard (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with a polydisperse mixture that elutes as a single, albeit asymmetric peak. On the sole basis of RI signal, one might surmise that the asymmetric shape of the elution peak could arise from interaction of N-His-Purβ with the column matrix. Although this could conceivably cause a tailing effect on elution, it would not cause a broadening in the distribution of weight-average molar mass measurements"
