https://openalex.org/W1519383911,"Synthetic cluster glycosides containing either one, two, or three galactosyl or lactosyl residues per ligand were used to test the effect of carbohydrate clustering on binding by the rabbit hepatic Gal/GalNAc-binding lectin using either isolated rabbit hepatocytes or the solubilized, affinity-purified lectin. The tris- and bis-glycosides were superior to the mono-glycosides for inhibition of 125I-asialoorosomucoid binding to rabbit hepatocytes at 0 degrees C. The concentrations of the tris-glycosides required for 50% inhibition of 125I-asialoorosomucoid binding (4-8 microM) to hepatocytes were 50-100 times lower than the concentrations of the corresponding mono-glycosides required for 50% inhibition (400-500 microM). The isolated lectin, however, did not effectively discriminate between the mono-, bis-, and tris-glycosides, possibly indicating an organizational difference between the lectin in the cell membrane and the isolated lectin. When the cluster glycosides were labeled with 125I-tyrosine, it was shown that the tris- and bis-galactosides were bound to the hepatocytes at 37 degrees C, and that binding was followed by a step that led to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid resistance, probably internalization. The process could be specifically inhibited by the neoglycoprotein Gal44-AI-bovine serum albumin, or by IgG specific for the hepatic lectin, but not by preimmune IgG. Internalization of the cluster glycosides did not lead to accumulation of ligand inside the cell, nor to degradation. Instead, the ligands were quickly released from the cells."

We have now demonstrated that glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase is inhibited, reversibly and completely, when membrane bound. The inhibition was competitive with respect to NAD+ and arsenate, but was noncompetitive with glyceraldehyde-3-P. Peptide fragments containing the NH2-terminal 23 residues of band 3 also inhibited the enzyme and displaced it from ghosts. Thus, the red cell membrane binding site for glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase is the same as that for aldolase, the polyanionic NH2-terminal region of the band 3 polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1645602382,"The Na+ and Ca2+ transport properties of cultured murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells have been investigated. We have previously shown that amiloride prevents dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cell differentiation via inhibition of an essential Ca2+ influx (levenson, R., Housman, D., and Cantley, L. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 5948-5952). Here we show that external Na+ inhibits Ca2+ influx and stimulates Ca2+ efflux from uninduced MEL cells. Increasing the internal Na+ concentration by a brief incubation of cells with ouabain stimulates the rate of 45Ca2+ influx. Amiloride (40 microM) completely blocks the external Na+-stimulated 45Ca2+ efflux and external Na+-inhibitable 45Ca2+ influx. The same concentration of amiloride had no significant effect on net Na+ uptake. These results suggest that a significant fraction of Ca2+ flux across the MEL cell plasma membrane occurs via a Na+/Ca2+ antiport system and that amiloride prevents differentiation by blocking Ca2+ influx through this system. The importance of a Na+/Ca2+ antiport system for MEL cell differentiation is supported by the following observation: increasing the cellular Na+ level by a brief treatment with ouabain plus monensin accelerates MEL cell commitment as effectively as adding the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. We suggest that dimethyl sulfoxide induces MEL cell differentiation by inhibiting the Na+ pump and consequently allowing Ca2+ influx through the Na+/Ca2+ antiport."
https://openalex.org/W2021289026,"The electrophysiological effects of ethanol in low doses (5 to 20 millimoles per liter or 23 to 92 milligrams per 100 milliliters) were examined intracellularly in CA1 cells of rat hippocampus in vitro. Inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic potentials were increased when ethanol was applied to the respective synaptic terminal regions. Postsynaptically, ethanol caused a moderate hyperpolarization with increased membrane conductance, even when synaptic transmission was blocked. Ethanol augmented the hyperpolarization that followed repetitive firing or that followed the eliciting of calcium spikes in the presence of tetrodotoxin, but not the rapid afterhyperpolarization in calcium-free medium. Ethanol appears to augment calcium-mediated mechanisms both pre- and postsynaptically."
https://openalex.org/W1522221384,"A pH difference (acid inside) across the platelet plasma membrane increases both the rate and extent of serotonin accumulation inside plasma membrane vesicles. Even in the absence of other transmembrane ion gradients, this pH difference (delta pH) serves as the sole driving force for serotonin accumulation, leading to a serotonin concentration 18-fold higher inside the vesicle. This process requires Na+ and is blocked by imipramine, indicating that it is mediated by the serotonin transporter. At physiological pH, internal K+ is counter-transported with serotonin, and high internal K+ stimulates transport maximally. Internal K+ also blocks the delta pH stimulation of serotonin transport. Conversely, low internal pH (5.6) inhibits the ability of internal K+ to stimulate transport. This apparent competition between K+ and protons suggests that delta pH drives serotonin accumulation through counter-transport with protons, and that serotonin is transported in its cationic form."
https://openalex.org/W1594494653,"Two isoproteins of calf liver metallothionein (MT) have been isolated, purified, and characterized by atomic absorption, ultraviolet absorption, electron spin resonance, and 113Cd nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Native calf liver MT was found to contain both Cu+ and Zn2+ in a mole ratio of approximately 0.75. Selective replacement of the native Zn2+ with 113Cd2+ can be accomplished in vitro by adding 113CdCl2 to the homogenate before chromatography. Both isoproteins of metallothionein thus prepared contain approximately 3.9 g atoms of Cd2+ and 2.6 g atoms of Cu+/mol of protein. No ESR signal was found, indicating that either Cu+ or antiferromagnetically coupled Cu2+ is the form of copper present. Arguments in support of the former state are presented. Unlike the native 113Cd,Zn MT from rabbit liver, calf liver 113Cd,Cu MT exhibits a remarkably simple 113Cd NMR spectrum. Four major resonances were found for each isoprotein, in the same positions as the resonances assigned to the metals in the four-metal cluster A of rabbit liver metallothionein. This conclusion was confirmed by homonuclear decoupling experiments. This result in conjunction with the stoichiometry of bound metal ions found in the native protein suggests that Cu+ is bound selectively to the three-metal cluster B sites, and that one homogeneous protein fraction predominates. Three minor resonances to higher field are observed in the 113Cd NMR spectrum of calf liver MT-1 and one in calf liver MT-2, which may be attributed to a small fraction of cluster B with one Cu+ replaced by 113Cd2+. The possible biological significance of the different metal ion specificities of cluster A versus cluster B is discussed."

A direct correlation between iron content and specific activity has been demonstrated through a comparison of enzyme activity and iron bound per subunit for various enzyme preparations and a measurement of the remaining activity upon partial and total removal of the iron by chelation. Apoenzyme has been prepared that can be reactivated by addition of Fe(II) aerobically or of Fe(III) anaerobically. A comparison of the native and reconstituted phenylalanine hydroxylase shows the latter behaves identically upon affinity and Chelex column chromatography as well as precipitation with ammonium sulfate supporting its close similarity to the native enzyme."

A neuroregulatory role for thyroid hormones, strongly supported by the observations, may account for their marked effects on behavior and the activity of the autonomic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1538137511,"Effects of monovalent cations on alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) transport were examined in the marine bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus. In K+-containing cells, AIB was actively accumulated only in the presence of Na+, and the addition of K+ had essentially no effect. On the other hand, K+-depleted and Na+-loaded cells required K+ as well as Na+ for the accumulation of AIB against its concentration gradient. The characterization of the roles of Na+ and K+ in AIB transport was performed by manipulation of intra- and extracellular cation compositions. K+ concentration gradient (K+in greater than K+out) was not essential for the Na+-dependent AIB uptake. Na+ extrusion against its concentration gradient in Na+-loaded cells occurred only in the presence of K+(Rb+). Half-maximal stimulations of the Na+ extrusion and AIB uptake by K+ were observed at K+ concentration near apparent Km for K+ transport. Finally, in the presence of the Na+ electrochemical gradient (toward the inside), K+ was not necessary for AIB uptake. From these results, it was concluded that the Na+-dependent AIB uptake is driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient across the membrane and that K+ is required for AIB uptake only for the generation of the Na+ electrochemical gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1576851852,"Proteoglycan Type H formed by incubation of chick embryo epiphyseal cartilages with [14C]glucosamine altered its buoyant density as the concentration of SO4(2-) in medium was lowered from 300 to 0 microM. At the highest SO4(2-) concentration, the labeled product was essentially identical with unlabeled proteoglycan Type H (i.e. the molecules already preformed in ovo) with respect to the buoyant density and hyaluronic acid-binding activity. With decreasing the SO4(2-) concentration in medium, the products showed a gradual decrease in the buoyant density with no apparent change in the hyaluronic acid-binding activity. This change of buoyant density was directly related to a decrease in average sulfation degree of the chondroitin sulfate moiety, which in turn reflected an increase in the ratio of low sulfated chondroitin chains (Chn) to high sulfated chondroitin sulfate chains (CS) per proteoglycan molecule. At intermediate SO4(2-) concentrations, 50 and 100 microM, the labeled products were of hybrid type containing both Chn and CS chains. Treatment of such hybrids with trypsin yielded, in each case, a mixture of CS- and Chn-carrying peptide fragments with an average buoyant density slightly lower than that of the parent proteoglycan. In no case were these fragments separated into two discrete groups corresponding to Chn-rich peptides and CS-rich peptides, respectively, suggesting that the two types of polysaccharide chain are rather evenly distributed along the core protein."
https://openalex.org/W1585422037,"The reaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) with deoxyhemoglobin is confined to 2 residues in the beta chains, i.e. the alpha-amino group of valine 1 and the epsilon-amino group of lysine 82, both of which are located in the polyphosphate binding site. The major product is a hemoglobin in which only the two NH2-terminal amino groups are substituted (symmetric diPLPHb). It is formed by subunit rearrangement of monoPLPHb which is the initial product of the pyridoxylation under anaerobic conditions. TetraPLPHb, with substitutions at lysine 82 and valine 1 of both beta chains is found as a minor component. It results from subunit exchange of asymmetric diPLPHb consisting of one unmodified alpha beta dimer and one which is pyridoxylated at both sites. Anaerobic electrophoresis and oxygenation curves show that this reaction is readily reversed by mixing the tetrasubstituted derivative with unmodified hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1528492214,"Levels of elastin production in explant culture of fetal sheep nuchal ligament and corresponding levels of translatable elastin mRNA were determined in parallel studies during a period of rapid growth of the embryo. The identity of the explant culture and cell-free products was confirmed by peptide mapping, immunoprecipitation, and the characteristic lack of histidine and methionine. Elastin production was quantitated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioimmune precipitation. The translation products could be labeled with methionine only when NH2-terminally donated as f-Met-tRNAfMet. Explant cultures showed a large rise in elastin production from 70 days after conception to 150 days after conception. Cell-free translation of RNA demonstrated a parallel in elastin mRNA levels and in elastin mRNA per cell. It appears, therefore, that the marked emphasis the differentiating nuchal ligament places on elastin production is modulated, at least in part, by the quantities of available elastin mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1532541457,"Abstract A sulfoglycosphingolipid containing N-acetylgalactosamine has been isolated from the lipid extract of rat kidney. The isolation procedure involved extraction of lipids with chloroform/methanol, alkaline methanolysis, and column chromatographies with DEAE-Sephadex and Silica beads. The components were N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, glucose, sphingoid bases, fatty acids, and sulfate in equimolar amounts. The yield of this sulfoglycolipid was about 24 nmol/g of tissue, which was about 13% of that of galactosylceramide 3-sulfate from rat kidney. By infrared spectroscopy, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, periodate oxidation, solvolysis, chromium trioxide oxidation, and methylation analysis of the native and partially degraded compound, the structure of this glycolipid is proposed to be GalNAc beta 1--4(HSO3-3)Gal beta 1--4Glc beta 1--1Cer."
https://openalex.org/W1598434179,"Chemotaxis by a macrophage cell line, RAW264, is specifically inhibited by the intracellular accumulation of 3-deazaadenosylhomocysteine (3-deaza-AdoHcy). Intracellular accumulation of 3-deaza-AdoHcy is the result of incubation of the cells with 3-deazaadenosine, a compound that can function both as a substrate and as an inhibitor of adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase. Accumulation of AdoHcy per se, brought about in chemotactic cell lines by incubation with either 3-deazaadenosine or with 3-deazaaristeromycin, does not affect chemotaxis. The specific role of 3-deazaadenosine as an inhibitor of macrophage cell line chemotaxis is supported by the following findings. Another macrophage cell line, RAW309CR, is resistant to the inhibition of chemotaxis by 3-deazaadenosine, and the resistance can be ascribed to the failure to accumulate 3-deaza-AdoHcy in this cell line. It is noteworthy that both RAW264 and RAW309CR accumulate similar amounts of AdoHcy after incubation with 3-deazaadenosine. The difference in the accumulation of 3-deaza-AdoHcy in RAW264 and RAW309CR is explained by the finding that sonicates of RAW264 rapidly form 3-deaza-AdoHcy but sonicates of RAW309CR do not. Both hydrolysis of AdoHcy and the inhibition of the hydrolysis of AdoHcy by 3-deazaadenosine are the same in sonicates of the two macrophage cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W1587173884,"A hypothesis that the existence of common binding sites for acetyl and malonyl moieties on the animal fatty acid synthetase necessitates that free CoA be available continuously to facilitate unloading of inappropriately bound acetyl or malonyl moieties, allowing initial access of an acetyl moiety and subsequent access by malonyl moieties to the site of chain elongation, was formulated and tested. The unloading of acetyl or malonyl moieties from the enzyme was blocked by a CoA-scavenging system and the enzyme was unable to reload with the other substrate; the inhibition was relieved by the addition of CoA or pantetheine. The freely reversible nature of the loading/unloading reaction was established as follows. CoA or pantetheine, but not S-acetyl-N-acetylcysteamine, could act as donor or acceptor for acetyl moieties in the loading or unloading reactions; incubation of fatty acid synthetase, acetyl-CoA, and [G-3H]CoA resulted in the formation of acetyl-[G-3H]CoA in an amount consistent with the predicted equilibrium; and addition of a high concentration of CoA shifted the equilibrium toward unloading, leaving most of the substrate-binding sites vacant. These results support our hypothesis and provide a plausible explanation both for the requirement of free CoA by the fatty acid synthetase and for the observed inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by high concentrations of CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1517218624,"3-Mercaptopyruvate, generally believed to be formed by enzymatic transamination of L-cysteine and by the oxidative deamination of L-cysteine, has been found to exist in solution, in equilibrium with the cyclic dimer, 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-dithiane-2,5-dicarboxylic acid; the equilibrium markedly favors the cyclic dimer in aqueous solution at pH 5-7. However, in neutral solutions, and especially in alkaline solution, 3-mercaptopyruvate undergoes very rapid and irreversible conversion to an acyclic aldol dimer. The rate of aldol dimerization is about 100 times greater than that of pyruvate dimerization under comparable conditions. Thus, 10 mM solutions of 3-mercaptopyruvate at pH 7.2 lose about 75% of their lactate dehydrogenase reactivity in 90 min at 25 degrees C. The present findings explain the previous observation that 3-mercaptopyruvate exhibits anomalous behavior in transamination with glutamine. Oxidative deamination of L-cysteine by L-amino acid oxidase yields the highly reactive imine, 2-imino-3-mercaptopropionic acid, which can be quantitatively trapped with semicarbazide. In the absence of semicarbazide, almost quantitative formation of ammonia from L-cysteine occurs with only a 10-20% yield of alpha-keto acid, none of which is 3-mercaptopyruvate; however, 3-mercaptopyruvate may be trapped as 3-mercaptolactate when the oxidase reaction is carried out in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase and NADH. One of the physiological functions of glutamine transaminase may be to convert 3-mercaptopyruvate to L-cysteine, thus preventing its loss through further transformations. In the course of this work it was found that hemithioketals (formed by reaction of cysteine with alpha-keto acids) are substrates of L-amino acid oxidase. Evidence for the cyclic dimer in the solid and vapor states of 3-mercaptopyruvate has been found through infrared and mass spectroscopic observations."
https://openalex.org/W1481062076,"Abstract The reaction of adenosine 5'[1-thio-2-cyanoethyl diphosphate], beta-cyanoethyl-ADP alpha S, with cyanogen bromide in aqueous solution near neutrality leads to the formation of adenosine 5'-[2-cyanoethyl diphosphate], beta-cyanoethyl-ADP, in good yield. Reaction of Rp or Sp beta-cyanoethyl-ADP alpha S in H218O produces Sp or Rp beta-cyanoethyl-[alpha-18O]ADP, respectively, with inversion of configuration. Removal of the cyanoethyl groups in KOH produces Sp or Rp [alpha-18O]ADP. Desulfurization of chiral phosphorothioates by reaction with cyanogen bromide in H218O or H217O or of chiral [17O] or [18O] phosphorothioates in water appears to be a convenient method for synthesizing chiral phosphates for use in a variety of investigations of the mechanisms of enzymatic cleavage of P-O bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1493270718,"Rapid-scan and fixed-wavelength stopped-flow spectrophotometry were used to characterize the 5-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate (PMS)/reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide couple at pH 7.4. Under anaerobic conditions, NADH reduces PMS to 5,10-dihydro-5-methylphenazine with a second order rate constant of 3.8 +/- 0.4 X 10(3) M-1 s-1. Oxygen reacts with 5,10-dihydro-5-methylphenazine to form PMS with a rate constant of about 180 M-1 s-1. When NADH reacts with PMS under aerobic conditions, a situation commonly encountered in carrying out routine enzymatic assays, the NADH reduction reaction and the O2 oxidation reaction proceed simultaneously with rate constants essentially the same as those determined for the two isolated reactions. The anaerobic photoreaction of PMS at pH = 7.4, which was studied by optical absorption spectroscopy, produces the 1-hydroxy-5-methylphenazinium cation (pyocyanine) and 5,10-dihydro-5-methylphenazine in nearly equal concentrations. When oxygen is present, the only detectable product is pyocyanine. These results, particularly the relatively slow rate of reaction between PMS and NADH, are used to point out potential complications in the use of the PMS/NADH couple."

https://openalex.org/W2128688605,"The use of scattered electrons alone for direct imaging of biological specimens makes it possible to obtain structural information at atomic and near-atomic spatial resolutions of 0.3 to 0.5 nanometer. While this is not as good as the resolution possible with x-ray crystallography, such an approach provides structural information rapidly on individual macromolecules that have not been, and possibly cannot be, crystallized. Analysis of the spectrum of energies of scattered electrons and imaging of the latter with characteristic energy bands within the spectrum produces a powerful new technique of atomic microanalysis. This technique, which has a spatial resolution of about 0.5 nanometer and a minimum detection sensitivity of about 50 atoms of phosphorus, is especially useful for light atom analysis and appears to have applications in molecular biology, cell biology, histology, pathology, botany, and many other fields."
https://openalex.org/W1516331966,"The question of whether the M1- and M2-type isozymes of pyruvate kinase are synthesized by a common mRNA was examined by isolating total RNA from rat skeletal muscle and AH-130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells, which express the M1- and M2-type isozymes, respectively, and translating the preparations in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The newly synthesized pyruvate kinase subunits were compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing under the denaturing condition. The pyruvate kinase subunit synthesized from hepatoma cell RNA had a slightly larger molecular weight and higher pI value than the subunit from muscle RNA. When a mixture of the two RNAs was added to the lysate, the same result was obtained. Thus, it is concluded that the M1- and M2-type isozymes are translated from different messenger RNAs."

https://openalex.org/W1633486379,"Abstract Hormone activation of turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase is affected by temperature and by cis-vaccenic acid incorporation. This was correlated with changes in membrane fluidity which were previously assumed to affect lateral diffusion of the beta-adrenergic receptor (Rimon, G., Hanski, E., and Levitzki, A. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 4451-4460; Briggs, M. M., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 4461-4466). To test this hypothesis, we measured the lateral mobility of the fluorescent phospholipid N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE in turkey erythrocyte ghosts, using fluorescence photobleaching recovery. Ghosts labeled only in the external leaflet exhibited a linear Arrhenius plot of the lateral diffusion coefficient (D) with little change in the mobile fraction of NBD-PE between 45 and 5 degrees C. Labeling from both sides, however, yielded a break point (approximately 30 degrees C) in the Arrhenius plot and a 30% decrease in the mobile fraction of NBD-PE from 24 to 10 degrees C, indicating differences between the external and inner monolayers. The observed discontinuities are not due to gel-phase formation, since fluorescence depolarization of cis- and transparinaric acid did not reveal discontinuities at this temperature range. cis-Vaccenic acid incorporation did not markedly affect either D or the mobile fraction of NBD-PE at 25 degrees C. These results are discussed in view of the effects of temperature and cis-vaccenic acid incorporation on adenylate cyclase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1548802008,"Dietary treatment of rats for 2 weeks with clofibrate (ethyl 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylproprionate), a hypolipidemic drug, increased the ratio of mitochondrial protein to cellular DNA by 2-fold, yet the recovery, purity, and structural integrity of mitochondria from treated livers were identical with the controls. Apparent half-lives of total protein in control and treated mitochondria were measured using [14C]bicarbonate as an amino acid precursor and were found to be the same. In a double label study, the relative half-lives of total mitochondrial proteins or mitochondrial inner membrane, matrix, or outer compartment proteins were compared in control and treated livers. In no case did drug treatment alter the apparent rates of degradation of protein. Coulter counting of the mitochondrial fraction revealed a 2-fold increase in counts relative to cellular DNA but counts per mg of mitochondrial protein were the same as control. Cytochrome spectra of mitochondria or purified inner membranes were not qualitatively different in control versus treated preparations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoretic patterns of mitochondria or submitochondrial fractions were very similar for control and treated livers. Inner compartment marker enzymes were unchanged in specific activity, but monoamine oxidase, an outer compartment marker, was decreased in specific activity. Clofibrate treatment appears to result in an increased synthesis of the majority of mitochondrial protein. The effects of clofibrate are consistent with a model of mitochondrial turnover in which the control of outer compartment synthesis and degradation is different from that of the inner compartment. A model is proposed for mitochondrial genesis and degradation in normal and clofibrate-treated livers."

https://openalex.org/W1634664569,"The bovine uracil-DNA glycosylase previously isolated from thymocyte nuclei was further purified by 1 order of magnitude with the aid of affinity chromatography. The final preparation was totally devoid of DNase and apurinic or apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease activities, and it corresponded to purifications of 457-fold over the nuclear extract and of about 2000-fold over the crude tissue homogenate. Most of the general enzyme properties already described were confirmed. Furthermore, this mammalian uracil-DNA glycosylase was shown to bind specifically with polymerized and not with monomeric nucleotide compounds, while having a preference for double-stranded forms. It cleaved N-glycosyl linkages only at the deoxyuridyl units located in internal positions of polynucleotide chains. The enzyme also used RNA-DNA hybrids as functional substrates and was practically ineffective on deoxyuridyl residues at the 3'-ends of nucleic acids. The activity of the glycosylase was greatly impaired in assays with DNA substrates that contained amounts of AP sites exceeding 5 microM. The inhibitory concentrations of AP residues were about 100 times lower than those found equally effective for the other reaction product, i.e. free uracil, and were almost comparable to the Km values for deoxyuridyl nucleotides in the DNA substrates. This all appears as a modulation of the glycosylase catalysis by the relative amounts of its substrate and product structures in DNA. The data lead us to surmise that the removal of uracil from cellular DNA is functionally coupled to the expected elimination of the formed AP sites by specific endonucleases. Base-exchange and base-insertion experiments with the purified enzyme yielded negative results under various conditions. The glycosylase behaved essentially as a hydrolase which has no associated base-insertase properties and irreversibly excises uracil from DNA by a mechanism for channeling the process to the next steps of the repair pathway."

The divinyl-Mg-protoporphyrin-6-ester component exhibited red-shifted emission and excitation maxima at 591 and 424 nm respectively.

Each fragment is able to deliver iron to a chicken embryo red cell system for the biosynthesis of heme, FeNF being 44% more efficient than FeCF. The Fe fragments are on an average approximately 2 times less effective in delivering iron to the chicken embryo red cell than Fe2OT. The binding of FeNF and FeCF to CERC is essentially identical in terms of apparent association constant (K = 1.5 X 10(6) M-1, with respect to fragments) and the number of binding sites per cell at equilibrium (n = 2.9 X 10(4)); however, they differ significantly in their rates of delivering iron for heme synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1603390723,"We have investigated the regulation of the synthesis of each ribosomal protein during spore germination and in vegetatively growing cells of Dictyostelium discoideum. Germinating spores and exponentially growing amoebae were labeled with [35S]methionine and the individual ribosomal proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. Functional mRNA levels for ribosomal proteins were analyzed by translating the slime mold RNA in a wheat germ cell-free system and separating the translation products by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All slime mold ribosomal proteins were synthesized at every stage of spore germination and during vegetative growth; and the amount of synthesis of these proteins was highest at 1 to 2 h of germination. A comparison between the synthesis of ribosomal proteins in germinating spores with those in vegetatively growing cells suggests that although the majority of them seem to be similarly regulated, the regulation of the synthesis of some of the proteins may be different in both conditions. Although dormant spores lacked functional mRNAs for 16 ribosomal proteins, these mRNAs were detected as early as 1 h of germination. The mRNAs corresponding to all ribosomal proteins were present throughout germination, and their levels were highest at 2 h of germination. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the synthesis of the majority of ribosomal proteins during spore germination is regulated transcriptionally. However, vegetative amoebae lack three proteins (A, E, and L in our nomenclature), yet contain mRNA for these proteins that can be translated in vitro. Therefore, the synthesis of these proteins is apparently regulated translationally."

With soluble laminarin as substrate (0.67 mg/ml), the temperature optimum is 60 degrees C (pH 6.0) and the pH optimum is 5.4 (40 degrees C). The egg glucanase does not exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics, exhibiting instead sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 1.6. The maximum velocity is 80 mumol of glucose released from soluble laminarin min-1 mg-1 protein. The half-maximum velocity (at pH 6.0, 40 degrees C) occurs at about 58 micrograms of laminarin ml-1. The glucanase is inhibited by D-1,5-gluconolactone, D-erythritol, and DL-threitol. This affinity method of glucanase purification may be important in the study of glucanases from other sources."
https://openalex.org/W1555175497,"We have studied the catalytic, immunochemical, and electrophoretic properties of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase in hemolysates from 30 patients with a deficiency of this enzyme in six unrelated families. We have found that: 1) the level of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme activity and immunoreactive protein in the four homozygous deficient patients was less than 1% of control values; 2) adenine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme activity was uniformly decreased to approximately 25% of normal in all 26 heterozygotes studied while the level of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase immunoreactive protein was consistent within each kindred but ranged in value from 22% to 112% of control; and 3) protein blot analysis revealed a single isoelectric form of the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase subunit in hemolysate from normal controls and from every heterozygote except for patient M.R. who exhibited both a normal and a more acidic adenine phosphoribosyltransferase subunit species. These studies provide the first evidence for the existence of a variety of different mutations in the structural gene for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase in patients exhibiting a deficiency of enzyme activity. We further conclude from our data that: 1) the variant enzymes are more labile in vivo and/or catalytically nonfunctional, and 2) heterozygotes express only 25% of normal enzyme activity because the normal and variant enzyme subunits form a hybrid dimer which is either more labile or less catalytically active than the normal adenine phosphoribosyltransferase dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1582046475,"Membrane protein and glycoprotein changes during estrogen-induced differentiation of the chick oviduct were studied. Membrane preparations from chicks treated with diethylstilbestrol for 3, 6, 10, and 20 days; from chicks treated with hormone for 10 days and then withdrawn for 2 days; and from mature hens were incubated with either GDP-[14C]Man or GDP-[3H]Man. Double label analysis of proteins using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicates that labeling of proteins with apparent molecular weights of 91,000 and 57,000 is enhanced upon diethylstilbestrol treatment. The effect is reversed upon hormone withdrawal. Analysis of [14C]Man-proteins by SDS-PAGE and fluorography reveals at least 18 labeled proteins, confirms the double label gel results, and shows changes in three additional proteins. Estrogen-induced changes in membrane proteins and glycoproteins were also studied by Coomassie blue staining, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and autoradiography of 125I-concanavalin A binding following SDS-PAGE. Changes are observed in at least 9 Coomassie blue, 7 periodic acid-Schiff and 13 125I-concanavalin A bands. Some proteins are enhanced by estrogen treatment and are diminished upon withdrawal, whereas other proteins are diminished by estrogen treatment and are enhanced by withdrawal. Hen oviduct membrane preparations were labeled with combinations of UDP-GlcNAc, GDP-Man, and UDP-Glc. Tunicamycin inhibits incorporation of [3H]Man and [14C]GlcNAc into protein by 84% and 65%, respectively. SDS-PAGE reveals that transfer of GlcNAc to a 36,000 protein is the least sensitive to tunicamycin. SDS-PAGE of proteins labeled by incubation with GDP-[14C]Man and UDP-[3H]Glc indicate that the presence of Glc does not alter the typical Man-protein-labeling pattern and processing of Glc from individual acceptors uniform."
https://openalex.org/W1534229817,"Radiodecomposition of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin has been followed by a variety of assays, including an ion-exchange assay which reflects the ability of toxin to bind to receptor and a competition assay that is sensitive to changes in specific activity. The rate of degradation of labeled toxin can be much faster than the decay rate of 125I. The radiodecomposition rate increases with increasing specific activity but is dramatically reduced by the addition of bovine serum albumin. Our results indicate that radiodecomposition affects labeled and unlabeled molecules equally and is due mostly to secondary radiodecomposition. As expected from this mechanism, we have found that radiodecomposition does not affect the specific activity of 125I-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin. Our results from iodinated preparations of moderate specific activity (40-500 Ci/mmol), containing a mixture of unlabeled and monolabeled toxin molecules, are also applicable to preparations of pure monoiodo-alpha-bungarotoxin of similar specific activity."

https://openalex.org/W1579745531,"Genes for xenopus oocyte-type 5 S ribosomal RNA are correctly transcribed in cell-free extracts derived from HeLa cells. At least two factors besides RNA polymerase III are required for the transcription process in somatic cells, one of which has affinity for DNA. The transcription of the oocyte-type 5 S genes can be selectively and completely repressed by purified HeLa 5 S RNA present in the transcription extract, while tRNA represses transcription incompletely and apparently nonspecifically. Weak competition of Xenopus 5 S ribosomal genes for a transcription factor(s) in the presence of HeLa 5 S RNA is discussed in terms of the relative strength of heterologous 5 S gene sequences to bind a transcription factor(s). Nonribosomal-bound 5 S RNA from the cytoplasm can be demonstrated to exist as a 7 S particle. The competition of 5 S RNA genes and 5 S RNA for a transcription factor and the finding of a 7 S particle in HeLa cells suggests a general feedback mechanism of 5 S RNA gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1485829082,"The native form of ATP citrate lyase (2 mol of phosphate/tetramer) and the dephospho-ATP citrate lyase (phosphate-free) purified to homogeneity from rat liver, are phosphorylated by ATP and by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from rabbit muscle. A total of 2 mol of phosphate/tetramer were incorporated into native enzyme, while with the dephospho form, 4 mol of phosphate were incorporated. The phosphopeptides resulting from trypsin treatment which were isolated from phosphorylated forms of both native enzyme and the dephospho enzyme were similar. The ATP citrate lyase, phosphorylated to an extent of 4 mol of phosphate/tetramer, has the same Vmax as the native enzyme (2 mol of phosphate/tetramer). Native ATP citrate lyase, trypsin-treated to remove the phosphopeptide, could not be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from rabbit muscle, suggesting a common trypsin-sensitive specific phosphorylation site. The phosphorylation rate varied with pH in potassium phosphate, imidazole/HCl, and Tris/HCl buffers. Divalent cations were essential for the activity of the protein kinase. The apparent Km value for ATP was found to be 50 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1587098861,"HeLa cells are shown to incorporate [35S]thiophosphate (added to the medium as sodium thiophosphate) into the gamma-positions of ATP and GTP, and into other nucleotides. Under these conditions there is a transfer of radioactive thiophosphoryl groups to histones H1, H2A, H3, and H4. The newly thiophosphorylated chromosomal proteins can be recovered selectively by affinity chromatography on organomercurial-Sepharose columns. The thiophosphorylated histone H1 and its NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal fragments were subjected to tryptic digestion and the sulfur-derivatized phosphopeptides were isolated by Hg-affinity chromatography prior to electrophoretic separation of different sites of modification. Thiophosphate was found to be incorporated into both serine and threonine residues of histone H1 in HeLa cells during logarithmic growth. When [3H]threonine and nonradioactive thiophosphate were employed simultaneously as precursors, the thiophosphorylated H1 molecules retained on the mercury column also showed the presence of the [3H]threonine label. It follows that newly synthesized H1 molecules are subject to thiophosphorylation in the growing cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1514692197,"Purified bovine liver branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase is inhibited by its reaction products, NADH and the branched chain acyl-CoA thiol esters. This provides an immediate, short term regulation mechanism for this enzyme which commits leucine, isoleucine, and valine to the catabolic pathway. We find that clofibric acid (p-chlorophenoxymethylpropionic acid) and phenylpyruvate also specifically inhibit this multienzyme complex. Fifty percent inhibition occurs at 0.24 mM and 0.40 mM concentrations, respectively. Both compounds bind either free enzyme (E) or the enzyme-substrate (ES) complex to give an abortive enzyme-substrate-inhibitor (ESI) complex. Phenylpyruvate preferentially binds E (Ki = 48 microM) over ES (alpha Ki = 97 microM), while clofibric acid has a reverse preference, binding ES (alpha Ki = 48 microM) with more avidity than E (Ki = 142 microM). Amino acids like L-leucine, beta-leucine, and 2-aminonorbornyl-2-carboxylic acid do not inhibit this enzyme at concentrations as high as 10 mM. These biochemical probes will be useful for studying the catalytic site of this enzyme complex and the consequences of accumulated branched chain ketoacids and their amino acid precursors on muscle and liver metabolism when the dehydrogenase function is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W1481900392,"A novel series of glycosphingolipids has been isolated from the nonepithelial part of rat small intestine. A mixed fraction containing 3 major components corresponding to glycolipids with 5, 6, and 7 sugars and 2 minor components with 8 and 9 sugars was characterized. The structure of the major components was deduced by mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy of nondegraded permethylated and permethylated-reduced (LiAlH4) derivatives and gas-liquid chromatography of degradation products of native, permethylated, and permethylated-reduced glycolipids. The structures of the penta-, hexa-, and hepta-glycosylceramides were found to be GalNAcp beta 1 leads to (3Galp alpha 1 leads to)2-44Galp beta 1 leads to 4Glcp beta 1 leads to 1Cer. By analogy reasoning, supported by mass spectrometry, the octa- and nonaglycosylceramides were concluded to have 1 and 2 additional internal leads to 3Galp alpha 1 leads to 3 structures, respectively. A pentaglycosylceramide fraction from another rat strain was also isolated. The NMR spectra were in agreement with 2 isomeric structures of which 1 had the internal alpha 1 leads to 4 linkage replaced by an alpha 1 leads to 3 linkage. The fatty acids of all components were nonhydroxy 16:0 to 24:0 acids with the 18:0 homologue as dominating species. The major base was sphingosine and possibly monohydroxy 18:1 base in the larger glycolipids. This is a novel series of structures with a terminal saccharide identical with isoglobotetraoxylceramide (cytolipin R). The glycosyltransferase for the terminal GalNAc beta 1 leads to 3 of cytolipin R may possibly be identical with the enzyme adding the terminal sugar of this novel series. This is supported by the presence in the same tissue of probable precursor glycolipids with 4 to 8 hexoses."

Three different fibrinogen subfractions were obtained. The most acidic fraction comprising 22% of the whole fibrinogen pool was prominent by two special features: 1) its sialic acid content was significantly higher than that of bulk fibrinogen, namely 8 mol of sialic acid/mol of fibrinogen versus 6 mol in bulk fibrinogen. 2) Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the polypeptide chains obtained after reduction revealed a preferential accumulation in this subfraction of the elongated gamma chains previously described as gamma chain heterogeneity of whole human fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1540525217,"A new purification procedure for polynucleotide phosphorylase from freeze-dried Micrococcus luteus cells gives approximately 20% yield of nearly homogeneous, primer-independent enzyme which is free of nucleic acid. The physicochemical properties of M. luteus polynucleotide phosphorylase are similar to those previously described for the enzyme from Escherichia coli in terms of Mr, subunit structure, and amino acid composition. The purified enzyme appears to be a trimer composed of three identical subunits (Mr 92,000), but it probably does not exist as such in the cell. Ferguson plot analyses of enzyme in cell extracts indicate that prior to purification the enzyme exists in oligomeric forms characterized by both higher charge and greater Mr. Changes in size and charge of oligomers which occur during purification are probably due to the dissociation of proteins and/or nucleic acids. Dissociation of the oligomers is achieved by dilution and electrophoresis, but reassociation does not occur after concentration. The poly(A) product of the initial polymerization stages migrates as a single band on both nondenaturing and urea-agarose gels. It is 13,000 +/- 2,000 nucleotides long, as measured by electron microscopy, and 8,000 nucleotides long by gel electrophoretic analysis. This poly(A) product remains bound to the enzyme after synthesis, yet can be easily obtained free of protein by proteinase K digestion."
https://openalex.org/W1536336485,"The phosphorylation of H1 histone subtypes was studied in 3 Chinese hamster cell lines (CHO, V79, and CHW). Chromatographic resolution of H1 subtypes showed that all 3 cell lines contained 1 homologous (coeluting) H1 subtype (CHO-1, V79-1, and CHW-1) while V79 and CHW cells contained 2 additional H1 subtypes not found in CHO cells (V79-2,3 and CHW-2,3). N-Bromosuccinimide cleavage of 32P-labeled H1 subtypes demonstrated that all V79 subtypes were phosphorylated in both the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions during interphase while CHO-1 was phosphorylated only in the COOH-terminal region. Tryptic phosphopeptide fractionations, using 2 sequential electrophoretic steps on paper, demonstrated qualitative differences in the 32P-labeled peptides from the 7 H1 subtypes of the 3 cell lines. For example, CHO-1 differed from its V79-1 homologue by 1 phosphopeptide and from its CHW-1 homologue by 3 phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide differences were also observed among the H1 subtypes of both V79 and CHW cells. The results demonstrate that Chinese hamster cell lines phosphorylated H1 histone subtypes differently during interphase and that there is no rigorous functional connection between the phosphorylation of the NH2-terminal region of 1 or all H1 histone subtypes and the initiation of mitosis in Chinese hamster cells."

https://openalex.org/W2130182373,"It has been reported that rat liver monoamine oxidase is an iron-dependent enzyme. Calculations from reported data suggest that rat liver monoamine oxidase contains 2 g atoms of iron/mol of enzyme. However, our data over a 16-year period show that our purified bovine liver monoamine oxidase does not contain sufficient iron to justify being considered an iron protein. In order to ensure the correctness of the iron content, two microchemical analyses and atomic absorption spectroscopy were used to determine the iron content of wet ashed samples. The iron content was also determined during successive steps of enzyme purification and was found to decrease rather than increase. Monoamine oxidase, being a hydrophobic outer membrane enzyme, is very difficult to purify and detailed tests for homogeneity are necessary. Our preparations show a single band when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis and behave as a pure protein by end group analysis. Thus, bovine liver monoamine oxidase is not an iron-dependent enzyme."
