https://openalex.org/W1986179131,"Cell cycle checkpoints can enhance cell survival and limit mutagenic events following DNA damage. Primary murine fibroblasts became deficient in a G1 checkpoint activated by ionizing radiation (IR) when both wild-type p53 alleles were disrupted. In addition, cells from patients with the radiosensitive, cancer-prone disease ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) lacked the IR-induced increase in p53 protein levels seen in normal cells. Finally, IR induction of the human GADD45 gene, an induction that is also defective in AT cells, was dependent on wild-type p53 function. Wild-type but not mutant p53 bound strongly to a conserved element in the GADD45 gene, and a p53-containing nuclear factor, which bound this element, was detected in extracts from irradiated cells. Thus, we identified three participants (AT gene(s), p53, and GADD45) in a signal transduction pathway that controls cell cycle arrest following DNA damage; abnormalities in this pathway probably contribute to tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2048890665,"apoE-deficient mice have been created by homologous recombination in ES cells. On a low fat, low cholesterol chow diet these animals have plasma cholesterol levels of 494 mg/dl compared with 60 mg/dl in control animals, and when challenged with a high fat Western-type diet, these animals have plasma cholesterol levels of 1821 mg/dl compared with 132 mg/dl in controls. This marked hypercholesterolemia is primarily due to elevated levels of very low and intermediate density lipoproteins. At 10 weeks of age, apoE-deficient mice have already developed atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and coronary and pulmonary arteries. apoE-deficient mice are a promising small animal model to help understand the role of apoE in vivo and the genetic and environmental determinants of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2052561585,"Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an integral role in T cell activation. Stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) results in tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular substrates. One of these is the TCR zeta chain, which can mediate the transduction of extracellular stimuli into cellular effector functions. We have recently identified a 70 kd tyrosine phosphoprotein (ZAP-70) that associates with zeta and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR stimulation. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding ZAP-70. ZAP-70 represents a novel PTK and is expressed in T and natural killer cells. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation and association of ZAP-70 with zeta require the presence of src family PTKs and provide a potential mechanism by which the src family PTKs and ZAP-70 may interact to mediate TCR signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2114599216,"Tissue-specific patterns of methylated deoxycytidine residues in the mammalian genome are preserved by postreplicative methylation of newly synthesized DNA. DNA methyltransferase (MTase) is here shown to associate with replication foci during S phase but to display a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution in non-S phase cells. Analysis of DNA MTase-β-galactosidase fusion proteins has shown that association with replication foci is mediated by a novel targeting sequence located near the N-terminus of DNA MTase. This sequence has the properties expected of a targeting sequence in that it is not required for enzymatic activity, prevents proper targeting when deleted, and, when fused to β-galactosidase, causes the fusion protein to associate with replication foci in a cell cycle-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2062313490,"The Xist gene maps to the X inactivation center region in both mouse and human, and previous analysis of the 3' end of the gene has demonstrated inactive X-specific expression, suggesting a possible role in X inactivation. We have now analyzed the entire mouse Xist gene. The mature inactive X-specific transcript is 15 kb in length and contains no conserved ORF. The Xist sequence contains a number of regions comprised of tandem repeats. Comparison with the human XIST gene demonstrates significant conservation of sequence and gene structure. Xist RNA is not associated with the translational machinery of the cell and is located almost exclusively in the nucleus. Together with conservation of inactive X-specific expression, these findings support a role for Xist in X inactivation, possibly as a functional RNA or as a chromatin organizer region."
https://openalex.org/W2095184701,"We have identified a human homolog of the Drosophila trithorax protein that is structurally altered by 11q23 translocations in acute leukemias. Human trithorax (HRX) is a predicted 431 kd protein containing two potential DNA-binding motifs consisting of zinc fingers conserved with the fly protein and nonconserved amino-terminal ""AT hook"" motifs related to the DNA-binding motifs in HMG proteins. 11q23 translocations disrupt the HRX gene between these two motifs, and in a t(11;19)-carrying cell line fusion transcripts are expressed from both derivative chromosomes. The more abundant derivative 11 transcript codes for a chimeric protein containing the AT hook motifs fused to a previously undescribed protein (ENL) from chromosome 19. These data suggest a novel role for a trithorax-homologous protein in multilineage human leukemias that may be mediated by DNA binding within the minor groove at AT-rich sites, implicated to play an important role in bacterial IHF-, yeast datin-, and mammalian HMG-mediated gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2003236156,"The DNA binding activity of p53 is required for its tumor suppressor function; we show here that this activity is cryptic but can be activated by cellular factors acting on a C-terminal regulatory domain of p53. A gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that recombinant wild-type human p53 binds DNA sequence specifically only weakly, but a monoclonal antibody binding near the C terminus activated the cryptic DNA binding activity stoichiometrically. p53 DNA binding could be activated by a C-terminal deletion of p53, mild proteolysis of full-length p53, E. coli dnaK (which disrupts protein-protein complexes), or casein kinase II (and coincident phosphorylation of a C-terminal site on p53). Activation of p53 DNA binding may be critical in regulation of its ability to arrest cell growth and thus its tumor suppressor function."
https://openalex.org/W1982640053,"The ALL-1 gene located at human chromosome 11 band q23 is rearranged in acute leukemias with interstitial deletions or reciprocal translocations between this region and chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, or 19. The gene spans approximately 100 kb of DNA and contains at least 21 exons. It encodes a protein of more than 3910 amino acids containing three regions with homology to sequences within the Drosophila trithorax gene, including cysteine-rich regions that can be folded into six zinc finger-like domains. The breakpoint cluster region within ALL-1 spans 8 kb and encompasses several small exons, most of which begin in the same phase of the open reading frame. The t(4;11) chromosome translocation results in two reciprocal fusion products coding for chimeric proteins derived from ALL-1 and from a gene on chromosome 4. This suggests that each 11q23 abnormality gives rise to a specific oncogenic fusion protein."
https://openalex.org/W2041652972,"The Myf-5 gene, a member of the myogenic basic HLH factor family, has been inactivated in mice after homologous recombination in ES cells. Mice lacking Myf-5 were unable to breathe and died immediately after birth, owing to the absence of the major distal part of the ribs. Other skeletal abnormalities, except for complete ossification of the sternum, were not apparent. Histological examination of skeletal muscle from newborn mice revealed no morphological abnormalities. Northern blot analysis demonstrated normal levels of muscle-specific mRNAs including MyoD, myogenin, and Myf-6. However, the appearance of myotomal cells in early somites was delayed by several days. These results suggest that while Myf-5 plays a crucial role in the formation of lateral sclerotome derivatives, Myf-5 is dispensable for the development of skeletal muscle, perhaps because other members of the myogenic HLH family substitute for Myf-5 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2069652778,"The c-fos proto-oncogene has been implicated as a central regulatory component of the nuclear response to mitogens and other extracellular stimuli. Embryonic stem cells targeted at the c-fos locus have been used to generate chimeric mice that have transmitted the mutated allele through the germline. Homozygous mutants show reduced placental and fetal weights and significant loss of viability at birth. Approximately 40% of the homozygous mutants survive and grow at normal rates until severe osteopetrosis, characterized by foreshortening of the long bones, ossification of the marrow space, and absence of tooth eruption, begins to develop at approximately 11 days. Among other abnormalities, these mice show delayed or absent gametogenesis, lymphopenia, and altered behavior. Despite these defects, many live as long as their wild-type or heterozygous littermates (currently 7 months). These data indicate that c-fos is not required for the growth of most cell types but is involved in the development and function of several distinct tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2010041789,"The potent mesoderm-inducing factors activin and FGF are present as maternally synthesized proteins in embryos of X. laevis. We show that activin can act on explanted blastomeres to induce at least five different cell states ranging from posterolateral mesoderm to dorsoanterior organizer mesoderm. Each state is induced in a narrow dose range bounded by sharp thresholds. By contrast, FGF induces only posterolateral markers and does so over relatively broad dose ranges. FGF can modulate the actions of activin, potentiating them and broadening the threshold-bounded dose windows. Our results indicate that orthogonal gradients of activin and FGF would be sufficient to specify the main elements of the body plan."
https://openalex.org/W2108049244,"The solution structure of the tenth type III module of fibronectin has been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The molecule has a fold similar to that of immunoglobulin domains, with seven beta strands forming two antiparallel beta sheets, which pack against each other. Both beta sheets contribute conserved hydrophobic residues to a compact core. The topology is more similar to that of domain 2 of CD4, PapD, and the extracellular domain of the human growth hormone receptor than to that of immunoglobulin C domains. The module contains an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence known to be involved in cell adhesion. This tripeptide is solvent exposed and lies on a conformationally mobile loop between strands F and G, consistent with its cell adhesion function."
https://openalex.org/W2101998972,"Zygotic expression of the Drosophila TGF beta family member decapentaplegic (dpp) is required for the development of the dorsal embryonic structures. By injecting dpp transcripts into young embryos, we find that 2- to 4-fold increases in the concentration of injected RNA elicit progressively more dorsal cell fates: only low levels of dpp permit development of ventral ectoderm, intermediate dpp levels drive dorsal epidermal development, and high dpp levels drive cells to differentiate as the most dorsal pattern element, the amnioserosa. Localized dpp RNA injections into embryos that lack all known maternal and zygotic dorsal-ventral polarity indicate that dpp can both define embryonic polarity and organize detailed patterning within the ectoderm. We infer that dpp acts as an extracellular morphogen and that the graded activity of dpp specifies the pattern of ectodermal cell fates in the Drosophila embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2141300290,"SEC61p is essential for protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of S. cerevisiae. We have found a mammalian homolog that shows more than 50% sequence identity with the yeast protein. Moreover, several regions of SEC61p have significant similarities with corresponding ones of SecYp of bacteria, indicating a strong evolutionary conservation of the mechanism of protein translocation. Mammalian Sec61p, like the yeast protein, is located in the immediate vicinity of nascent polypeptides during their membrane passage. It is tightly associated with membrane-bound ribosomes, suggesting that the nascent chain passes directly from the ribosome into a protein-conducting channel. These results define Sec61p as a ubiquitous key component of the protein translocation apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1984116290,"Prior to the chemical steps of mRNA splicing, the extensive base-pairing interaction between the U4 and U6 spliceosomal snRNAs is disrupted. Here, we use a mutational analysis in yeast to demonstrate a conserved base-pairing interaction between the U6 and U2 snRNAs that is mutually exclusive with the U4-U6 interaction. In this novel pairing, conserved sequences in U6 interact with a sequence in U2 that is immediately upstream of the branch point recognition region. Remarkably, the residues in U6 that can be consequently juxtaposed with the intron substrate include those that have been proposed previously to be catalytic. Both the first and second steps of splicing are inhibited when this base-paired structure is mutated. These observations, together with the high conservation of the U2-U6 structure, lead us to propose that it might be a component of the spliceosomal active site."
https://openalex.org/W2082861222,"In MDCK cells, transport of membrane proteins to the basolateral plasma membrane has been shown to require a distinct cytoplasmic domain determinant. Although the determinant is often related to signals used for localization in clathrin-coated pits, inactivation of the coated pit domain in the human LDL receptor did not affect basolateral targeting. By expressing mutant and chimeric LDL receptors, we have now identified two independently acting signals that are individually sufficient for basolateral targeting. The two determinants mediate basolateral sorting with different efficiencies, but both contain tyrosine residues critical for activity. The first determinant was colinear with, but distinct from, the coated pit domain of the receptor. The second was found in the C-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor and, although tyrosine-dependent, did not mediate endocytosis. The results suggest that membrane proteins can have functionally redundant signals for basolateral transport and that a tyrosine-containing motif may be a common feature of multiple intracellular sorting events."
https://openalex.org/W1997124556,"Among the maternally active genes of Drosophila, cactus is the only one whose loss of function mutations specifically produce ventralized embryos. Its product inhibits nuclear translocation of the dorsal morphogen in the dorsal region of the embryo. Here we report the cloning of cactus and the sequencing of its maternal transcript. The identity of our clones was verified by induction of phenocopies with antisense RNA and rescue of the mutant phenotype with sense RNA. cactus is predicted to encode an acidic, cytoplasmic protein with seven ankyrin repeats. The sequence has similarity to the IκB proteins that inhibit the vertebrate transcription factor NF-κB. In analogy to results obtained with IκB and NF-κB, bacterially expressed cactus protein can inhibit DNA binding of dorsal protein in vitro"
https://openalex.org/W1975437758,"An oligonucleotide based on the cdc repeats of the Drosophila Notch protein was used to isolate other Drosophila genes with these repeats. One of these genes is the cactus locus, 1 of 11 genes required maternally for the establishment in embryos of a gradient of nuclear localization of dorsal protein, a rel-like transcription factor. Previous work showed that in cactus mutants more dorsal protein enters the nucleus in dorsal regions, resulting in a ventralized phenotype. It is now shown that the cactus locus produces two proteins that differ at their carboxy termini; both contain six cdc repeats that are sufficient for binding to dorsal and for inhibiting the ability of dorsal to bind DNA. The site on dorsal to which cactus binds was localized to the rel homology domain, where it overlaps with, or is adjacent to, the nuclear localization signal. In vivo the bulk of the cactus protein associated with dorsal is phosphorylated. This, or the association with dorsal, appears to stabilize the maternal cactus protein."
https://openalex.org/W1597241698,"The Wilms' tumor locus on chromosome 11p13 contains a tumor suppressor gene, wt1, which encodes a DNA binding protein (WT1) with four zinc fingers and a glutamine-proline-rich N terminus and which functions as a repressor of transcription. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain gene encodes a potent growth factor, which is expressed in high levels in a number of tumor cell lines. We initiated a search for WT1 target genes and now report that WT1 strikingly represses transcription of the PDGF A-chain gene in transient transfection assays and that the WT1 protein interacts directly with a highly G+C-rich region of the PDGF A-chain promoter in gel mobility shift assays. The results suggest that WT1 may function to repress expression of the PDGF A-chain gene and that loss of this or related repressor activities may contribute to the abnormal growth of Wilms' tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1496485913,"The 1311-base pair human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha promoter region was fused to the luciferase (Luc) reporter gene and studied in a transient transfection system in three TNF producing cell lines, the U937 macrophage cell line, the MLA 144 T cell line, and the 729-6 B cell line. This full length promoter construct can be induced by phorbol 13-myristate acetate (PMA) in each of these cell types. Analysis of a series of 5'-truncations showed several peaks of basal and PMA induced activity suggesting the presence of several positive and negative regulatory elements. A PMA responsive element was localized to a region between -95 and -36 bp relative to the transcription start site. Within this region, single AP-2- and AP-1-like consensus sequences were noted. These AP-2 and AP-1 sites were each modified with a double point mutation. A modest (20-50%) reduction in TNF promoter activity was observed with the AP-2 site mutation. However, mutation of the AP-1 site markedly diminished both the basal and PMA-activated promoter activity. Also co-transfections of the wild-type promoter construct with an AP-1/c-jun expression vector resulted in augmented basal and PMA-induced promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W2081118837,"Mutations in SHR3 block amino acid uptake into yeast by reducing the levels of multiple amino acid permeases within the plasma membrane. SHR3 is a novel integral membrane protein component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). shr3 null mutants specifically accumulate amino acid permeases in the ER; other plasma membrane proteins, secretory proteins, and vacuolar proteins are processed and targeted correctly. Our findings suggest that SHR3 interacts with a structural domain shared by amino acid permeases, an interaction required for permease-specific processing and transport from the ER. Even in the presence of excess amino acids, shr3 mutants exhibit starvation responses. shr3 mutants constitutively express elevated levels of GCN4, and mutant diploids undergo dimorphic transitions that result in filamentous growth at enhanced frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2122225748,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was internalized at a rapid rate by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that do not express significant numbers of high affinity receptors for bFGF as well as CHO cells that have been transfected with cDNA encoding FGF receptor-1 or FGF receptor-2. Internalization of bFGF was completely blocked by the addition of 10 micrograms/ml heparin in the parental CHO cells but only partially inhibited in cells expressing transfected FGF receptors. Bovine aortic endothelial cells also exhibit heparin-sensitive and heparin-resistant internalization of bFGF. The internalization of bFGF through the heparin-resistant pathway in CHO cells was efficiently competed by addition of unlabeled bFGF, was proportional to the number of receptors expressed, and approached saturation, suggesting that the heparin-resistant internalization was due to high affinity receptors. Internalization of bFGF through the heparin-sensitive pathway was not efficiently competed by unlabeled bFGF and did not approach saturation at concentrations of bFGF up to 50 ng/ml, properties similar to the interaction of bFGF with low affinity heparan sulfate binding sites on the cell surface. Internalization of bFGF in CHO cells not expressing FGF receptors was inhibited by heparin, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, the same glycosaminoglycans that block binding to cell-surface heparin sulfates. Internalization of bFGF in the parental CHO cells was inhibited at the same concentrations of heparin that block binding to cell-surface heparan sulfates. Finally, inhibition of the sulfation of CHO cell heparan sulfates by the addition of chlorate or digestion of CHO cell heparan sulfates with heparinase inhibited bFGF internalization in the parental CHO cells. These results demonstrate that bFGF can be internalized through a direct interaction with cell-surface heparan sulfates. Thus, there are two pathways for internalization of bFGF: high affinity receptor-mediated and heparan sulfate-mediated."
https://openalex.org/W1995418168,"There is accumulating evidence that the mammalian Y chromosome, in addition to its testis-determining function, may have other male limited functions, particularly in spermatogenesis. We have previously shown that the short arm of the mouse Y carries information needed for spermatogonial proliferation. This information, together with the testis-determining gene Sry, is contained within the Y-derived sex reversal factor Sxra. XO males carrying a copy of Sxra attached to the X chromosome are nevertheless sterile owing to an almost complete arrest during the meiotic metaphase stages. Here we show that this meiotic block can be overcome by providing a meiotic pairing partner (with no Y-specific DNA) for the XSxra chromosome. However, this does not restore fertility because the sperm produced all have abnormal heads. It is concluded that the Y-specific region of the mouse Y chromosome long arm includes information essential for the normal development of the sperm head."
https://openalex.org/W1988836624,"The nine tandem zinc finger repeats in the 5S gene-specific transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) from Xenopus mediate specific binding to 5S DNA as well as to 5S ribosomal RNA. A comparative functional analysis of a systematic set of TFIIIA zinc finger combinations reveals that most, if not all, participate in both DNA and RNA binding. Minimal sets of fingers sufficient for DNA and RNA recognition are different. In RNA binding, most finger elements are found to be functionally equivalent. However, the nonessential finger 6 exhibits RNA binding characteristics distinct from the other eight modules. The secondary/tertiary structure of the central domain in 5S RNA, not its primary sequence, is found to carry the essential structural information for TFIIIA binding in Xenopus oocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that RNA and DNA binding are overlapping, though separable functions of the nine zinc finger elements in TFIIIA, occurring via fundamentally different molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2013083223,"Activation of the PHO5 gene in S. cerevisiae by phosphate starvation was previously shown to be accompanied by the disappearance of four positioned nucleosomes from the promoter. To investigate the mechanism, we replaced the PHO80 gene, a negative regulator of PHO5, by a temperature-sensitive allele. As a consequence, PHO5 can be activated in the presence of phosphate by a temperature shift from 24 degrees C to 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, the promoter undergoes the same chromatin transition as in phosphate-starved cells. Disruption of the nucleosomes by the temperature shift also occurs when DNA replication is prevented. Nucleosomes re-form when the temperature is shifted from 37 degrees C back to 24 degrees C in nondividing cells. Glucose is required for the disruption of the nucleosomes during the temperature upshift, not for their re-formation during the temperature downshift. These experiments prove that DNA replication is not required for the transition between the nucleosomal and the non-nucleosomal state at the PHO5 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1602190625,"GAT-1, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter cloned from rat brain, was expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Voltage-clamp measurements showed concentration-dependent, inward currents in response to GABA (K0.5 4.7 microM). The transport current required extracellular sodium and chloride ions; the Hill coefficient for chloride was 0.7, and that for sodium was 1.7. Correlation of current and [3H]GABA uptake measurements indicate that flux of one positive charge occurs per molecule of GABA transported. Membrane hyperpolarization from -40 to -100 mV increased the transport current approximately 3-fold. The results indicate that the transport of one molecule of GABA involves the co-transport of two sodium ions and one chloride ion."
https://openalex.org/W1591245273,"Time courses for intramolecular NO and O2 recombination to native and three position 29 mutants of sperm whale myoglobins were measured after laser photolysis on picosecond and nanosecond time scales. The rates for the first phase of NO recombination were 1.8, 2.5, 29, and > or = 100 ns-1 for Ala29, Val29, Leu29 (native), and Phe29 myoglobin, respectively, at room temperature. This order is not correlated with the overall association rate constants for NO binding which were all in the range 20-50 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 and is the opposite of that observed for the rate constants for the overall thermal dissociation of NO which were 5.0, 2.8, 0.98, and 0.21 x 10(-4) s-1 for Ala29, Val29, Leu29 (native), and Phe29 myoglobin, respectively, at 20 degrees C. This inverse correlation suggests that photo- and thermally dissociated ligand molecules experience similar kinetic and equilibrium barriers to rebinding. The larger side chains of Leu29 and Phe29 inhibit rapid movement of the ligand away from the iron atom facilitating geminate recombination. The smaller side chains of Val29 and Ala29 increase the space available to the ligand, decreasing the rate of geminate recombination and enhancing complete dissociation. Diffusion of NO in the distal pocket of myoglobin was simulated using a variant of the molecular dynamics program CHARMM that includes the locally enhanced sampling protocol (Elber, R., and Karplus, M. (1991) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112, 9161-9175; Roitberg, A., and Elber, R. (1991) J. Chem. Phys. 95, 9277-9287) and the x-ray structures of Carver et al. (Carver, T. E., Brantley, R. E., Jr., Singleton, E. W., Arduini, R. M., Quillin, M. L., Phillips, G. N., Jr., and Olson, J. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14443-14450). Both accelerated (5,000 K) and room temperature ligands were used, and comparisons were made between simulations with a complete hydration shell surrounding the protein and those with only eight water molecules near the distal histidine. Photodissociated ligands initially move away from the heme plane, past Leu29, and toward Leu32, Phe33, Ile107, and Ile111. These theoretical results confirm that a complete description of picosecond ligand recombination must include the dynamics of ligand movement in the distal portion of the heme pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1565074159,"The finding that two subunits of the proteasome, LMP2 and LMP7, are encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has linked the proteasome which represents a major extralysosomal proteolytic system to the processing of intracellular antigens. Here we describe a second form of the human LMP7 cDNA, LMP7-E2, which has been identified during the characterization of novel genes in the MHC. The analysis of the genome organization of LMP7 revealed that LMP7-E1 and LMP7-E2 arise by alternative exon usage. Using specific antibodies against LMP2 and LMP7, we show that they are co-expressed with class I MHC molecules as well as a putative peptide transporter. The polypeptides encoded by LMP7 and LMP2 undergo proteolytic processing when incorporated into proteasomes, and the LMP7 precursor is derived mainly from LMP7-E2. Furthermore, our data suggest that LMP7 and LMP2 are mutually dependent for their incorporation into the proteasomal complex."
https://openalex.org/W2071032973,"We have used an in vitro reconstitution system to determine the effects of a large number of mutations in the highly conserved 5' terminal domain of the yeast U2 snRNA on pre-mRNA splicing. Whereas many mutations have little or no functional consequence, base substitutions in two regions were found to have drastic effects on pre-mRNA splicing. A previously unrecognized function for the U2 snRNA in the second step of splicing was found by alteration of the absolutely conserved sequence AGA upstream of the branch point recognition sequence. The effects of these mutations suggest the formation of a structure involving the U2 snRNA similar to the guanosine-binding site found in the catalytic core of group I introns."
https://openalex.org/W2060853377,"The ts41 mutation of Chinese hamster cells was first isolated and characterized by Hirschberg and Marcus, 1982 Hirschberg J. Marcus M. Isolation by a replica-plating technique of Chinese hamster temperature-sensitive cell cycle mutants. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 113: 159-166 Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar who showed that at nonpermissive temperature, cells accumulate up to 16C equivalents of DNA. Here we show that the mutation is recessive and at nonpermissive temperature, cells replicate their genome normally, but instead of going on into G2, M, and G1, they pass directly into a second S phase. Entry into a second S phase does not require serum nor is it inhibited by G2 checkpoints or mitotic inhibitors. Temperature-shift experiments suggest that the ts41 gene product participates in two functions in the cell cycle: entry into mitosis and inhibition of entry into S phase. The ts41 mutation seems to define a class of cell cycle mutant that couples the sequential events of DNA replication and mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1593480505,"In this study, we have used photoaffinity labeling by [32P]azido-GTP as well as [32P]ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin (PT) and cholera toxin (CT) to identify GTP-binding proteins associated with mouse T-lymphoma plasma membranes. Our results indicate that GP85 (CD44) can be photoaffinity labeled by [32P] azido-GTP and [32P]ADP-ribosylated by both PT and CT. Using purified GP85 (CD44) obtained by Triton X-100 extraction, wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, and anti-GP85 (CD44) antibody affinity chromatographies, we have further characterized GP85 (CD44) as a GTP-binding protein. GP85 (CD44) is found to bind guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) in a time- and dose-dependent manner with a dissociation constant of 0.83 nM. Importantly, GP85 (CD44) appears to display a GTPase activity which hydrolyzes [gamma-32P]GTP at a rate of 0.011 mol of Pi released/mol of GP85 (CD44)/min. This GTPase activity can be readily inhibited by PT- or CT-mediated ribosylation of GP85 (CD44). Most interestingly, GTP binding significantly enhances the interaction of purified GP85 (CD44) with ankyrin, whereas ADP-ribosylation of GP85 (CD44) by PT or CT inhibits the GTP-induced increase in ankyrin binding to GP85 (CD44). In addition to GP85 (CD44) being the first reported transmembrane GTP-binding protein, these results suggest that GTP plays an important role in promoting the interaction between GP85 (CD44) and its underlying membrane cytoskeleton through ankyrin."
https://openalex.org/W2064910445,"We have cloned a Dictyostelium phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP1) with a catalytic domain showing approximately 38%-50% amino acid identity to those of other PTPs. PTP1 contains an approximately 99 amino acid insert and bacterially produced PTP1 possesses PTP activity. PTP1 is expressed at a very low level in vegetative cells, induced by 4 hr, and maximally expressed at the tight aggregate stage. PTP1-lacZ studies indicate that PTP1 is spatially localized to prestalk and anterior-like cell types. PTP1 gene disruptants show accelerated development, whereas strains overexpressing PTP1 to a high level fail to aggregate. Strains overexpressing moderate levels exhibit severe morphological defects following aggregation, including multiply tipped aggregates and morphologically aberrant fruiting bodies. Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies shows specific changes in the mutant strains when compared with wild-type cells. The results indicate that reversible protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and PTP1 play important regulatory roles during Dictyostelium development."
https://openalex.org/W2162384798,"The kinetic mechanism of the lactose transport system of Streptococcus thermophilus was studied in membrane vesicles fused with cytochrome c oxidase containing liposomes and in proteoliposomes in which cytochrome c oxidase was coreconstituted with the lactose transport protein. Selective manipulation of the components of the proton (and sodium) motive force indicated that both a membrane potential and a pH gradient could drive transport. The galactoside/proton stoichiometry was close to unity. Experiments which discriminate between the effects of internal pH and delta pH as driving force on galactoside/proton symport showed that the carrier is highly activated at alkaline internal pH values, which biases the transport system kinetically toward the pH component of the proton motive force. Galactoside efflux increased with increasing pH with a pKa of about 8, whereas galactoside exchange (and counterflow) exhibited a pH optimum around 7 with pKa values of 6 and 8, respectively. Imposition of delta pH (interior alkaline) retarded the rate of efflux at any pH value tested, whereas the rate of exchange was stimulated by an imposed delta pH at pH 5.8, not affected at pH 7.0, and inhibited at pH 8.0 and 9.0. The results have been evaluated in terms of random and ordered association/dissociation of galactoside and proton on the inner surface of the membrane. Imposition of delta psi (interior negative) decreased the rate of efflux but had no effect on the rate of exchange, indicating that the unloaded transport protein carries a net negative charge and that during exchange and counterflow the carrier recycles in the protonated form."
https://openalex.org/W2117252019,"In vivo, supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids are required to restore adrenal medullary phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT, E.C. 2.1.1.28) activity after hypophysectomy. However, in vitro, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene expression appears normally glucocorticoid-responsive. To explore this paradox, rats were given dexamethasone or the type II-specific glucocorticoid RU28362 (1-1000 micrograms/day), and adrenal phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity and mRNA levels were determined. At low doses (1-30 micrograms/day), neither steroid altered mRNA whereas at higher doses (100-1000 micrograms/day), mRNA rose 10- to 20-fold, with dexamethasone approximately 3 times as potent as RU28362. In contrast, enzyme activity fell with low doses of either steroid, consistent with suppression of ACTH and endogenous steroidogenesis. At higher doses of RU28362, enzyme activity remained low and unchanged despite increased mRNA expression, whereas higher doses of dexamethasone progressively restored the enzyme to normal. These findings suggest 1) that glucocorticoid regulation of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity occurs largely independent of gene expression; 2) that glucocorticoid effects on enzyme activity are primarily indirect, probably through cosubstrate regulation and/or enzyme stabilization; and 3) that these effects are not mediated via a classical (type II) glucocorticoid receptor mechanism, given the high doses of dexamethasone and corticosterone required and the inability of RU28362 to mimic the effects of these less selective steroids."
https://openalex.org/W2034491503,"Thymocyte differentiation is dependent upon recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on thymic stroma, a process called positive selection. Here we describe an immature CD4+8+ T cell line derived from a TCR transgenic mouse that differentiates into CD4+8- cells in response to antigen and nonthymic antigen-presenting cells. When injected intrathymically, these cells differentiate in the absence of antigen. The ability of immature T cells to recognize MHC molecules in the absence of foreign antigen in the thymus can thus be attributed to a unique property of thymic antigen-presenting cells. These studies also demonstrate the phenotypic and functional changes associated with TCR-mediated T cell maturation and establish an in vitro model system of positive selection."

The data suggest that the enzyme interacts preferentially with compounds having the isocyclic carbomethoxy and the C-17 propionic residues facing opposite sides of the porphyrin macrocycle. The relevance of this observation to chlorophyll biosynthesis and degradation in vivo is briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1536616493,"Ionophore activation of the human polymorphonuclear neutrophil results in eicosanoid synthesis and the accumulation of inactive 5-lipoxygenase in a membrane compartment. We report here that inhibition of self-inactivation of 5-lipoxygenase in ionophore-treated neutrophils with the reversible inhibitor zileuton, results in the accumulation of active 5-lipoxygenase in the membrane fraction. In zileuton plus ionophore-treated cells, 77% of the specific activity of the cytosolic enzyme from resting cells was diverted to the membrane fraction compared to 22% of the activity translocated when ionophore alone was used to activate the neutrophils. Accumulation of active membrane-associated 5-lipoxygenase was inhibited and reversed by the 5-lipoxygenase translocation inhibitor MK-886. The membrane-associated 5-lipoxygenase was two times more efficient in the production of leukotriene A4 from arachidonate-derived 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid than the cytosolic enzyme. Unlike the cytosolic enzyme, membrane-associated 5-lipoxygenase could metabolize 12(S)- and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid to 5(S),12(S)- and 5(S),15(S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, respectively. The ability to metabolize hydroxy fatty acids was dependent upon 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein association, but was lost if 5-lipoxygenase was eluted from the membrane by MK-886. These studies reveal for the first time that significant quantities of active 5-lipoxygenase can be detected in the membrane fraction of activated neutrophils and show that membrane association can alter the substrate specificity of 5-lipoxygenase which is further evidence for the role of the membrane-associated enzyme in the synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1579793406,"Uptake and inhibitory kinetics of [3H]L-threonine were evaluated in preparations of pig jejunal brush border membrane vesicles. Uptake of [3H]L-threonine under O-trans, Na+ gradient, and O-trans, Na(+)-free conditions was best described by high affinity transport (Km < 0.01 mM) plus a nonsaturable component. The maximal velocity of transport was 3-fold greater under Na+ gradient conditions. 100 mM concentrations of all of the dipolar amino acids and 2-aminobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid caused complete inhibition of [3H]L-threonine transport under Na+ gradient and Na(+)-free conditions. Imino acids, anionic amino acids, cationic amino acids, and methylamino-isobutyric acid caused significant partial inhibition of L-threonine uptake. Inhibitor concentration profiles for proline and lysine were consistent with low affinity competitive inhibition. The Ki values of alanine and phenylalanine approximated 0.2 and 0.5 mM, respectively, under both Na+ gradient and Na(+)-free conditions. These data indicate that the transport system available for L-threonine in the intestinal brush border membrane (system B) is functionally distinct from other amino acid transport systems. Comparison of kinetics parameters in the presence and absence of a Na+ gradient suggests that both partially and fully loaded forms of the carrier can function to translocate substrate and that Na+ serves to accelerate L-threonine transport by a mechanism that does not involve enhanced substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1540384934,"2-Keto-3-methylvaleric acid (KMVA) has been found not to undergo spontaneous keto-enol tautomerization in neutral aqueous solution, alone or in the presence of large concentrations of pyridoxamine or pyridoxamine-5-phosphate. This finding denies the commonly held suppositions that 3R-KMVA is derived spontaneously from 3S-KMVA in vivo, and that L-alloisoleucine is the product of the reamination of this 3R-KMVA. Evidence presented here suggests that racemization of the 3-carbon of L-isoleucine occurs during transamination, that L-alloisoleucine is an inherently unavoidable by-product of L-isoleucine transamination (and vice versa), and that a KMVA enol is not obligate in this racemization. The four stereoisomers of 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid have been synthesized and the mass spectra of their trimethylsilyl derivatives recorded. An achiral methylsilicone column was used to separate the diastereomeric pairs and to determine their relative ratios in plasma and urine from normal controls and two maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients. The urinary ratio of the two diastereomers is different from that for plasma, both in normals and in MSUD patients. The plasma ratios may provide a rapid and simple measure of residual branched chain 2-keto acid dehydrogenase activity in MSUD patients."
https://openalex.org/W1515071563,"Deprivation-induced proteolysis in the perfused rat liver is controlled through the multiphasic action of 7 regulatory amino acids of which L-leucine plays the dominant role. Recently, isovaleryl-L-carnitine (IVC) was shown to mimic the leucine's effects, suggesting that the two molecules share structural features that are recognized at a common site(s). In this study we find that each evokes identical responses consisting of inhibitory effects at 0.08 and 0.8 mM, separated by a sharp zonal loss of inhibition at 0.15 mM. As monitored by density shifts of beta-hexosaminidase in colloidal silica gradients, macroautophagy is suppressed by both. Responses to Leu and IVC at 0.08 and 0.15 mM are stereospecific and require a reactive group at the alpha-carbon (or equivalent) and a high degree of branched chain specificity. In addition, 0.5 mM Ala coregulates with IVC and Leu by decreasing the zonal loss at 0.15 mM. The fact that the multiphasic responses can be duplicated with equimolar mixtures of Leu + IVC indicates that both react at the same site(s). IVC is readily taken up by a saturable process, but owing to its rapid hydrolysis in the cell, the ratio of internal to external IVC remains low over a 4-fold concentration range. These findings, together with a kinetic analysis of concerted responses to regulatory amino acids, suggest that the recognition sites are at a position in the cell, possibly at the plasma membrane, to react reversibly with plasma amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2011425522,"The reovirus cell attachment protein, σ1, is a homotrimer with an N-terminal fibrous tail and a C-terminal globular head. By cotranslating full-length and various truncated σ1 proteins in vitro, we show that the N- and C-terminal halves of σ1 possess independent trimerization and folding domains. Trimerization of σ1 is initiated at the N-terminus by the formation of a “loose,” protease-sensitive, three-stranded, α-helical coiled coil. This serves to bring the three unfolded C-termini into close proximity to one another, facilitating their subsequent trimerization and cooperative folding. Concomitant with, but independent of, this latter process, the N-terminal fiber further matures into a more stable and protease-resistant structure. The coordinated folding of σ1 trimers exemplifies the dominant negative effects of mutant subunits in oligomeric complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1532435742,"A novel family of cyclosporin A (CsA) binding proteins was identified by using the biologically active, radioiodinated photoaffinity probe [D-Lys-N epsilon-(4-azido-3-[125I]iodophenyl)propionyl)]8-CsA. In addition to cyclophilin, proteins with molecular masses of 43 kDa and approximately 50-55 kDa were labeled in Jurkat extracts and bovine calf thymus. Sequence analysis of the 43-kDa protein purified from calf thymus and subsequent Western analysis of CsA affinity-purified material from Jurkat extracts identified the 43-kDa component as actin. [D-Lys-N epsilon-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)]8-CsA, a fluorescent analogue of CsA, was prepared and used to measure the binding constants of cyclosporin derivatives to actin by means of a new fluorescence displacement assay. [D-Lys-N epsilon-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)]8-CsA and [N delta-t-butoxycarbonyl diaminobutyryl)]8-CsA bind to bovine actin at physiologically relevant concentrations, with dissociation constants of 60 +/- 33 and 570 +/- 380 nM, respectively. Because the ATPase fragment of heat shock cognate 70 (HSC 70) is structurally related to actin, the yeast homologue SSA1 was tested and found to be radiolabeled by the cyclosporin A photoaffinity reagent. The binding constant for [D-Lys-N epsilon-(5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl)]8-CsA to SSA1 was determined and is 53 +/- 48 nM. These results indicate that actin and the 70-kDa heat shock protein family contain a structurally related domain for binding of cyclosporin A-related peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1506556940,"A rapid and simple purification of milligram amounts of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase, an integral membrane enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization of squalene epoxide to lanosterol, is reported. Several nonionic detergents (Triton X-100, Tween 80, Emulphogene, and lauryl maltoside) were evaluated for solubilization of oxidosqualene cyclase from rat liver microsomes. At a detergent concentration of 5 mg/ml, lauryl maltoside was approximately 10 times more effective than Emulphogene in the solubilization of oxidosqualene cyclase; Triton X-100 and Tween 80 were less effective than Emulphogene as judged by the relative specific activities of the solubilized enzyme. Treatment of microsomes with lauryl maltoside resulted in a selective solubilization of the cyclase with concomitant activation of the enzyme. The solubilized enzyme was purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography. The purified enzyme consists of a single subunit that has an apparent molecular weight of 65,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme obeys saturation kinetics and the apparent Km of (2,3)-oxidosqualene is 15 microM; the apparent kcat/Km is 200 M-1.min-1. An improved assay of the enzyme that utilizes high performance liquid chromatography methods is also described."
https://openalex.org/W1584945129,"Intracellular protein degradation in the rat hepatocyte is regulated by 7 amino acids of which Leu, Gln, and Tyr play major roles. Although Phe is known to inhibit proteolysis as effectively as Tyr at high concentrations, it has not been regarded as an active regulator because of its rapid hydroxylation to Tyr. We now show that proteolytic responses to Phe during liver perfusion differ strikingly from effects of the multiphasic regulators Leu, Gln, and Tyr in eliciting mirror image responses at half-normal and normal plasma concentrations. Since response curves to phenylpyruvate and Phe were identical, we considered the possibility that phenylpyruvate mediated its anomalous inhibition intracellularly. However, when phenylpyruvate was produced from phenyllactate intracellularly at a rate providing the same rate of transamination (and intracellular concentration) as that derived from the uptake of phenylpyruvate, no response was obtained. Hence, the effect of phenylpyruvate was not initiated within the cell but more likely from the plasma membrane. Comparable evidence for Phe is less direct. Recent findings indicate that recognition sites for Leu and Gln are located at the plasma membrane. Since Phe augments the concerted inhibition by Leu and Gln at 4-fold normal levels, Phe is probably recognized in close proximity to them. However, the failure of phenylpyruvate to substitute for Phe in this interaction suggests that proteolytic inhibition by phenylpyruvate and Phe is mediated through similar, although independent, plasma membrane sites."
https://openalex.org/W1524614578,"We examined the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on the expression of interleukin 6 receptors (IL-6R) on mouse myelomonocytic leukemic M1 cells. Binding studies using 125I-labeled human and murine IL-6 revealed that LIF caused a decrease in IL-6 binding to M1 cells. The decrease became evident within 1 h, and the maximum decrease was observed at 3-6 h. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that M1 cells had a single class of high affinity receptors for IL-6 and that LIF-induced decrease in IL-6 binding was due to a decrease in the number of IL-6R on the cell surface and not to changes in their affinity. The affinity of IL-6R on M1 cells to human IL-6 (Kd = 2.25 nM) was about 10-fold lower than that to murine IL-6 (Kd = 200 pM). The amount of IL-6 secreted into culture media by M1 cells that were treated with LIF for up to 12 h was not enough to cause receptor down-regulation. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that IL-6R mRNA was down-regulated by LIF treatment, and similar regulation was also observed when the cells were treated with IL-6. The time course of the IL-6R mRNA level was similar to that of IL-6R expression on the cell surface, suggesting that the main mechanism responsible for the loss of high affinity IL-6R was the regulation of IL-6R mRNA. Although the half-life of IL-6R on the cell surface was about 30 min, the addition of LIF reduced it to 16 min, suggesting the existence of an additional mechanism responsible for the loss of high affinity IL-6R on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1509820067,"A comprehensive set of hybrid molecules of aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase) from Escherichia coli has been constructed of wild-type and mutationally altered catalytic chains. The mutant enzymes that were virtually devoid of activity contained a replacement of Gly-128 in the catalytic polypeptide chains by either Asp or Arg. The kinetic properties of these hybrid enzyme-like molecules were analyzed to evaluate the basis for the unusual quaternary constraint demonstrated by an intersubunit hybrid containing one wild-type catalytic subunit, one inactive mutant subunit (containing the Gly to Asp replacement), and three wild-type regulatory subunits. A similar intersubunit hybrid was constructed from the wild-type catalytic subunit and the mutant in which Gly-128 was replaced by Arg, and it too demonstrated a pronounced decrease in activity relative to that expected for a hybrid containing three active sites. Moreover, neither of these hybrid holoenzymes exhibited the cooperativity with respect to aspartate that is characteristic of wild-type ATCase. In contrast, hybrid holoenzymes containing at least one wild-type chain in each catalytic subunit showed cooperativity. Also, hybrid enzymes containing different arrangements of five, four, three, or two wild-type catalytic chains with an appropriate complement of mutant chains had specific activities proportional to the number of wild-type chains in the holoenzymes. Exceptions were observed only in hybrids in which one of the two subunits in the holoenzyme was composed completely of mutant catalytic chains. For these hybrids the negative complementation was manifested as a much lower enzyme activity than expected from the number of wild-type chains in the enzyme and the loss of cooperativity. Thus, the activity and allosteric properties of these hybrids is dependent on the arrangement of catalytic chains in the holoenzyme, in contrast to results obtained for hybrids containing native and chemically modified catalytic chains. Intrasubunit hybrid catalytic trimers containing one or two wild-type chains exhibited one-third and two-thirds the activity of the intact wild-type catalytic subunit, respectively, indicating the dominant negative effect that was seen in intersubunit hybrid holoenzymes is absent within trimers."
https://openalex.org/W1643549762,"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increases toad bladder granular cell apical membrane osmotic water permeability (Pf) by insertion of cytoplasmic vesicles containing water channels into the apical membrane. Termination of ADH stimulation results in endocytosis of water channel-containing membrane. In previous work, we have purified water channel-containing vesicles and demonstrated that they contain 12 major protein bands when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). On the basis of vectorial labeling studies of granular cells and purified vesicles, we have proposed previously that vesicle proteins of 55, 53, and 17 kDa are ADH water channel components. In this report, we have purified and analyzed these three proteins using a combination of SDS-PAGE, peptide mapping, amino acid composition, and amino-terminal analyses. The 55- and 53-kDa proteins are distinct protein species possessing a high degree of structural similarity. Both possess a large content of cysteine. The 17-kDa protein appears to be a proteolytic fragment of the 53-kDa protein. None of these three proteins is phosphorylated or contains large amounts of covalently linked carbohydrate. ADH-elicited Pf is inhibited by the organic mercurial reagent fluorescein mercuric acetate (FMA). Exposure of water channel-containing vesicles to FMA labels selectively four vesicle proteins of 92, 55, 53, and 29 kDa while reducing vesicle Pf by 82%. The combination of FMA and 2-mercaptoethanol or exposure to another mercurial reagent, n-ethylmaleimide, does not inhibit vesicle Pf. Together, these data provide additional evidence for the role of the 55- and 53-kDa proteins as components of the ADH water channel. These candidate ADH water channel proteins are distinct from a 28-kDa candidate water channel protein (CHIP 28) isolated recently from human erythrocyte membranes and kidney proximal tubule by Agre and co-workers (Preston, G. M., Carroll, T. P., Guggino, W. B., and Agre, P. (1992) Science 256, 385-387)."
