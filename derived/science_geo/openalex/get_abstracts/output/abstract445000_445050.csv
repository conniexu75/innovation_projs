https://openalex.org/W2123921804,"Cytosine methylation is involved in various biological processes such as silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and imprinting. Multiple pathways regulate DNA methylation in different sequence contexts, but the factors that regulate DNA methylation at a given site in the genome largely remain unknown. Here we have surveyed the methylomes of a comprehensive list of 86 Arabidopsis gene silencing mutants by generating single-nucleotide resolution maps of DNA methylation. We find that DNA methylation is site specifically regulated by different factors. Furthermore, we have identified additional regulators of DNA methylation. These data and analyses will serve as a comprehensive community resource for further understanding the control of DNA methylation patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1995826067,"A 44-year old woman with recurrent solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)/hemangiopericytoma was enrolled in a clinical sequencing program including whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. A gene fusion of the transcriptional repressor NAB2 with the transcriptional activator STAT6 was detected. Transcriptome sequencing of 27 additional SFTs identified the presence of a NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion in all tumors. Using RT-PCR and sequencing, we detected this fusion in all 51 SFTs, indicating high levels of recurrence. Expression of NAB2-STAT6 fusion proteins was confirmed in SFT, and the predicted fusion products harbor the early growth response (EGR)-binding domain of NAB2 fused to the activation domain of STAT6. Overexpression of the NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion induced proliferation in cultured cells and activated the expression of EGR-responsive genes. These studies establish NAB2-STAT6 as the defining driver mutation of SFT and provide an example of how neoplasia can be initiated by converting a transcriptional repressor of mitogenic pathways into a transcriptional activator."
https://openalex.org/W2019346039,"The induction of pluripotency or trans-differentiation of one cell type to another can be accomplished with cell-lineage-specific transcription factors. Here, we report that repression of a single RNA binding polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein, which occurs during normal brain development via the action of miR-124, is sufficient to induce trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into functional neurons. Besides its traditional role in regulated splicing, we show that PTB has a previously undocumented function in the regulation of microRNA functions, suppressing or enhancing microRNA targeting by competitive binding on target mRNA or altering local RNA secondary structure. A key event during neuronal induction is the relief of PTB-mediated blockage of microRNA action on multiple components of the REST complex, thereby derepressing a large array of neuronal genes, including miR-124 and multiple neuronal-specific transcription factors, in nonneuronal cells. This converts a negative feedback loop to a positive one to elicit cellular reprogramming to the neuronal lineage.

Diminished PTB expression is sufficient to trans-differentiate fibroblasts to neurons PTB plays a key role in a regulatory loop to suppress neuronal-specific genes PTB regulates gene expression at both the splicing and RNA stability levels PTB modulates microRNA targeting by competition or switching RNA structure Feedback and feedforward circuits are key regulatory strategies for maintaining gene expression programs in specific cell types, and factors that alter the homeostatic balance of these circuits can induce enduring program switches in cell differentiation and development (Zernicka-Goetz et al., 2009Zernicka-Goetz M.

Many regulatory pathways use such mechanisms to control the output of biological responses through gene networks in transcription (Amit et al., 2009Amit I. Garber M. Chevrier N. Leite A.P. Donner Y.

MicroRNAs have emerged as key mediators in various modes of feedback and feedforward regulation (Leung and Sharp, 2010Leung A.K. Sharp P.A. MicroRNA functions in stress responses.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). MicroRNA are expressed in all higher eukaryotes, ∼800 in humans, and a recent estimate suggests that up to 60% of human genes may be subjected to microRNA control (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15907) Google Scholar). In many cases, homeostasis is achieved by feedback controls in which specific transcription factors or RNA-binding proteins regulate the expression and biogenesis of microRNAs, which, in turn, suppress the expression of their regulators. Neuronal differentiation is a well-studied paradigm as a consequence of transcription reprogramming (Li and Jin, 2010Li X. Jin P. Roles of small regulatory RNAs in determining neuronal identity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that a set of neuronal-specific transcription factors is sufficient to trans-differentiate fibroblasts into functional neurons (Caiazzo et al., 2011Caiazzo M. Dell’Anno M.T.

Several neuronal-specific microRNA, such as miR-9/9∗ and miR-124, also play key roles in this process (Yoo et al., 2011Yoo A.S. Sun A.X. Li L. Shcheglovitov A. Portmann T. Li Y. Lee-Messer C. Dolmetsch R.E. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. MicroRNA-mediated conversion of human fibroblasts to neurons.Nature. 2011; 476: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). miR-124 is a well-known regulator of the transcription silencing complex built on RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST), which represses a large array of neuronal-specific genes in nonneuronal cells; this includes miR-124 itself, thus forming an autoregulatory loop during neuronal differentiation (Ballas et al., 2005Ballas N.

Forced expression of miR-124 can drive differentiation of neural progenitor cells to neurons (Cheng et al., 2009Cheng L.C. Pastrana E. Tavazoie M. Doetsch F. miR-124 regulates adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone stem cell niche.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) and C2C12 cells to become neuronal-like cells (Watanabe et al., 2004Watanabe Y. Kameoka S. Gopalakrishnan V. Aldape K.D. Pan Z.Z. Lang F.F. Majumder S. Conversion of myoblasts to physiologically active neuronal phenotype.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Regulated RNA processing also plays a critical role in neuronal differentiation. The polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein and its homolog nPTB undergo a programmed switch during neuronal differentiation (Boutz et al., 2007Boutz P.L. Stoilov P. Li Q. Lin C.H. Chawla G. Ostrow K. Shiue L. Ares Jr., M. Black D.L. A post-transcriptional regulatory switch in polypyrimidine tract-binding proteins reprograms alternative splicing in developing neurons.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1636-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar; Makeyev et al., 2007Makeyev E.V.

Cell. 2007; 27: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar; Zheng et al., 2012Zheng S. Gray E.E. Chawla G. Porse B.T. O’Dell T.J. Black D.L. PSD-95 is post-transcriptionally repressed during early neural development by PTBP1 and PTBP2.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). miR-124 is able to modulate such switch by reducing PTB, thereby reprogramming an array of neuronal-specific alternative splicing events, and forced expression of PTB is able to block miR-124-induced neuronal differentiation (Makeyev et al., 2007Makeyev E.V. Zhang J. Carrasco M.A. Maniatis T. The MicroRNA miR-124 promotes neuronal differentiation by triggering brain-specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing.Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear whether the PTB/nPTB switch is sufficient to initiate neuronal differentiation, and if so, which specific PTB/nPTB-regulated splicing events contribute to such cell fate switch. We previously reported global PTB-RNA interactions in the human genome (Xue et al., 2009Xue Y. Zhou Y. Wu T. Zhu T. Ji X. Kwon Y.S. Zhang C. Yeo G. Black D.L. Sun H. et al.Genome-wide analysis of PTB-RNA interactions reveals a strategy used by the general splicing repressor to modulate exon inclusion or skipping.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 996-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In PTB-depleted cells, we unexpectedly observed conversion of diverse cell types into neuronal-like cells. In addition to induced alternative splicing events, we found an extensive involvement of PTB in the regulation of microRNA targeting through either direct competition or induced switch of local RNA secondary structure. A key event is the activation of the miR-124/REST loop in which PTB not only serves as a target, but also acts as a potent regulator. Consequently, regulated PTB expression induces massive reprogramming at both the splicing and microRNA levels to drive the cell fate decision toward the neuronal lineage. We attempted to use specific small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to stably knock down PTB in order to systematically analyze PTB-regulated splicing. As expected, shPTB induced nPTB expression in HeLa cells (Figure S1A available online). We noted a slow-growth phenotype of shPTB-treated cells, which was also seen by others (He et al., 2007He X. Pool M. Darcy K.M. Lim S.B. Auersperg N. Coon J.S. Beck W.T. Knockdown of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein suppresses ovarian tumor cell growth and invasiveness in vitro.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Strikingly, many PTB-depleted HeLa cells exhibited neurite outgrowth, and further analysis revealed the expression of several neuron markers, including class III β-tubulin (known as Tuj1) and MAP2 (Figures 1A and S1A), suggesting that PTB knockdown converted highly transformed HeLa cells to neuronal-like cells.Figure 1Differentiation of Diverse Cell Types into Neuronal-like Cells in Response to PTB KnockdownShow full caption(A) Induction of neuronal morphology and the expression of the neuronal marker Tuj1 in multiple cell types in response to depletion of PTB.

We extended this analysis to multiple cell types of diverse origin, including human embryonic carcinoma stem cells (NT2), mouse neural progenitor cells (N2A), human retinal epithelial cells (ARPE19), and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Upon PTB knockdown (Figure S1B), all of these cells exhibited a neuronal-like morphology and showed strong Tuj1 staining (Figure 1A). Neuronal committed N2A and NT2 cells were potently induced to show typical neuronal morphology in ∼5 days after PTB knockdown and develop more complex morphology after the cells were switched to N3 media containing a set of neural growth factors for 3–5 days. ARPE19 and MEFs took ∼2 weeks to develop typical neuronal morphology in N3 media. Control shRNA treatment had no effect under these conditions. We further characterized two of these cell lines (N2A and MEFs) by examining additional neural markers, including Synapsin 1 (SYN1), vGLUT1, and NeuN (Figure 1B). SYN1 and vGLUT1 showed a typical punctate staining pattern on Tuj1-positive cells, but not on undifferentiated cells in the same field (Figure 1B). We also detected strong staining of GABA channel receptors on these derived neurons (data not shown). As previously described (Vierbuchen et al., 2010Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar), immunostaining and RT-PCR analyses ruled out potential contamination of our starting MEFs with neural crest cells (Figures S1C and S1D). Both N2A cells and MEFs were efficiently converted by two distinct shRNAs against PTB to neuronal-like cells (Figure S1E). Importantly, the effect of specific shPTB molecules could each be rescued with the shRNA-resistant PTB expression unit that carries synonymous mutations (M1 or M2) in their targeting sites, thus ruling out potential off-target effects (Figure 1C). Time-course analysis demonstrated that PTB knockdown progressively converted MEFs to neuronal-like cells with complex morphology (Figure 1, Figure 1D and 1E). These data strongly suggest that PTB downregulation potently induced these cells to differentiate (in the case of N2A cells) or trans-differentiate (in the case of MEFs) into neurons. To determine the functionality of differentiated cells, we patch-clamped both shPTB-induced neurons from N2A cells and MEFs. We observed that 11 out of 12 N2A cell-derived neurons exhibited fast inward Na+ currents and action potential upon membrane depolarization (Figure S2A) and that seven out of eight shPTB-induced MEFs showed a similar response, which could be blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX), a specific inhibitor of sodium channels (Figure 2A). Both of these induced cell types showed depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx (Figures S2B and S2C). We next determined whether MEF-derived neurons are fully functional in the presence of primary astrocytes, which is known to be essential for trans-differentiated MEFs to become synaptically competent (Vierbuchen et al., 2010Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). After coculture for a week with freshly isolated astrocytes free of contaminating neurons from the brain of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic rat, we detected repetitive action potentials of varying frequencies driven by current pulse in five out of six MEFs-derived neurons (Figure 2B). Importantly, we recorded synaptic activities on six out of seven such neurons examined (Figures 2C and 2D).Figure 2Synaptic Activities on Neurons Derived from shPTB-Induced MEFsShow full caption(A) Representative traces of whole-cell currents on control shRNA-treated (top) and shPTB-treated (bottom) MEFs.

The number of cells that show the representative response against total cells examined is indicated in each panel. See also Figure S2. The detected postsynaptic currents likely reflect both glutamatergic and GABAergic responses, because 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) plus D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) (antagonists of glutamatergic channel receptors) and Picrotoxin (PiTX, antagonist of GABAA channel receptors) could sequentially block the expected signals (Figure 2, Figure 2E and 2F). We further recorded GABA-induced, PiTX-sensitive currents upon focal application of GABA (Figure 2G). In the presence of PiTX, we detected AMPA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) with fast kinetics when holding the neuron at −70mV with an external solution containing 2 mM Mg2+ (Figure 2H), which is known to inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) EPSC with slow kinetics (Nowak et al., 1984Nowak L. Bregestovski P. Ascher P. Herbet A. Prochiantz A. Magnesium gates glutamate-activated channels in mouse central neurones.Nature. 1984; 307: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar). By holding the neuron at +60mV to relieve the inhibitory effect of Mg2+, we detected both NMDA and AMPA EPSCs, which could be progressively blocked by the NMDA channel inhibitor APV and the AMPA channel antagonist CNQX (Figure 2H). These data demonstrated that shPTB had trans-differentiated MEFs into functional neurons. Because of the induced neuronal morphology and the availability of the genome-wide PTB-RNA interaction map on HeLa cells (Xue et al., 2009Xue Y. Zhou Y. Wu T. Zhu T. Ji X. Kwon Y.S. Zhang C. Yeo G. Black D.L. Sun H. et al.Genome-wide analysis of PTB-RNA interactions reveals a strategy used by the general splicing repressor to modulate exon inclusion or skipping.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 996-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we initially took this cell type as a surrogate model to understand shPTB-induced cellular reprogramming. We identified by RNA-seq a large number of up- or downregulated genes induced by shPTB (Figure S3A), and we further confirmed a panel of these events by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure S3B). Gene ontology analysis showed that many such altered genes were linked to neuronal functions (Figure S3C). These observations indicate that PTB is extensively involved in the regulation of neuronal genes in nonneuronal cells. We noted the induction of Brn2 and Myt1l, which correspond to two out of five key transcription factors previously shown to be sufficient to induce trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into neurons (Vierbuchen et al., 2010Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Because HeLa cells have a severely rearranged genome, we performed a focused analysis on MEFs by qRT-PCR (Figure 3A), detecting the induction of all five critical transcription factors (Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l, Zic1, and Olig2) as well as NeuroD1 known to enhance neurogenesis in human fibroblasts (Pang et al., 2011Pang Z.P. Yang N. Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Fuentes D.R. Yang T.Q. Citri A. Sebastiano V. Marro S. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Induction of human neuronal cells by defined transcription factors.Nature. 2011; 476: 220-223PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed the induction of miR-124 and miR-9 (Figure 3A), which have been shown to synergize with neuronal-specific transcription factors in promoting neurogenesis (Yoo et al., 2011Yoo A.S. Sun A.X. Li L. Shcheglovitov A. Portmann T. Li Y. Lee-Messer C. Dolmetsch R.E. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. MicroRNA-mediated conversion of human fibroblasts to neurons.Nature. 2011; 476: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). These data explain the compatible functionality of shPTB-induced neurons to that converted by a set of lineage-specific transcription factors. The REST complex is known to repress a large set of neuronal genes in nonneuronal cells (Johnson et al., 2007Johnson D.S. Mortazavi A. Myers R.M. Wold B. Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein-DNA interactions.Science. 2007; 316: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (2004) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we noted that all induced transcription factors examined in Figure 3A contain significant REST ChIP-seq signals from the ENCODE data on C2C12 cells. We confirmed strong REST binding by ChIP-qPCR on most of these genes in MEFs, and, as expected, REST knockdown induced the expression of these genes (Figures S3D and S3E). These data suggest that the function of the REST complex might be compromised in shPTB-treated MEFs. To determine how the REST complex was compromised, we examined the response of REST and REST cofactors to shPTB in HeLa cells. While REST expression was little affected from our RNA-seq analysis, we found that SCP1, a Pol II Ser5 phosphatase associated with the REST complex (Yeo et al., 2005Yeo M. Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Small CTD phosphatases function in silencing neuronal gene expression.Science. 2005; 307: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), was significantly downregulated by shPTB in multiple cell types with induced neuronal morphology (Figure 3B). The effect of shPTB on SCP1 expression could be rescued on two of these cell types we examined (Figures 3C and 3D). During the course of retinoic-acid-induced neural differentiation on NT2 cells, we observed that SCP1 expression was gradually reduced, which closely tracked PTB downregulation and nPTB induction (Figure 3E). These findings suggest that PTB-regulated expression of the REST cofactor SCP1 may play a key role in neuronal differentiation under physiological conditions. Recent studies suggest that REST is required for maintaining the population of neural stem cells (Gao et al., 2011Gao Z. Ure K. Ding P. Nashaat M. Yuan L. Ma J. Hammer R.E. Hsieh J. The master negative regulator REST/NRSF controls adult neurogenesis by restraining the neurogenic program in quiescent stem cells.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9772-9786Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and genetic inactivation of REST does not efficiently turn fibroblasts into neurons, despite the induction of some neuronal genes (Aoki et al., 2012Aoki H. Hara A. Era T. Kunisada T. Yamada Y. Genetic ablation of Rest leads to in vitro-specific derepression of neuronal genes during neurogenesis.Development. 2012; 139: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, a dominant-negative SCP1 was able to efficiently drive neuronal differentiation on P19 cells (Yeo et al., 2005Yeo M. Lee S.K. Lee B. Ruiz E.C. Pfaff S.L. Gill G.N. Small CTD phosphatases function in silencing neuronal gene expression.Science. 2005; 307: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We thus wished to directly test the contribution of SCP1 to shPTB-induced neurogenesis under our experimental conditions, and we similarly tested REST for comparison. We found that both shSCP1 and shREST, but not control shRNA, were able to trigger neuronal differentiation on MEFs (Figure 3F). The neural induction efficiency by shSCP1 and shREST was similar, but lower than that induced by shPTB (compared Figure 1C and Figure 3F), indicating that other PTB-regulated events may additionally contribute to the induction of neurogenesis. The reason for efficient induction of neurogenesis with shPTB or shRNA against REST or a REST cofactor gene may be due to gradual switch of these cell-lineage-specific regulators, which may mimic relevant developmental processes (see Disc"

Herbivores are often adapted to feed on a specific group of evolutionarily and biochemically related host plants, but the genetic and molecular bases for adaptation to plant defense compounds remain poorly understood. We report the first whole-genome sequence of a basal lepidopteran species, Plutella xylostella, which contains 18,071 protein-coding and 1,412 unique genes with an expansion of gene families associated with perception and the detoxification of plant defense compounds. A recent expansion of retrotransposons near detoxification-related genes and a wider system used in the metabolism of plant defense compounds are shown to also be involved in the development of insecticide resistance. This work shows the genetic and molecular bases for the evolutionary success of this worldwide herbivore and offers wider insights into insect adaptation to plant feeding, as well as opening avenues for more sustainable pest management."

Here, we describe mutations occurring exclusively at codon 625 of the SF3B1 gene, encoding splicing factor 3B subunit 1, in low-grade uveal melanomas with good prognosis. Thus, uveal melanoma is among a small group of cancers associated with SF3B1 mutations, and these mutations denote a distinct molecular subset of uveal melanomas."

Here, we show that new hair cells can be induced and can cause partial recovery of hearing in ears damaged by noise trauma, when Notch signaling is inhibited by a γ-secretase inhibitor selected for potency in stimulating hair cell differentiation from inner ear stem cells in vitro. Hair cell generation resulted from an increase in the level of bHLH transcription factor Atoh1 in response to inhibition of Notch signaling. In vivo prospective labeling of Sox2-expressing cells with a Cre-lox system unambiguously demonstrated that hair cell generation resulted from transdifferentiation of supporting cells. Manipulating cell fate of cochlear sensory cells in vivo by pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling is thus a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of deafness."
https://openalex.org/W2076687395,"Subtypes of GABAergic interneurons (INs) are crucial for cortical function, yet their specific roles are largely unknown. In contrast to supra- and infragranular layers, where most somatostatin-expressing (SOM) INs are layer 1-targeting Martinotti cells, the axons of SOM INs in layer 4 of somatosensory cortex largely remain within layer 4. Moreover, we found that whereas layers 2/3 SOM INs target mainly pyramidal cells (PCs), layer 4 SOM INs target mainly fast-spiking (FS) INs. Accordingly, optogenetic inhibition of SOM INs in an active cortical network increases the firing of layers 2/3 PCs whereas it decreases the firing of layer 4 principal neurons (PNs). This unexpected effect of SOM INs on layer 4 PNs occurs via their inhibition of local FS INs. These results reveal a disinhibitory microcircuit in the thalamorecipient layer through interactions among subtypes of INs and suggest that the SOM IN-mediated disinhibition represents an important circuit mechanism for cortical information processing."

Here we performed a high-throughput screen of over 52,000 small molecules and identified 15 pluripotent cell-specific inhibitors (PluriSIns), nine of which share a common structural moiety. The PluriSIns selectively eliminated hPSCs while sparing a large array of progenitor and differentiated cells. Cellular and molecular analyses demonstrated that the most selective compound, PluriSIn #1, induces ER stress, protein synthesis attenuation, and apoptosis in hPSCs. Close examination identified this molecule as an inhibitor of stearoyl-coA desaturase (SCD1), the key enzyme in oleic acid biosynthesis, revealing a unique role for lipid metabolism in hPSCs. PluriSIn #1 was also cytotoxic to mouse blastocysts, indicating that the dependence on oleate is inherent to the pluripotent state. Finally, application of PluriSIn #1 prevented teratoma formation from tumorigenic undifferentiated cells. These findings should increase the safety of hPSC-based treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1995721971,"Deciphering the interneuronal circuitry is central to understanding brain functions, yet it remains a challenging task in neurobiology. Using simultaneous quadruple-octuple in vitro and dual in vivo whole-cell recordings, we found two previously unknown interneuronal circuits that link cortical layer 1-3 (L1-3) interneurons and L5 pyramidal neurons in the rat neocortex. L1 single-bouquet cells (SBCs) preferentially formed unidirectional inhibitory connections on L2/3 interneurons that inhibited the entire dendritic-somato-axonal axis of ∼1% of L5 pyramidal neurons located in the same column. In contrast, L1 elongated neurogliaform cells (ENGCs) frequently formed mutual inhibitory and electric connections with L2/3 interneurons, and these L1-3 interneurons inhibited the distal apical dendrite of >60% of L5 pyramidal neurons across multiple columns. Functionally, SBC→L2/3 interneuron→L5 pyramidal neuronal circuits disinhibited and ENGC↔L2/3 interneuron→L5 pyramidal neuronal circuits inhibited the initiation of dendritic complex spikes in L5 pyramidal neurons. As dendritic complex spikes can serve coincidence detection, these cortical interneuronal circuits may be essential for salience selection."

Feasibility was demonstrated in patients with Barrett’s esophagus, including high-grade dysplasia. Here we introduce tethered capsule endomicroscopy, which involves swallowing an optomechanically engineered pill that captures cross-sectional microscopic images of the gut wall at 30 μm (lateral) × 7 μm (axial) resolution as it travels through the digestive tract.

However, the cellular mechanisms that coordinate interactions between oscillations in different frequency bands are not known. The relationships between mechanisms that generate oscillatory reference signals and those that support representation of information through firing rate codes are also not clear. Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) represent location relative to the external environment using rate-coded grid-like firing fields and by timing of their action potentials relative to theta frequency (4–12 Hz) network rhythms (Fyhn et al., 2004Fyhn M.

Nested within the slower theta rhythm are network oscillations with frequency in the high gamma range (60–120 Hz) (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998Chrobak J.J. Buzsáki G. Gamma oscillations in the entorhinal cortex of the freely behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 388-398PubMed Google Scholar; Colgin et al., 2009Colgin L.L. Denninger T. Fyhn M. Hafting T. Bonnevie T. Jensen O. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Frequency of gamma oscillations routes flow of information in the hippocampus.Nature. 2009; 462: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). These gamma frequency oscillations are believed to act as a reference signal to coordinate interactions between MEC neurons and their synaptic partners in the hippocampus (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G. Draguhn A. Neuronal oscillations in cortical networks.Science. 2004; 304: 1926-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (4110) Google Scholar; Colgin et al., 2009Colgin L.L. Denninger T. Fyhn M. Hafting T.

Frequency of gamma oscillations routes flow of information in the hippocampus.Nature. 2009; 462: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), so that ensembles of MEC neurons with firing that is phase locked to nested gamma oscillations more effectively activate downstream neurons on which their synaptic output converges (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012Buzsáki G. Wang X.J. Mechanisms of gamma oscillations.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar; Fries, 2009Fries P. Neuronal gamma-band synchronization as a fundamental process in cortical computation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Nested gamma oscillations are also hypothesized to enable temporal codes in which different items are encoded on each gamma cycle (Lisman, 2005Lisman J. The theta/gamma discrete phase code occuring during the hippocampal phase precession may be a more general brain coding scheme.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, the cellular mechanisms that enable generation of grid firing fields and theta-nested gamma oscillations are not clear. The possibility that theta frequency drive is sufficient for generation of nested gamma oscillations has not previously been addressed. It is also not clear if the same circuit mechanisms generate nested oscillatory activity and grid firing fields, or if instead either form of activity requires additional circuit elements. Because encoding of location by grid cells in layer II of the MEC requires inputs from the medial septum and as activity of these inputs is modulated at theta frequency (Brandon et al., 2011Brandon M.P. Bogaard A.R. Libby C.P. Connerney M.A. Gupta K. Hasselmo M.E. Reduction of theta rhythm dissociates grid cell spatial periodicity from directional tuning.Science. 2011; 332: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar; Koenig et al., 2011Koenig J.

Rawlins J.N. Steward O. Olton D.S. Medial septal area lesions disrupt theta rhythm and cholinergic staining in medial entorhinal cortex and produce impaired radial arm maze behavior in rats.J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 292-302PubMed Google Scholar), we set out to investigate whether theta frequency activation of layer II networks is sufficient to generate nested gamma oscillations. Using optogenetic stimulation, we demonstrate that theta frequency optical activation elicits nested gamma frequency oscillations that closely resemble activity observed during spatial behaviors. In contrast to pharmacologically induced gamma activity, optical nested oscillations have frequency in the high gamma band and have clock-like properties that make them suitable for multiplexing temporal codes within rate-coded firing fields. Optical theta-nested gamma and pharmacologically induced gamma activity also differ in their underlying mechanism. Layer II of the MEC contains inhibitory interneurons and excitatory stellate cells (SCs) that are likely to correspond to grid cells (Burgalossi et al., 2011Burgalossi A. Herfst L. von Heimendahl M.

Nolan M.F. Intrinsic electrophysiological properties of entorhinal cortex stellate cells and their contribution to grid cell firing fields.Front Neural Circuits. 2012; 6: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but the synaptic and functional interactions of SCs and interneurons have not been determined. We establish that nested gamma oscillations require synaptic interactions mediated by local feedback inhibition between SCs but do not involve recurrent excitation. Finally, we demonstrate that networks of excitatory neurons connected only by feedback inhibition are sufficient to generate grid firing fields through network attractor states and to simultaneously produce clock-like theta-nested gamma oscillations. To test the sufficiency of local theta frequency activity in the MEC for generation of nested gamma frequency oscillations, we adopted an optogenetic approach (Figure 1 and see Figure S1 available online). We recorded activity from neurons in layer II of the MEC in brain slices prepared from adult mice. We used a mouse line in which expression of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is under the control of the Thy1 promoter (Arenkiel et al., 2007Arenkiel B.R. Peca J. Davison I.G. Feliciano C. Deisseroth K. Augustine G.J. Ehlers M.D. Feng G. In vivo light-induced activation of neural circuitry in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2.Neuron. 2007; 54: 205-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In this mouse line, all tested SCs and fast-spiking (FS) interneurons were depolarized by light, but pyramidal cells were not (Figure S1). We found that theta frequency (8 Hz) optical stimulation causes local field potential oscillations nested within each theta cycle (Figures 1A–1C). This nested activity had frequency 86.1 ± 2.4 Hz (range 62.4–100.8 Hz, n = 13), similar to the frequency of nested gamma activity reported in the MEC of behaving animals (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998Chrobak J.J.

Carbachol induces fast oscillations in the medial but not in the lateral entorhinal cortex of the isolated guinea pig brain.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 2441-2450PubMed Google Scholar). To begin to investigate the synaptic mechanisms mediating nested gamma activity, we recorded membrane currents from SCs. We observed nested synaptic currents with frequency 82.7 ± 2.05 Hz (range 64.2–100.8, n = 21) (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1D). Cross-correlation analysis indicated that the timing of the nested synaptic currents was similar to simultaneously recorded theta-nested epochs of field gamma activity (peak correlation = 0.81 ± 0.02, lag 0.12 ± 0.2 ms, n = 21) (Figures 1E and 1F), indicating that they reflect the same process. Consistent with this conclusion, the frequency with maximum power for synaptic and simultaneously recorded field gamma activity was also highly correlated (slope = 0.94, R2 = 0.9, p = 4.2 × 10−11, n = 21). The nested synaptic currents recorded from SCs were outward going, suggesting that nested gamma oscillations involve inhibitory synaptic input to SCs (Figure 1A). We therefore recorded the membrane potential of SCs and nearby FS interneurons during theta stimulation (Figure 1G). SCs fired on average 1.5 ± 0.2 action potentials per theta epoch (n = 55), whereas interneurons fired 13.4 ± 3.1 spikes per epoch (n = 11) (Figure S1). Theta stimulation modulated the timing of action potential firing by both neuron types (44/48 SCs and 11/11 interneurons, p < 0.05 versus a uniform distribution, Kuiper test). Within each theta cycle, action potential firing by SCs and interneurons coincided with nested gamma oscillations (Figures 1G–1I) and the range of theta phases during which interneurons and SCs fired action potentials was similar (mean theta phase of first spike: SC −1.24 rads [from peak], n = 48, FS interneuron −1.72 rads, n = 11, p = 0.79, nonparametric second-order analysis of angles [NSOA]; mean theta phase of last spike: SC 0.96 rads, n = 37, FS interneuron 1.12 rads, n = 11, p = 0.37, NSOA). However, the distribution of SC and FS interneuron action potential times differed, with SC action potentials following a bimodal distribution with respect to the theta phase, whereas action potentials fired by interneurons followed a broad unimodal distribution (p = 6 × 10−4, NSOA) (Figures 1H and 1I). The frequency and relative timing of action potentials fired by SCs and interneurons, which we record here during optical theta stimulation, is similar to that recorded from neurons in layer II of the MEC during theta activity in behaving animals (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998Chrobak J.J.

Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop.Neuron. 2009; 64: 267-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Nested gamma oscillations may enable temporal codes that operate relative to the theta cycle to be superimposed upon firing rate codes (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012Buzsáki G. Wang X.J.

The theta/gamma discrete phase code occuring during the hippocampal phase precession may be a more general brain coding scheme.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For temporal codes that require predictable reference signals (Fries, 2009Fries P. Neuronal gamma-band synchronization as a fundamental process in cortical computation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar; Lisman, 2005Lisman J. The theta/gamma discrete phase code occuring during the hippocampal phase precession may be a more general brain coding scheme.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), multiplexing of rate and phase codes is likely to be particularly effective if gamma oscillations have clock-like consistency between consecutive theta epochs (Lisman, 2005Lisman J. The theta/gamma discrete phase code occuring during the hippocampal phase precession may be a more general brain coding scheme.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), but it is not clear how this might be achieved. Surprisingly, we find that while the timing and number of spikes fired by stellate or inhibitory neurons differs between theta cycles, the timing of the gamma oscillations relative to the theta cycle is robust (cf. Figures 1G–1I, 2A, and 2B ). To quantify the reliability of gamma oscillations, we compared the time of each gamma peak during a theta epoch with its average time across all epochs. In many cells, each gamma peak fell within a 5 ms window on the majority of theta cycles (Figure 2C). Similarly, even on the fifth gamma peak of each theta cycle, the difference between the time of each gamma peak and the time of the corresponding average peak could be <3 ms, compared with the gamma period of >10 ms (Figure 2D). For both measures, some, but not all, SCs demonstrate nested gamma activity with timing that is consistent between theta cycles. While the reason for this variability is unclear, these observations nevertheless establish that in principle local theta drive to circuits in the MEC can generate gamma activity with clock-like properties in a substantial fraction of SCs. To further compare the timing of optically induced nested gamma with activity in vivo, we averaged traces captured by triggering from the negative peak of each gamma oscillation. When nested gamma activity recorded from the MEC of behaving animals is analyzed in this way, average traces contain side peaks adjacent to the central peak, indicating periodicity of the gamma activity (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998Chrobak J.J. Buzsáki G. Gamma oscillations in the entorhinal cortex of the freely behaving rat.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 388-398PubMed Google Scholar). Applying this analysis to optically induced nested gamma also reveals side peaks adjacent to the central peak (Figure 2E). This comparison is consistent with the idea that theta-nested gamma oscillations in the entorhinal circuit provide a reference signal for hypothesized coding schemes that require precise temporal coordination of action potential firing (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012Buzsáki G. Wang X.J. Mechanisms of gamma oscillations.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar; Lisman, 2005Lisman J. The theta/gamma discrete phase code occuring during the hippocampal phase precession may be a more general brain coding scheme.Hippocampus. 2005; 15: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To test whether the properties of nested gamma oscillations are unique to theta frequency stimulation, we compared responses to optical stimulation at 2, 8, and 16 Hz (Figure S2). With activation at 2, 8, and 16 Hz, we observed 23 ± 0.3, 6.6 ± 0.1, and 2.7 ± 0.2 oscillations per stimulus cycle (p < 10−9, ANOVA). Although there is no difference in the frequency with maximum power for 2 Hz compared to 8 Hz stimulation (p = 0.11, ANOVA), gamma activity was not as consistently maintained through each 2 Hz cycle, with the result that the total number of gamma cycles available to contribute to information processing is reduced (p = 0.0003, t test). Thus, the phase of maximum gamma power occurred earlier in the stimulation cycle (p = 0.0005), the gamma frequency at the trough of the stimulation cycle was lower (p = 0.005, n = 6), and the gamma activity persevered through a narrower range of the stimulation cycle (p = 1.1 × 10−6). These properties did not differ between 8 Hz and 16 Hz stimulation (p > 0.1 for all comparisons). These data suggest that layer II of the MEC is optimized to generate gamma oscillations for approximately half the duration of each theta cycle but is less effective at sustaining gamma oscillations during stimulation at lower frequencies, while stimulation at higher frequencies generates fewer gamma oscillations per cycle. Together, these data suggest that theta frequency activation of MEC layer II is sufficient to generate theta-nested gamma activity that resembles activity observed from the MEC of behaving animals (Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998Chrobak J.J.

Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop.Neuron. 2009; 64: 267-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In both forms of nested activity, the frequency of gamma oscillations is similar, action potential firing by interneurons and excitatory neurons is on the same phase of the theta cycle, and on each theta cycle excitatory neurons fire relatively few spikes, whereas interneurons fire multiple spikes. Nested gamma activity has clock-like properties that may enable it to serve as a reference signal for temporal codes. What circuit mechanisms mediate nested gamma oscillations? In principle, gamma frequency oscillatory activity can be generated exclusively by interneuron networks or by networks that involve coordination of action potential firing by interneurons and excitatory neurons (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012Buzsáki G. Wang X.J. Mechanisms of gamma oscillations.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar; Fries, 2009Fries P.

Cortical enlightenment: are attentional gamma oscillations driven by ING or PING?.Neuron. 2009; 63: 727-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The respective roles of these mechanisms in generating theta-nested gamma oscillations are not clear. To establish whether synaptic input from excitatory or inhibitory cells is required for nested gamma oscillations, we blocked each component of synaptic transmission pharmacologically. Antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) reduced total gamma power by a factor of 5.53 in SCs (n = 23, p = 1.1 × 10−8, paired t test) and a factor of 28.9 in FS interneurons (n = 5, p = 4.4 × 10−4, paired t test). As a result, spectral peaks at gamma frequencies were no longer observed (Figure 3). Antagonists of iGluRs had only very small effects on the mean firing rate (SCs: p = 0.28, n = 24, FS ints: p = 0.04, n = 8, paired t tests) and did not affect theta modulation of firing (Figure S3). The relatively small change in firing rate after block of iGluRs is because the majority of the current driving action potential firing is mediated directly by activation of ChR2 (Figure S3). Therefore, the absence of gamma frequency activity during block of iGluRs is not explained by failure of interneurons to generate action potentials during optical theta stimulation. Instead, these data indicate that excitatory synaptic transmission mediated by iGluRs is required to coordinate nested gamma frequency activity. To determine whether theta-nested gamma is generated independently of synaptic connections from neurons in deeper layers of the MEC, and to further investigate differences between optical and pharmacologically induced gamma activity, we recorded from layer II neurons in slices in which the adjacent deeper layers of the MEC have been separated (Figures 3G and 3H). Blocking NMDA receptors abolishes pharmacologically induced gamma activity generated locally in layer II of the MEC and reveals lower-frequency activity that originates from layer III (Middleton et al., 2008Middleton S. Jalics J. Kispersky T. Lebeau F.E. Roopun A.K. Kopell N.J. Whittington M.A. Cunningham M.O. NMDA receptor-dependent switching between different gamma rhythm-generating microcircuits in entorhinal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 18572-18577Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that optical theta-nested gamma activity is generated in slices in which layers II and III are separated and is maintained after block of NMDA receptors with D-APV (Figures 3G and 3H). Therefore, optical theta-nested gamma is generated locally in layer II of the MEC and, unlike gamma induced pharmacologically in layer II, it does not require activation of NMDA receptors. We next tested the role of fast inhibitory synaptic transmission. Antagonists of GABA receptors substantially reduced theta-nested gamma activity in SCs (by an average factor of 13.5, p = 0.02, n = 8, paired t test) (Figures 4A–4C). Block of synaptic inhibition had a small effect on the frequency (p = 0.046, n = 8, paired t test) but did not affect theta modulation of action potentials fired by SCs (Figure S4). Importantly, block of inhibitory synaptic transmission did not reveal excitatory inward currents in recordings from SCs during theta stimulation, even though SCs fired at 13.4 ± 2.7 Hz, suggesting that SCs do not form recurrent excitatory connections with one another. To further test this possibility, we drove SCs to fire action potentials using ramp stimuli (Figures 4D and 4E). Because the ramps switch SCs from silent to active states, we expect them to reveal synaptic responses that depress during prolonged stimulation or that summate from distal locations. Ramp stimuli also did not evoke detectable synaptic responses (Figure"

A point mutation in the gene encoding Ca(V)1.2 causes Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We report that channels with the Timothy syndrome alteration cause activity-dependent dendrite retraction in rat and mouse neurons and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from individuals with Timothy syndrome. Dendrite retraction was independent of calcium permeation through the mutant channel, was associated with ectopic activation of RhoA and was inhibited by overexpression of the channel-associated GTPase Gem. These results suggest that Ca(V)1.2 can activate RhoA signaling independently of Ca(2+) and provide insights into the cellular basis of Timothy syndrome and other ASDs."
https://openalex.org/W2116429223,"Embryonic development is characterized by dynamic changes in gene expression, yet the role of chromatin remodeling in these cellular transitions remains elusive. To address this question, we profiled the transcriptome and select chromatin modifications at defined stages during pancreatic endocrine differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. We identify removal of Polycomb group (PcG)-mediated repression on stage-specific genes as a key mechanism for the induction of developmental regulators. Furthermore, we discover that silencing of transitory genes during lineage progression associates with reinstatement of PcG-dependent repression. Significantly, in vivo- but not in vitro-differentiated endocrine cells exhibit close similarity to primary human islets in regard to transcriptome and chromatin structure. We further demonstrate that endocrine cells produced in vitro do not fully eliminate PcG-mediated repression on endocrine-specific genes, probably contributing to their malfunction. These studies reveal dynamic chromatin remodeling during developmental lineage progression and identify possible strategies for improving cell differentiation in culture."

However, in many of these disorders, the underlying genetic defect has yet to be discovered. Here, we identify homozygous nonsense and missense mutations in the orphan gene C20orf72 in three families with a mitochondrial syndrome characterized by external ophthalmoplegia, emaciation and respiratory failure. Muscle biopsies showed mtDNA depletion and multiple mtDNA deletions. C20orf72, hereafter MGME1 (mitochondrial genome maintenance exonuclease 1), encodes a mitochondrial RecB-type exonuclease belonging to the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily. We show that MGME1 cleaves single-stranded DNA and processes DNA flap substrates. Fibroblasts from affected individuals do not repopulate after chemically induced mtDNA depletion. They also accumulate intermediates of stalled replication and show increased levels of 7S DNA, as do MGME1-depleted cells. Thus, we show that MGME1-mediated mtDNA processing is essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance."

In this study, we show that oncostatin M (OSM) is expressed in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in invasive breast carcinoma. OSM stimulation promotes spontaneous lung metastasis of MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice. A conspicuous epigenetic transition was induced by OSM stimulation not only in breast cancer cell lines but also in MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice. The expression of miR-200 and let-7 family members in response to OSM stimulation was downregulated in a signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (Stat3)-dependent manner, resulting in comprehensive alterations of the transcription factors and oncoproteins targeted by these microRNAs. Inhibition of Stat3 activation or the ectopic expression of let-7 and miR-200 effectively reversed the mesenchymal phenotype of breast cancer cells. Stat3 promotes the transcription of Lin-28 by directly binding to the Lin-28 promoter, resulting in the repression of let-7 expression and concomitant upregulation of the let-7 target, high-mobility group A protein 2 (HMGA2). Knock down of HMGA2 significantly impairs OSM-driven EMT. Our data indicate that downregulation of let-7 and miR-200 levels initiates and maintains OSM-induced EMT phenotypes, and HMGA2 acts as a master switch of OSM-induced EMT. These findings highlight the importance of Stat3-coordinated Lin-28B-let-7-HMGA2 and miR-200-ZEB1 circuits in the cytokine-mediated phenotypic reprogramming of breast cancer cells."

Distinct subdivisions within this region generate distinct neurons. For instance, the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) generates striatal projection neurons whereas the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) generates pallidal projection neurons. Domains within the MGE are biased toward generating different cell types, whereas the rostrodorsal MGE largely produces cortical and striatal interneurons, the caudoventral MGE largely produces pallidal projection neurons (Flandin et al., 2010Flandin P. Kimura S. Rubenstein J.L.R. The progenitor zone of the ventral medial ganglionic eminence requires Nkx2-1 to generate most of the globus pallidus but few neocortical interneurons.J.

Distinct MGE-derived cortical interneuron subtypes appear to be generated from the same progenitors, perhaps in a temporal sequence (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.-H. Tan X.

While Nkx2-1 is initially required for both of these cell types, Nkx2-1 expression is repressed soon after immature cortical interneurons tangentially migrate from the MGE, while it is maintained in striatal interneurons (Butt et al., 2008Butt S.J.B.

Forced expression of Nkx2-1 in cortical interneurons changes their migration so that they settle in the striatum (Nóbrega-Pereira et al., 2008Nóbrega-Pereira S. Kessaris N. Du T. Kimura S.

How Nkx2-1 expression is repressed in these cells is unknown. Herein, we provide evidence that the Zfhx1b (Sip1, Zeb2) zinc-finger homeobox transcription factor is required to repress Nkx2-1 in the generation of cortical interneurons. In its absence, we find a decrease in cortical interneurons concomitant with increased striatal nNOS/NPY/Sst GABAergic interneurons. We provide evidence that expression of the cMaf transcription factor is a highly specific marker of the cortical interneuron lineage, and discovered that its expression is lost in Zfhx1b mutants. Previous analysis of Zfhx1b mouse mutants has shed light on its functions in the development of cortical projection neurons (Miquelajauregui et al., 2007Miquelajauregui A. Van De Putte T. Polyakov A.

In humans, mutations of Zfhx1b result in Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by mental retardation, epilepsy, and defects of neural crest-derived tissues, including craniofacial and enteric nervous system (Mowat et al., 2003Mowat D.R.

Our results that demonstrate Zfhx1b is required to generate cortical interneurons suggest a mechanism for the epilepsy observed in Mowat-Wilson syndrome. Zfhx1b prenatal expression has been noted in migrating cortical interneurons and the subpallial telencephalon (Batista-Brito et al., 2008Batista-Brito R. Machold R. Klein C. Fishell G.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1373-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We found that Zfhx1b RNA is expressed in E12.5 MGE-derived cells that are tangentially migrating through the LGE and into the cortex by performing fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on a brain in which MGE-derived cells expressed EGFP (expressed due to Nkx2.1-Cre induced recombination of the CAG:CAT-EGFP Cre reporter allele) (see Figures S1A–S1A″ available online). To determine the role of Zfhx1b in the development of the basal ganglia, we used a conditional mutagenesis approach. Using an allele of Zfhx1b, in which exon 7 is floxed (Higashi et al., 2002Higashi Y. Maruhashi M. Nelles L. Van de Putte T. Verschueren K. Miyoshi T. Yoshimoto A. Kondoh H. Huylebroeck D. Generation of the floxed allele of the SIP1 (Smad-interacting protein 1) gene for Cre-mediated conditional knockout in the mouse.Genesis. 2002; 32: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we removed Zfhx1b expression using two different Cre alleles. Deletion of exon 7 creates a frameshift mutation and premature truncation of the protein. Previous analysis failed to detect the truncated mutant protein in Zfhx1b mutant tissues, providing evidence that this is a null allele (Higashi et al., 2002Higashi Y. Maruhashi M. Nelles L. Van de Putte T. Verschueren K. Miyoshi T. Yoshimoto A. Kondoh H. Huylebroeck D. Generation of the floxed allele of the SIP1 (Smad-interacting protein 1) gene for Cre-mediated conditional knockout in the mouse.Genesis. 2002; 32: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To remove Zfhx1b in the early progenitors of the MGE, we used the Nkx2.1-Cre allele (Xu et al., 2008Xu Q. Tam M. Anderson S.A. Fate mapping Nkx2.1-lineage cells in the mouse telencephalon.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), which drives Cre expression in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the MGE beginning around E9.5 (later it also drives expression in the subventricular and mantle zones [SVZ and MZ]). To differentiate between the role of Zfhx1b in the VZ and the SVZ/MZ, we used the DlxI1/2b-Cre allele (Potter et al., 2008Potter G.B. Petryniak M.A. Shevchenko E. Mckinsey G.L. Ekker M. Rubenstein J.L.R. Generation of Cre-transgenic mice using Dlx1/Dlx2 enhancers and their characterization in GABAergic interneurons.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 40: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which drives Cre expression in the SVZ and MZ of the entire subpallium beginning around E10.5. To examine the pattern of recombination, we used an antisense riboprobe designed against Zfhx1b exon 7. By E12.5, Cre activity from both the Nkx2.1-Cre and DlxI1/2b-Cre alleles removed Zfhx1b RNA expression in the expected patterns (Figures 1A–1C). As previously reported, the Nkx2-1 allele did not express Cre in the dorsal-most portion of the MGE, thus explaining the persistence of Zfhx1b in that location (Figure 1B). Of note, in the Nkx2.1-Cre; Zfhx1b conditional mutant brains, Zfhx1b RNA expression was not observed in the cells that appear to be migrating from the dorsal MGE into the mantle of the LGE, suggesting that the Zfhx1b+ cells in the mantle of the E12.5 LGE are likely to be MGE-derived cells (e.g., cortical and/or striatal interneurons) (X in Figure 1B). Also, note that DlxI1/2b-Cre leads to recombination in the SVZ and MZ of the LGE, MGE and CGE (white arrowhead, Figure 1C, and data not shown). Next, we examined the expression of Zfhx1b’s closely related homolog, Zfhx1a, in the E12.5 control and mutant telencephalon. Both Zfhx1a and Zfhx1b are expressed in the subpallial VZ, whereas only Zfhx1b is clearly expressed in the SVZ (Figures 1A and S1B). Zfhx1a’s expression did not clearly change in the Nkx2.1-Cre mediated Zfhx1b mutant (Figures S1B–S1S1D′). Thus, in the Nkx2.1-Cre conditional Zfhx1b mutant, only the VZ of the MGE continued to strongly express a Zfhx homolog. We analyzed the effect of deleting Zfhx1b, using Nkx2.1-Cre at multiple developmental stages, including E12.5, E15.5, and P0. To track the fate of Zfhx1b mutant cells, we used the CAG:CAT-EGFP Cre reporter allele (Kawamoto et al., 2000Kawamoto S. Niwa H. Tashiro F. Sano S. Kondoh G. Takeda J. Tabayashi K. Miyazaki J. A novel reporter mouse strain that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein upon Cre-mediated recombination.FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 263-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Mutant brains had the following genotype: Nkx2.1-Cre;Zfhx1bF/−;CAG:CAT-EGFP; whereas controls had the following genotype: Nkx2.1-Cre;Zfhx1bF/+;CAG:CAT-EGFP (on occasion, some were: Nkx2.1-Cre; Zfhx1bF/+). At E12.5, while the control brain showed a robust stream of EGFP+ cells migrating into the cortex, the mutant’s EGFP+ MGE derivatives failed to migrate to the cortex, and many were detected in the LGE mantle (Figures 1D–1G′). Next, we analyzed the phenotype using molecular markers of MGE-derived cells including Nkx2-1 and Lhx6. While Nkx2-1 RNA and protein is expressed throughout the VZ and SVZ of the MGE, its expression thereafter is restricted to specific neuronal lineages. MGE-derived cortical interneurons repress Nkx2.1 expression as they migrate out of the MGE while most, but not all, classes of striatal interneurons maintain Nkx2.1 expression.

In the mutants, there was a subtle increase in Nkx2-1 RNA expression in the LGE and CGE (Figures 1H–1J′). This increase was more apparent at higher magnification when analyzing NKX2-1 protein expression (Figures 1G and 1G′) and at later stages (E13.5 and E15.5) (Figures 1N–1P′ and 2A–2F′). EGFP and NKX2-1 protein expression in control brains colocalized in a subset of cells derived from the MGE. EGFP/NKX2-1+ cells were observed in the MGE VZ and SVZ progenitors and a subset of their derived neurons, including the globus pallidus, and striatal interneurons (Xu et al., 2008Xu Q. Tam M. Anderson S.A. Fate mapping Nkx2.1-lineage cells in the mouse telencephalon.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar; Figure 1G, solid arrowheads), while interneurons migrating to the cerebral cortex showed little to no NKX2-1 protein expression (Figure 1G, open arrowheads). In mutant brains, however, most if not all EGFP labeled cells had detectable levels of NKX2-1 protein, with many cells strongly coexpressing NKX2-1 and EGFP in the LGE MZ, and in a region lateral to the globus pallidus (Figure 1G′, solid arrowheads). Thus, Zfhx1b mutants had a defect in their ability to repress Nkx2-1 RNA and protein expression, concomitant with failure of MGE-derived migration to the cerebral cortex. While Zfhx1b was required to repress Nkx2-1 expression, we did not find evidence that Nkx2-1 regulated Zfhx1b expression; this conclusion was based on in situ hybridization analysis of Zfhx1b expression in mice lacking Nkx2-1 in newly born MGE neurons at E15.5 (Nkx2-1 conditional mutant with Dlx5/6-Cre) (Figure S6). Lhx6 RNA is expressed in tangentially migrating cells that are immature cortical and striatal interneurons, as well as cell types that remain in the subpallium (Flandin et al., 2011Flandin P. Zhao Y.

Neurol. 2008; 510: 79-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the Zfhx1b mutant, Lhx6+ cells failed to be detected in the pallium, whereas they continued to be densely located throughout the MGE, and as a scattered population in the LGE and CGE (Figures 1K–1M′). On the other hand, Lhx8 and Gbx2 RNA expression was not appreciably changed in the mutants (Figures S1H–S1J′). Thus, Zfhx1b mutants may have a selective defect in cells fated to become pallial interneurons, but not cholinergic striatal interneurons. To explore this hypothesis we studied the phenotype at later developmental stages. By E15.5, the tangential migration of immature cortical interneurons can be readily visualized by expression of Lhx6, Somatostatin (Sst), and EGFP (in Nkx2.1-Cre;CAG-EGFP brains) (Figures 2 and S2D–S2F). By contrast, in Zfhx1b mutants (Nkx2.1-Cre), pallial expression of Lhx6, Sst, and EGFP was strongly attenuated (Figures 2 and S2D′–S2F′). On the other hand, subpallial expression of these markers was increased in two locations: the striatum (asterisks, Figures 2A–2C′, 2G–2I′, and S2D–S2F′) and a region contiguous with the caudoventral striatum, which we believe corresponds to the anlage of the central nucleus of the amygdala (labeled e, for ectopia, Figures 2E′’, 2H′, and S2D′; note that Figure S2T shows Dlx5 expression labeling the central nucleus of the amygdala, CeA). The ectopia in these regions also contained increased expression of Nkx2-1 and Sox6 (Figures 2D–2F′ and 2J–2L′). These genes are normally expressed in the subpallial projection neurons such as the globus pallidus, striatal interneurons, and cortical interneurons (Sox6 only) (Azim et al., 2009Azim E. Jabaudon D. Fame R.M. Macklis J.D. SOX6 controls dorsal progenitor identity and interneuron diversity during neocortical development.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1238-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar; Batista-Brito et al., 2008Batista-Brito R. Machold R. Klein C. Fishell G. Gene expression in cortical interneuron precursors is prescient of their mature function.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 2306-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether the mutant cells that failed to migrate to the pallium had features of the globus pallidus or striatal interneurons. We examined expression of several globus pallidus markers including Kcnmb4, Kctd12, Gbx2, and Lhx8. Unlike the abnormal expression of Lhx6, Sst, Nkx2-1, and Sox6, expression of Kcnmb4, Kctd12, Gbx2, and Lhx8 appeared normal in the Zfhx1b mutants (Figures 2M–2O′, 2S–2U′, and S2J–S2O′), providing evidence that the abnormal collections of cells correspond either to abnormally migrated cortical interneurons or to striatal interneurons, and not globus pallidus neurons. Furthermore, as Gbx2 and Lhx8 expression and function are linked to the development of striatal cholinergic interneurons (Chen et al., 2010Chen L. Chatterjee M. Li J.Y.H. The mouse homeobox gene Gbx2 is required for the development of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14824-14834Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; Zhao et al., 2003Zhao Y. Marín O. Hermesz E. Powell A. Flames N. Palkovits M. Rubenstein J.L.R. Westphal H. The LIM-homeobox gene Lhx8 is required for the development of many cholinergic neurons in the mouse forebrain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9005-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), these results provided evidence that increased striatal Nkx2-1 expression did not correspond to cells destined to become striatal cholinergic interneurons. To distinguish whether the abnormal collections of cells in the mutant striatum were cortical or striatal interneurons, we examined expression of Cxcr7 and NPY. At E15.5, Cxcr7 marked migrating cortical interneurons and few cells in the striatum (Figures 7J, 7K, and 7L), suggesting that it is a relatively specific cortical interneuron marker (Wang et al., 2011Wang Y. Li G. Stanco A. Long J.E. Crawford D. Potter G.B. Pleasure S.J. Behrens T. Rubenstein J.L.R. CXCR4 and CXCR7 have distinct functions in regulating interneuron migration.Neuron. 2011; 69: 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the mutant, there was a robust reduction of Cxcr7 expression in the pattern of migrating cortical interneurons, without a substantive increase in striatal expression (Figures 7J′, 7K′,and 7L′); a similar result was seen for Cux2 (not shown). On the other hand, at E15.5, NPY expression strongly marks scattered striatal cells (probably interneurons), and relatively few migrating cortical interneurons (note, most of the cortical expression at this age resembles that of immature projection neurons in the cortical plate). In the mutant, there was a robust increase in NPY expression in the striatum (Figures 2P–2R′), in a pattern closely resembling the pattern of ectopic Nkx2-1, Lhx6 and Sox6 (Figures 2D–2L′). Thus, we propose that the mutant cortical interneurons are transformed toward GABAergic striatal interneurons. Toward defining the stage of differentiation when Zfhx1b is required for programming interneurons to migrate to the cortex, and not the striatum, we used the DlxI12b-Cre allele (Potter et al., 2008Potter G.B. Petryniak M.A. Shevchenko E. Mckinsey G.L. Ekker M. Rubenstein J.L.R. Generation of Cre-transgenic mice using Dlx1/Dlx2 enhancers and their characterization in GABAergic interneurons.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 40: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DlxI1/2b-Cre expression begins in subpallial SVZ cells that express the mitotic marker Ki67 (Figures S1T–S1T″), suggesting that Cre recombination occurs in secondary progenitor cells that are mitotically active. Thus, DlxI12b-Cre induces recombination beginning in the SVZ of the entire subpallium, whereas Nkx2.1-Cre induces recombination in the VZ of the MGE and preoptic area (Figures 1D–1F′). We analyzed the effect of deleting Zfhx1b using DlxI12b-Cre at E12.5 and E15.5. In general, all of the phenotypes of MGE-derived cells observed with the Nkx2.1-Cre were recapitulated with the DlxI12b-Cre (Figures 3, S1, S3), including the strong reduction of tangential migration to the cortex, indicated by analysis of Cre-dependent reporter EGFP expression, and Lhx6, Sst, and CXCR7 expression. Like Nkx2.1-Cre mutants, DlxI1/2b-Cre mutants showed increased numbers of striatal cells that expressed Lhx6, Nkx2-1, NPY, Sst, and Sox6 (Figures 3A–3I′, 3M–3O′, and S3J–S3L′). Furthermore, these mutants did not show an increase in the number of cells that expressed markers of the globus pallius (Lhx8, Gbx2, Kcnmb4) or striatal cholinergic interneurons (Lhx8, Gbx2) (Figures 3J–3L′, 3P–3R′, and S1Q′–S1S′, and data not shown). Nkx2.1-Cre conditional mutants died between P17 and P21; at P15, mutants weighed ∼30% less than their control littermates, a phenotype that was exacerbated by litter size. We did not observe seizures or other neurological/behavioral phenotypes. We analyzed postnatal day 0 (P0) and P15 Nkx2.1-Cre;Zfhx1bF/− conditional mutants to better understand the nature and extent of their cortical and striatal interneuron defects. In the P0 neocortex there was an ∼90% reduction in the number of EGFP+ Cre-reporter marked cells, as well as a decrease in Calbindin (CB), Sst, and Lhx6 expressing interneurons (Figures 4A–4C′ and 4S ). Likewise, at P15 there was a >90% reduction in number of neocortical EGFP+ cells (Figures 4D–4F′ and 4S). Next, we counted the number cortical interneurons in the Nkx2-1-Cre lineage that expressed Parvalbumin (PV) or Sst, which are the two main MGE-derived subtypes (Rudy et al., 2011Rudy B. Fishell G. Lee S. Hjerling-Leffler J. Three groups of interneurons account for nearly 100% of neocortical GABAergic neurons.Dev. Neurobiol. 2011; 71: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). We saw a strong reduction in double labeled neurons, with the numbers of EGFP+ interneurons expressing Sst or PV reduced by >90% or more (Figure 4S). The expression of cortical Calretinin (CR), which predominantly marks CGE-derived cortical interneurons, showed little to no change in the Zfhx1b; Nkx2.1-Cre conditional mutant (Figures 4F and 4F′). In the striatum at P0, as we saw at E15.5, there was an increase in the number of cells expressing EGFP (Cre reporter), Sst, and Lhx6 (Figures 4G–4I′); consistent with the hypothesis that Zfhx1b mutant cells that were destined to go to the neocortex, instead migrated to the striatum. Additionally, there was a clear increase in the number of striatal cells expressing nNos, NPY, and Nkx2-1 (Figures 4J–4K′, S4B, and S4B′), while we observed no change in Lhx8, a marker for striatal cholinergic interneurons (Figures S4A and S4A′). As NPY, Sst, and nNos are also expressed in subsets of cortical interneurons, their increased striatal expression does not provide unequivocal information about whether supernumerary cells correspond to cortical interneurons that failed to correctly migrate, or to interneurons that changed fate due to the mutation. To this end, we searched for a marker that is expressed in striatal, but not cortical interneurons. Substance P receptor (TacR1) is robustly expressed in striatal interneurons (Ardelt et al., 1996Ardelt A.A. Karpitskiy V.V. Krause J.E. Roth K.A. The neostriatal mosaic: basis for the changing distribution of neurokinin-1 receptor immunoreactivity during development.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 376: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that TacR1 is almost exclusively expressed in striatal and not cortical interneurons at E15.5, P0, and P15 (Figures 4L and 4L′, and 4Q and 4Q′, and S4D–S4F′, and data not shown). In Zfhx1b-Nkx2.1-Cre mutants at P0, there was increased striatal TacR1 expression (Figures 4Q and 4Q′), supporting the idea that at least some of the mutant cells are adopting a striatal interneuron identity. At P15 the number of mutant cells (EGFP+) was roughly the same as in controls, and they were evenly dispersed within the striatum, lacking the cell clusters and ectopia (striatal and caudal amygdala) that were apparent at younger ages (Figures 4M, 4M′, and 4T). The elimination of the excess mutant striatal cells appears to occur through apoptosis, which is robust at P0 (expression of activated cleaved-caspase 6), particularly in the ectopia (Figures S4C–S4C′). Despite the cell death, Zfhx1b conditional mutants at P15 continued to have significantly increased numbers of striatal nNOS, NPY, Sst, and TacR1 expressing cells (183%, 230%, 225%, and 164%; Figures 4N–4Q′ and 4T). Importantly, total striatal PV+ cells were decreased by 58% (Figure 4S). Furthermore, there was no detectable change in TrkA expression (Figures 4R, 4R′, and 4T), which marks striatal cholinergic interneurons. We saw very few CR+ cells in the control striatum (1–3 cells per section), which did not noticeably change in the Zfhx1b conditional mutant (data not shown). Thus, Nkx2.1-Cre;Zfhx1b mutants have a selective increase in striatal interneurons expressing nNos, NPY, Sst, and TacR1 but have reduced PV interneurons, and no change in cholinergic or CR interneurons. We also analyzed the gross morphological properties of nNos/NPY/Sst striatal interneurons in the Zfhx1b mutant and found that, like control brains, Zfhx1b conditional mutants had Sst processes restricted to the matrisomes (Chesselet and Graybiel, 1986Chesselet M.F. Graybiel A.M. Striatal neurons expressing somatostatin-like immunoreactivity: evidence for a peptidergic interneuronal system in the cat.Neuroscience. 1986; 17: 547-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), in a lateral to medial gradient (Figures S4G–S4I′, arrowheads mark CB-poor striosomes), suggesting that the overproduced nNos/NPY/Sst interneurons in the Zfhx1b conditional mutant share grossly similar morphological properties with wild-type striatal interneurons. Dlx1 and Dlx2 are necessary for subpallial development, including interneuron migration to the cortex (Anderson et al., 1997aAnderson S.A. Eisenstat D.D. Shi L. Rubenstein J.L.

Several TRP channels have been implicated in Drosophila auditory transduction, but mechanistic studies have been hampered by the inability to record subthreshold signals from receptor neurons. Here, we develop a non-invasive method for measuring these signals by recording from a central neuron that is electrically coupled to a genetically defined population of auditory receptor cells. We find that the TRPN family member NompC, which is necessary for the active amplification of sound-evoked motion by the auditory organ, is not required for transduction in auditory receptor cells. Instead, NompC sensitizes the transduction complex to movement and precisely regulates the static forces on the complex. In contrast, the TRPV channels Nanchung and Inactive are required for responses to sound, suggesting they are components of the transduction complex. Thus, transduction and active amplification are genetically separable processes in Drosophila hearing."

https://openalex.org/W2144628304,"GABAergic interneurons mainly originate in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) of the embryonic ventral telencephalon (VT) and migrate tangentially to the cortex, guided by membrane-bound and secreted factors. We found that Sip1 (Zfhx1b, Zeb2), a transcription factor enriched in migrating cortical interneurons, is required for their proper differentiation and correct guidance. The majority of Sip1 knockout interneurons fail to migrate to the neocortex and stall in the VT. RNA sequencing reveals that Sip1 knockout interneurons do not acquire a fully mature cortical interneuron identity and contain increased levels of the repulsive receptor Unc5b. Focal electroporation of Unc5b-encoding vectors in the MGE of wild-type brain slices disturbs migration to the neocortex, whereas reducing Unc5b levels in Sip1 knockout slices and brains rescues the migration defect. Our results reveal that Sip1, through tuning of Unc5b levels, is essential for cortical interneuron guidance."

The origin and function of these biases in preference distribution are unclear but may be key to understanding the causal role of M1 in limb control. We demonstrate that these distributions arise naturally in a network model that commands muscle activity and is optimized to control movements and counter applied forces. In the model, movement and load preference distributions matching those observed empirically are only evident when particular features of the musculoskeletal system were included: limb geometry, intersegmental dynamics, and the force-length/velocity properties of muscle were dominant factors in dictating movement preferences, and the presence of biarticular muscles dictated load preferences. Our results suggest a general principle: neural activity in M1 commands muscle activity and is optimized for the physics of the motor effector."
https://openalex.org/W2163467412,"Persistent pain induced by noxious stimuli is characterized by the transition from normosensitivity to hypersensitivity. Underlying mechanisms are not well understood, although gene expression is considered important. Here, we show that persistent nociceptive-like activity triggers calcium transients in neuronal nuclei within the superficial spinal dorsal horn, and that nuclear calcium is necessary for the development of long-term inflammatory hypersensitivity. Using a nucleus-specific calcium signal perturbation strategy in vivo complemented by gene profiling, bioinformatics, and functional analyses, we discovered a pain-associated, nuclear calcium-regulated gene program in spinal excitatory neurons. This includes C1q, a modulator of synaptic spine morphogenesis, which we found to contribute to activity-dependent spine remodelling on spinal neurons in a manner functionally associated with inflammatory hypersensitivity. Thus, nuclear calcium integrates synapse-to-nucleus communication following noxious stimulation and controls a spinal genomic response that mediates the transition between acute and long-term nociceptive sensitization by modulating functional and structural plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2059840898,"E-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein, is frequently downregulated with tumorigenic progression. The extracellular domain of E-cadherin is cleaved by proteases to generate a soluble ectodomain fragment, termed sEcad, which is elevated in the urine or serum of cancer patients. In this study, we explored the functional role of sEcad in the progression of skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We found that full-length E-cadherin expression was decreased and sEcad increased in human clinical tumor samples as well as in ultraviolet (UV)-induced SCCs in mice. Interestingly, sEcad associated with members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1R) family of receptors in human and UV-induced mouse tumors. Moreover, in both E-cadherin-positive (E-cadherin(+)) and -negative (E-cadherin(-)) cells in vitro, sEcad activated downstream mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and enhanced tumor growth, motility and invasion, the latter via activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. To this end, HER, PI3K or MEK inhibitors suppressed sEcad's tumorigenic effects, including proliferation, migration and invasion. Taken together, our data suggest that sEcad contributes to skin carcinogenesis via association with the HER/IGF-1R-family of receptors and subsequent activation of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, thereby implicating sEcad as a putative therapeutic target in cutaneous SCCs."

However, the in vivo contribution of sphingosine kinase (SphK) in fibrotic processes has not been documented. Microarray analysis of blood mononuclear cells from patients with IPF and SphK1- or SphK2-knockdown mice and SphK inhibitor were used to assess the role of SphKs in fibrogenesis. The expression of SphK1/2 negatively correlated with lung function and survival in patients with IPF. Also, the expression of SphK1 was increased in lung tissues from patients with IPF and bleomycin-challenged mice. Knockdown of SphK1, but not SphK2, increased survival and resistance to pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-challenged mice. Administration of SphK inhibitor reduced bleomycin-induced mortality and pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Knockdown of SphK1 or treatment with SphK inhibitor attenuated S1P generation and TGF-β secretion in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model that was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of Smad2 and MAPKs in lung tissue. In vitro, bleomycin-induced expression of SphK1 in lung fibroblast was found to be TGF-β dependent.

However, it is unclear how such compensatory adaptations coexist with synaptic information storage, especially in established networks. Here, we report that in mature hippocampal neurons in vitro, network activity preferentially regulated excitatory synapses within the proximal dendrites of CA3 neurons. These homeostatic synapses exhibited morphological, functional, and molecular signatures of the specialized contacts between mossy fibers of dentate granule cells and thorny excrescences (TEs) of CA3 pyramidal neurons. In vivo TEs were also selectively and bidirectionally altered by chronic activity changes. TE formation required presynaptic synaptoporin and was suppressed by the activity-inducible kinase, Plk2. These results implicate the mossy fiber-TE synapse as an independently tunable gain control locus that permits efficacious homeostatic adjustment of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, while preserving synaptic weights that may encode information elsewhere within the mature hippocampal circuit."

Unlike other MBD proteins, MBD4 recognizes not only methylated CpG dinucleotides ((5m)CG/(5m)CG) but also T/G mismatched sites generated by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine ((5m)CG/TG). The glycosylase activity of MBD4 is also implicated in active DNA demethylation initiated by the deaminase-catalyzed conversion of 5-methylcytosine to thymine. Here, we report the crystal structures of the MBD of MBD4 (MBDMBD4) complexed with (5m)CG/(5m)CG and (5m)CG/TG. The crystal structures show that the DNA interface of MBD4 has flexible structural features and harbors an extensive water network that supports its dual base specificities. Combined with the results of biochemical analyses, the crystal structure of MBD4 bound to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine further demonstrates that MBDMBD4 is able to recognize a wide range of 5-methylcytosine modifications through the unique water network. The versatile base recognition ability of MBDMBD4 implies multifunctional roles for MBD4 in the regulation of dynamic DNA methylation patterns coupled with deamination and/or oxidation of 5-methylcytosine."
https://openalex.org/W2127675971,"LpxC, the deacetylase that catalyzes the second and committed step of lipid A biosynthesis in Escherichia coli, is an essential enzyme in virtually all gram-negative bacteria and is one of the most promising antibiotic targets for treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections. Despite the rapid development of LpxC-targeting antibiotics, the potential mechanisms of bacterial resistance to LpxC inhibitors remain poorly understood. Here, we report the isolation and biochemical characterization of spontaneously arising E. coli mutants that are over 200-fold more resistant to LpxC inhibitors than the wild-type strain. These mutants have two chromosomal point mutations that account for resistance additively and independently; one is in fabZ, a dehydratase in fatty acid biosynthesis; the other is in thrS, the Thr-tRNA ligase. For both enzymes, the isolated mutations result in reduced enzymatic activities in vitro. Unexpectedly, we observed a decreased level of LpxC in bacterial cells harboring fabZ mutations in the absence of LpxC inhibitors, suggesting that the biosyntheses of fatty acids and lipid A are tightly regulated to maintain a balance between phospholipids and lipid A. Additionally, we show that the mutation in thrS slows protein production and cellular growth, indicating that reduced protein biosynthesis can confer a suppressive effect on inhibition of membrane biosynthesis. Altogether, our studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of antibiotic resistance by rebalancing cellular homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2061955146,"A central tenet of most theories of synaptic modification during cortical development is that correlated activity drives plasticity in synaptically connected neurons. Unexpectedly, however, using sensory-evoked activity patterns recorded from the developing mouse cortex in vivo, the synaptic learning rule that we uncover here relies solely on the presynaptic neuron. A burst of three presynaptic spikes followed, within a restricted time window, by a single presynaptic spike induces robust long-term depression (LTD) at developing layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapses. This presynaptic spike pattern-dependent LTD (p-LTD) can be induced by individual presynaptic layer 4 cells, requires presynaptic NMDA receptors and calcineurin, and is expressed presynaptically. However, in contrast to spike timing-dependent LTD, p-LTD is independent of postsynaptic and astroglial signaling. This spike pattern-dependent learning rule complements timing-based rules and is likely to play a role in the pruning of synaptic input during cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2013805868,"Alternating contractions of antagonistic muscle groups during locomotion are generated by spinal ""half-center"" networks coupled in antiphase by reciprocal inhibition. It is widely thought that reciprocal inhibition only coordinates the activity of these muscles. We have devised two methods to rapidly and selectively silence neurons on just one side of Xenopus tadpole spinal cord and hindbrain, which generate swimming rhythms. Silencing activity on one side led to rapid cessation of activity on the other side. Analyses reveal that this resulted from the depression of reciprocal inhibition connecting the two sides. Although critical neurons in intact tadpoles are capable of pacemaker firing individually, an effect that could support motor rhythms without inhibition, the swimming network itself requires ~23 min to regain rhythmic activity after blocking inhibition pharmacologically, implying some homeostatic changes. We conclude therefore that reciprocal inhibition is critical for the generation of normal locomotor rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W2076432979,"Neurons in cortical sensory areas respond selectively to sensory stimuli, and the preferred stimulus typically varies among neurons so as to continuously span the sensory space. However, some neurons reflect sensory features that are learned or task dependent. For example, neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) reflect learned associations between visual stimuli. One might expect that roughly even numbers of LIP neurons would prefer each set of associated stimuli. However, in two associative learning experiments and a perceptual decision experiment, we found striking asymmetries: nearly all neurons recorded from an animal had a similar order of preference among associated stimuli. Behavioral factors could not account for these neuronal biases. A recent computational study proposed that population-firing patterns in parietal cortex have one-dimensional dynamics on long timescales, a possible consequence of recurrent connections that could drive persistent activity. One-dimensional dynamics would predict the biases in selectivity that we observed."
https://openalex.org/W2072171154,"The primate temporal cortex implements neural mechanisms for memory retrieval from visual long-term storage, and memory neurons have been identified at the single-neuron level whose activities following cue presentation encode the presented object (""cue-holding"" neurons) or to-be-recalled target (""pair-recall"" neurons). Although these two types of neurons can potentially interact during the target recall, little is known about information flow among these neurons. We conducted simultaneous recordings of multiple single units in macaque perirhinal cortex while they performed a pair-association memory task. Granger causality analysis revealed the emergence of directed couplings during the delay period predominantly from cue-holding neurons to pair-recall neurons. Moreover, these interactions coincided with unidirectional signal flow from the recipient recall neuron to another recall neuron, implying cascade-like signal propagation among the memory cell assembly. These results suggest that directed interactions among perirhinal memory neurons are dynamically modulated to implement functional microcircuitry for retrieval of object association memory."
https://openalex.org/W2076194757,"Androgen receptor (AR) has essential roles during prostate cancer progression. With genome-wide AR-binding sites mapped to high resolution, studies have recently reported AR as a transcriptional repressor. How AR inhibits gene expression and how this contributes to prostate cancer, however, are incompletely understood. Through meta-analysis of microarray data, here we nominate nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV) as a top androgen-repressed gene. We show that NOV is directly suppressed by androgen through the AR. AR occupies the NOV enhancer and communicates with the NOV promoter through DNA looping. AR activation recruits the polycomb group protein EZH2, which subsequently catalyzes histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation around the NOV promoter, thus leading to repressive chromatin remodeling and epigenetic silencing. Concordantly, AR and EZH2 inhibition synergistically restored NOV expression. NOV is downregulated in human prostate cancer wherein AR and EZH2 are upregulated. Functionally, NOV inhibits prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. NOV reconstitution reverses androgen-induced cell growth and NOV knockdown drives androgen-independent cell growth. In addition, NOV expression is restored by hormone-deprivation therapies in mice and prostate cancer patients. Therefore, using NOV as a model gene we gained further understanding of the mechanisms underlying AR-mediated transcriptional repression. Our findings establish a tumor-suppressive role of NOV in prostate cancer and suggest that one important, but previously underestimated, manner by which AR contributes to prostate cancer progression is through inhibition of key tumor-suppressor genes."
https://openalex.org/W2098924879,"Molecular interactions between the tumor suppressor p53 and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins play an important role in the transcription-independent apoptosis of p53. The p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) contains two conserved ΦXXΦΦ motifs (Φ indicates a bulky hydrophobic residue and X is any other residue) referred to as p53TAD1 (residues 15-29) and p53TAD2 (residues 39-57). We previously showed that p53TAD1 can act as a binding motif for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. In this study, we have identified p53TAD2 as a binding motif for anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins by using NMR spectroscopy, and we calculated the structures of Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-2 in complex with the p53TAD2 peptide. NMR chemical shift perturbation data showed that p53TAD2 peptide binds to diverse members of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family independently of p53TAD1, and the binding between p53TAD2 and p53TAD1 to Bcl-X(L) is competitive. Refined structural models of the Bcl-X(L)·p53TAD2 and Bcl-2·p53TAD2 complexes showed that the binding sites occupied by p53TAD2 in Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 overlap well with those occupied by pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides. Taken together with the mutagenesis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data, our structural comparisons provided the structural basis of p53TAD2-mediated interaction with the anti-apoptotic proteins, revealing that Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-2, MDM2, and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 share highly similar modes of binding to the dual p53TAD motifs, p53TAD1 and p53TAD2. In conclusion, our results suggest that the dual-site interaction of p53TAD is a highly conserved mechanism underlying target protein binding in the transcription-dependent and transcription-independent apoptotic pathways of p53."
https://openalex.org/W1973811270,"Vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) is a central regulator of cellular pH homeostasis, and inactivation of all V-ATPase function has been shown to prevent infectivity in Candida albicans. V-ATPase subunit a of the Vo domain (Voa) is present as two fungal isoforms: Stv1p (Golgi) and Vph1p (vacuole). To delineate the individual contribution of Stv1p and Vph1p to C. albicans physiology, we created stv1Δ/Δ and vph1Δ/Δ mutants and compared them to the corresponding reintegrant strains (stv1Δ/ΔR and vph1Δ/ΔR). V-ATPase activity, vacuolar physiology, and in vitro virulence-related phenotypes were unaffected in the stv1Δ/Δ mutant. The vph1Δ/Δ mutant exhibited defective V1Vo assembly and a 90% reduction in concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity and proton transport in purified vacuolar membranes, suggesting that the Vph1p isoform is essential for vacuolar V-ATPase activity in C. albicans. The vph1Δ/Δ cells also had abnormal endocytosis and vacuolar morphology and an alkalinized vacuolar lumen (pHvph1Δ/Δ = 6.8 versus pHvph1Δ/ΔR = 5.8) in both yeast cells and hyphae. Secreted protease and lipase activities were significantly reduced, and M199-induced filamentation was impaired in the vph1Δ/Δ mutant. However, the vph1Δ/Δ cells remained competent for filamentation induced by Spider media and YPD, 10% FCS, and biofilm formation and macrophage killing were unaffected in vitro. These studies suggest that different virulence mechanisms differentially rely on acidified vacuoles and that the loss of both vacuolar (Vph1p) and non-vacuolar (Stv1p) V-ATPase activity is necessary to affect in vitro virulence-related phenotypes. As a determinant of C. albicans pathogenesis, vacuolar pH alone may prove less critical than originally assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1987870439,"DNA methylation patterns are the dynamic outcome of antagonist methylation and demethylation mechanisms, but the latter are still poorly understood. Active DNA demethylation in plants is mediated by a family of DNA glycosylases typified by Arabidopsis ROS1 (repressor of silencing 1). ROS1 and its homologs remove 5-methylcytosine and incise the sugar backbone at the abasic site, thus initiating a base excision repair pathway that finally inserts an unmethylated cytosine. The DNA 3'-phosphatase ZDP processes some of the incision products generated by ROS1, allowing subsequent DNA polymerization and ligation steps. In this work, we examined the possible role of plant XRCC1 (x-ray cross-complementing group protein 1) in DNA demethylation. We found that XRCC1 interacts in vitro with ROS1 and ZDP and stimulates the enzymatic activity of both proteins. Furthermore, extracts from xrcc1 mutant plants exhibit a reduced capacity to complete DNA demethylation initiated by ROS1. An anti-XRCC1 antibody inhibits removal of the blocking 3'-phosphate in the single-nucleotide gap generated during demethylation and reduces the capacity of Arabidopsis cell extracts to ligate a nicked DNA intermediate. Our results suggest that XRCC1 is a component of plant base excision repair and functions at several stages during active DNA demethylation in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2008772260,"A skin-tropic invasive group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) strain, AP53, contains a natural inactivating mutation in the covS gene (covS(M)) of the two-component responder (CovR)/sensor (CovS) gene regulatory system. The effects of this mutation on specific GAS virulence determinants have been assessed, with emphasis on expression of the extracellular protease, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), capsular hyaluronic acid, and proteins that allow host plasmin assembly on the bacterial surface, viz. a high affinity plasminogen (Pg)/plasmin receptor, Pg-binding group A streptococcal M protein (PAM), and the human Pg activator streptokinase. To further illuminate mechanisms of the functioning of CovRS in the virulence of AP53, two AP53 isogenic strains were generated, one in which the natural covS(M) gene was mutated to WT-covS (AP53/covS(WT)) and a strain that contained an inactivated covR gene (AP53/ΔcovR). Two additional strains that do not contain PAM, viz. WT-NS931 and NS931/covS(M), were also employed. SpeB was not measurably expressed in strains containing covR(WT)/covS(M), whereas in strains with natural or engineered covR(WT)/covS(WT), SpeB expression was highly up-regulated. Alternatively, capsule synthesis via the hasABC operon was enhanced in strain AP53/covS(M), whereas streptokinase expression was only slightly affected by the covS inactivation. PAM expression was not substantially influenced by the covS mutation, suggesting that covRS had minimal effects on the mga regulon that controls PAM expression. These results demonstrate that a covS inactivation results in virulence gene alterations and also suggest that the CovR phosphorylation needed for gene up- or down-regulation can occur by alternative pathways to CovS kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2092623760,"APOBEC3G is a retroviral restriction factor that can inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) in the absence of the viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein. Virion-encapsidated APOBEC3G can deaminate cytosine to uracil in viral (-)DNA, which leads to hypermutation and inactivation of the provirus. APOBEC3G catalyzes these deaminations processively on single-stranded DNA using sliding and jumping movements. Vif is thought to primarily overcome APOBEC3G through an interaction that mediates APOBEC3G ubiquitination and results in its proteasomal degradation. However, Vif may also inhibit APOBEC3G mRNA translation, virion encapsidation, and deamination activity. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of VifIIIB- and VifHXB2-mediated inhibition of APOBEC3G deamination activity. Biochemical assays using a model HIV-1 replication assay and synthetic single-stranded or partially double-stranded DNA substrates demonstrated that APOBEC3G has an altered processive mechanism in the presence of Vif. Specifically, VifHXB2 inhibited the jumping and VifIIIB inhibited the sliding movements of APOBEC3G. The absence of such an effect by Vif on degradation-resistant APOBEC3G D128K indicates that a Vif-APOBEC3G interaction mediates this effect. That the partially processive APOBEC3G was less effective at inducing mutagenesis in a model HIV-1 replication assay suggests that Vif co-encapsidation with APOBEC3G can promote sublethal mutagenesis of HIV-1 proviral DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2002317777,"Eps8, a bi-functional actin cytoskeleton remodeller, is a positive regulator of cell proliferation and motility. Here, we describe an unrecognized mechanism regulating Eps8 that is required for proper mitotic progression: whereas Eps8 is stable in G1 and S phase, its half-life drops sharply in G2. This requires G2-specific proteasomal degradation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase SCF(Fbxw5). Consistent with a short window of degradation, Eps8 disappears from the cell cortex early in mitosis, but reappears at the midzone of dividing cells. Failure to reduce Eps8 levels in G2 prolongs its localization at the cell cortex and markedly delays cell rounding and prometaphase duration. However, during late stages of mitosis and cytokinesis, Eps8 capping activity is required to prevent membrane blebbing and cell-shape deformations. Our findings identify SCF(Fbxw5)-driven fluctuation of Eps8 levels as an important mechanism that contributes to cell-shape changes during entry into-and exit from-mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2059430764,"We investigated whether a synthetic tetrameric branched peptide based on the conserved TFLK motif from mammary-associated serum amyloid A3 (M-SAA3) is more efficient than the monomeric peptide at up-regulating MUC3 expression and examined the possible mechanism(s) and biological significance of this process. We used standard solid-phase methods to synthesize a tetrameric branched peptide (sequence GWLTFLKAAG) containing a trilysine core, termed the TFLK-containing 10-mer BP. The aberrant expression of transcription factors was analyzed using a transcription factor protein/DNA array. MUC3 and relevant transcription factors were detected using real-time PCR and/or Western blots. The luciferase assay, EMSA, and ChIP assays were used to analyze the activity of the human MUC3 promoter. The bacterial adherence assay was used to evaluate the in vitro inhibition of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli or enterohemorrhage E. coli serotype O157:H7 (EHEC O157:H7) adherence to HT-29-Gal cells after treatment with the TFLK-containing 10-mer BP. In HT-29-Gal cells, the TFLK-containing 10-mer BP induced higher levels of MUC3 expression than the M-SAA3-derived N-terminal 10-mer monomeric peptide, and MUC3 expression was activated through transcriptional mechanisms, including the induction of multiple transcription factors and further binding with their cis-elements between nucleotides -242 and -62 within MUC3 promoter. Interestingly, the TFLK-containing 10-mer BP dramatically inhibited enteropathogenic E. coli and EHEC O157:H7 adherence to the HT-29-Gal cells compared with the controls. This finding suggests a potential therapeutic use for this peptide to prevent gastrointestinal infection."
https://openalex.org/W1967458175,"The microbial pattern-recognizing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are major signal transducers known to shape and influence the postnatal maturation of host intestinal epithelium. Perturbations in this intricate host-microbe cross-talk have been reported to be associated with uncontrolled epithelial cell growth and thus potential cancer development by mechanisms which are largely unknown. We therefore generated transgenic mice carrying a constitutively active TLR4 (CD4-TLR4) linked to an intestinal epithelial cell-specific promoter. Ex vivo analysis of transgenic crypt-villus organoid cultures revealed an increased proliferative capacity and a lowered cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) expression in these organoids compared with wild-type control cultures. Introducing the CD4-TLR4 transgene into APC(Min/+) mice (CD4-TLR4-APC(Min/+)), a model of colorectal carcinoma, resulted in a dramatic drop in tumor load as compared with control APC(Min/+) mice. Intestinal tumors from CD4-TLR4-APC(Min/+) mice displayed reduced Cox-2 protein, elevated interferon β expression and increased caspase-3 activity, which correlated with increased apoptosis in vivo. Thus, our data reveal that host microbiota-mediated signal transduction via TLR4 in intestinal epithelial cells is far more complex than what is previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1965778035,"Conclusions regarding disturbance effects in high elevation or high latitude ecosystems based solely on infrequent, long-term sampling may be misleading, because the long winters may erase severe, short-term impacts at the height of the abbreviated growing season. We separated a) long-term effects of pack stock grazing, manifested in early season prior to stock arrival, from b) additional pack stock grazing effects that might become apparent during annual stock grazing, by use of paired grazed and control wet meadows that we sampled at the beginning and end of subalpine growing seasons. Control meadows had been closed to grazing for at least two decades, and meadow pairs were distributed across Sequoia National Park, California, USA. The study was thus effectively a landscape-scale, long-term manipulation of wetland grazing. We sampled arthropods at these remote sites and collected data on associated vegetation structure. Litter cover and depth, percent bare ground, and soil strength had negative responses to grazing. In contrast, fauna showed little response to grazing, and there were overall negative effects for only three arthropod families. Mid-season and long-term results were generally congruent, and the only indications of lower faunal diversity on mid-season grazed wetlands were trends of lower abundance across morphospecies and lower diversity for canopy fauna across assemblage metrics. Treatment x Season interactions almost absent. Thus impacts on vegetation structure only minimally cascaded into the arthropod assemblage and were not greatly intensified during the annual growing season. Differences between years, which were likely a response to divergent snowfall patterns, were more important than differences between early and mid-season. Reliance on either vegetation or faunal metrics exclusively would have yielded different conclusions; using both flora and fauna served to provide a more integrative view of ecosystem response."
https://openalex.org/W1964031613,"The large and rapidly increasing number of potentially pathological mutants in the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) prompts the need to characterize their effects on voltage-activated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle. Here we evaluated the function of the R4892W and G4896V RyR1 mutants, both associated with central core disease (CCD) in humans, in myotubes and in adult muscle fibers. For both mutants expressed in RyR1-null (dyspedic) myotubes, voltage-gated Ca2+ release was absent following homotypic expression and only partially restored following heterotypic expression with wild-type (WT) RyR1. In muscle fibers from adult WT mice, both mutants were expressed in restricted regions of the fibers with a pattern consistent with triadic localization. Voltage-clamp-activated confocal Ca2+ signals showed that fiber regions endowed with G4896V-RyR1s exhibited an ∼30% reduction in the peak rate of SR Ca2+ release, with no significant change in SR Ca2+ content. Immunostaining revealed no associated change in the expression of either α1S subunit (Cav1.1) of the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) or type 1 sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1), indicating that the reduced Ca2+ release resulted from defective RyR1 function. Interestingly, in spite of robust localized junctional expression, the R4892W mutant did not affect SR Ca2+ release in adult muscle fibers, consistent with a low functional penetrance of this particular CCD-associated mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2076418806,"Cilia in ciliated cells consist of protruding structures that sense mechanical and chemical signals from the extracellular environment. Cilia are assembled with variety molecules via a process known as intraflagellar transport (IFT). What controls the length of cilia in ciliated cells is critical to understand ciliary disease such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, which involves abnormally short cilia. But this control mechanism is not well understood. Previously, multiple tubular cysts have been observed in the kidneys of max-interacting protein 1 (Mxi1)-deficient mice aged 6 months or more. Here, we clarified the relationship between Mxi1 inactivation and cilia disassembly. Cilia phenotypes were observed in kidneys of Mxi1-deficient mice using scanning electron microscopy to elucidate the effect of Mxi1 on renal cilia phenotype, and cilia disassembly was observed in Mxi1-deficient kidney. In addition, genes related to cilia were validated in vitro and in vivo using quantitative PCR, and Ift20 was selected as a candidate gene in this study. The length of cilium decreased, and p-ERK level induced by a cilia defect increased in kidneys of Mxi1-deficient mice. Ciliogenesis of Mxi1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) decreased, and this abnormality was restored by Mxi1 transfection in Mxi1-deficient MEFs. We confirmed that ciliogenesis and Ift20 expression were regulated by Mxi1 in vitro. We also determined that Mxi1 regulates Ift20 promoter activity via Ets-1 binding to the Ift20 promoter. These results indicate that inactivating Mxi1 induces ciliary defects in polycystic kidney."
