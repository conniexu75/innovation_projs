https://openalex.org/W2021395497,"Homocysteine thiolactone is formed in all cell types studied thus far as a result of editing reactions of some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Because inadvertent reactions of thiolactone with proteins are potentially harmful, the ability to detoxify homocysteine thiolactone is essential for biological integrity. This work shows that a single specific enzyme, present in mammalian but not in avian sera, hydrolyzes thiolactone to homocysteine. Human serum thiolactonase, a 45-kDa protein component of high density lipoprotein, requires calcium for activity and stability and is inhibited by isoleucine and penicillamine. Substrate specificity studies suggest that homocysteine thiolactone is a likely natural substrate of this enzyme. However, thiolactonase also hydrolyzes non-natural substrates, such as phenyl acetate,p-nitrophenyl acetate, and the organophospate paraoxon. N-terminal amino acid sequence of pure thiolactonase is identical with that of human paraoxonase. These and other data indicate that paraoxonase, an organophosphate-detoxifying enzyme whose natural substrate and function remained unknown up to now, is in fact homocysteine thiolactonase. By detoxifying homocysteine thiolactone, the thiolactonase/paraoxonase would protect proteins against homocysteinylation, a potential contributing factor to atherosclerosis.

Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. Macmillan Reference Ltd., London2000Google Scholar, 2.Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs), such as MetRS, IleRS, LeuRS, ValRS, and LysRS, misactivate Hcy and form an AARS-bound homocysteinyl adenylate according to Reaction 1. AARS+Hcy+ATP⇔AARS·Hcy∼AMP+PPi ↓ Hcy thiolactone REACTION 1However, misactivated Hcy is not transferred to tRNA by any of these enzymes (1.Jakubowski H. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences.

Instead, Hcy∼AMP is efficiently edited (3.Jakubowski H. Fersht A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), as indicated by the side reaction in Reaction 1. Editing of Hcy∼AMP involves an intramolecular reaction in which the side chain thiolate of Hcy displaces the AMP group from the carboxylate of the activated Hcy, forming thiolactone as a product (ReactionFR2). The energy of the anhydride bond of Hcy∼AMP is conserved in an intramolecular thioester bond of Hcy thiolactone. Consequently, Hcy thiolactone easily acylates side chain amino groups of protein lysine residues (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jakubowski H.

Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its mostly neutral character at physiological pH (pK = 7.1; Ref. 11.Anderson R.F. Packer J.E. Int. J. Radiat. Phys. Chem. 1974; 6: 33-46Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), thiolactone accumulates in culture media (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol.

The synthesis of Hcy thiolactone increases with an increase in Hcy levels and decreases with an increase in Met levels. For example, folate-limited cultures of cystathionine β-synthase-deficient human fibroblasts (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or normal human fibroblasts (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial cells (7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), accumulate both Hcy and Hcy thiolactone. As much as 60% of the metabolized Hcy is converted to thiolactone in human vascular endothelial cells maintained on Hcy in Met-free, folate-limited media (7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to Hcy thiolactone, homocysteinylated proteins are also present in cultured human cells (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vascular endothelial cells in which methionine synthase was inhibited by folate limitation, Hcy incorporation into protein represented 36% of the incorporation of Met (7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). When endothelial cells were maintained on Hcy, its incorporation into intracellular and extracellular protein represented 15% and 65%, respectively, of Met incorporation (7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular levels of Hcy bound to protein via amide bonds are greater than the levels of free Hcy (7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hcy incorporation into protein is post-translational, reflecting facile homocysteinylation of protein lysine residues by Hcy thiolactone (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jakubowski H.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge2000Google Scholar). Translational incorporation of Hcy into protein is not believed to be possible because AARSs exhibit absolute selectivity against Hcy in the tRNA aminoacylation reaction (1.Jakubowski H. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. Macmillan Reference Ltd., London2000Google Scholar, 2.Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Jakubowski H.

The efficacy of protein damage by homocysteinylation has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Enzymes, such as MetRS and trypsin (7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), are irreversibly inactivated by homocysteinylation. Lysine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for post-translational modification essential for the biogenesis of connective tissue matrices, is also inactivated by Hcy thiolactone (12.Liu G. Nellaiappan K. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32370-32377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Homocysteinylated proteins can be physiologically detrimental; for instance, they can elicit immune response, as shown recently in rabbits (13.Ferguson E. Parthasarathy S. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 925-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because protein homocysteinylation can potentially lead to cell and tissue damage (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jakubowski H.

Thromb. 1991; 11: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), human beings most likely evolved mechanisms to detoxify Hcy thiolactone. The present work shows that a calcium-dependent Hcy thiolactone hydrolase (HTase) is tightly associated with HDL in human serum. In addition, it shows that HTase is identical with paraoxonase, an organophosphate-detoxifying enzyme whose natural substrate and function are unknown at present. [35S]Hcy thiolactone was prepared from [35S]Met according to Baernstein (15.Baernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 106: 451-456Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and purified by two-dimensional TLC on 20 × 10-cm cellulose plates (Eastman Kodak Co.) (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall yield of the procedure was 65%. The preparation of l-[35S]Hcy thiolactone was at least 96% pure on analytical two-dimensional TLC. Maximum levels of contamination with Met, Hcy, and homocystine were <1%, <0.8%, and <1%, respectively. Human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers, as approved by the institutional human investigation review board. It was taken into vacutainer tubes and allowed to clot for 2 h. Serum was collected after centrifugation (15 min, 2,000 × g). Animal sera were purchased from Sigma. Human serum was incubated with l-[35S]Hcy thiolactone at 37 °C. Incorporation of Hcy into protein was assayed by precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid before and after treatment with 10 mm DTT. Protein-N-Hcy was determined as DTT-resistant trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Protein-S-S-Hcy was measured as DTT-sensitive fraction of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material or as free Hcy released from protein by DTT treatment. In control experiments in whichl-[35S]Hcy was incubated with human serum, protein-S-S-Hcy was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Half-lives (∼1 h) for the formation of protein-Hcy adducts were independent of concentrations of Hcy thiolactone and Hcy up to 0.3 mm. LDL and HDL were prepared from fresh human serum by sequential precipitation with dextran-CaCl2 as described by Burstein et al.(16.Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid. Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were also prepared by ultracentrifugation in KBr (density of 1.225 g/ml) and gel filtration (17.Rudel L.L. Lee J.A. Morris M.D. Felts J.M. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) on a Sephacryl HR S-300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2. Unless indicated otherwise, incubations were carried out at 37 °C in 0.1 m K-Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 2 mm CaCl2. HTase activity was determined by following formation of [35S]Hcy from [35S]Hcy thiolactone. Hcy was separated from thiolactone by TLC (18.Jakubowski H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4504-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19.Jakubowski H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8252-8259Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and quantitated by scintillation counting. Paraoxonase was assayed by following hydrolysis of phenyl acetate or paraoxon (22.Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric assays were used in substrate specificity studies with non-radiolabeled substrates (all from Sigma). Hydrolysis of Hcy thiolactones was determined from the decrease of their characteristic UV absorption at λ = 240 nm (ε = 3500−1m−1 cm−1) (21.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17672-17673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of phenyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate was determined spectrophotometrically using ε = 1300m−1 cm−1 at 270 nm for phenol and ε = 13000 m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm for p-nitrophenol, respectively. Hydrolysis of diethylp-nitrophenyl phosphate (paraoxon) was measured spectrophotometrically using ε = 13000m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm forp-nitrophenol (22.Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments in which utilization of other (thio)esters (10 mm) by HTase was tested, potential substrates and products were separated by TLC and visualized by staining with ninhydrin (3.Jakubowski H. Fersht A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3105-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5.Jakubowski H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8088-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or under UV. With all potential substrate-product pairs, complete separation was achieved on cellulose plates (Kodak) using butanol:acetic acid:water (4:1:1, v/v) as solvent. Complete separation of acetyl-S-coenzyme A from coenzyme A-SH was achieved on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Sigma) using 1.2 m LiCl as solvent. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm CaCl2was used. When necessary, fractions containing HTase activity were concentrated by ultrafiltration on Centricon 30 cartridges (Amicon). Human serum (20 ml) was brought to 35% saturation by the addition of 4.4 g of solid ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was discarded. Proteins precipitated by subsequent addition of 4.8 g of ammonium sulfate (to 70% saturation) were collected, dissolved in 5 ml of buffer, dialyzed, and concentrated to 6 ml. The 35–70% ammonium sulfate fraction was chromatographed on a 1.6 × 85-cm Sephacryl S300HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Active fractions (20 ml), eluting between LDL and serum albumin fractions, were applied onto a 1 × 10-cm Mono Q Sephacryl (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteins were eluted with 0–0.4 m NaCl gradient (100 + 100 ml) in the standard Tris-Ca buffer. Active fractions (30 ml), eluting at 0.25–0.30 m NaCl, were concentrated to 4 ml and applied onto a second Sephacryl S300HR column (1.6 × 85 cm). Active fractions from the second Sephacryl S300HR (20 ml) column were applied onto a 1 ml HiTrap Blue column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Blue column was washed successively with 5 ml of 1, 2, or 3 mNaCl in the buffer, and the buffer alone. HTase was eluted with 5 ml 0.1% sodium deoxycholate in standard buffer. Fractions containing the enzyme (1.5 ml) were diluted with 4 ml of buffer, supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, and applied onto Mono Q Sephacryl column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the Tris-Ca-Triton buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 0–0.4 m NaCl gradient (50 + 50 ml) in the Tris-Ca-Triton buffer. Fractions containing HTase activity (9.5 ml) were concentrated to 0.1 ml. N-terminal sequence determination was carried out by Dr. R. Donnelly on Applied Biosystems model 491 ProciseTM sequencer at institutional Molecular Core Facility. Incubation of exogenous [35S]Hcy thiolactone with human serum resulted in progressive incorporation of the [35S]radiolabel into protein. At 3 h, most of the thiolactone became trichloroacetic acid-precipitable (Fig. 1 A). Addition of DTT to [35S]Hcy thiolactone-modified serum proteins resulted in a release of ∼30% of the incorporated35S as free [35S]Hcy. DTT treatment of protein-S-[35S]Hcy adducts, prepared by a 2-h incubation of free [35S]Hcy with serum, rendered all radioactivity trichloroacetic acid-soluble (Fig. 1 B). Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that albumin-S-[35S]Hcy represented most (>95%) of protein-S-[35S]Hcy in human serum (data not shown). As described elsewhere (6.Jakubowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Jakubowski H. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 377S-381SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jakubowski H. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), [35S]Hcy in the DTT-resistant fraction of 35S-protein adducts is bound to side chain amino groups of protein lysine residues. Thus, Hcy thiolactone undergoes two major reactions in serum: 1) protein homocysteinylation, forming protein-N-Hcy (Fig.2 A); and 2) enzymatic hydrolysis to give Hcy, which then attaches to protein cysteine residues, forming protein-S-S-Hcy disulfides (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Schematic structures of protein-N-Hcy and protein-S-S-Hcy. A, in protein-N-Hcy the carboxyl group of Hcy forms an amide bond with the side chain amino group of protein lysine residue.B, in protein-S-S-Hcy the thiol of Hcy forms a disulfide bond with the side chain thiol of protein cysteine residue. Theovals represent protein molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These reactions of Hcy thiolactone were observed in 10 different human serum samples, as well as in bovine, horse, rabbit, and mouse sera. In human sera from different donors, rates of thiolactone hydrolysis to Hcy ranged from about equal to 2–3-fold slower than the rate of protein-N-homocysteinylation. The hydrolysis of the thiolactone to Hcy in rabbit and mouse sera was 5–10 times faster than protein-N-homocysteinylation. There was no enzymatic hydrolysis of thiolactone in chicken serum (data not shown). When a sample of human serum was subjected to gel filtration, Hcy thiolactone hydrolyzing activity eluted in a single peak at a position characteristic of HDL, between LDL and serum albumin peaks (Fig. 3). The HTase activity co-migrated with paraoxonase, a known component of HDL (23.Mackness B. Durrington P.N. Mackness M.I. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine if HTase is in fact associated with HDL, human serum lipoprotein fractions were prepared by sequential precipitation with dextran-CaCl2 (16.Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid. Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and assayed. HTase activity, like paraoxonase activity, was present in HDL and absent in the LDL fraction (Table I), indicating that HTase is tightly associated with HDL in human serum. Similar association of HTase with HDL was observed in rabbit serum (not shown).Table IHTase is associated with HDL in human serumLipoprotein fractionHTaseParaoxonasenmol/mg protein/hμmol/mg/minSerum57 ± 52.8 ± 0.2LDL00HDL613 ± 4031.0 ± 2.0None, serum albumin (control)00LDL and HDL were prepared from human serum as described by Burstein et al. (16.Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid. Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HTase and paraoxonase were assayed with 10 mm[35S]Hcy thiolactone and 5 mm phenyl acetate, respectively. Open table in a new tab LDL and HDL were prepared from human serum as described by Burstein et al. (16.Burstein M. Scholnick H.R. Morfin R. J. Lipid. Res. 1970; 11: 583-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HTase and paraoxonase were assayed with 10 mm[35S]Hcy thiolactone and 5 mm phenyl acetate, respectively. At all steps of purification, a single peak of HTase activity was obtained, suggesting that a single enzyme is responsible for Hcy thiolactone hydrolysis in human serum (Table II). Due to its tight association with HDL, pure HTase could only be obtained by including the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 at the final step of purification. For example, HTase preparation obtained after first Mono Q column chromatographed as a high molecular mass complex of ∼300 kDa on a gel filtration column and contained protein components (major of mass 28 kDa and minor of mass 45 kDa) identical to those of authentic HDL (17.Rudel L.L. Lee J.A. Morris M.D. Felts J.M. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). Re-chromatography on Mono Q in the presence of Triton X-100 resulted in separation of HTase (eluting at 0.25 m NaCl) from apolipoprotein A-I (eluting at 0.1 m NaCl). Pure HTase migrated as a 45-kDa protein on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A 1300-fold purification with a yield of 10% was achieved (Table II), suggesting that HTase is present in human serum at a concentration ∼50 μg/ml or ∼1 μm. Similar purification of HTase was achieved when HDL (prepared by ultracentrifugation in KBr and gel filtration; Ref. 17.Rudel L.L. Lee J.A. Morris M.D. Felts J.M. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was subjected to chromatography on a Mono Q column in the presence of Triton X-100.Table IIPurification of human serum HTaseStepVolumeProteinHTase activityParaoxonase activityRatio HTase paraoxonasePurificationmlmgμmol/mg/hμmol/mg/min× 10 3-foldSerum20.012000.0572.80.34Ammonium sulfate6.22200.2211.40.313.8Sephacryl S300HR19.8440.7338.60.3112.8Mono Q30.08.42.6121.40.3645.7Sephacryl S300HR19.66.42.9162.50.2950.4HiTrap Blue1.52.63.02170.2352.6Mono Q9.50.176.036190.351333HTase was assayed with 10 mm [35S]Hcy thiolactone. Paraoxonase was assayed with 5 mm phenyl acetate. Open table in a new tab HTase was assayed with 10 mm [35S]Hcy thiolactone. Paraoxonase was assayed with 5 mm phenyl acetate. Twelve cycles of automatic Edman degradation of the purified HTase yielded the following N-terminal amino acid sequence: AKLIALTLLGMG. Search of data banks revealed a 100% match of this sequence with N terminus of human serum paraoxonase (24.Hassett C. Richter R.J. Humbert R. Chapline C. Crabb J.W. Omiecinski C.J. Furlong C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10141-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). HTase could not be purified in the absence of CaCl2 because the enzyme quickly lost its activity. The inactivated enzyme could not be re-activated by addition of any divalent metal. Effects of divalent cations and EDTA on HTase activity is shown in Table III. Partial activity, observed in the absence of exogenous divalent metal ions, was due to 0.02 mm CaCl2 carried over from HTase preparation. The activity was inhibited by EDTA and stimulated by CaCl2. NiCl2 (2 mm) stimulated HTase activity but was ineffective at lower concentrations. Other divalent metal ions, tested as dichloride salts, did not affect HTase activity.

HTase was resistant to iodoacetate or iodoacetamide (data not shown), suggesting that thiol groups are not required for activity. Up to 0.01m cysteine, Hcy, or DTT did not affect HTase activity. However, HTase was 60% inhibited by 0.1 m DTT, most likely due to reduction of intramolecular -S-S- disulfide bridges of the enzyme. AlthoughS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine, a donor of NO groups, inhibited HTase (Table V), another NO donors, S-nitroso-glutathione and sodium nitroprusside, did not (data not shown). This suggests that the inhibition byS-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine is not due to its ability to donate NO groups.Table VEffects of amino acids and other compounds on HTase activityCompoundHTase activity%None100 ± 10l-Isoleucine34 ± 7 (I 50 = 2 mm)aNoncompetitive inhibition.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 195-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The most important underlying mechanism is 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3)1-regulated active transport of Ca2+ from the lumen to the blood compartment, which occurs primarily in the proximal small intestine and the distal part of the nephron. This process of transcellular Ca2+ transport is a three-step operation consisting of passive apical Ca2+ entry followed by cytosolic diffusion facilitated by calbindins and active extrusion across the basolateral membrane by a high affinity Ca2+-ATPase and/or a Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (2.Hoenderop J.G.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Bindels R.J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F899-F906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apical influx of Ca2+ is the rate-limiting step in this process and, therefore, a prime regulatory target for stimulatory and inhibitory hormones. The epithelial Ca2+ channel (ECaC), recently cloned from rabbit kidney, is the candidate channel for being the gatekeeper of this apical Ca2+ influx mechanism (3.Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

ECaC is exclusively present in 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive epithelia, including intestine, kidney, and placenta, and is structurally related to the family of transient receptor potential channels, capsaicin receptors, and the growth factor-regulated channel (4.Zhu X.B., L.

These Ca2+-permeable cation channels contain six putative transmembrane domains, including a pore-forming region, but share only 30% homology that is mainly restricted to the pore-forming region and flanking transmembrane segments. ECaC contains putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent and cGMP-dependent protein kinase, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and structural domains, such as N-linked glycosylation sites and ankyrin repeats (3.Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

A similar conclusion was reached for a Ca2+ transporter (calcium transporter 1) cloned from rat intestine, which shares with ECaC a structural similarity of 75% and several basic functional properties (8.Peng J.B.

The identification of ECaC offers for the first time a realistic approach to study the functional and regulatory aspects of this Ca2+ influx pathway. Knowledge of ECaC functioning is of vital importance to understand the Ca2+ handling by Ca2+ absorbing epithelia and will, in particular, provide a molecular basis for achieving a better understanding of Ca2+ malabsorption/malreabsorption. The aim of the present study is to functionally characterize ECaC by a combined whole-cell patch-clamp analysis and fura-2 fluorescence microscopy using HEK293 cells heterologously expressing ECaC. The entire open reading frame from rbECaC was cloned as a PvuII-BamHI fragment in the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector (3.Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F. van Os C.H. Willems P.H.

Human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the pCINeo/IRES-GFP/rbECaC vector using methods described previously (10.Kamouchi M. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. Wissenbach U. Mamin A. Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were visually identified in the patch-clamp set up. GFP was excited at a wavelength between 450 and 490 nm, and the emitted light was passed through a 520 nm long-pass filter. The ECaC-expressing cells were identified by their green fluorescence, and GFP-negative cells from the same batch were used as controls. Electrophysiological methods and Ca2+ measurements have been described in detail previously (11.Nilius B. Oike M. Zahradnik I. Droogmans G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 787-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were measured with an EPC-9 (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany; sampling rate, 1 ms; 8-pole Bessel filter, 2.9 kHz) or an L/M-EPC-7 (List Elektronics, Darmstadt, Germany) using ruptured patches. Electrode resistances were between 2 and 5 MΩ, and capacitance and access resistances were monitored continuously. The ramp protocol consisted of linear voltage ramps changing from −100 or −150 mV to +100 mV within 400 ms, applied every 5 s. The step protocol consisted of a series of 400-ms-long voltage steps applied from a holding potential of +20 mV to voltages between −100 and +100 mV, with an increment of 25 mV. The current density was calculated from the size of net current at −80 mV during the ramp protocol. The permeability of Cs+, the only other permeable monovalent cation besides Na+ in pipette and bath solution, was measured relative to that of Na+ from the reversal potential in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (1 nm free [Ca2+]o buffered by 5 mm EGTA and 10 μm total [Ca2+]o) to Equation 1.

ECaC-expressing cells were loaded with fura-2 via the patch pipette and excited alternately at wavelengths of 360 and 390 nm through a filter wheel rotating at 2 cycles/s. The fluorescence emitted at each excitation wavelength was measured at 510 nm using a photomultiplier. Autofluorescence was subtracted. Apparent free [Ca2+] was calculated from the fluorescence ratio R by [Ca2+]i =K eff (R −R 0)/(R 1 − R), where K eff is the effective binding constant,R 0 the fluorescence ratio at zero Ca2+, and R 1 that at high Ca2+. These calibration constants were determined experimentally for the given set-up and the actual experimental conditions used. The standard extracellular solution (Krebs) contained 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with CsOH, and the concentration of Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, or Mn2+ was varied between 1 and 30 mm as indicated in the text. Nominally free Ca2+ concentration was estimated at 10 μm. Ca2+-free solutions were buffered by 5 mm EGTA at a free [Ca2+] below 1 nm, as calculated by the CaBuf program (G. Droogmans, KU Leuven). The internal (pipette) solution contained 20 mm CsCl, 100 mmCs-aspartate, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmBAPTA, 4 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with CsOH. For simultaneous measurement of the membrane current and [Ca2+]i, the same extracellular solution was used, and the internal (pipette) solution contained 20 mmCsCl, 100 mm Cs-aspartate, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Na2ATP, and 0.5 mm fura-2 (pentapotassium salt), pH 7.2, with CsOH. Cells were kept in a nominally Ca2+-free medium to prevent Ca2+ overload and exposed for a maximum of 5 min to a Krebs solution containing 1.5 mm Ca2+ before sealing the patch pipette to the cell. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). In all experiments, the data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In the case of significance (p < 0.01), individual groups were compared by Student's t test. Experimental data were fitted to multiple exponentials using the fitting routine of the ASCD program (G. Droogmans). Evidence that ECaC forms a constitutively active Ca2+entry pathway was obtained from experiments showing a close correlation between the level of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and the electrochemical Ca2+gradient in ECaC-expressing HEK293 cell (Fig.1). The driving force for Ca2+entry was therefore modified either by changing extracellular ([Ca2+]o, Fig. 1 A) or the membrane potential (V M) (Fig. 1 B). In Fig. 1, the top panels show some representative traces of the changes in [Ca2+]i induced by changes in [Ca2+]o and V M, respectively. Increasing [Ca2+]o from 0 to 30 mm in cells clamped at +20 mV markedly increases [Ca2+]i in ECaC-expressing cells, whereas the effect was much less pronounced in nontransfected cells (Fig.1 A). In another experiment, we varied the membrane potential at a constant [Ca2+]o of 1.5 mm. Depolarization from +20 to +60 mV decreased [Ca2+]i, whereas hyperpolarization from +20 to −100 mV increased [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1 B). The pooled data from several cells are summarized in the bottom panels of Fig. 1, which represent the maximal values of [Ca2+]i observed at each [Ca2+]o or V M. It is obvious that intracellular [Ca2+]i is closely correlated with either [Ca2+]i or V M and that the corresponding changes of [Ca2+]i are much smaller in nontransfected cells. The characteristics of the Ca2+ entry pathway in ECaC-expressing cells were further investigated in electrophysiological whole-cell experiments in cells dialyzed with 10 mm BAPTA and using the described ramp and step protocols. Under these circumstances, voltage ramps induced large inward currents in ECaC-expressing HEK293 cells with amplitudes that were obviously enhanced by increasing [Ca2+]o (Fig.2 B). Nontransfected HEK293 cells exhibited under these experimental conditions only a small background current, which was in contrast with ECaC-expressing cells inhibited by increasing [Ca2+]o (Fig.2 A). Because of the strong inward rectification, it was difficult to obtain reliable values of the reversal potential. Moreover, the reversal potential of +54 ± 4 mV (range, 30–77;n = 13) at 30 mm[Ca2+]o is probably an underestimation due to the presence of background currents. Currents in response to voltage-steps to potentials more negative than −40 mV showed time-dependent inactivation, whereas currents at more positive potentials did not. Inactivation was manifest at 30 mm [Ca2+]o but was also present at 1 mm (Fig. 2, C and D). Buffering [Ca2+]o at 1 nm abolished inactivation and enhanced the current amplitude (Fig. 2 E) compared with that at 1 mm [Ca2+]o. The fit of the inactivation time course with a sum of exponentials disclosed two kinetically distinct components at 30 mm[Ca2+]o or Mn2+ (Fig.3, A and B) but a single slow component if extracellular Ca2+ was replaced with Ba2+ or Sr2+ (Fig. 3, C andD).Figure 3Inactivation of ECaC-mediated currents. A, currents at steps from +20 mV holding potential to −100, −75, and −50 mV, respectively. Extracellular Ca2+concentration was 30 mm. The decay of the currents was fitted with two exponentials. At potentials more positive than −50 mV, only non-inactivating current could be recorded. The fitted lines completely matched the current traces. Inactivation time constants are plotted against the respective voltages (n = 4-9). Note that two time constants can be clearly separated. Calibration is identical for all examples shown. B, currents measured with 30 mm Mn2+ showed a similar inactivation, with a fast and a slow component. The protocol used was the same as inA. Decay was fitted by two exponentials (n = 3). C, current steps and inactivation time constantversus voltage plotted for Ba2+ being the charge carrier through ECaC. Inactivation was delayed compared with Ca2+ (n = 3). D, when Sr2+ was substituted for Ca2+, currents through ECaC were still inactivated. Decay was faster than in Ba2+but slower than Ca2+ (n = 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To corroborate our insight in the mechanism of permeation through ECaC, we have measured current densities at −80 mV as a function of [Ca2+]o in ECaC-expressing cells, as shown in Fig. 4 A. At extracellular Ca2+ levels above 1 mm, the current density strongly increased with [Ca2+]o. However, the current density also increased if [Ca2+]o was buffered at 1 nm. Under the latter conditions, the channel becomes apparently permeable for monovalent cations. The [Ca2+]o dependence of the ECaC-specific current density, calculated as the difference current in ECaC-expressing and control cells, shows the typical anomalous mole fraction behavior known for highly Ca2+-selective channels (Fig. 4 B). Note also that the current density in control cells in contrast with ECaC-expressing cells diminished with increasing [Ca2+]o (Fig. 4 A). We have also compared the current densities at −80 mV in ECaC-expressing cells at different [Ca2+]i,i.e. in cells buffered with 10 mm BAPTA at extremely low values or at 1 μm (Fig. 4 C). It is obvious that an increase in [Ca2+]idown-regulates the current. Current densities and inactivation pattern of ECaC was different for the various divalents (Fig. 5,A and B, and Fig. 3). The conductance sequence for divalent cations of the ECaC channel derived from the current densities at −80 mV is Ca2+ > Ba2+ ≈ Sr2+ > Mn2+ (Fig. 5 C); the values for Sr2+ and Ba2+ are not statistically different (p > 0.01). The permeability ratioP Ca:P Na, determined from the reversal potentials at 30 mm[Ca2+]o and in Ca2+-free solution according to Equations 1 and 2, was 107 ± 32 (range, 7–420;n = 13). This value probably underestimates the real ratio because of the mentioned underestimation of the reversal potential. The permeabilities of Mn2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ relative to that of Na+ were 20, 5.6, and 4, respectively. ECaC is thus despite the smaller current densities observed with Mn2+ as the charge carrier, more permeable for Mn2+ than for Ba2+ and Sr2+. (Fig. 5 D). In 1 nm[Ca2+]o, we calculated aP Cs:P Na of 0.84, indicating that ECaC is more permeable for Na+ than for Cs+. Another feature of the current through ECaC is its decay during repetitive stimulations (Fig. 6), with voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV applied with an interval of 5 s from a holding potential of +20 mV. In the presence of 30 mm [Ca2+]o, the current practically disappeared after 8 ramps (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, more sweeps were necessary to down-regulate the current when Ba2+ was the charge carrier (Fig. 6 B). Decreasing [Ca2+]o to 1 nm virtually abolished the rundown phenomenon (Fig. 6 C). The time constants of half-maximal decay of the ECaC currents are summarized in Fig. 6 D, showing the dramatic lowering of ECaC currents when Ca2+ is the charge carrier. This finding indicates that the decay process may be associated with a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. The present study describes functional characteristics of the recently cloned epithelial Ca2+ channel, ECaC, that are consistent with its putative role as apical Ca2+ entry channel that mediates transcellular Ca2+ transport in 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive epithelia. These distinctive properties include a constitutively activated Ca2+ permeability at physiological membrane potentials, a high calcium selectivity, Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation of channel activity, anomalous mole-fraction behavior, and rundown of channel activity. Transient expression of ECaC dramatically increased the Ca2+ permeability of HEK293 cells, which was reflected by an elevated cytosolic Ca2+ level proportional to the electrochemical driving force for Ca2+. At physiological membrane potentials, ECaC is apparently constitutively active in the absence of any known stimulus. Extrapolating these findings to thein vivo situation suggests that additional regulatory factors or at least an increased Ca2+ buffer capacity are a necessity for ECaC-expressing cells to maintain constant low Ca2+ levels during transcellular Ca2+transport. The 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent calcium-binding proteins, named calbindins, which are abundantly present in the cytosol of ECaC-expressing epithelia, could fulfil such a function (2.Hoenderop J.G.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Bindels R.J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F899-F906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Bindels R.J. Timmermans J.A. Hartog A. Coers W. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1991; 2: 1122-1129PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Friedman P.A. Gesek F.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Indeed, calbindins are known to facilitate the cytosolic diffusion of Ca2+ from the apical membrane to the basolateral extrusion mechanisms, while maintaining low cytosolic Ca2+ levels (14.Feher J.J. Fullmer C.S. Wasserman R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C517-C526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ECaC-expressing HEK293 cells displayed large inward currents in the presence of BAPTA in the pipette solution. These currents displayed high Ca2+ dependence and very positive reversal potentials. These findings are indicative of a Ca2+-selective current. The current-voltage relationship shows prominent inward rectification. Thus, under unstimulated physiological conditions when the membrane potential is typically around −70 mV in the distal nephron (13.Friedman P.A. Gesek F.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), ECaC has a substantial Ca2+ conductance permitting basal Ca2+ influx in the epithelial cell. This influx would be enhanced when the driving force is increased by reduction of [Ca2+]i or hyperpolarization of the cells. Indeed, PTH has been shown to hyperpolarize the membrane during its stimulatory action and thereby promotes Ca2+ influx in the renal cell. Likewise, thiazide diuretics-induced impairment of NaCl reabsorption hyperpolarizes the plasma membrane (15.Friedman P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and thus facilitates additional Ca2+ entry through ECaC. This could explain the calcium-sparing effect of this diuretic. Detailed knowledge about the mechanism of permeation through ECaC was obtained from the Ca2+ current response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps. These responses are characterized by a rapid but incomplete inactivation, which consists of a fast and a slow component. The fast component was eliminated when Ba2+ or Sr2+ was used as a charge carrier. This latter finding suggests that ECaC activity is controlled by a Ca2+-dependent feedback mechanism. It is generally known that Ca2+ ions that enter through Ca2+ channels, including voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and transient receptor potential channels, exert a negative effect on channel activity (16.Hille B. Ionic Channel of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 337-389Google Scholar). Recently, several independent studies have reached the conclusion that in the case of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, direct binding of calmodulin, which is ubiquitously expressed as Ca2+ sensor inside cells, plays a critical role in this Ca2+-dependent inactivation process. (17.Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 18.Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). So far, we do not have any indication that a similar mechanism is responsible for the inactivation of ECaC. The IQ motif, identified in the C-tail of these voltage-operated channels is not present in ECaC. It might be possible, however, that a still unidentified calmodulin-binding motif is present in ECaC or that a different feedback mechanism is operative. An additional feature of the gating mechanism is that the current response slowly disappears during successive voltage ramps, generally referred to as rundown or decay. The rundown was significantly diminished when Ca2+ was replaced by Ba2+ as charge carrier and abrogated when extracellular Ca2+ was lowered to 1 nm, indicating, as suggested for the inactivation process, that a Ca2+-operated process inhibits ECaC activity during repetitive stimulation. This form of regulation could have a significant impact on the amount of Ca2+ that enters the cell during repetitive activation. As postulated for other ion channels, it is possible that this rundown involves phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation of the channel or associated proteins (16.Hille B. Ionic Channel of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 337-389Google Scholar,21.Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is tempting to explore the role of a calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II for which functionally conserved consensus sites are present in ECaC (Ser-142 and Ser-693) (3.Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22739-22746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), because it has recently been demonstrated that this kinase is involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of channel activity (22.Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 23.Chao A.C. Kouyama K. Heist E.K. Dong Y.J. Gardner P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1794-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, calbindin-D28K has been implicated in the regulation of the rundown process of N-methyl-d-glucamine receptor channel activity, possibly through buffering local Ca2+elevations and thereby preventing calcium-induced depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (24.Price C.J. Rintoul G.L. Baimbridge K.G. Raymond L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Together with the striking co-localization of ECaC and calbindin-D in Ca2+-transporting cells, a calbindin-mediated rundown process represents a possible mechanism that could adjust the amount of Ca2+ that enters the cell during repetitive activation. The present data unambiguously demonstrate that ECaC possesses a high selectivity for Ca2+, illustrated byP Ca:P Na values of more than 100. This implies that under physiological conditions when Ca2+ ions present in the pro-urine or intestinal fluid are largely outnumbered by Na+ ions, ECaC can efficiently discriminate between Ca2+ and other cations, thereby specifically controlling the Ca2+ permeability of the apical membrane of Ca2+-transporting epithelial cells. This restriction toward monovalent cations was eliminated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ ions, which can be explained by the observed anomalous mole-fraction behavior of ECaC, indicating multiple ion binding sites in ECaC (16.Hille B. Ionic Channel of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 337-389Google Scholar). The cation selectivity of ECaC is distinguishably different from that observed for homologous Ca2+ channels, including members of the Trp family and the ligand-operated vanilloid receptor and growth factor-regulated channels, and is exemplified by an eminent selectivity for Ca2+ over monovalent cations and a permeability sequence for divalent cations of Ca2+ > Ba2+∼ Sr2+ > Mn2+. Furthermore, the current-voltage relationship of vanilloid receptor-like 1, vanilloid receptor 1, and growth factor-regulated channels reveals dominant outward rectification of the corresponding current, allowing us to discriminate these channels from the ECaC current (2.Hoenderop J.G.J.

Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). ECaC, however, resembles several features typical for store-operated Ca2+ entry. The Ca2+-release activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) is remarkably selective for Ca2+, with a divalent cation selectivity profile similar to that of ECaC, and gives rise to prominent inward rectification at negative voltages (26.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 27.Fasolato C. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, it could not be demonstrated that ECaC is activated by store depletion (data not shown), indicating that ECaC does not encode ICRAC. However, it remains intriguing to consider channels homologous to ECaC as candidates for store-operated Ca2+entry. A homologue of ECaC was recently cloned from rat duodenum and named calcium transporter 1 (8.Peng J.B. Chen X.Z. Berger U.V. Vassilev P.M. Tsukaguchi H. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22739-22746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The main part of this protein is highly identical (>90%) to ECaC, whereas the last part of the C-tail is structurally different. Based on its macroscopic kinetic properties, it was suggested that this protein represents a unique transition between a channel and a transporter. The current paper, however, clearly demonstrates that ECaC exhibits defining characteristics typical for a Ca2+ channel, including a positive reversal potential and anomalous mole fraction behavior. The present study has established the basic kinetic aspects of ECaC, which are important to understanding the control of apical Ca2+ entry in Ca2+-transporting epithelial cells. It has been shown previously that this process of transcellular Ca2+ transport is under the regulation of multiple signaling pathways involving protein kinase C and cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinase (13.Friedman P.A. Gesek F.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 28.Hoenderop J.G. De Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Willems P.H.

Together with the observation that relevant consensus sites for these kinases are present in ECaC (3.Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F. van Os C.H. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J.

The human kidney's capacity to convert AA to 20-HETE is unclear, however, as is the underlying P450 catalyst. Microsomes from human kidney cortex were found to convert AA to a single major product, namely 20-HETE, but failed to catalyze AA epoxygenation and midchain hydroxylation. Despite the monophasic nature of renal AA ω-hydroxylation kinetics, immunochemical studies revealed participation of two P450s, CYP4F2 and CYP4A11, since antibodies to these enzymes inhibited 20-HETE formation by 65.9 ± 17 and 32.5 ± 14%, respectively. Western blotting confirmed abundant expression of these CYP4 proteins in human kidney and revealed that other AA-oxidizing P450s, including CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2E1, were not expressed. Immunocytochemistry showed CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 expression in only the S2 and S3 segments of proximal tubules in cortex and outer medulla. Our results demonstrate that CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 underlie conversion of AA to 20-HETE, a natriuretic and vasoactive eicosanoid, in human kidney.

In fact, due to their vasodilatory nature and inhibitory effects on ion transport, a role for EETs (e.g. 5,6-EET and 11,12-EET) in the regulation of renal function has been proposed (3.Harder D.R.

It is known, however, that the CYP4A11 cDNA, which was cloned from a human kidney cDNA library, catalyzes AA 20-hydroxylation 3In this paper, the terms “AA ω-hydroxylation” and “20-hydroxylation” have been used interchangeably and denote hydroxylation of AA at the primary carbon–hydrogen bond. upon its heterologous expression in Escherichia coli (35.Palmer C.N.

We recently found that AA ω-hydroxylation to 20-HETE in human liver was mediated not by CYP4A11 but rather by CYP4F2, another member of theCYP4 gene family (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). While both of these enzymes exhibited extensive AA ω-hydroxylase activity in reconstituted systems, only antibodies to CYP4F2 proved capable of inhibiting 20-HETE formation by intact human liver microsomes. Moreover, it was revealed that CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 were expressed in human renal microsomes at levels nearly equivalent to those found in hepatic microsomes (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). In this investigation, which extends our prior findings, we show that microsomes derived from the human kidney cortex convert AA to a single major metabolite, namely 20-HETE. Other than CYP4F2 and CYP4A11, no other P450 enzyme, including those capable of either AA epoxygenation (e.g. CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19) or ω-1 hydroxylation (CYP2E1), was expressed in human kidney microsomes at appreciable levels. Kinetic analyses and immunoinhibition studies demonstrated that renal 20-HETE formation was mediated by both CYP4F2 and CYP4A11. Finally, immunohistochemical techniques revealed that these two CYP4 family members were localized chiefly in the S2 and S3 segments of the proximal tubule, a region in the kidney nephron where most salt and water reabsorption occurs. Microsomes derived from samples of human renal cortex were obtained from the Human Cell Culture Center (Laurel, MD), from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (Scranton, PA), and from Dr. Barbara Haehner-Daniels (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN). The donor organs had been removed within 30 min of death, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until microsomes were prepared from the samples. The source and properties of the human liver microsomes employed herein have been described elsewhere (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38.Jin R. Koop D.R. Raucy J.L. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Microsomal protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid procedure (39.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). CYP4F2, CYP4A11,b 5, and P450 reductase were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from human liver microsomes as reported elsewhere (38.Jin R. Koop D.R. Raucy J.L. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40.Powell W. Rokach J. Khanapure S. Hashefi M. Gravel S. Macleod R. Falck J. Bhatt R. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The specific contents of the hemoproteins were 7.2 (CYP4F2), 12.6 (CYP4A11), and 29.6 (b 5) nmol/mg of protein, whereas the specific activity of P450 reductase was 25,800 units/mg; 1 unit of P450 reductase activity was defined as that amount catalyzing reduction of 1 nmol of ferricytochromec/min at 22 °C in 300 mm KPO4buffer (pH 7.7). The conversion of AA to oxygenated metabolites was assessed according to Powell et al. (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar) in incubation mixtures (0.25 ml) containing 100 mmKPO4 buffer (pH 7.4), 100 μm AA, 1 mm NADPH, and one of the following enzyme sources: human kidney microsomes (0.5 mg of protein), human liver microsomes (0.25–0.4 mg of protein), or reconstituted P450 enzymes. Reconstituted systems consisted of 25 pmol of purified P450, 250 units of P450 reductase, 100 pmol of b 5, and 7.5 μg of synthetic dilauroylphosphatidylcholine. All reactions were initiated with NADPH and were terminated after 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μl of 2.0 n HCl and vigorous mixing. In antibody inhibition studies, renal microsomes were first incubated with either anti-human CYP4A11, anti-human CYP4F2, or preimmune IgG (described below) for 3 min at 37 °C and then for 10 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of the remaining reaction components. In chemical inhibition studies, microsomes or reconstituted P450 enzymes were preincubated with or without 17-ODYA in the presence of NADPH for 15 min at 37 °C. After cooling on ice, 100 μm AA and additional NADPH were added. AA and its metabolites were isolated from incubation mixtures by extraction with 4 volumes of ethyl acetate using a multiple vortexer device, after which the organic extracts were separated, evaporated to dryness with nitrogen gas at room temperature, resolubilized in 15 μl of 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid, and subjected to HPLC analysis (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of 20-HETE formation were determined from standard curves prepared by adding varying amounts of authentic standard to incubations conducted without AA, whereas 19-HETE production rates were estimated by applying the same standard curve as that used for 20-HETE. Enzyme kinetic results were analyzed by nonlinear regression using weighted (1/y) untransformed data (Grafit; Erithacus Software Ltd., Cambridge, UK); Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined using either a one- or two-enzyme model. Polyclonal antibodies to human liver CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 were raised in male New Zealand White rabbits as described previously (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Jin R. Koop D.R. Raucy J.L. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Preimmune (control) IgG was prepared from rabbit sera obtained prior to immunization. Anti-CYP4F2 and anti-CYP4A11 were essentially monospecific as isolated but required back-adsorption against human epidermal keratin covalently linked to Sepharose 4B to remove the keratin cross-reactivity that interfered with immunoquantitation. The characteristics of anti-CYP2E1, anti-CYP3A4, anti-CYP1A2, anti-CYP2A6, and anti-CYP2C9 have been reported elsewhere (37.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem.

Protein blotting of microsomal proteins and purified P450 enzymes to nitrocellulose and subsequent immunochemical staining with anti-CYP4A11 IgG or anti-CYP4F2 were performed as described previously (40.Powell W. Rokach J. Khanapure S. Hashefi M. Gravel S. Macleod R. Falck J. Bhatt R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 728-736PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Tsutsumi M. Lasker J.M. Takahashi T. Lieber C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 enzyme levels were first quantitated in our reference human kidney sample, HK-31, by applying various amounts of purified CYP4F2 (0.25–0.65 pmol), purified CYP4A11 (0.13–0.5 pmol), and HK-31 kidney microsomes (10–20 μg) to the same polyacrylamide gel, followed by staining of the ensuing Western blots with either anti-CYP4F2 or anti-CYP4A11 IgG. The blots were scanned with an Agfa Arcus II flat bed scanner interfaced to a computer, and immunoreactive areas on the image were measured using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 enzyme content were then assessed in the other kidney specimens (applied at 10 and/or 15 μg/gel lane) by comparing immunostaining intensities to that of the HK-31 reference sample. All immunochemical staining was performed under conditions where the peroxidase reaction density was directly proportional to the amount of protein applied to the original polyacrylamide gels. The contents of CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 in human liver microsomes were determined as described elsewhere (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Jin R. Koop D.R. Raucy J.L. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, normal human kidneys suitable for transplantation were perfused with ice-cold basic salts solution, dissected into small pieces, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 4–12 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the kidney samples were embedded in low temperature paraffin wax, and 4-μm thick sections were then prepared. The sections were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-human CYP4F2 or rabbit anti-human CYPA11 IgG (5–20 μg of IgG/ml of blocking reagent) as the primary antibody, followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG and avidin-biotinylated peroxidase (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA); aminoethylcarbazole was utilized as the chromagen to localize peroxidase activity. Photomicrographs were taken using a Nikon Photomat VxR microscope equipped for Novarski optics. AA, 20-HETE, 14,15-EET, and 14,15-di-HETE were purchased from Cayman Chemical Corp. (Ann Arbor, MI). NADPH was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 17-ODYA was purchased from Cayman Chemical Corp. and from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). HPLC grade solvents were purchased from Fisher. All other chemicals used were of the highest grade commercially available. Our initial studies involved the assessment by Western blotting of the various P450 proteins expressed in human kidney. As shown in Fig.1, renal cortical microsomes from subjects HK860828 and HK861212 contained anti-CYP4F2 and anti-CYP4A11 immunoreactive proteins with the same molecular weights as human liver CYP4F2 and CYP4A11, respectively. Extensive CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 expression was likewise noted in the nine other kidney samples examined (see Table I and Fig. 8). These kidney specimens also expressed CYP3A5 (but not CYP3A4), as described previously by Haehner et al. (47.Haehner B.D. Gorski J.C. Vandenbranden M. Wrighto S.A. Janardan S.K. Watkins P.B. Hall S.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 52-59PubMed Google Scholar), albeit at substantially lower levels than the CYP4 proteins. In contrast, expression of CYP2A6, CYP2E1, and the CYP2C P450s (CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and/or CYP2C19) was observed in neither the depicted kidney samples nor in the nine other renal specimens tested. Furthermore, the low level of renal CYP1A2 expression noted in subject 860828 was not replicated among any of the other subjects. Fig. 1 also reveals that each of the antibodies used for these experiments recognized their corresponding immunogen in human liver microsomes (see lane 1 in each of thepanels). In the case of anti-CYP2C9, this antibody also weakly cross-reacted with the structurally related P450s CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 (46.Lasker J.M. Wester M.R. Aramsombatdee E. Raucy J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas anti-CYP3A4 exhibited strong cross-reactivity with CYP3A5 (45.Feierman D.E. Lasker J.M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1996; 24: 932-939PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of aggregate P450 content in human renal microsomes was precluded here due to sample size constraints.Table IAA ω-hydroxylation, CYP4F2, and CYP4A11 content in human kidney and liver microsomesAA ω-hydroxylationanmol of 20-HETE formed/min/mg of microsomal protein.CYP4A11 contentbpmol of enzyme/mg of microsomal protein.CYP4F2 contentbpmol of enzyme/mg of microsomal protein.Human kidney Mx (n = 9)0.42 ± 0.232.4 ± 18.482.0 ± 15.4Human liver Mx (n = 9)1.81 ± 1.047.6 ± 27.6154.6 ± 47.7AA ω-hydroxylation to 20-HETE by human kidney microsomes was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” whereas microsomal CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 content in the same samples was assessed on immunoblots similar to that shown in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab AA ω-hydroxylation to 20-HETE by human kidney microsomes was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” whereas microsomal CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 content in the same samples was assessed on immunoblots similar to that shown in Fig. 1. The results shown with liver microsomes were taken from Powell et al. (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar) and/or Jin et al. (38.Jin R. Koop D.R. Raucy J.L. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We next examined the capacity of microsomes derived from human kidney cortex to catalyze AA metabolism, particularly the ω-hydroxylation of this essential long chain fatty acid to 20-HETE. In the presence of NADPH, renal cortical microsomes converted AA to 20-HETE in a time- and protein-dependent manner (linear up to 10 min of reaction time at 37 °C with up to 1.0 mg of microsomal protein) (Fig.2 A). Rates of renal 20-HETE formation among nine different subjects were 0.42 ± 0.2 nmol of product formed/min/mg of protein (range of 0.18–0.74 nmol/min/mg), or 4.5-fold less than rates observed with human liver microsomes (Table I) (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, renal microsomes also formed 19-HETE (0.09 ± 0.08 nmol of product formed/min/mg of protein), yet three of the nine subjects failed to generate measurable amounts of this AA ω-1 hydroxylation product (data not shown). 20-HETE and 19-HETE were the only UV-detectable metabolites of AA formed by the human kidney samples, although the HPLC assay employed herein allows for adequate resolution and detection of other P450-mediated AA oxygenation products, including di-HETEs, midchain HETEs, and EETs (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). Had renal microsomes, like hepatic microsomes, converted AA to 14,15-EET, for example, at least the corresponding hydration product 14,15-di-HETE would have been observed upon HPLC analysis (Fig. 2, compare A with B). Kidney microsomes from subject HK013197 were used to examine the kinetics properties of renal 20-HETE formation. Over the range of substrate concentrations utilized (5–240 μm), AA metabolism to 20-HETE exhibited simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.3 A), which were consistent with reaction catalysis by a single enzyme (or by two or more enzymes with similar kinetic properties). Nonlinear regression analysis was used to derive an apparent K m of 43.0 ± 2.8 μm and a V max of 0.84 ± 0.02 nmol 20-HETE formed/min/mg of protein for this particular kidney sample (Fig. 3 B). In fact, identical K m values were derived when the data was subjected to a two-component Michaelis-Menten equation. Interestingly, such monophasic-type kinetics of 20-HETE formation by renal microsomes from subject HK013197 more closely resembled that observed with purified hepatic CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 than the biphasic AA ω-hydroxylation kinetics noted with intact human liver microsomes (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). The respective roles of CYP4F2 and CYP4A11 in human renal AA ω-hydroxylation were first assessed with polyclonal antibodies raised against these P450 enzymes. As mentioned previously (Fig. 1), both anti-CYP4F2 and anti-CYP4A11 IgGs recognized a single P450 protein in human kidney microsomes, namely their respective antigens of immunization (36.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Powell P.K. Wolf I. Lasker J.M. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1998; 359: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although anti-CYP4F2 did exhibit some cross-reactivity with a 70-kDa non-P450 polypeptide. Initial studies using microsomes from subject HK010597 showed dose-dependent inhibition of AA ω-hydroxylation by anti-CYP4F2 as well as by anti-CYP4A11 IgG. With this human kidney sample, maximal inhibition of 20-HETE formation by anti-CYP4F2 (44%) was nearly equivalent to that obtained with anti-CYP4A11 (42%) and was achieved at the same antibody:microsomal protein ratio of 0.2 mg of IgG/mg (Fig. 4 A). As described below, microsomes from subject HK010597 contained similar levels of CYP4F2 (82.0 pmol/"

We have isolated a complementary DNA clone (designated GlnT) encoding a plasma membrane glutamine transporter from glutamatergic neurons in culture, and its properties have been examined using the T7 vaccinia system in fibroblasts. When GlnT is transfected into CV-1 cells, l-glutamine is the preferred substrate. Transport is Na+-dependent and inhibited by α-methylaminoisobutyric acid, a specific inhibitor of neutral amino acid transport system A. Kinetic analysis of glutamine uptake by GlnT is saturable, with a Michaelis constant (K m) of 489 ± 88 μm at pH 7.4. Glutamine uptake mediated by GlnT is pH-sensitive with a 5-fold greater efficiency of uptake at pH 8.2 than at pH 6.6. Only the maximal velocity of transport increases without a significant change in K m. The distribution of GlnT mRNA and protein in the central nervous system is widespread and is expressed on neurons that use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. In cultured cerebellar granule cells, GlnT is expressed only on neurons and is absent from astrocytes. GlnT expression increases concomitantly with the morphologic and functional differentiation of these cells in vitro, consistent with its role of supplying glutamatergic neurons with their neurotransmitter precursor.

To replenish the neurotransmitter pool of glutamate, an intensive glutamine flow from astrocytes to glutamatergic neurons must occur. Once glutamine is taken up into the glutamatergic neuron, phosphate-activated glutaminase converts it into glutamate (11.Bradford H.F. Ward H.K.

System L transporters are high affinity, sodium-independent transporters that prefer large apolar branched-chain and aromatic amino acids. They display unusual tolerance to variations in extracellular pH and are specifically inhibited by the nonmetabolizable substrate 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane 2-carboxylic acid (BCH). System ASC transporters are sodium-dependent and transport alanine, serine, and cysteine most efficiently. They can also function over a broad pH range and, in some situations, mediate amino acid release more than uptake (35.Christensen H.N. Levi G. Battistin L. Lajtha A.

Uptake of glutamine by rat cerebellar granule cells, a predominantly glutamatergic nerve cell population, is primarily mediated by system A (40.Su T-Z. Campbell G.W. Oxender D.L. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of the system A family of transporters has remained elusive. Recently, the transporter that mediates uptake of GABA and glycine into synaptic vesicles has been cloned from the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans (unc-47) and mammals (41.McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J.

This vesicular transporter displays weak similarity to a family of amino acid/auxin permeases (AAAP), which are found in plants (AAP), yeast, and C. elegans (43.Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In plants, five AAP homologues have been shown primarily to mediate transport of neutral amino acids across the plasma membrane (44.Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Riesmeier J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We investigated the possibility that mammalian homologues of the AAAP family encode amino acid transporters. In particular, we sought to identify mammalian cDNA clones that might be associated intimately with the metabolic/sequestration pathway of neurotransmitter glutamate. Here, we reveal the amino acid sequence of GlnT, a neuronal glutamine transporter and propose an 11-transmembrane domain structure for the protein. We show by Northern analysis and in situhydridization histochemistry the distribution of GlnT mRNA. Central nervous system and neuron-specific expression of GlnT, as well as its developmental time course in vitro, are further shown by Western blotting and by immunofluorescence of primary granule cell cultures, a good model for glutamatergic neurons. The identification of GlnT as a Na+-dependent and pH-sensitive glutamine transporter on glutamatergic neurons provides a missing link in the glutamine-glutamate cycle. The role of GlnT as a physiologically important gateway for the precursor of the releasable pool of glutamate can now be studied at the molecular level. Cerebellar primary cultures were prepared from 8-day postnatal Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described, with minor modifications (47.Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cerebella were removed from decapitated rat pups, minced, and digested with trypsin (0.25 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Lebowitz medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. The cell suspension was then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum, and centrifuged at 300 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. This treatment was followed by trituration with a Pasteur pipette in DNase I (50 μg/ml) containing DMEM/5% fetal bovine serum. The cell suspension was allowed to settle for 15 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was transferred to a centrifuge tube on ice. This trituration step was repeated two more times, and the combined supernatants were centrifuged as described above. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and plated at a density of 15 or 3.75 × 105cells/cm2 (neuronal and astrocytic cultures, respectively) in 65-mm-diameter plastic dishes coated with 10 μg/ml polyornithine. Cells were also plated on polyornithine-coated glass 2-well chamber slides (Nunc) at 1 × 106/well. The medium for neuronal cultures also contained 25 mm KCl (final concentration). After 18 h, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to the neuronal cultures to prevent the replication of non-neuronal cells. The astrocyte culture medium was changed at day 3 in vitro and every other day afterward. The neuronal culture medium was 50% refreshed at day 7. Cerebellar neuronal cultures contained more than 95% granule cells, whereas astrocyte cultures contained more than 95% glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)-positive cells (47.Gallo V. Ciotti M.T.

An oligo(dT)-primed, size-selected cDNA library from cerebellar granule cells (10 days in culture) was constructed in a modified T7 promoter bearing plasmid expression vector CDM7/amp (48.Usdin T.B. Beinfeld M.C. Neuroprotocols. 1994; 5: 144-150Google Scholar). Subdivisions of the library were screened with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe against the amino acid sequence (MSVFNLSNAIMGSGILG) of mouse EST 277610, which corresponds to the conserved putative TMD 1 of the yeast AAAP homologues (43.Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and region I (41% identity) of UNC-47 (41.McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Southern blots of EcoRI restriction digests of plasmid prepared from overnight cultures were hybridized overnight at 45 °C in a buffer containing 5× SSC, 25% formamide, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 200 μg/ml tRNA, and the oligonucleotide probe was labeled using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products). The filters were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Autoradiographs were analyzed using BAS2000 phosphorimager system (Fuji Biomedical) after a 12-h exposure. The 2.4-kilobase cDNA purified was subcloned into pUC18, and overlapping fragments were sequenced in both directions with the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding region for the NH2-terminal hydrophilic portion of GlnT (amino acids 1–63) was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KT, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into BL21 cells. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was produced and isolated using a bulk glutathione S-transferase purification module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits by Macromolecular Resources at Colorado State University. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from different rat tissues by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and ultracentrifugation through a cesium trifluoroacetic acid cushion followed by a single round of oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography (49.Okayama H. Kawaichi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota R. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of RNA were electrophoresed through formaldehyde-agarose gels, electroblotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes against 3′ noncoding sequences (bases 1960–2008) or coding sequences (bases 815–862) of GlnT in buffer containing 6× SSPE, 50% formamide, 1× Denhardt's solution, and 250 μg of tRNA for 18 h at 45 °C. The filters were washed in 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 3 days. Fifteen-μm sagittal fresh-frozen brain sections were hybridized at 45 °C in 4× SSC, 50% formamide, 1× Denhardt's, 250 μg/ml tRNA, 500 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (sheared and heat-denatured), and 10% dextran sulfate with35S-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 16 h at 37 °C in a humid chamber (50.Young III., W.S. Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992: 33-44Google Scholar). Slides were washed in 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, air-dried, and exposed to BioMax MR film (Kodak) for 2 weeks. Both GlnT oligonucleotides shown to specifically label a single band on Northern blots were used, and identical results were obtained. For comparison, an oligonucleotide against the vesicular GABA/glycine transporter (bases 1852–1899) was also examined. Primary cerebellar cultures grown for 10 days on polyornithine-coated glass slides were fixed in cold acetone for 3 min, rinsed in PBS, blocked in 0.01% Tween 20, 2% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and incubated for 3 h with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against GlnT and a mouse monoclonal antibody against GFAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:1500 and 1:500, respectively, in blocking buffer. The slides were then washed in PBS, incubated for 1 h in secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa-488 and Alexa-594 (anti-rabbit and anti-mouse, respectively; Molecular Probes), diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer, washed, mounted with SlowFade (Molecular Probes), and viewed under epifluorescence. For primary cultures, cells were rinsed with PBS, harvested by scraping in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/liter pepstatin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, and 5 mg/liter aprotinin, sonicated, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were kept frozen at −80 °C until further use. Various rat tissues and brain regions were rapidly dissected following decapitation and stored frozen at −80 °C. Upon thawing, the samples were homogenized (glass/glass) in PBS containing protease inhibitors, sonicated and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min to eliminate cell debris, and processed immediately. Five μg of SDS-solubilized cell extracts or 10 μg of rat tissue extracts were size-fractionated under reducing conditions on 8% acrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using standard protocols. GlnT, synaptophysin (p38), and GFAP were detected using the respective primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by exposure to film. The subcellular fractionation of a crude synaptosomal preparation from rat brain was performed as described by Huttner and co-workers (51.Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Two rat cerebrums were homogenized in 30 ml of homogenization buffer (0.32m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/liter pepstatin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, and 5 mg/liter aprotinin) using a glass/Teflon homogenizer (12 strokes, 900 rpm). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g in a Beckman JA25.5 rotor. The pellet (P1) was saved, and the supernatant was centrifuged again for 15 min at 9,200 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of homogenization buffer and recentrifuged at 10,200 ×g to yield a washed synaptosomal pellet (P2). The supernatants of the last two spins were pooled (S2). The synaptosomes in P2 were resuspended in homogenization buffer (final volume 5 ml), hypo-osmotically lysed by the addition of 45 ml of ice-cold 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors, and homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer (10 strokes, 900 rpm) followed by rocking at 4 °C for 15 min. The lysed synaptosomes were centrifuged for 20 min at 25,000 × g, and the resulting LP1 pellet was saved. The supernatant was centrifuged again for 1 h at 50,000 rpm in a Ti50.4 rotor to obtain LP2 pellets and the LS2 supernatant. The pellets were resuspended in a total of 5 ml of 25 mm sucrose and layered on top of a linear continuous sucrose gradient made from 16 ml of 50 mm sucrose and 15 ml of 800 mm sucrose. Centrifugation was performed for 150 min in a SW 28 rotor at 25,000 rpm, and the broad turbid band in the 200–500 mm sucrose region was collected and centrifuged in a 70 Ti rotor for 2 h at 40,000 rpm. The microsomal pellet at the bottom of the sucrose gradient was saved. The protein concentrations of all fractions were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) after 5× dilution in PBS containing 0.1% SDS. Monkey kidney fibroblasts (CV-1 cells) were plated on collagen-coated 12-well dishes (2 × 105 cells/well) in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). Cells were rinsed with DMEM without serum, antibiotics, or glutamine, infected with recombinant T7 vaccinia virus at 10 plaque-forming units/cell for 30 min, and then transfected with plasmid cDNA (1 μg/ml) by lipofection in the same medium (52.Feurst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). After 16 h, the cells were rinsed with uptake buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2P04, 1.2 mmMgS04, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and preincubated in the same buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh buffer at various pH values to which 50 μm unlabeled glutamine and 2.5 μCi (0.1 μm) of [3H]glutamine or 0.25 μCi (10 μm) of [14C]MeAIB (NEN Life Science Products) were added. For inhibition studies, 0.8 mmunlabeled amino acids were mixed with [14C]MeAIB. When indicated, BCH and/or MeAIB at a 10 mm concentration were added immediately prior to [3H]glutamine. Cells were placed in a 37 °C incubator for the indicated time, and uptake was terminated with a 2.5-ml wash in 4 °C buffer on ice. For kinetic and inhibition studies, as well as for ion substitutions, uptake was terminated at 2.5 or 3 min. Cells were then solubilized in 1 ml of 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 5 ml of EcoScint (National Diagnostics). Transport measurements were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times using independent infection/transfections. All experimental conditions with GlnT-transfected cells had corresponding mock-transfected cells in adjacent wells. Glutamine transport mediated by the L-type system was defined as total transport minus transport in the presence of BCH, the ASC-type system-mediated process was the glutamine uptake in the presence of BCH and MeAIB, and the A-type system-mediated glutamine transport was the uptake calculated by subtracting the ASC-mediated uptake from the total Na+-dependent uptake in the presence of BCH (40.Su T-Z. Campbell G.W. Oxender D.L. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our cloning strategy began with a search of the EST data base for distant mammalian homologues of the vesicular GABA/glycine transporter. A mouse EST was obtained that displayed high sequence identity to region I of RUNC-47, a region highly conserved among amino acid permeases in the AAAP family of plants, in yeast, and in C. elegans (Fig.1). We screened a rat cDNA library prepared from glutamatergic neuronal cultures with an oligonucleotide corresponding to this region of the EST. A cDNA clone with an open reading frame of 1455 base pairs, predicting a highly hydrophobic protein of 485 amino acids and a molecular mass of 53,848 daltons, was obtained (Fig. 2). Hydropathy analysis suggests 11 hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments (TMD). The absence of a signal sequence for membrane insertion in the NH2terminus suggests that it is retained in the cytoplasm leaving the short COOH terminus located extracellularly. This topologic model is slightly different from that suggested for the GABA/glycine vesicular transporter with 10 TMDs (41.McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The granule cell cDNA clone has two canonical sites for N-linked glycosylation between putative TMDs 5 and 6, and unlike the GABA/glycine vesicular transporter (42.Sagne C. El Mestikawy S. Isambert M.F. Hamon M. Henry J.P. Giros B. Gasnier B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), it is glycosylated (data not shown). Consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase C occur on predicted cytoplasmic domains in the NH2 terminus and between putative TMDs 6 and 7.Figure 2Primary amino acid sequence and proposed structure of the neuronal glutamine transporter. Eleven putative transmembrane domains (I–XI), potential sites forN-linked glycosylation (three-pronged branches), and phosphorylation by protein kinase C (P incircles) are indicated. The cytoplasm is shownabove and the extracellular space below the TMDs; − represents the acidic residues and + the basic residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide a clue as to the functional identity of this putative transporter, we examined the distribution of its cognate mRNA and protein (Fig.3). In situ hybridization reveals a widespread distribution in the neurons of the brain that is distinct from the pattern observed using the vesicular GABA/glycine transporter as a probe (Fig. 3 A). In particular, neurons that use glutamate as their transmitter, such as pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as well as granule cells of the cerebellum, are labeled. By Northern analysis, the mRNA (∼8 kb) is found to be enriched in the brain and spinal cord, with low levels observed in the colon (Fig. 3 B). This mRNA is not observed in peripheral tissues such as lung, liver, spleen, or kidney.

https://openalex.org/W2071221371,"We have applied two strategies for the cloning of four genes responsible for the biosynthesis of the GT1a ganglioside mimic in the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of a bacterial pathogen,Campylobacter jejuni OH4384, which has been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome. We first cloned a gene encoding an α-2,3-sialyltransferase (cst-I) using an activity screening strategy. We then used nucleotide sequence information from the recently completed sequence from C. jejuni NCTC 11168 to amplify a region involved in LOS biosynthesis from C. jejuni OH4384. The LOS biosynthesis locus from C. jejuni OH4384 is 11.47 kilobase pairs and encodes 13 partial or complete open reading frames, while the corresponding locus in C. jejuni NCTC 11168 spans 13.49 kilobase pairs and contains 15 open reading frames, indicating a different organization between these two strains. Potential glycosyltransferase genes were cloned individually, expressed in Escherichia coli, and assayed using synthetic fluorescent oligosaccharides as acceptors. We identified genes encoding a β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase (cgtA), a β-1,3-galactosyltransferase (cgtB), and a bifunctional sialyltransferase (cst-II), which transfers sialic acid to O-3 of galactose and to O-8 of a sialic acid that is linked α-2,3- to a galactose. The linkage specificity of each identified glycosyltransferase was confirmed by NMR analysis at 600 MHz on nanomole amounts of model compounds synthesized in vitro. Using a gradient inverse broadband nano-NMR probe, sequence information could be obtained by detection of3J(C,H) correlations across the glycosidic bond. The role of cgtA and cst-II in the synthesis of the GT1a mimic in C. jejuni OH4384 were confirmed by comparing their sequence and activity with corresponding homologues in two relatedC. jejuni strains that express shorter ganglioside mimics in their LOS."
https://openalex.org/W2029527760,"Many matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are tightly bound to tissues; matrilysin (MMP-7), although the smallest of the MMPs, is one of the most tightly bound. The most likely docking molecules for MMP-7 are heparan sulfate proteoglycans on or around epithelial cells and in the underlying basement membrane. This is established by extraction experiments and confocal microscopy. The enzyme is extracted from homogenates of postpartum rat uterus by heparin/heparan sulfate and by heparinase III treatment. The enzyme is colocalized with heparan sulfate in the apical region of uterine glandular epithelial cells and can be released by heparinase digestion. Heparan sulfate and MMP-7 are expressed at similar stages of the rat estrous cycle. The strength of heparin binding by recombinant rat proMMP-7 was examined by affinity chromatography, affinity coelectrophoresis, and homogeneous enzyme-based binding assay; the K(D) is 5-10 nM. Zymographic measurement of MMP-7 activity is greatly enhanced by heparin. Two putative heparin-binding peptides have been identified near the C- and N-terminal regions of proMMP-7; however, molecular modeling suggests a more extensive binding track or cradle crossing multiple peptide strands. Evidence is also found for the binding of MMP-2, -9, and -13. Binding of MMP-7 and other MMPs to heparan sulfate in the extracellular space could prevent loss of secreted enzyme, provide a reservoir of latent enzyme, and facilitate cellular sensing and regulation of enzyme levels. Binding to the cell surface could position the enzyme for directed proteolytic attack, for activation of or by other MMPs and for regulation of other cell surface proteins. Dislodging MMPs by treatment with compounds such as heparin might be beneficial in attenuating excessive tissue breakdown such as occurs in cancer metastasis, arthritis, and angiogenesis."

ZntA was expressed as a histidyl-tagged protein, solubilized from membranes with Triton X-100, and purified to homogeneity. The soft metal-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of purified ZntA was characterized. The activity was specific for Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), and Hg(II), with the highest activity obtained when the metals were present as thiolate complexes of cysteine or glutathione. The maximal ATPase activity of ZntA was ∼3 μmol/(mg·min) obtained with the Pb(II)-thiolate complex. In the absence of thiolates, Cd(II) inhibits ZntA above pH 6, whereas the Cd(II)-thiolate complexes stimulate activity, suggesting that a metal-thiolate complex is the true substrate in vivo. These results are consistent with the physiological role of ZntA as mediator of resistance to toxic concentrations of the divalent soft metals, Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II), by ATP-dependent efflux.

Putative soft metal P-type ATPases have been found in archea, bacteria, and eukarya including humans. Their physiological roles appear to be to maintain homeostasis of the essential soft metal, Cu(I), as well as to mediate resistance to toxic concentrations of Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I). The soft metal P-type ATPases can be further subdivided into two classes. One class contains the Cu(I)- and Ag(I)-transporting pumps, which include the human Menkes and Wilson disease-related proteins (5.Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The other class of soft metal ATPases have been shown to transport the divalent soft metals, Zn(II) and Cd(II). These include ZntA from Escherichia coli (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,13.Rensing C. Sun Y.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Putative ZntA homologs are widespread in prokaryotes (15.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 787-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and one has been recently identified in the eukaryote, Arabidopsis thaliana(GenBank™ accession no. 4210504). In addition to the many common features of all P-type ATPases, including consensus domains for ATP binding and hydrolysis and a conserved aspartate residue that is phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle, soft metal ATPases have a few distinctive features of their own. One of the most striking features is the presence of 1–6 metal-binding motifs in the polar NH2-terminal segment. This motif is most commonly GMTCXXC, or, in the case of some of the Cu(I) pumps, (M/H)XXMDH(S/G)XM. In addition, the invariant proline residue found in one transmembrane helix of all P-type ATPases is flanked by two cysteine residues in most of the soft metal pumps; in a few cases, this CPC motif is replaced by CPH, CPS, or SPC. This motif probably plays a role in the translocation of the soft metal cation. Soft metal ATPases also have a conserved histidine-proline dipeptide on the carboxyl-terminal side of the conserved phosphoenzyme-formation sequence. While ATP-dependent metal transport as well as metal binding by the amino-terminal domains of some soft metal pumps have been shown so far (8.Solioz M. Odermatt A. J. Biol.

We have initiated biochemical studies of ZntA, as a prototype for the divalent soft metal transporting ATPases. Previously, we showed that ZntA confers resistance to Pb(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) in E. coli by ATP-dependent efflux of these metal ions (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,13.Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the purification of ZntA and the characterization of its soft metal-stimulated ATP hydrolysis activity. ZntA was overexpressed as a hexahistidyl-tagged protein, solubilized from membranes, and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Purified ZntA displayed ATPase activity that was stimulated specifically by Pb(II) > Cd(II) ∼ Zn(II) ∼ Hg(II), in that order. This suggests that the physiological role of ZntA is to mediate resistance to the toxic metals, Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II). The ATPase activity was highest when the soft metal cations were present as high affinity thiolate complexes. pH dependence studies of the ATPase activity of ZntA indicated that free Cd(II) and Hg(II), or their lower affinity, non-thiolate complexes, inhibit the protein at neutral and alkaline pHs. This suggests that a metal-thiolate complex is the substrate for ZntA in vivo. The maximal ATPase activity of ZntA was observed with Pb(II), with an activity of ∼3 μmol/(mg·min) obtained for the thiolate complex of Pb(II) at neutral pH; this value is comparable to those observed previously for Ca(II)- and Na(I)-ATPases (19.Hunter G.W. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4604-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20.Fedosova N.U. Cornelius F. Klodos I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13634-13642Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than the values reported for other P1-type ATPases (21.Wyler-Duda P. Solioz M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22.Takeda K. Ushimaru M. Fukushima Y. Kawamura M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Our data confirm our previous hypothesis that ZntA is a Pb(II)-ATPase (13.Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBAD/Myc-His C and E. coli strains TOP10 and LMG194 were obtained from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (asolectin) was purchased from Sigma and purified prior to use (23.Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against the hexahistidyl tag were obtained fromCLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA. Anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate was purchased from Sigma. 65Zn(II) sulfate was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 109Cd(II) acetate was from Los Alamos Laboratories. ZntA was expressed with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidyl tag under the tightly controlledaraBAD promoter. ZntA was subcloned into the expression vector pBAD/Myc-His C by polymerase chain reaction methods. An NcoI site was generated at the initiation codon, and an EcoRI site was generated downstream of the termination codon using the oligonucleotides 5′-GATGCCATGGCGACTCCTGACAATCACGGC-3′ and 5′-TGAATTCTCTCCTGCGCAACAATCTTAACG-3′ together with the plasmid pCGR2, described previously, as template (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Following restriction digestion with NcoI and EcoRI, pBAD/Myc-His C and the amplified DNA product were ligated together to generate the plasmid pZntA, in which zntA is in-frame with a hexahistidyl tag at the carboxyl terminus. pZntA was transformed into the E. coli strains TOP10 or LMG194 as well as thezntA-disrupted LMG194 strain. The zntA disruption was transferred from E. coli strain RW3110, described previously (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), to LMG194 by generalized transduction with P1 bacteriophage, with selection for kanamycin resistance. ZntA was routinely expressed by growing the pZntA-transformed LMG194 (zntA::kan) cells at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the absorbance at 600 nm was 1, followed by induction with 0.02%l-arabinose, unless noted otherwise. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction, washed with ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 100 mm KCl, and stored at −70 °C till further use. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared from induced LMG194 (zntA::kan) cells with and without pZntA, as described previously (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Transport assays were performed with 65Zn(II) sulfate or 109Cd(II) acetate, usually at pH 6.0. Transport assays were also performed with 20 μm109Cd(II) with or without cysteine at pH 7.0. All buffers were degassed or sparged with nitrogen before use to minimize the oxidation of the enzyme. Purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen cells were thawed and resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, with 100 mm sucrose and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)1) at 0.2 g/ml and disrupted at 20,000 p.s.i. DNase I (0.02 mg/ml) and 2 mmMgCl2 were then added, and the lysed cells were incubated for 30 min. The cells were then diluted 2-fold with buffer A and centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 163,000 × g for 1 h to separate the membranes from the soluble fraction of the cells. The pellet from this centrifugation was washed with buffer A and centrifuged at 229,000 × g for 1 h. The washed membranes were suspended in buffer A and stored frozen till further use. Frozen membranes were diluted to a protein concentration of ∼3 mg/ml with buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 100 mmsucrose, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm PMSF). Triton X-100 was added dropwise to a final concentration of 1%, and the suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h under nitrogen. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 229,000 ×g for 1 h. The Triton X-100 extract (80 ml) was then incubated with 5 ml of Ni(II) resin (Invitrogen, CA), pre-equilibrated with buffer C (buffer B containing 0.5% Triton X-100), and gently mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was next loaded on a column and washed successively with 25 ml of buffer C, 25 ml of buffer C containing 50 mm imidazole, and 10 ml of buffer C containing 100 mm imidazole. The protein was finally eluted with 10 ml of buffer C containing 300 mm imidazole. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for protein. Protein-containing fractions were concentrated using Centricon concentrators (Amicon), and the imidazole was immediately removed by gel-filtration on a ∼20-ml Sephadex G-25 column pre equilibrated with buffer D (25 mmTris, pH 8.0, with 100 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mm PMSF). Fractions were assayed for ATPase activity. The active fractions were pooled (with typical protein concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/ml) and stored at −70 °C following quick freezing in liquid nitrogen. The metal-dependent ATPase activity of purified ZntA was assayed by the pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase coupled spectroscopic assay (24.Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), in which the regeneration of ATP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH. The reaction was monitored at 340 nm. Purified ZntA was rapidly thawed and incubated with 2 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C for 1 h prior to assays. For most of the reported results, a buffer made up of 0.1 m acetic acid, 0.05 m BisTris, and 0.05 m triethanolamine was used. This buffer maintains a constant ionic strength in the pH range tested (25.Ellis K. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Other buffers used were 25 mm BisTris, pH 6, with 50 mm KCl or 25 mm Tris, pH 7, with 50–400 mm KCl. Essentially similar results were obtained in these different buffer systems. The assay mixture (1 ml) also contained 0.1% purified asolectin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5.0 mm ATP, 0.25 mm NADH, 1.25 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 7 units of pyruvate kinase, and 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase, with or without lead acetate, zinc chloride, or cadmium chloride and thiols. Below pH 7, 14 units of pyruvate kinase and 20 units of lactate dehydrogenase were used. Typically 5–20 μl of purified ZntA (0.5–2 mg/ml) were used per assay. Assay mixtures were typically incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before initiating the reaction with 5 mm MgCl2. When measuring theK m for MgATP, the concentration of MgATP was calculated by taking into account the dissociation constants of MgATP, MgHATP, and the pK a values of ATP (26.Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 257-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard. In assays where the metal thiolate complex was used, the concentration of cysteine or glutathione required to generate a constant metal ion:thiolate ion ratio was calculated at each pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation and pK a values of 8.33 and 8.7 for cysteine and glutathione, respectively. Protein expression and purity was assessed on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For Western blotting, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes following electrophoresis. Monoclonal antibodies against the hexahistidyl tag were used to observe the recombinant protein. To express ZntA under a heterologous promoter as well as to facilitate its purification, the zntAgene was subcloned with a carboxyl-terminal histidyl tag into the expression vector pBAD/Myc-His C, where it is under control of the tightly regulated ara promoter. ZntA was expressed in the E. coli strains Top10 and LMG194 as well as the mutant strain LMG194 (zntA::kan), where the chromosomal copy of zntA was disrupted by insertion of a kanamycin cassette. The recombinant ZntA was able to complement the sensitivity of the disrupted strain to Zn(II) and Cd(II) salts to the same extent as the wild-type strain; complementation was observed only when the inducer, arabinose was added (data not shown). This demonstrates that expression of recombinant ZntA was tightly regulated and that the protein was functional. To maximize the expression of ZntA, a variety of growth and induction conditions were examined. For example, the temperature and duration of growth and induction were varied as well as the inducer (l-arabinose) concentration. Expression was maximal when pZntA-transformed LMG194 (zntA::kan) cells were grown to mid-log phase and then induced with 0.02% arabinose for 4–6 h at 37 °C. Arabinose concentrations lower than 0.02% produced less protein, as did induction for 16 h. There was no detectable expression of ZntA in the absence of arabinose, as shown by SDS-PAGE or by Western blot using antibodies against the histidyl tag (Fig. 1). ZntA was localized in the membrane fraction of the cells. Everted membrane vesicles prepared from cells of LMG194 (zntA::kan) expressing ZntA accumulated65Zn(II) in the presence of MgATP (Fig.2 A), indicating that ZntA was functionally expressed. 65Zn(II) accumulation was not observed with either uninduced cells or with induced cells of the disrupted strain without the pZntA plasmid. The specific rate of65Zn(II) accumulation was much higher compared with the value observed previously for the wild-type strain, W3110, induced with 1 mm ZnSO4 (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar); this result is consistent with ZntA being overexpressed upon induction of pZntA. A variety of detergents, including Triton X-100, Tween 80,n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and sodium deoxycholate, were used for solubilization of ZntA from membrane suspensions. Triton X-100 was the most effective detergent; it was able to solubilize >90% of ZntA from the membranes as observed by Western blot (Fig. 1). Sodium deoxycholate, Tween 80, octylglucoside, and dodecylmaltoside were able to solubilize only a portion of the protein. ZntA solubilized with Triton X-100, octylglucoside, or dodecylmaltoside was purified in a single step using Ni(II) affinity chromatography. Of these three detergents, maximal ATPase activity was obtained with the Triton X-100-solubilized and purified protein. Therefore, in the optimized purification protocol, ZntA was solubilized from the membranes with 1% Triton X-100 and purified on a Ni(II) affinity column in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100. Purified ZntA was stored in 0.2% Triton X-100. The presence of phospholipids during the purification had no effect on the activity of the purified enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1, SDS-PAGE revealed that ZntA was >95% pure. The enzyme appeared to lose its activity upon storage by oxidation but could be reactivated by treatment with dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol prior to assays. Purified ZntA showed high levels of metal ion-dependent ATPase activity in the presence of phospholipids and Triton X-100. No ATPase activity was observed in the absence of phospholipids. Asolectin and E. coliphospholipids were both effective at stimulating activity. Treatment of the purified, detergent-solubilized protein with reducing agents was necessary in order to obtain the maximal activity. ZntA was active in the temperature range 25–45 °C, with the activity being >2-fold higher at 40 °C compared with 30 °C. Assays were routinely performed at 37 °C. High levels of activity were observed only in the presence of both Mg(II) as well as Pb(II), Cd(II), Hg(II), or Zn(II). The basal level of ATPase activity in the absence of soft metal cations was typically <10% of the metal cation-stimulated value. Fig.3 shows the ATPase activity obtained as a function of the MgATP concentration in the presence and absence of 100 μm Pb(II) at pH 6.5 and 37 °C. The activity was highest for a 1:1 complex of Mg(II) and ATP; excess Mg(II) had no effect on the activity. The Pb(II)-dependent activity of ZntA had a K m of 111 ± 14 μm for ATP and a V max of 1.44 ± 0.04 μmol/(mg·min) at pH 6.5. Fig.4 A shows the ATPase activity obtained as a function of Pb(II) and Zn(II) concentrations in the presence of 5 mm each Mg(II) and ATP, at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. Under these conditions, a V max of 0.9 μmol/(mg·min) and a K m of 7 μmwere obtained for Pb(II), while the corresponding values for Zn(II) were 0.2 μmol/(mg·min) and 5.0 μm (TableI). No Cd(II)- or Hg(II)-stimulated activity was observed for ZntA at pH 7.0. It is to be noted that Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) form chelates with ATP with association constants that are typically similar to or greater than that of MgATP (27.Sigel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, under the conditions of these assays, where ATP is typically present at 5 mm, the soft metals are primarily present as complexes of ATP. The Km values in Table I thus refer to those of soft metal ATP complexes.Figure 4The ATPase activity of ZntA as a function of the soft metal cation concentrations in the absence and presence of thiolates. Assays were carried out at pH 7.0 and 37 °C, in the presence of 5 mm each Mg(II) and ATP. The same buffer was used as in Fig. 3. The lines are fits to the same equation as in Fig. 3. A, activity as a function of Pb(II) (○) and Zn(II) (▵) concentrations in the absence of any thiolates. Under these conditions, Pb(II) and Zn(II) are present as complexes with ATP.

Therefore, the effect of Cd(II) on ZntA was investigated further. It was observed that addition of Cd(II) to the assay buffer completely inhibited the Pb(II)-induced ATPase activity of ZntA at pH 7.0. This inhibition could be protected by adding cysteine to the assay buffer. Moreover, ZntA displayed Cd(II)-stimulated ATPase activity at pH 7.0 when cysteine or glutathione was included in the assay medium. The effect of cysteine or glutathione was investigated in more detail at pH 7.0. For each of the three metals, Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II), the activity increased with increasing concentrations of the unprotonated (thiolate) form of cysteine or glutathione until a maximum was reached for a metal ion:thiolate ratio of 1:2. The ATPase activities obtained as a function of the Pb(thiolate)2, Cd(thiolate)2, and Zn(thiolate)2 concentrations at pH 7.0 are shown in Fig.4 B. Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), and other soft metals form complexes with thiolates with affinities that are typically many orders of magnitude greater than complexes with ATP (28.Dawson R.M.C. Elliot D.C. Elliot W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biomedical Research. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, London1969Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike Fig. 4 A where the soft metals are primarily present as lower affinity complexes with ATP, they are almost completely chelated with cysteine in Fig. 4 B. A comparison of panels A and B in Fig. 4 shows that theV max is greater when the metals are present as thiolate complexes. This effect is the most dramatic for Cd(II). The maximal activities and Km values for Pb(thiolate)2, Cd(thiolate)2, and Zn(thiolate)2 are summarized in Table I. TheKm values were typically 10–20-fold higher for the dithiolate complexes of the metals. Transport assays were performed with everted membrane vesicles prepared from pZntA-transformed LMG194 (zntA::kan) cells at pH 7.0 with 20 μm109Cd(II) in the presence and absence of cysteine (Fig. 2 B). When cysteine was absent,109Cd(II) was accumulated at very low levels and showed saturation after 2–4 min. In the presence of cysteine (thiolate present at 2-fold the concentration of Cd(II)), 109Cd(II) accumulation was >5-fold higher and increased in a linear manner during the time scale of the measurement. The pH dependence of the ATPase activity of ZntA was investigated in more detail. Fig.5 A shows the pH profiles for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) in the pH range 5.5–8.0, in the absence of thiolates. For each pH, the activities were measured at two high metal ion concentrations (100 and 200 μm), to ensure that the maximal activity was obtained. The pH profiles for Pb(II) and Zn(II) are similar, with a pH optimum of 6.0–6.5. The activities decreased rapidly below pH 6.0 and above pH 7.5. The pH profile with Cd(II) was rather different, with essentially no ATPase activity observed above pH 6.5; this result is consistent with our earlier observation that Cd(II) inhibits ZntA at pH 7.0. Fig. 5 B shows the pH profile of the ATPase activity of ZntA in the presence of Pb(thiolate)2, Cd(thiolate)2, and Zn(thiolate)2. The activities were measured at a metal cation concentration of 600 μm. At each pH, sufficient cysteine was added to maintain the thiolate ion at a 2-fold excess over the metal ion concentration. For both Pb(II) and Zn(II), the ATPase activity of ZntA was elevated when thiolates were present in the assay buffer. In the case of Cd(II), ZntA showed high levels of activity at neutral pH in the presence of thiolates, with a pH profile that closely resembled that of Zn(II). This result is in striking contrast to the total lack of activity with Cd(II) above pH 6.5 when thiolates were absent. Due to the large concentrations of cysteine that were required at low pH levels, activities were not measured below pH 6.5. Metal cations other than Cd(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) were tested in the presence and absence of thiolates for their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of purified ZntA. The “hard” metals, Ca(II), Na(I), and Ba(II), were ineffective at stimulating any ATPase activity. The “soft” metals, Co(II), Ni(II), Cr(III), Cu(I), Cu(II), SbO2− and AsO2−, also did not show any ATPase activity. Surprisingly, ZntA displayed Hg(II)-induced ATPase activity at pH 7.0 in the presence of added thiolates. In the absence of added thiolates, Hg(II) is a potent inhibitor of the coupled assay system used in this study; hence, the Hg(II) activity of ZntA was not characterized in detail. However, 100 μmHg(thiolate)2 stimulated the ATPase activity of ZntA to the same extent as 100 μm Cd(thiolate)2 at pH 7.0, indicating that Hg(II) is at least as effective as Cd(II). It is to be noted that wild-type E. coli and thezntA-disrupted strain showed similar levels of sensitivity to Hg(II), suggesting that ZntA does not contribute to Hg(II) resistance in E. coli (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Soft metal transporting P-type ATPases, presently numbering more than 30 pumps, are a rapidly growing subgroup of the large family of P-type ATPases. With the discovery of the human Menkes and Wilson disease-associated proteins, which are responsible for copper uptake and homeostasis (5.Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 6.Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), much attention has been focused on these ATPases. ATP-dependent transport of metal cations has been demonstrated for both the Cu(I) and Zn(II)/Cd(II) pumps (8.Solioz M. Odermatt A. J. Biol.

The soft metal ATPases have a distinctive metal-binding motif in the amino-terminal domain. Recently, the ability of the isolated NH2-terminal domains of the Menkes and Wilson disease-related proteins to bind metal ions have been shown (16.Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T.

Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The formation of a phosphorylated intermediate has been shown for CopB from E. hirae, CadA from S. aureus, and recently for the Menkes protein (21.Wyler-Duda P. Solioz M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Tsai K.J. Lynn A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31.Solioz M. Camakaris J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, there have been no convincing reports of soft metal cation-dependent ATPase activity for the P1-type ATPases. CopB from E. hirae is the only other soft metal ATPase that has been purified. Very low levels of ATPase activity were measured for CopB; however, it showed no stimulation of activity upon addition of Cu(I) (21.Wyler-Duda P. Solioz M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that microsomes from mouse liver contain a P-type ATPase. The microsomes also exhibit copper and iron-stimulated ATPase activity (22.Takeda K. Ushimaru M. Fukushima Y. Kawamura M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the optimal ATPase activity obtained was rather low, ∼16 nmol/(mg·min); this activity could not be assigned to a specific protein. ZntA, the product of o732, is one of two soft metal translocating ATPases in E. coli. ZntA was previously shown to confer bacterial resistance toward toxic concentrations of Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13.Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Everted membrane vesicles were shown to catalyze ATP-dependent transport of 65Zn(II) and 109Cd(II). Our objectives in this study were to expresszntA under a heterologous promoter, purify the protein, and characterize its soft metal-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity. An ATPase assay on purified ZntA would be a convenient and quantitative way to study the mechanism of the P1-type ATPases. In this work, we report the expression of histidyl-tagged ZntA in a functional form under control of the tightly regulatedaraBAD promoter in a zntA-disrupted strain. The expressed ZntA was solubilized from membranes with Triton X-100 and purified to homogeneity on an affinity column. Purified, detergent-soluble ZntA showed ATPase activity that was dependent on the presence of Mg(II) as well as divalent soft metal cations. The maximal activity obtained was ∼3 μmol/(mg·min) in the presence of a Pb(II)-thiolate complex; in the absence of soft metal, the activity was ∼10-fold lower. This is the first demonstration of high levels of soft metal-stimulated ATPase activity for a purified P1-type ATPase. ZntA hydrolyzed ATP only in the presence of Mg(II); theK m for MgATP was ∼110 μm. Pb(II) and Zn(II) stimulated the ATPase activity at neutral pHs, with the Pb(II)-dependent activity being ∼4-fold higher than that of Zn(II) at optimal pH. The Km values for Pb(II) and Zn(II) were very similar, 5–10 μm; theseKm values reflect those of the ATP complexes of Pb(II) and Zn(II). Thus, ZntA is more efficient as a Pb(II)-ATPase than a Zn(II)-ATPase. Surprisingly, Cd(II) appeared to inhibit ZntA above pH 6.0; however, Cd(II)-thiolate complexes protected this inhibition and also stimulated the ATPase activity. For Pb(II) and Zn(II), the activity was 3–4-fold higher for thiolate complexes of these metals; for Cd(II), this effect was much more dramatic in that no activity was observed for the non-thiolate complex of Cd(II) above pH 6.5. A 1:2 complex of metal cation to thiolate was the most efficient substrate at pH 7.0. The only other metal that stimulated the ATPase activity of ZntA was Hg(II); the dithiolate complex of Hg(II) was as effective as those of Zn(II) and Cd(II) at neutral pH. No activity was observed with Cu(I) or Cu(II) in the presence or absence of thiolates. Our data thus indicate that ZntA is a divalent soft metal cation ATPase, as opposed to the bacterial and eukaryotic Cu-ATPases that have been shown to transport Cu(I) and Ag(I), and are, therefore,monovalent soft metal cation ATPases (2.Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 3.Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). ZntA is specific for four soft metals, Pb(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II), with the highest activity obtained in the presence of a dithiolate complex of Pb(II). High levels of ATPase activity of purified ZntA were obtained only when the enzyme was reduced with dithiothreitol prior to assays. This indicates that ZntA is easily oxidized on exposure to air; the oxidized enzyme is not active. This observation, together with the presence of the conserved CXXC motif in the amino-terminal and CPC motif in the transmembrane regions of many P1-type ATPases, suggests that one or both of these cysteine pairs may be easily oxidized to cystines in air-saturated buffers, and that the reduced form is essential for activity. Although ZntA mediates resistance of E. coli to Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II), Cd(II) inhibited the enzyme at physiological pHs in the absence of thiolates. This inhibition could be the result of Cd(II) forming a strong dead-end complex with one or more cysteines in ZntA. Cd(II) has a stronger affinity for sulfur ligands than Pb(II) and Zn(II); this may explain why no inhibition was observed with free Zn(II) or Pb(II). Thiolate complexes of Cd(II) and Hg(II) were able to stimulate the ATPase activity of ZntA at neutral pHs; for Zn(II) and Pb(II), the ATPase activities were 3–4-fold higher in the presence of thiolate complexes compared with the lower affinity complexes with ATP. Physiologically, the concentrations of the free soft metal ions are expected to be very low; it has been recently suggested that free intracellular Cu(I) in yeast is negligible (32.Rae T.D. Schimdt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The divalent soft metals, Pb(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II), are likely to be present inside cells as complexes of glutathione or may be tightly bound to as yet unidentified “chaperone” proteins similar to those for Cu(I) (32.Rae T.D. Schimdt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 33.Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schimdt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that the physiological substrates for the ATPase activity of ZntA are the metal thiolate complexes. ZntA as well as CadA from S. aureus, a close homolog of ZntA, mediate resistance to Pb(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) (12.Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13.Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that CadC, the transcriptional regulator of CadA, responds to soft metal cations in the order Pb(II) > Cd(II) > Zn(II) (13.Rensing C. Sun Y. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32614-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that soft metal complexes stimulate the ATPase activity of ZntA in the order Pb(II) > Cd(II) ∼ Zn(II) ∼ Hg(II). These observations suggest that the primary physiological function of ZntA, CadA, and their close homologs is to mediate bacterial resistance to the highly toxic metals, Pb(II) and Cd(II). A putative eukaryotic ZntA homolog has been identified in A. thaliana, suggesting that plants may employ similar resistance mechanisms. Mammalian ZntA homologs may exist, although none has been identified yet. In conclusion, ZntA from E. coli has been expressed, solubilized, and purified. ZntA shows high levels of soft metal cation-dependent ATPase activity specifically with Pb(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), and Hg(II), with the highest activity obtained in the presence of Pb(II). With a purification protocol established, as well as transport and ATPase assays optimized, ZntA is an ideal system to study the mechanisms of soft metal recognition and transport in the P1-ATPases. While this manuscript was in press, an article by J. Okkeri and T. Haltia was ptblished describing the overexpression of ZntA in E. coli and its soft metal-stimulated ATPase activity in membrane fractions (1999) (Biochemistry 38, 14109–14116). Our results are in qualitative agreement with those presented in this article; however, the metal specificity of purified ZntA that we have described here is slightly different from that of ZntA in membrane fractions as shown by these authors. This discrepancy may be due to the presence of the second soft metal P-type ATPase of E. coli in their membrane preparations. We have recently shown that this second ATPase is a Cu(I)/Ag(I)-transporting ATPase (Rensing, C., Fan, B., Sharma, R., Mitra, B. & Rosen, B. P. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press)."

By cloning the hamster ortholog of NPC1, we identified the molecular lesions in two independently isolated Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants, CT60 and CT43. Both mutants lead to premature translational terminations of the NPC1 protein. Transfecting hamster NPC1cDNA complemented the defects of the mutants. Investigation of the CT mutants, their parental cells, and an NPC1-stable transfectant allow us to present evidence that NPC1 is involved in a post-plasma membrane cholesterol-trafficking pathway. We found that the initial movement of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol to the plasma membrane (PM) did not require NPC1. After reaching the PM and subsequent internalization, however, cholesterol trafficking back to the PM did involve NPC1. Both LDL-derived cholesterol and cholesterol originating from the PM accumulated in a dense, intracellular compartment in the CT mutants. Cholesterol movement from this compartment to the PM or endoplasmic reticulum was defective in the CT mutants. Our results functionally distinguish the dense, intracellular compartment from the early endocytic hydrolytic organelle and imply that NPC1 is involved in sorting cholesterol from the intracellular compartment back to the PM or to the endoplasmic reticulum.

The final cloning work involved the identification of a 300-kb human genomic DNA containing the candidate NPC1gene (7.Gu J.Z. Carstea E.D. Cummings C. Morris J.A. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Coleman K.G.

This unique DNA was identified by its ability to complement the defect of a previously isolated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cholesterol-trafficking cell mutant, CT60 (8.Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The humanNPC1 gene encodes an integral membrane protein with 1278 amino acids and contains the “sterol-sensing domain” (9.Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Watari M. Neufeld E.B. Patel S.

In mammalian cells, LDL binds to its receptor and internalizes and enters the endosomes/lysosomes for hydrolysis of the lipid cargo cholesteryl esters (12.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). It is currently believed that the movement of LDL-derived cholesterol from the hydrolytic organelle to the PM is defective in NPC cells, ultimately leading to cholesterol accumulation in the lysosomes (4.Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5.Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). More recent evidence at the microscopic level, however, illustrates that in NPC cells, cholesterol instead accumulates in the late endosomes (13.Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F. Ohno K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Incardona J.P. Strauss III, J.F. Vanier M.T. Patterson M.C. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Another study showed that in NPC-like cells, the movement of LDL-derived cholesterol from the lysosomes to the PM is not defective (15.Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18915-18922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrates a slow equilibrium between the PM and the abnormal, buoyant lysosomes present in the NPC-like cells when cells are overloaded with cholesterol. However, this study did not clearly identify at what step the cholesterol-trafficking defect may be in these NPC-like cells. The NPC1 protein may be also involved in translocating cholesterol from the PM to the ER for esterification (16.Pentchev P.G. Comley M.E. Kruth H.S. Vanier M.T. Wenger D.A. Patel S. Brady R.O. Proc.

Acta. 1995; 1254: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). How NPC1 mediates this step is not clear. Thus, based on current literature, it is not obvious what actual step(s) in the LDL cholesterol-trafficking pathway cause cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells. In this work, we used two independently isolated cholesterol-trafficking mutants defective in NPC1, an NPC1 stable transfectant and their parental cells as tools to examine the role of NPC1 in intracellular cholesterol trafficking. We then provide evidence that NPC1 is involved in post-PM cholesterol trafficking, that is NPC1 cycles cholesterol from an intracellular compartment to the PM or to the ER after, but not prior to, newly hydrolyzed LDL-derived cholesterol appears in the PM. Our results allow us to explain the discrepancies that currently exist among various laboratories.

By using the primer set (forward primer, CTGTGTTTGGTATGGAGAGTGTGGAATTGC; reverse primer, GCAGCATGTCCCCCTTTGCCGCACTTGGGG), a 2.9-kb product was subcloned intopGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced using at least three independent clones. Rapid amplification of the 5′- and 3′-cDNA ends (5′-RACE and 3′-RACE) was performed using Marathon cDNA Amplification system (CLONTECH). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from WT CHO cells using the kit from Invitrogen. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized and ligated to adaptor cDNA to serve as a template. The gene-specific 5′ end primer (GCCGAAGAAGAATCCTGGGCAGAGTTCC) and 3′ end primer (CTCTACAACGCCACTCACCAGTTTTGC) were employed to generate the 5′- and 3′-RACE products, respectively. The amplified products were sequenced using three independent clones. The full-length hamsterhmNPC1 cDNA sequence has been submitted to GenBankTM. For transfection studies, the full-lengthhmNPC1 cDNA was released from the pGEM vector with EagI and SpeI. This cDNA fragment was then inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3(Invitrogen) linearized with NotI and XbaI. The expression construct was named phmNPC1. cDNA covering the coding region ofhmNPC1 was divided into five overlapping regions (size averaging 1.0 kb) and was amplified by PCR. The primer sets used were as follows (forward and reverse, respectively): set 1, GGTGGACGGCAAGCAGAACCGCGGTCGGTA/TAAACATGCGTCTCAGACAGTCAT; set 2, CTGCCAGGACTGCTCCATTGTCTG/TATAGTAATTATCGACAGGGAAGG; set 3, CAAGAACTGCACCATTATAAGTGT/AGCTCTCAGAGGCCTGGATGCCT; set 4, CCCCTACAATGTTCCTTTCTTCCT/CTGGCTATTAGCCGAGCTTTCTTC; and set 5, TTTTGCAATGCTTCTGTGATTGAC/TTTCCATAATACTGCTTCACAAGTCACAGG. In addition, T7 or SP6 promoter sequences were introduced into forward or reverse primers, respectively. Non-isotopic RNase cleavage assays were performed with the Mismatch Detect II Kit according to the instruction manual supplied by Ambion. Total RNA was isolated from WT, CT60, and CT43 CHO cells, and cDNAs were synthesized to serve as templates. Each amplified region using the primer sets described above was transcribed in vitro by T7 or SP6 polymerase to generate sense or antisense RNA. The resulting RNA from the same region was cross-hybridized. Hybridized RNA containing the mutation was subject to cleavage by RNase and was identifiable by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel. Region 1 of NPC1 RNA from CT60 cells and region 4 of NPC1 RNA from CT43 cells showed susceptibility to RNase cleavage; mutations within these regions were identified by sequencing PCR products corresponding to these regions. Cells in 6-well dishes at 50–60% confluency were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transiently co-transfected with 2 μg of DNA/well of phmNPC1 or empty vectorpcDNA3, along with 0.2 μg of pEGFP-N3(CLONTECH). Candidate-stable transfectants expressing phmNPC1 were selected from the G418-resistant colonies based on the presence of cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester lipid droplets visible under a light microscope (8.Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CT43 cells do not possess such a phenotype because cholesterol is unable to reach the ER to be esterified by ACAT. Each candidate transfectant clone was subjected to four rounds of recloning. One clone, CT43NPC1, exhibited a stable phenotype and was characterized as reported here. Filipin staining was performed as described (8.Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). LDL and [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL ([3H]CL-LDL), specific radioactivity ranging between 5 and 15 μCi/mg protein, were prepared as described (8.Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After labeling, labeled cellular lipids were analyzed by TLC; the percent hydrolysis and the percent reesterification were calculated as described (8.Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For cholesterol efflux experiments, cells were incubated with 2% cyclodextrin in medium D at 37 °C for the indicated times. The media were centrifuged to remove cellular debris; labeled lipids were extracted and analyzed as described (8.Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The percent cholesterol efflux was calculated as the amount of [3H]cholesterol in medium divided by the sum of [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholesteryl oleate in cell extract and [3H]cholesterol in medium. Protein determinations were as described (22.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7142) Google Scholar). The PMs were labeled with [3H]cholesterol by using one of three methods (15.Lange Y. Ye J. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

Before labeling at 4 °C, cells were pre-chilled for 30 min. Labeled cellular lipids were analyzed as described (17.Spillane D.M. Reagan Jr., J.W. Kennedy N.J. Schneider D.L. Chang T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These were based upon previously described methods with modifications (4.Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J.

The cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) and homogenized on ice with tight-fitting, 1-ml Dounce homogenizers (Kontes); 50–100 strokes were needed to ensure extensive cell breakage. Postnuclear supernatants (800 μl) were layered onto 9 ml of 11% (v/v) Percoll in buffer A and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C) using a Beckman model 50Ti rotor. Ten fractions were collected from the top. As determined by immunoblot analysis, more than 80% of the PM marker (Na+/K+-ATPase α-1) was concentrated in fractions 1 and 2, whereas more than 80% of the late endosomal/lysosomal marker (LAMP-1) and the lysosomal marker (LAMP-2) were concentrated in fractions 9 and 10. Anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α-1 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-LAMP-1 and anti-LAMP-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. This was according to procedures described in the booklet by CLONTECH Laboratories on quantitative RT-PCR, using total RNA from 25RA, CT43, and CT43NPC1 cells. The PCR primer set, CGGGTCCACCCTGTGTACTTCGTTGTGG(f)/AGGTTAAAGATGGTGTCATCAATG(r) flanks the region deleted from CT43 NPC1 mRNA such that a shorter product (524 bp) is produced from mutant mRNA, whereas a longer product (640 bp) is produced from WT mRNA. To serve as an internal standard, a region (371 bp) of α-tubulin RNA was amplified with the primer set AGTGCACAGGTCTTCAGGGCTTCTT (f)/GGTCAACATTCAGGGCTCCATCAAA(r). To begin to characterize the CT60 and CT43 mutants at the molecular level, we determined the hmNPC1 cDNA sequence from WT CHO cells by performing RT-PCR and 5′- and 3′-RACE. hmNPC1 cDNA encodes a protein of 1277 amino acids, sharing high homology with the human and mouse NPC1 proteins (6.Carstea E.D.

The hmNPC1 mutations in CT60 and CT43 cells were located by RNase cleavage assays followed by sequencing (see “Experimental Procedures”). The CT60 mutant contains a Cys to Thr mutation at nucleotide 355, causing premature translational termination after only 118 amino acids (Fig.1 A). Previous studies indicate that the NPC1 protein cannot be detected in CT60 cells by immunoblot analysis (24.Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Glick J.M. Patel S. Neufeld E.B. Brady R.O.

The CT43 mutant contains a mutation that causes a 116-bp deletion from nucleotides 2796 to 2911 in exon 19 (26.Morris J.A. Zhang D. Coleman K.G. Nagel J. Pentchev P.G. Carstea E.D. Biochem. Biophys.

Based on recent functional analysis on human NPC1 (9.Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Watari M. Neufeld E.B. Patel S. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol.

The mutation analyses along with the RT-PCR result (Fig. 6 A) indicate that both CT60 and CT43 mutants contain only one NPC1 allele at the RNA level. Additional results show that the parental cell line (25RA) from which the CT mutants were derived contain a normal NPC1 allele (data not shown).Figure 6Stable expression of hmNPC1 at low levels partially restores the intracellular cholesterol-trafficking defects in the CT43 mutant. A,RT-PCR amplification involved 15–40 cycles as indicated. The WThmNPC1 band (640 bp) and the mutant hmNPC1 band (524 bp) are marked. B–E, 25RA, CT43neo+, and CT43NPC1 were grown as described in Fig. 2. Cells were treated with protocol A for B and C, incubated immediately with 2% CD for 30 min to determine percentage of cholesterol efflux (B), or chased in medium D at 37 °C for 8 h then incubated with 2% CD for 30 min to determine percentage of cholesterol efflux (C). Results are representative of two experiments. For D, cells were treated with protocol B, chased for 6–8 h at 37 °C, and then analyzed for percent reesterification. Values are the combined results of three independent experiments. For E, cells were labeled with [3H]CH/PC liposome, incubated in medium D at 37 °C for 14–18 h, and then analyzed for percent esterification. Values are the combined results of four experiments. Error bars indicate sizes of 1 S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One distinguishing feature of the NPC phenotype is the inability to deliver properly LDL-derived cholesterol to various organelles within the cell, thereby leading to accumulation of free cholesterol in an acidic cellular compartment that can be stained by filipin. Filipin is a fluorescent compound that specifically binds free cholesterol. When CT60 and CT43 cells were incubated with LDL for 24 h and then stained with filipin, they exhibited a strong fluorescent intracellular staining pattern relative to their parental 25RA cells or when incubated without LDL (Fig.1 C). To quantitate NPC1 cDNA expression, we used a method previously described (24.Watari H. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Glick J.M. Patel S. Neufeld E.B. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar): co-transfecting CT43 cells with the constructs phmNPC1, which expresses WT NPC1, andpEGFP-N3, which expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP), resulted in the disappearance of filipin staining in a significant portion of GFP-expressing cells. Co-transfecting the empty vector pcDNA3 and pEGFP-N3 failed to produce the same effect (Fig. 1, D and E). These results demonstrate that the cloned hmNPC1 cDNA is biologically active. The parental 25RA cells and CT mutants contain a gain of function mutation in the protein SCAP, rendering these cells resistant to sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation. This phenotype should not affect the general applicability of our results because we use these cells to study intracellular cholesterol trafficking, not sterol-dependent transcriptional control. To study the role of a single gene mutation (i.e. NPC1), we chose to compare directly the cholesterol trafficking activities of 25RA cells, rather than WT CHO cells, to the CT mutants. When cells are incubated with LDL at 19 °C, lipid transport from the sorting endosome to the lysosome is blocked (27.Chen C.S. Bach G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Upon warming to 37 °C, the majority of the LDL is rapidly hydrolyzed in the lysosome within 10–20 min; the free cholesterol is then available for efflux at the PM, using high density lipoprotein as an acceptor, 40–50 min later (28.Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclodextrins are compounds that can be used to monitor the flux of cholesterol through the PM of living cells. When cells are treated with cyclodextrin, PM cholesterol cannot be reinternalized into the cell interior (5.Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of these properties of cyclodextrin and considering the short time needed for cholesterol transport from the lysosome to the PM, we designed an assay in intact cells to monitor the arrival of newly hydrolyzed LDL-derived cholesterol at the PM. We used two different protocols to radiolabel cells prior to measuring cholesterol efflux with cyclodextrin at 37 °C as follows: protocol A, pulse cells with [3H]CL-LDL for 1 h at 37 °C; protocol B, pulse cells with [3H]CL-LDL for 4–5 h at 17–19 °C, allowing [3H]CL-LDL to accumulate in a pre-lysosomal compartment. To avoid continuously loading the cells with cholesterol, which may cause secondary consequences, we used cells grown in cholesterol-free media for 48 h as the starting culture and used cholesterol-free media throughout the experiments. After labeling, the cells were washed several times and immediately treated with 2% cyclodextrin at 37 °C to monitor cholesterol movement to the PM. When protocol A was used to label the cells, we found that the initial cholesterol efflux rates to the PM for 25RA and CT60 cells were essentially identical (Fig.2 A). Control experiments showed that the presence of cyclodextrin was necessary to cause significant cholesterol efflux (Fig. 2 A). We next performed similar experiments, using 25RA and CT43 cells, but inspected earlier time points after the short pulse period. Again, w"
https://openalex.org/W2012526549,"The classical cadherins (e.g. N-, E-, and P- cadherin) are well established homophilic adhesion molecules; however, the mechanism that governs cadherin specificity remains contentious. The classical cadherins contain an evolutionarily conserved His-Ala-Val (HAV) sequence, and linear peptides harboring this motif are capable of inhibiting a variety of cadherin-dependent processes. We now demonstrate that short cyclic HAV peptides can inhibit N-cadherin function. Interestingly, the nature of the amino acids that flank the HAV motif determine both the activity and specificity of the peptides. For example, when the HAV motif is flanked by a single aspartic acid, which mimics the natural HAVD sequence of N-cadherin, the peptide becomes a much more effective inhibitor of N-cadherin function. In contrast, when the HAV motif is flanked by a single serine, which mimics the natural HAVS sequence of E-cadherin, it loses its ability to inhibit the N-cadherin response. Our results demonstrate that subtle changes in the amino acids that flank the HAV motif can account for cadherin specificity and that small cyclic peptides can inhibit cadherin function. An emerging role for cadherins in a number of pathological processes suggests that the cyclic peptides reported in this study might be developed as therapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2011682300,"Pex5p, a receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins with a type 1 peroxisome targeting signal (PTS1), has been proposed to cycle from the cytoplasm to the peroxisomal membrane where it docks with Pex14p and Pex13p, the latter an SH3 domain-containing protein. Using in vitro binding assays we have demonstrated that binding of Pex5p to Pex14p is enhanced when Pex5p is loaded with a PTS1-containing peptide. In contrast, Pex5p binding to Pex13p, which involves only the SH3 domain, occurs at 20–40-fold lower levels and is reduced when Pex5p is preloaded with a PTS1 peptide. Pex14p was also shown to bind weakly to the Pex13p SH3 domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Pex13p SH3 domain attenuated binding to Pex5p and Pex14p, consistent with both of these proteins being binding partners for this domain. The SH3 binding site in Pex5p was determined to lie within a 114-residue peptide (Trp100-Glu213) in the amino-terminal region of the protein. The interaction between this peptide and the SH3 domain was competitively inhibited by Pex14p. We interpret these data as suggesting that docking of the Pex5p-PTS1 protein complex at the peroxisome membrane occurs at Pex14p and that the Pex13p SH3 domain functions as an associated component possibly involved in sequestering Pex5p after relinquishment of the PTS1 protein cargo to components of the translocation machinery.

Peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS)1 type 1 consists of a tripeptide sequence (Ser-Lys-Leu, or conserved variant) at the extreme carboxyl terminus and is utilized by the majority of matrix proteins (1.Gould S.J.

The recent finding that the amino-terminal region of Pex13p binds Pex7p (13.Girzalsky W. Rehling P. Stein K. Kipper J. Blank L. Kunau W.-H. Erdmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1151-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) is one possible explanation for this effect. Pex14p, a peripheral membrane protein on the cytoplasmic surface of the peroxisome, has also been shown to bind Pex7p, a finding implicating it as a docking protein for this receptor (14.Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W.,J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Pex14p has also been shown to bind Pex5p and also weakly to the Pex13p SH3 domain. Another peroxisomal peripheral membrane protein, Pex17p, is also involved in these import pathways and has been shown to associate with Pex14p (15.Huhse B. Rehling P. Albertini M. Blank L. Meller K. Kunau W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, Pex13p and Pex14p represent putative convergence points for the two import pathways and provide initial direct evidence of a common translocation machinery for PTS1 and PTS2 proteins. Despite these important findings, many elements of the import mechanisms remain unknown. In particular, the different roles of the proteins implicated in docking Pex5p at the peroxisome membrane have not been resolved. Thus, Pex13p and Pex14p may compete for binding of Pex5p or form part of a protein import cascade in which a receptor-cargo protein complex moves from one component to another (14.Albertini M.

A clarification of the interactions among Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex14p is therefore warranted, and in this paper we report on molecular analyses that address these questions. On the basis of the findings presented, we propose a revised model for the interactions of Pex5p, Pex13p, and Pex14p in the PTS1 import pathway. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using EXPAND DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Pacific Oligos (Australia) or Bresatec (Adelaide, Australia). [35S]Methionine was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckingham Shire, U. K.) or Bresatec. Peptides were synthesized by Chiron Technologies (Melbourne, Australia). DNA fragments corresponding to Pex13p amino acids Pro276-Pro348, Pro276-Thr380, and His252-Thr380 were generated via PCR using the following primer pairs A: 5′-GGGGATCCCACGAAGTTGGAGTT-3′ and 5′-GCGAATATGCGGCCGCGGGTCGTTGATGTCGTTCAATG-3′, B: 5′-GGGGATCCCACGAAGTTGGAGTT-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCGAGTAGTTAGCTATTTAGCTATTATG-3′, C: 5′-GGGGATCCTTCATCTTGCTGACACCAGTCAAAATGAATGG-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCGAGTAGTTAGCTATTTAGCTATTATG-3′, respectively, with the vector template pDC120. pDC120 contains the entire PEX13open reading frame as a PvuII-HindIII fragment cloned between the EcoRV-HindIII sites of theHIS4+-Escherichia coli-P. pastorisshuttle vector pSG934 (10.Gould S.J.

Genet. 1994; 26: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments, which were constructed to include a terminal 5′-BamHI site and 3′-NotI site (A) or a 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-XhoI site (B and C), were then cloned into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-5x-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting GST fusion constructs were designated GST-SH3, GST-SH3-COOH, and GST-MSH3-COOH, respectively. The construction of the fusion protein between GST and the human Pex13p SH3 domain has been described previously (10.Gould S.J. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. Bjorkman J. Urquhart A.J. Crane D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment, incorporating the entire P. pastoris PEX14 open reading frame, was generated by a SalI-NotI restriction digest of the plasmid pJL59/pp14F1. 2S. J. Gould, manuscript in preparation. This fragment was then cloned between the XhoI and NotI sites of pGEX-5x-3, creating pGST-PEX14. The GST fusion plasmids were electroporated into electrocompetent DH10BE. coli cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a GenePulser (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then plated onto LB agar (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in order to select for successful transformants. Positive constructs were identified via restriction enzyme digest and confirmed by direct sequencing using dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. GST fusion proteins were expressed by seeding 1-liter overnight cultures of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin with DH10B cells harboring the relevant plasmid, to an absorbance at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.05. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.5, at which point expression of the GST fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalctopyranoside (Progen Industries, Brisbane, Australia). Cells were grown for a further 3 h, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in GST lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 10% ethylene glycol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and frozen at −20 °C. The suspensions were thawed and sonicated, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (30 min at 12,000 ×g) and mixed gently for 1 h at room temperature with 1 ml of GSH resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The lysate/resin mixes were loaded into a column and washed with approximately 40 ml of lysis buffer. The GST fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm glutathione and stored at −80 °C until required. The purity of fusion proteins was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The point mutations E291K, E291Q, E296K, and E296Q were generated by degenerate oligonucleotide mutagenesis of the Pex13p-encoding plasmid pDC120. The following oligonucleotides were used to generate PCR products, incorporating the point mutations, from the template pDC120: 5′-GACGGGCCCTTTACGATTTCAATCCTAAGAATGAAG-3′ and 5′-GACGGGCCCTTTACGATTTCAATCCTCAGAATGAAG-3′, which incorporate a 5′-ApaI site and the point mutations E291K and E291Q, respectively; 5′-GCGGAGCTCACCTCTAGCAAGTTTAAGCTTCATTTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GCGGAGCTCACCTCTAGCAAGTTTCAGCTGCATTTCTTC-3′, which incorporate a 5′-SacI site and the point mutations E296K and E296Q, respectively; 5′-GAGAAGAAGTCGAAAGGACACAGTATTTTCGAAGGG-3′ (for E291K/Q) and 5′-GAAACGAATCATGGGCAAGTTGATGGG-3′ (for E296K/E296Q). The fragments were digested with ApaI and HindIII (for E291K/E291Q) or SacI and EcoRI (for E296K/E296Q) and cloned into the corresponding sites of pDC120. The mutations E318K and W321LW322L were introduced into pDC120 with the Gene Editor site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) using the oligonucleotides 5′-CCAACCAGAAGTCTACTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGAGTCTACTTTGTTGAAATGCAGAACTCGGG-3′, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing. GST fusion constructs incorporating these mutations were prepared by the procedure used for the generation of GST-SH3, as described above. Electrocompetent P. pastoris pex13Δ,his4Δ yeast (10.Gould S.J. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. Bjorkman J. Urquhart A.J. Crane D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was electroporated with site-directed mutants of PEX13 in the plasmid pDC120, using a Gene Pulser Electroporater (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transformed yeast was plated onto SSD agar plates (1m sorbitol, 1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose, 20 g/liter bacteriological agar) to select for HIS+ transformants, which were subsequently tested for their ability to grow in minimal media containing methanol, SM (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco Laboratories), 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, 0.5% methanol) (17.Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pJEK4-3, encoding the entire PEX5 open reading frame, has been described previously (18.Dodt G. Braverman N. Wong C. Moser A. Moser H.W. Watkins P. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). pJEK5–4ΔNP8, encoding amino acids 206–576 (STOP) of Pex5p was created by deletion mutagenesis of pJEK4-3. pAU203 (encoding amino acids 1–108) was created by digesting pJEK4-3 with NcoI andEcoRI and then ligating the vector remnant, creating a STOP codon directly after the NcoI-EcoRI ligation site. pAU206(56–576) was created by PCR using the 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-CCCCGCGGGAATGGAAAGGCAGCAAATG-3′), with a 5′-KspI site, and a 3′-oligonucleotide (5′-GCAACCATGGGATCCTTCAT-3′), with a 5′-NcoI site. The PCR product was then cloned into pJEK4-3 between the KspI andNcoI sites. The primers used to generate DNA fragments for the following constructs were: pAU201(1–266), 5′-GTGCCGCGGGAAGTAATCC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAGTATTCTCCGTAATTGAGCC-3′; pAU202(110–266), 5′-TCCCCGCGGCCCATGGTTGCAAACGCTCCATCTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAGTATTCTCCGTAATTGAGCC-3′; pAU205(1–55), 5′-GTGCCGCGGGAAGTAATCC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCATGGGGACATGGTACTTTCATTTC-3′; pAU207(56–266), 5′-CCCCGCGGGAATGGAAAGGCAGCAAATG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAGTATTCTCCGTAATTGAGCC-3′; pAU208(1–99), 5′-GTGCCGCGGGAAGTAATCC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAGCTATTGTTTGCTACTTGCTG-3′; pAU210(56–127), 5′-CCCCGCGGGAATGGAAAGGCAGCAAATG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAGTTAGTTGATTGAACAGGTG-3′; pAU211(100–213), 5′-CCCCGCGGGATGGAACCAAGAGTTTCGAATG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCATTCTTGGGTTTTACTGTTCAAC-3′; pAU212(100–195), 5′-CCCCGCGGGATGGAACCAAGAGTTTCGAATG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCATTGTGTCTGTGATTGTTCTG-3′; and pAU213(100–174), 5′-CCCCGCGGGATGGAACCAAGAGTTTCGAATG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAACGGTTCATGCTCCCGC-3′. In each case, the plasmid pJEK4-3 was used as a template for PCR, the 5′-oligonucleotide contained a 5′-KspI site and the 3′-oligonucleotide a 5′-STOP codon followed by an EcoRI site. The PCR fragments were cloned between the KspI and EcoRI sites of pJEK4-3. pAU401 was created by PCR amplification of the entire PEX14open reading frame from the plasmid pJL59/pp14F1 using the 5′-oligonucleotide 5′-CAACTGCAGATGATATTCTGGATTCTTAGGCTATC-3′, with a 5′-PstI site, and the 3′-oligonucleotide 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACAACTCAGCTTTGAGCTGCC-3′, with a 5′-BamHI site. The DNA fragment was then cloned between thePstI and sites of the mammalian expression vector pSP64 poly(A) (Promega). All constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing as described above. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were created by coupled in vitro transcription and translation using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate TnT® SP6 expression system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Dot blots were performed using a vacuum manifold to immobilize 0.2 nmol of GST fusion protein to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). A negative control of no protein was used to monitor background binding. The nitrocellulose was then blocked for 2 h at room temperature using TBST (137 mmNaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20) or TBS (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 10% w/v skimmed milk powder (BLOTTO). After blocking, immobilized proteins were probed (overnight at 4 °C) with 35S-labeled protein in 1 ml of 10% BLOTTO. The blots were then washed in TBST or TBS (4 × 5 min) and dried at room temperature. At this stage, some of the dried membranes were exposed overnight to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and bound radioactivity determined using densitometry and the analysis software NIH Image, version 1.61. To quantify the level of binding between the various GST fusions and35S-labeled protein, individual dots were cut from the dried nitrocellulose and placed in 10 ml of ACS or BCS scintillation fluid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radioactivity was determined using a 2000CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (United Technologies Packard). When comparing the degree of binding of different35S-labeled proteins, equivalent mol of protein were used as determined by methionine labeling using the TnT® SP6 expression system (Promega). Briefly, in triplicate measurements, 2 μl of coupled transcription/translation reaction product was added to 98 μl of 1 m NaOH and 2% H202, vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. 900 μl of ice-cold 25% trichloroacetic acid and 2% amino acid mixture was added and the mix incubated on ice for 30 min to precipitate the translation product. 250 μl of the trichloroacetic acid/protein mix was then vacuum filtered onto GF/C filter paper (Whatman, Maidstone, U. K.) pre-wet with 5% trichloroacetic acid; the filter was rinsed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with 1 ml of acetone and then dried at room temperature. Dry filter paper was then placed in 10 ml of scintillation fluid and counted, as above, and the results used to determine mol of protein (based on methionine content) for use in dot blot assays as well as the relative molar binding levels. Competitive binding between radiolabeled Pex5p and unlabeled Pex5p for membrane-immobilized GST-SH3 was tested by adding a constant volume (30 μl) of 35S-labeled Pex5p with various molar ratios (up to 90 μl) of unlabeled Pex5p, both created by in vitrotranscription/translation, in 1 ml of TBST BLOTTO. Competitive binding between Pex5p and the Trp100-Glu213 peptide for membrane-immobilized GST-SH3 was tested by adding a constant volume (15 μl) of 35S-labeled Pex5p with various molar ratios (up to 50 μl) of unlabeled Trp100-Glu213 peptide, both created by in vitro transcription/translation, in 1 ml of TBST BLOTTO. Competitive binding between the Trp100-Glu213 peptide and Pex14p for membrane-immobilized GST-SH3 was tested by adding a constant volume (10 μl) of 35S-labeled Trp100-Glu213peptide with various molar ratios (up to 50 μl) of unlabeled Pex14p, created by in vitro transcription/translation, in 1 ml of TBST BLOTTO. In all cases, membrane-bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For all competitive binding assays, the amount of unlabeled translation product was approximated from molar calculations of duplicate in vitro transcription/translation reactions in which products were labeled with [35S]methionine, as above. The specificity of binding of a PTS1-containing peptide to Pex5p was tested by conjugating the peptide CRYHLKPLQSKL (which contains the SKL PTS1 signal) or CRYHLKPLQLKS (a control peptide lacking the signal) to SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce, Rockford, IL), according to the manufacturer's protocol. 25 μl of gel conjugate was then mixed with 35 μl of TBST buffer and 15 μl of either 35S-labeled Pex5p or 35S-labeled Pex14p, or 15 μg of purified GST-SH3 fusion protein, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the mixtures were pelleted by centrifugation to yield a supernatant and gel pellet. The gel pellet was washed four times with 1 ml of TBST and resuspended in a final volume of 50 μl of TBST. Proportional volumes of supernatant and pellet were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, and GST-SH3 was detected by Western analysis using a rabbit anti-SH3 antibody (10.Gould S.J. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. Bjorkman J. Urquhart A.J. Crane D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The effect of PTS1 peptide loading of Pex5p was determined using these same peptides. 50 μl of 35S-labeled Pex5p, created using coupled in vitro transcription/translation, was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with a 60 μm concentration of either peptide (19.Fransen M. Terlecky S.R. Subramani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in 1 ml of TBS BLOTTO. These mixtures were then used to probe various membrane-immobilized GST fusion constructs, as described above. The technique of protein modeling by homology (20.Blundell T.L. Sibanda B.L. Sternberg M.J.E. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) was used to assign three-dimensional structure to the unknown structure of the Pex13p SH3 domain based on structural information from Fyn, another member of the SH3 domain family. The underlying principle of protein modeling by homology is that within members of a protein family there are structurally conserved regions that tend to be at the inner core of proteins where differences in peptide chain topology would have significant effects on the overall conformation of the protein (20.Blundell T.L. Sibanda B.L. Sternberg M.J.E. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Several modeled proteins have been subsequently defined by x-ray crystallography, demonstrating the success of this method (21.Amit A.G. Mariuzza R.A. Phillips S.E.V. Poljak R.J. Science. 1986; 233: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 22.Chothia C. Science. 1986; 233: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Coordinates were assigned from the crystal structure of the SH3 domain of Fyn (pdblFyn.ent) (23.Musacchio A. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) to the secondary structural regions of Pex13 protein according to the alignment shown in Fig. 6 A. All suitable loop structures were obtained by searching the Brookhaven Protein Data bank for proteins containing loops of the same length joining similar secondary structural units. All splice junctions were relaxed to a bond length of 1.34–1.37 Å and a bond angle greater than 166o. The resultant crude model was then refined by energy minimization using Biosym's consistent valence force field to a convergence criterion of less than 1.0 kcal/mol Å (maximum derivative). The accuracy of three-dimensional model was tested using the Eisenberg method (24.Eisenberg D. Wesson M. Yamashita M. Chem. Struct. 1989; 29A: 217-221Google Scholar, 25.Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar, 26.Lüthy R. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 10: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which utilizes a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the protein with the model, using a three-dimensional profile which is computed from the atomic coordinates of the structure. Each residue in the three-dimensional model is characterized by its environment, which is defined by the area of the residue side chain that is buried in the protein structure, the fraction of the side chain that is covered by polar residues, and the local secondary structure. Thus the probability of finding each amino acid in the assigned environment is calculated from a three-dimensional–one-dimensional scoring table derived from a statistical analysis of known protein structures (26.Lüthy R. McLachlan A.D. Eisenberg D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 10: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the protein is then compared with the three-dimensional profile generated from the environment classifications and gives rise to an overall profile score and a graphical presentation of the assessment (see insetgraphs for Fyn and Pex13 in Fig. 6 B). The maximum expected score for a protein is given by: S calc = exp (−0.833 + 1.008 × length), where length is the number of residues. Based on studies of all coordinate entries in the Brookhaven Data Bank derived by x-ray, NMR, and computational methods, along with a number of deliberately misfolded proteins, Eisenberg et al. (24.Eisenberg D. Wesson M. Yamashita M. Chem. Struct. 1989; 29A: 217-221Google Scholar) suggest that a cutoff of < 0.45 ×S calc is useful for identifying grossly misfolded structures. Models with profile scores between 0.45 ×S calc and S calc are considered correct, although it is still possible that locally misfolded regions occur. It is suggested the examination of profile score in a moving window scan of 10 residues is sufficient to identify locally misfolded regions. The results of previous yeast studies have demonstrated that Pex5p interacts with both Pex13p (10.Gould S.J. Kalish J.E. Morrell J.C. Bjorkman J. Urquhart A.J. Crane D.I. J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The former interaction has been proposed to occur via the SH3 domain of Pex13p. To study these interactions in detail for the P. pastoris proteins, we developed in vitro overlay binding assays in which35S-labeled “probe” proteins, generated by in vitro transcription/translation (Fig.1 A), were tested for binding to purified GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 B) immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. The validity of these binding assays was evaluated by immobilizing various amounts of purified GST-SH3 fusion protein and probing with a constant amount of Pex5p; complex formation, quantified as the amount of membrane-bound radioactivity, increased with immobilized protein in the range 0–16 μg (data not shown). In subsequent experimentation we employed approximately 8 μg (0.2 nmol) of GST fusion protein. Under these conditions, complex formation was proportional to added 35S-labeled Pex5p translation product up to the maximum volume tested of 50 μl (Fig.2 A) and was competitively inhibited by the addition of unlabeled Pex5p translation product (Fig.2 B). The inability to observe “stoichiometric” competition in this latter experiment was because saturation binding of GST-SH3 was not able to be achieved due to the prohibitively large volumes of labeled Pex5p (i.e. translation product) required. This binding interaction was saturable, however, as demonstrated in separate experiments using 2 μg of GST fusion protein (data not shown). We nevertheless chose 8 μg of GST fusion protein for the"
https://openalex.org/W2043111550,"Matrilin-3 is a recently identified member of the superfamily of proteins containing von Willebrand factor A-like domains and is able to form hetero-oligomers with matrilin-1 (cartilage matrix protein) via a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Full-length matrilin-3 and a fragment lacking the assembly domain were expressed in 293-EBNA cells, purified, and subjected to biochemical characterization. Recombinantly expressed full-length matrilin-3 occurs as monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers, as detected by electron microscopy and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas matrilin-3, purified from fetal calf cartilage, forms homotetramers as well as hetero-oligomers of variable stoichiometry with matrilin-1. In the matrix formed by cultured chondrosarcoma cells, matrilin-3 is found in a filamentous, collagen-dependent network connecting cells and in a collagen-independent pericellular network. Affinity-purified antibodies detect matrilin-3 expression in a variety of mouse cartilaginous tissues, such as sternum, articular, and epiphyseal cartilage, and in the cartilage anlage of developing bones. It is found both inside the lacunae and in the interterritorial matrix of the resting, proliferating, hypertrophic, and calcified cartilage zones, whereas the expression is lower in the superficial articular cartilage. In trachea and in costal cartilage of adult mice, an expression was seen in the perichondrium. Furthermore, matrilin-3 is found in bone, and its expression is, therefore, not restricted to chondroblasts and chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2137452601,"We have previously shown that hMSH2-hMSH6 contains an intrinsic ATPase which is activated by mismatch-provoked ADP→ATP exchange that coordinately induces the formation of a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that mismatch repair could be propagated by a signaling event transduced via diffusion of ATP-bound hMSH2-hMSH6 molecular switches to the DNA repair machinery. The Molecular Switch model (Fishel, R. (1998) Genes Dev. 12, 2096–2101) is considerably different than the Hydrolysis-Driven Translocation model (Blackwell, L. J., Martik, D., Bjornson, K. P., Bjornson, E. S., and Modrich, P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32055–32062) and makes additional testable predictions beyond the demonstration of hydrolysis-independent diffusion (Gradia, S., Subramanian, D., Wilson, T., Acharya, S., Makhov, A., Griffith, J., and Fishel, R. (1999) Mol. Cell3, 255–261): (i) individual mismatch-provoked ADP→ATP exchange should be unique and rate-limiting, and (ii) thek cat·DNA for the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity should decrease with increasing chain length. Here we have examined hMSH2-hMSH6 affinity and ATPase stimulatory activity for several DNA substrates containing mispaired nucleotides as well as the chain length dependence of a defined mismatch under physiological conditions. We find that the results are most consistent with the predictions of the Molecular Switch model. We have previously shown that hMSH2-hMSH6 contains an intrinsic ATPase which is activated by mismatch-provoked ADP→ATP exchange that coordinately induces the formation of a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that mismatch repair could be propagated by a signaling event transduced via diffusion of ATP-bound hMSH2-hMSH6 molecular switches to the DNA repair machinery. The Molecular Switch model (Fishel, R. (1998) Genes Dev. 12, 2096–2101) is considerably different than the Hydrolysis-Driven Translocation model (Blackwell, L. J., Martik, D., Bjornson, K. P., Bjornson, E. S., and Modrich, P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32055–32062) and makes additional testable predictions beyond the demonstration of hydrolysis-independent diffusion (Gradia, S., Subramanian, D., Wilson, T., Acharya, S., Makhov, A., Griffith, J., and Fishel, R. (1999) Mol. Cell3, 255–261): (i) individual mismatch-provoked ADP→ATP exchange should be unique and rate-limiting, and (ii) thek cat·DNA for the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity should decrease with increasing chain length. Here we have examined hMSH2-hMSH6 affinity and ATPase stimulatory activity for several DNA substrates containing mispaired nucleotides as well as the chain length dependence of a defined mismatch under physiological conditions. We find that the results are most consistent with the predictions of the Molecular Switch model. mismatch repair ATP hydrolysis activity base pairs adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) polymerase chain reaction hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer Mismatch repair (MMR)1is an important cellular pathway that facilitates genome stability by correcting mismatched nucleotides in DNA that arise from chemical and physical damage, replication errors, and recombination events between heteroallelic parental DNAs (for review see Ref. 6.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Mutation of several of the human MMR genes have been shown to result in a mutator phenotype and are associated with a common cancer predisposition syndrome, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), as well as a variety of sporadic tumors (7.Fishel R.

Initiation of MMR is fundamentally dependent on the prototypicalEscherichia coli MutS or its eucaryotic homologs: a highly conserved family of proteins responsible for mispair recognition (for review see Ref. 9.Fishel R. Wilson T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The bacterial MutS protein appears to recognize mispaired DNA as a homodimer, while the eucaryotic MSHs (MutShomologs) appear to function as heterodimers of MSH2 and MSH6 or MSH2 and MSH3 (10.Drummond J.T.

Like their yeast counterpart, the human hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer primarily recognizes and participates in the repair of single-base and small insertion/deletion DNA mismatches, while the hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer is associated with the repair of small and large insertion/deletion DNA mismatches (12.Acharya S.

Homology between the MutS homologs is largely based upon a highly conserved Walker-A/B adenosine nucleotide and magnesium-binding domain (3.Fishel R.

A defining observation is that binding to mismatched DNA by MutS and hMSH2-hMSH6 is abolished in the presence of ATP (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 10.Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

The ATP-induced release of E. coli MutS from mispaired DNA has been reported to occur by hydrolysis-driven translocation of the protein along the DNA backbone (4.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the appearance of growing loop structures observed by electron microscopy that depend on MutS, MutL, and ATP. Moreover, the poorly hydrolyzable analog of ATP, ATPγS, appears to block the growth of these loops, which has been interpreted to suggest a requirement for ATP hydrolysis. An alternative model for signaling MMR suggests that hMSH2-hMSH6 functions as an adenosine nucleotide-regulated molecular switch (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol.

This conclusion is grounded on the biochemical properties of the hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase and the observation that ADP and ATP have opposing effects on mispair binding. These studies have further demonstrated that: (i) the rate-limiting step for the intrinsic ATPase is mismatched nucleotide provoked ADP→ATP exchange; (ii) hMSH2-hMSH6 undergoes a conformational transition associated with ADP→ATP exchange similar to that demonstrated for G protein signaling molecules; (iii) the adenosine nucleotide conformational transition of hMSH2-hMSH6 results in the formation of an ATP-bound hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp (preincubation of hMSH2-hMSH6 with ATPγS, results in a conformation that is topologically refractory to mispair binding); and (iv) hydrolysis of ATP only occurs when hMSH2-hMSH6 dissociates or is dissociated from the DNA (thus recycling the mispair binding switch). An argument against the Molecular Switch model was recently forwarded by Blackwell et al. (5.Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and is based on the following observations: (i) a similar dissociation constant (k d) between hMSH2-hMSH6 and mismatched DNA in the presence or absence of ADP; (ii) plasmon resonance spectroscopy demonstrating ADP-induced release of hMSH2-hMSH6, which was prebound to mismatched DNA in the absence of nucleotide (albeit >10-fold slower than ATP-induced release); (iii) an ATPase “salt profile” that appeared similar to MMR and mismatch-provoked excision reactionsin vitro, and 4.) a “significant” DNA length-dependent increase in thek cat·DNA for the ATPase. It was concluded that hMSH2-hMSH6 movement along the DNA backbone occurred by a modified Hydrolysis-Driven Translocation model (5.Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J.

Quantitative measure of bacterial MMR in vitro and in vivo have shown that repair efficiency is primarily determined by the type of mispaired base (21.Su S.S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Kramer B. Kramer W. Fritz H.-J. Cell. 1984; 38: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and can be influenced by the sequence context surrounding the mispair (23.Werntges H. Steger G. Riesner D. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3773-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although genetic experiments have implicated hMSH2-hMSH6 in the repair of most single base mismatches, nearly all of the biochemical studies have focused on its interaction with G/T mismatched DNA. Here we have examined the affinity of hMSH2-hMSH6 for a variety mismatched DNA substrates as well as the extent to which these mismatched DNA substrates provoke ADP→ ATP exchange and stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity. We have additionally characterized the affinity of hMSH2-hMSH6 for ATP and examined the chain length dependence of homoduplex and mismatched DNA substrates on the hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase. Our results suggest that the rate-limiting step in hMSH2-hMSH6 initiation of MMR is tied to the ability of individual mispaired nucleotides to provoke ADP→ATP exchange. Moreover, in contrast to previous reports (19.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we observe a modest decrease in the k cat·DNA with increasing DNA chain length under physiologically significant conditions. These and other results reduce the likelihood of a Hydrolysis-Driven Translocation mechanism, while providing further support for the Molecular Switch model. The hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer was prepared and quantitated as described previously (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a 3948 Nucleic Acid Synthesis and Purification System (Applied Biosystems). Unlabeled duplex DNA substrates were made by annealing equal molar amounts of an upper strand, 5′-GCT TAG GAT CAT CGA GGA TCX AGC TCG GTG CAA TTC AGC GG-3′, to a lower strand, 5′-CCG CTG AAT TGC ACC GAG CTY GAT CCT CGA TGA TCC TAA GC-3′. For example a G/T mismatch was constructed by positioning a G in place of X in the upper strand and a T in place ofY in the lower strand. All single base pair mismatched DNA substrates followed this format. Insertion/deletion mismatched DNA substrates were constructed by annealing an upper strand 5′-GCT TAG GAT CAT CGA GGA TCG XAG CTC GGT GCA ATT CAG CGG-3′; whereX = A for (+A), X = CA for (+CA), andX = CACACACA for +(CA)4 to the lower strand, 5′-CCG CTG AAT TGC ACC GAG CTC GAT CCT CGA TGA TCC TAA GC-3′. Labeled 41-base pair DNA substrates were prepared by annealing32P end-labeled oligonucleotide to an equal molar amount of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide. Duplex DNA was purified from an 8% acrylamide gel. Excised gel slices were crushed and incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl for 12 h. Buffer containing the DNA was separated from the acrylamide using an Ultrafree-MC 0.22 μm Filter Unit (Millipore) and concentrated using a microconcentrator (Amicon). The 125-, 251-, and 501-bp heteroduplex DNA substrates were made by amplifying a region of a modified pBSK− vector containing a central G/C or A/T base pair using the Pfu polymerase in a standard PCR reaction (Stratagene). The sequence directly surrounding the G/C or A/T base pair is 5′-TCG AGC AGC TXG ATC TAG CCT-3′ where X = G or A. PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit. Equal molar amounts of G/C and A/T DNA were combined in buffer M (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTE) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, and then reannealed by cooling to 37 °C. DNA was then digested with BglII and PvuII, which cleaves only homoduplex DNA (leaving G/T or C/A heteroduplex DNA intact) (24.Fishel R.A. Kolodner R. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. New Series. 1983; 11: 309-324Google Scholar). Full-length heteroduplex DNA was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Waters Gen-Pak FAX Column (Millipore). DNA was loaded onto the column in buffer M at 0.5 ml/minute, washed 10 min with 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and then eluted with a 35 min gradient to 750 mm NaCl. Full-length heteroduplex DNA fraction typically separated 2–4 min from restricted DNA fractions. DNA was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and then quantitated by spectroscopy. DNA and ATPγS filter binding assays were performed in 25 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.8), 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol, unless otherwise indicated. The concentrations of hMSH2-hMSH6, DNA, and ATPγS are indicated in the figure legends. DNA binding assays were performed by incubating hMSH2-hMSH6 with the indicated labeled DNA substrates in the presence of 25 μm ADP at 37 °C for 15 min in a 20-μl reaction. Unlabeled competitor DNA or ATP was included in the reaction where indicated. Reactions were placed on ice, diluted with 4 ml of buffer A (which consisted of 25 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, and NaCl concentration equivalent to that of the reaction), and then were immediately filtered through a prewet Millipore HAWP nitrocellulose membrane and washed with 8 ml of buffer A. Filters were incubated overnight in scintillation fluid and quantitated using a Beckman counter. Data from the DNA competition assays were fit to the equation: Y =NS + (T − NS)/(1 + 10log[comp] − log[IC50]) as described by Motulsky (25.Motulsky H.J. Analyzing Data with Graphpad Prism. Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA1999Google Scholar) where, [comp] is the concentration of competitor,T is the total binding in the absence of competitor,NS is the binding at saturating concentration of competitor, and Y is the binding measured at various concentrations of competitor. IC50 values represent the concentration of unlabeled competitor that reduced G/T DNA binding by 50%.K i values were determined by the equationK i = IC50/(1 + ([radioligand]/K d)), where the concentration of radioligand (labeled G/T DNA) was 20 nm and theK d for hMSH2-hMSH6 binding G/T DNA was 10.5 nm. ATPγS binding assays were performed by incubating hMSH2-hMSH6 with ATPγS at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence or absence of DNA; the reactions were then analyzed by filter binding as described above. K d and B max(equivalent to the moles of substrate bound at saturation) were determined by fitting the data to a square hyperbola (25.Motulsky H.J. Analyzing Data with Graphpad Prism. Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA1999Google Scholar). ATPase assays were performed in 25 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.8), 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol, unless otherwise indicated. The concentrations of hMSH2-hMSH6 and ATP are indicated in the figure legends. For experiments shown in Fig. 3 A and Table I, the concentration of hMSH2-hMSH6 was varied so that the amount of ATP hydrolyzed remained below 15%. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the fraction of hydrolyzed [γ-32P]ATP was determined by charcoal binding as described previously (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R.

Assays were performed in 25 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, and 2 mmMgCl2. hMSH2-hMSH6 (75 nm) was incubated with 2.3 μm [3H]ADP at 25 °C for 25 min and then put on ice. DNA (93 nm) and 25 μm ATP was added to start the reaction, which was then stopped at the indicated time by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (25 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). The solution was immediately filtered on a Millipore HAWP nitrocellulose membrane and washed with 10 ml of cold stop buffer. Filters were air dried, added to 3 ml of scintillation fluid, and quantitated. The amount of ADP bound before the addition of DNA and ATP was used as the zero time point. We found that multiple filter washes (up to four) did not significantly alter (± <10%) the results. The hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimeric protein complex has been purified from human cell extracts based on its ability to restore MMR to mutant cell lines (10.Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and to specifically bind DNA containing mismatched nucleotides (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of the hMSH2-hMSH6 protein have primarily focused on its interaction with DNA containing a G/T mismatch. We examined the affinity of hMSH2-hMSH6 for the eight possible single nucleotide mispairs by gel shift analysis and found a strong bias for the G/T mispair followed by a C/A mispair (data not shown). To further quantitate these interactions, a filter binding assay was developed, and the association of hMSH2-hMSH6 with several DNA substrates containing defined mismatched nucleotides in an otherwise identical sequence context was examined (Fig.1 A). We found that none of the mismatched DNA substrates reached a level of binding saturation comparable with that of a G/T mismatch. These results suggested that the hMSH2-hMSH6 interaction(s) with mismatched DNA was complex, and simple binding studies were unlikely to be sufficient for accurate interaction comparison. Competition studies have been used to overcome complex binding activities and to gauge the relative affinity MutS homologs for mismatched DNA substrates (16.Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29993-29997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5604-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We performed a similar competition analysis in which an unlabeled DNA was tested for its ability to compete with a labeled DNA substrate containing a G/T mismatch (Fig.1 B). IC50 and K i values for these competition assays were calculated by fitting the data to a one-site competition equation (see “Materials and Methods”) and are shown in Table I. We observe a hierarchy for mispair competition in which G/T ≫ C/A > +(CA) > T/T ≈ G/C. Comparison of the K i values for each DNA substrate suggests that there is an 8-fold preference for G/T mispair binding over a C/A mispair, which was the next best competition substrate. The affinity of hMSH2-hMSH6 for homoduplex (G/C) DNA was 23-fold lower than for a DNA containing a G/T mismatch, and there appeared to be little or no discrimination between a T/T mismatch and the duplex G/C competitor substrates. Although there may be sequence context effects, several reports have suggested a hierarchy for MMR in bacteria, yeast, and human cells in vivo and in vitro in which G/T > C/A ≈ G/G ≈ +A > A/A > G/A > T/T ≈ C/T ≫ C/C (21.Su S.S.

However, there appears to be a discordance between the relative binding and repair of the C/A mismatch as well as the complete lack of discrimination between the homoduplex (G/C) DNA and the T/T mispair (which is poorly but significantly repaired) (19.Blackwell L.J.

Chem. 1999; 274 (21644): 21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have compared the ability of hMSH2-hMSH6 to binding a DNA substrate containing a G/T mismatch with an identical homoduplex (G/C) DNA substrate as a function of salt concentration (Fig. 1 C). The binding preference for a G/T mismatch at low salt appears comparable with previous observations (19.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have additionally found that the binding of homoduplex (G/C) DNA by hMSH2-hMSH6 also increases at low salt concentrations. However, the preference for mismatched DNA compared with homoduplex (G/C) DNA remains fairly constant at NaCl concentrations below 150 mm. Interestingly, the peak of MMR activity appears to occur at a salt concentration of 110–130 mm (19.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although it would appear premature to suggest that peak salt activity of a multicomponent MMR system is solely due to hMSH2-hMSH6 function (19.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the wide range of salt concentrations where mispair discrimination occurs supports the idea that mismatch binding is unlikely to be the critical function for hMSH2-hMSH6 in MMR. Previous studies have demonstrated that hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase activity requires MgCl2, is significantly stimulated by DNA containing a G/T mismatch, and is controlled by mismatched DNA provoked ADP→ATP exchange (1.Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 2.Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We have further examined the salt profile and DNA concentration dependence of the G/T mismatch-stimulated hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase (Fig. 2). Homoduplex (G/C) stimulation of hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase activity peaked at ≈65 mm, while G/T mismatched DNA peaked at ≈110 mm (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, below 65 mmand above 300 mm NaCl there appeared to be no discrimination between homoduplex (G/C) and heteroduplex (G/T) stimulation of the hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase. Interestingly, the NaCl concentrations that produce a discrimination between homoduplex (G/C) and heteroduplex (G/T) DNA for the hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase appear to closely correlate with the salt profile observed for MMR in vitro(19.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32049-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). At the salt concentration of peak ATPase activity (110 mm), a wide range of DNA concentrations (25–900 nm) appeared to provide continuous discrimination between homoduplex (G/C) and heteroduplex (G/T) DNA (Fig. 2 B). We calculated that G/T mismatched DNA stimulated hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase activity displayed ak cat·G/T DNA ≈10 min−1 andK 12·G/T DNA ≈40 nm, whereas the k cat·G/C DNA for homoduplex (G/C) was lower (≈6.4 min−1) and theK 12·G/C DNA was substantially higher (≈260 nm). Taken together these results provide a foundation for the quantitative analysis of mismatched DNA substrates that affect the hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase. We then examined the activation of the hMSH2-hMSH6 ATPase by a variety of DNA substrates (Fig. 3 A). Estimations of the apparent K m·ATP andk cat·ATP was determined by fitting the data directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation (TableII). It is interesting to note that the rate of hMSH2-hMSH6 ATP"

This work reports that intron 1 of the mouse Fas death receptor gene contains a p53-responsive element (p53RE) that matches the p53 consensus sequence and that is located between nucleotides +1704 and +1723 from the transcription initiation site. This element is specifically bound by p53 and functions as a p53-dependent enhancer in mammalian or in yeast reporter gene assays. Contrary to bax, another known pro-apoptotic p53-target gene, both mouse and human FASp53REs are still activated by the discriminatory p53 mutants Pro-175 and Ala-143, a class of mutants unable to induce apoptosis. We propose that p53-dependent up-regulation of Fas does not induce apoptosis per se but sensitizes the cell to other pro-apoptotic signal(s). The functional conservation of p53-dependent Fas up-regulation argues strongly in favor of its biological importance and suggests that murine models may be used to study further the in vivo role of Fas in the p53 response. p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that induces apoptosis at least in part through its ability to act as a sequence-specific transactivator.

Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4465) Google Scholar), mainly by mediating cell cycle checkpoints and/or apoptosis after genotoxic stresses, thereby allowing reparation or elimination of altered cells (4.Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms through which wild type (wt)1 p53 acts have not yet been completely identified. However, an essential aspect of p53 function depends on its activity as a transcription factor (5.Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner through an inter-species conserved central “core” domain (7.Kern S.E.

Biol. 1996; 260: 623-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Most of the mutations in the p53 gene found in tumors affect this core domain, underscoring the importance of DNA binding and transactivation in its role as a tumor suppressor (9.Cho Y. Gorina S.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One of the well characterized p53 target genes is WAF1, which encodes the 21-kDa inhibitor (p21) of cyclin-dependent kinases and appears to be an essential effector of p53-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest after genotoxic stress (15.Brugarolas J.

Pathways leading to p53-dependent apoptosis are less well understood. Several p53 target genes potentially implicated in this process have been characterized, namely h-BAX, h-IGFBP3, h-PIG3, and more recently h-FAS (18.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19.Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N.

Krammer P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The protein products of h-BAX and h-FAS are directly implicated in apoptosis; BAX acts as an antagonist to the pro-survival protein Bcl2, and FAS is a cell surface receptor that contains a “Death Domain” in its cytoplasmic part and is able to trigger an apoptotic program after activation. For both proteins, a partial requirement for full p53-dependent apoptosis has been shown in some models (21.Müller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L.

Implication of PIG3 and IGFBP3 in p53-dependent apoptosis has been proposed but not demonstrated. It is therefore difficult to assign a precise role for each of these genes during p53-dependent apoptosis. Several p53 mutants that have lost apoptotic but not cell-cycle arrest function have been described (28.Rowan S. Ludwig R.L. Haupt Y. Lu X. Oren M. Vousden K.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 29.Ryan K.M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3692-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these mutants, so-called discriminatory mutants, present a differential ability to transactivate target cellular promoters; they retain the ability to activate the expression of WAF1 but fail to activateBAX or IGFBP3 p53RE (29.Ryan K.M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3692-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 30.Ludwig R.L. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, these mutants are unique molecular tools to study the implication of p53 target genes in apoptosis. We were interested in studying the involvement of Fas during p53-dependent apoptosis. At the beginning of this work, Fas was not yet characterized as a direct target of p53, and we therefore looked for a p53-responsive element (p53RE) in the mouse Fas gene. We then employed p53 discriminatory mutants to characterize further the p53-dependent regulation of Fas. We report here that, like its human counterpart, the murine Fas gene contains a functional p53RE located in the first intron. In addition, we show that p53 discriminatory mutants are able to activateFas p53RE in contrast to p53REs derived from other pro-apoptotic genes, suggesting a distinct function of theFas gene in the course of p53-dependent apoptosis. A C3H/He mouse genomic DNA library (32.Tsuchiya M. Kaziro Y. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was screened under high stringency conditions (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a DNA fragment carrying the mouse Fas cDNA. A recombinant DNA (λMF8S) that contains the 5′ part of the Fas gene was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene). Two plasmids were further used as follows: pMFS8-1X that contains an XhoI DNA fragment encompassing exon 1 (approximately from nucleotide −4500 to +3900 starting from the transcription initiation site) and pMFS8-2X that contains the 3′ adjacent part of the intron 1 (from nucleotide +3900 to +10,000). All cells were routinely maintained in a water-saturated 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. All media used were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% of penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). M1-S6 (expressing no p53) and the derived cell line M1-LTR13 (expressing the mouse thermosensible (ts) Val-135 p53 mutant) were maintained at 38 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). H1299 (expressing no p53) and SAOS-Val-135 (expressing the mouse ts Val-135 p53 mutant) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 and 38 °C, respectively. Actinomycin D was purchased from Sigma, and human interleukin-6 (IL-6) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Total cellular RNAs were extracted using the Trizol LS reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Electrophoresis and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (34.May E. Mouriesse H. May-Levin F. Contesso G. Delarue J. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1037-1042PubMed Google Scholar). A 0.9-kbEcoRI-BamHI DNA fragment corresponding to the cDNA of the mouse Fas gene and a 1.3-kb PstI cDNA fragment corresponding to the rat GAPDH gene were used as probes for Northern blot analysis. The relative level of the hybridization signal of specific mRNAs was evaluated with a Bio-Rad GS 363 molecular imager. Plasmids were constructed using standard procedures (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequences were determined using a T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The transcription reporter plasmid used in this study is pLGΔ178 (35.Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It contains theURA3 gene, the yeast 2-μm replication origin, and thelacZ gene under control of a truncated CYC1promoter. A unique XhoI site located just upstream of the promoter allows the cloning of DNA fragments to test them for p53-dependent transactivation. The following pairs of oligonucleotides were used to clone the core of the different putative p53REs: for p53RE A: Aa, TCGATGACATGTTTGTACATGCCC and Ab, TCAGGGGCATGTACAAACATGTAC; for p53RE B: Ba, TCGAGAGCTTGCTCTGTCTCGCTTGTCC and Bb, TCGAGGACAAGCGAGACAGAGCAAGCTC; for p53RE C: Ca, TCGAAACCAAGCTTCTGACTTGACT and Cb, TCGAAGTCAAGTCAGAAGCTTGGTT; for p53RE D1: D1a, TCGAGGGCAAGTCCAGCTTCTGAGTAAGAACACGTCT and D1b, TCGAAGACGTGTTCTTACTCAGAAGCTGGACTTGCCC; and for p53RE D2: D2a, TCGAGGACTTGCCCAACACCATGCCT and D2b, TCGAAGGCATGGTGTTGGGCAAGTCC. Oligonucleotides of each pair were annealed, leading to double strand oligonucleotides with extremities compatible with anXhoI digestion product and ligated into pLGΔ178 digested with XhoI leading, respectively, to the pFA, pFB, pFC, pFD1, and pFD2 reporter plasmids. p53 was expressed using the pLS76 family vector (36.Flaman J.M. Robert V. Lenglet S. Moreau V. Iggo R. Frebourg T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These vectors contain the LEU2 gene, the Yeast ARS-CEN replication origin, and the human p53 coding sequence under the control of the ADH1 constitutive promoter. pLS76-WT allows expression of the wt p53. The LEU2 ARS-CEN YCplac111 was used as a negative control plasmid that does not express p53 (37.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). Yeast strain W303 (kindly provided by E. Boy-Marcotte) was co-transformed with an appropriate reporter plasmid and with a p53 expression vector (38.Fukada I.H. Murata Y. Kimura K. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each experiment, β-galactosidase activity of the transformants was determined in three independent cultures as described (39.Ruby S.W. Szostak J.W. Murray A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 253-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). pSVE-hump53 and pCMV-hump53 are expression vectors of human wt p53 under the control of the SV40 early promoter (SVE) and the cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer (CMV) promoter (14.Bourdon J.C. Deguin-Chambon V. Lelong J.C. Dessen P. May P. Debuire B. May E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). p53 mutants derived from these vectors are indicated in lowercase (i.e. pSVE-hump53-P175 allows expression of the Pro-175 mutant). pSVE-Renluc is an expression vector of the Renillaluciferase under the control of the SVE promoter (Promega). pGL3-basic (Promega) reporter plasmid contains the luciferase coding sequence downstream of a multiple cloning site and allows measurement of promoter activity. pPy and pGL3-E1bTATA are the reporter plasmids used to measure enhancer activity in mammalian cells. They contain a truncated polyoma virus early promoter (7.Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) and an E1B minimal promoter (41.Resnick-Silverman L. St Clair S. Maurer M. Zhao K. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 15: 2102-2107Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), respectively, that drive expression of the luciferase coding sequence. pPymFA contains the p53RE A (from nucleotide +1603 to +1812) cloned upstream of the truncated promoter in pPy. pE1B-mF4 and pE1B-mF2 contain, respectively, the four decamers of the p53RE A (from nucleotide +1674 to +1723) or only the two distal decamers of p53RE A (from nucleotide +1704 to +1723) cloned upstream of the E1B minimal promoter in pGL3-E1bTATA. Oligonucleotides TCGACAACATGGTGCAGAGACTGTTTGCTTGGCAGGGCATGTACAAACATGTCA and CTAGTGACATGTTTGTACATGCCCTGCCAAGCAAACAGTCTCTGCACCATGTTG were annealed and cloned into pGL3-E1bTATA digested with NheI andXhoI to obtain pE1B-mF4. To obtain pE1B-mFas, oligonucleotides Aa and Ab (see under “Yeast p53RE Functional Assays”) were annealed and cloned into pGL3-E1bTATA digested withXhoI in the same orientation as pE1B-mF4. pE1B-hWAF1, pE1B-hFAS, pE1B-hBAX, and pE1B-hPIG3 contain p53RE derived from the indicated human gene cloned upstream of the E1B minimal promoter in pGL3-E1bTATA between the NheI and the XhoI restriction sites. Pairs of oligonucleotides used are as follows: TCGAGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTG and CTAGCAACATGTTGGGACATGTTC for pE1B-WAF1, TCGAGGACAAGCCCTGACAAGCCA and CTAGTGGCTTGTCAGGGCTTGTCC for pE1B-hFAS, TCGATCACAAGTTAGAGACAAGCCTGGGCGTGGGCTATATTG and CTAGCAATATAGCCCACGCCCAGGCTTGTCTCTAACTTGTGA for pE1B-bax, and TCGACAGCTTGCCCACCCATGCTC and CTAGGAGCATGGGTGGGCAAGCTG for pE1B-hPIG3. pWWP-luc and pbax-luc contain, respectively, 2400 bp of the human WAF1 promoter and 370 bp of the human BAX promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase (42.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cells seeded in 6-well (35-mm) plates at 2 × 105cells per well were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (43.May E. Omilli F. Borde J. Scieller P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each well, 200 μl of precipitate containing 1 μg of reporter gene plasmid, 20 ng of pSVE-Renluc plasmid, either pSVE-hump53 (0 or 40 ng) or pCMV-hump53 (0 or 80 ng) and sonicated calf thymus DNA to obtain a total of 2 μg of DNA were added and left on the cells 6 h, rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified medium, and incubated for 24 h at the indicated temperature prior to measuring the reporter gene expression. To activate p53 in the SAOS-Val-135 cell lines, cells were incubated for 8 h at 32.5 °C prior to the luciferase assay. Luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-luciferaseTMreporter assay system (Promega), and the activity of the reporter gene was measured with a Microlumat LB 96P (EG & G Berthold). TheRenilla luciferase was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. For each reporter vector, fold activation was calculated as the ratio between the experimental luciferase activity and the corresponding value obtained without p53-expressing vector. Results shown are the mean of at least three experiments, and the standard deviations are indicated. EMSA was performed as described (14.Bourdon J.C. Deguin-Chambon V. Lelong J.C. Dessen P. May P. Debuire B. May E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) without competitor DNA unless specified. Oligomers Aa and Ab (as described above) were annealed and labeled as described (14) and were used as probes. DNA protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis at 4 °C on 4–15% PhastGel Gradient with PhastGel Native Buffer Strips on LKB-PhastSystem (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the following steps: step 1, 400 V, 10 mA, 2.5 watts, 10 V-h; step 2, 400 V, 1 mA, 2.5 watts, 2 V-h; and step 3, 400 V, 10 mA, 2.5 watts, 450 V-h. 2J.-C. Delong, personal communication. To search for a p53RE in the mouse Fas gene, we have employed a multistep approach, based on sequence analysis and reporter gene assay. Sequence analysis of the 800 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site did not reveal any p53 consensus sequence as previously defined. Furthermore, when inserted upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-basic vector, this fragment was not able to induce expression of the reporter gene in a p53-dependent manner in H1299 or in SAOS-Val-135 cells (data not shown). To test whether a p53RE could be present further upstream of the transcription initiation site, an EcoRI fragment spanning from −3250 to −385 (starting from the transcription initiation site) was inserted in both orientations in pPy upstream of the polyoma virus minimal promoter driving the expression of the luciferase gene. When transfected either in H1299 or in SAOS-Val-135 cells, this fragment did not lead to a p53-dependent up-regulation of the reporter gene (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that the mouse Faspromoter region does not contain a p53RE. We therefore decided to look for the presence of a p53RE downstream of the transcription initiation site. The sequence between nucleotide +1 and +4150 (encompassing exon 1 and part of intron 1) was determined and searched for a p53 consensus sequence, two PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy decamers separated by 0–13 nucleotides (11.El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Compared with the above consensus sequence, some mismatches do not alter the functionality of the p53-binding site (11.El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 12.Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). According to this notion we have accepted a maximum of three variations compared with the consensus sequence proposed by El-Deiryet al. (11.El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) with no more than one error in a single decamer if it is located in one of the two central nucleotides of a decamer. The C in position 4 and the G in position 7 were considered as invariant positions. Fig. 1 presents the position and sequence of the four putative p53REs found, named A, B, C, and D. These p53REs are located between nucleotides +1600 and +4000 from the transcriptional initiation site. Putative p53RE D and p53RE A contain one and two additional decamers, respectively. To explore the functionality of the putative p53REs found in intron 1 of the mouse Fas gene, we first used a yeast reporter gene assay. Pairs of decamers (corresponding to the p53 DNA-binding site (11.El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar)) found in the four putative Fas p53REs were subcloned into pLGΔ178 upstream of a truncated CYC1 promoter regulating lacZreporter gene expression (35.Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids obtained were used to co-transform yeast strain W303 with empty vector (YCplac111) or with a plasmid expressing human wild type p53 (pLS76-WT), and expression of β-galactosidase was analyzed. Only decamers of p53RE A gave rise to a p53-dependent expression of the reporter gene (Table I). This p53RE was activated 3500-fold by wt p53. To confirm the functionality of the p53RE A, this element was tested in a luciferase reporter gene assay in mammalian cells. A Sau3A DNA fragment, spanning from nucleotide +1603 to +1812 and encompassing the decamers found in p53RE A, was cloned into the pPy luciferase reporter plasmid upstream of the truncated polyoma virus promoter. This plasmid was transfected into the SAOS-Val-135 human cell line (expressing a ts mutant of p53) and into the H1299 p53-deficient human cell line. In SAOS-Val-135 cells, activation of p53 by temperature shift resulted in a p53-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression (Fig.2 A). In H1299 cells, co-transfection with a plasmid encoding for wt p53 results in a p53-dependent expression of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2 A). To explore further the functionality of this p53RE composed of four decamers matching the p53 consensus sequence, it was subcloned into a reporter plasmid containing the E1B minimal promoter (21.Müller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Stremmel W. Oren M. Krammer P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Constructs containing either the four decamers or only the two distal decamers were tested by transfection into H1299 cells. Both constructs gave rise to a comparable p53-dependent activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 2 B). Thus, a minimal functional p53RE is located in intron 1 between nucleotides +1704 and +1723 of the murine Fas gene.Table Ip53-dependent β-galactosidase activity induced by the putative p53REs found in the Fas geneInsert into LacZreporter plasmid−p53+p53None0.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1From p53RE A, A0.2 ± 0.1712 ± 77From p53RE B, B0.1 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.1From p53RE C, C0.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1From p53RE D, D10.4 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.1From p53RE D, D20.3 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.1Each DNA fragment indicated in the table (see Fig. 2 for the corresponding DNA sequence) was cloned into the pLGΔI78 reporter plasmid upstream of the truncated CYC1 promoter and analyzed in the yeast reporter assay in the presence or absence of wild type p53. β-Galactosidase activities indicated are expressed in Miller units. Open table in a new tab Each DNA fragment indicated in the table (see Fig. 2 for the corresponding DNA sequence) was cloned into the pLGΔI78 reporter plasmid upstream of the truncated CYC1 promoter and analyzed in the yeast reporter assay in the presence or absence of wild type p53. β-Galactosidase activities indicated are expressed in Miller units. Gel retardation assay was performed to test whether p53 specifically binds to the p53RE A. The p53 used in this experiment was produced in Sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus and partially purified on a Q-Sepharose column (44.Delphin C. Cahen P. Lawrence J. Baudier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When p53 was incubated with a double strand oligonucleotide corresponding to the Fas p53RE (nucleotides +1704 to +1723), complexes leading to band shifts were detected (Fig. 3, lane 2). To identify the specific protein-DNA complex in lane 2, competition assays were performed. Addition of a 100-fold excess of non-radioactive oligonucleotide devoid of a p53-binding site did not affect the presumably specific complex (lane 4), whereas the formation of this complex was inhibited by 100-fold excess of unlabeled homologue probe or an alternative p53 consensus sequence (lanes 5 and 6). Finally, the mobility of this specific complex was retarded in the presence of an antibody directed against p53 (lane 3), confirming the presence of p53 in the complex. Taken together these results demonstrate that p53 specifically binds to the Fas p53RE. Since we demonstrated the presence of a functional p53RE in the mouse Fas gene, it was of interest to test whether p53 regulates the transcription of this gene. M1-S6 is a mouse myeloid leukemia cell line that does not express p53. M1-LTR13 is a derived clone stably transfected with a plasmid that allows expression of the mouse temperature-sensitive (ts) Val-135 mutant of p53. In this cell line activation of p53 by temperature shift (32.5 °C) induces apoptosis (45.Yonish-Rouach E. Resnitzky D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently shown that activation of p53 in the M1-LTR13 cells leads to an accumulation of theFas mRNA. 3C. Choisy-Rossi et al., submitted for publication. We tested whether this accumulation resulted from transcriptional activation or mRNA stabilization. To this end, the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D was employed to measure the half-life ofFas mRNA induced by p53. M1-S6 cells were used to obtain the control Fas mRNA population. Since the basal level of Fas mRNA is not easily detectable in M1-derived cell lines, we induced Fas transcription with IL-6.3IL-6 action is mediated through the transcription factor NF-IL-6 which induces Fas transcription without modifying the stability of the Fas mRNA (46.Wada N. Matsumura M. Ohba Y. Kobayashi N. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18007-18012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 47.Akira S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1401-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To analyze FasmRNA stability, RNAs were sequentially harvested from M1-LTR13 cells cultured at 32.5 °C and from M1-S6 cells cultured in presence of IL-6 at 32.5 °C after addition of actinomycin D. As shown in Fig.4, the kinetics of FasmRNA degradation in cells treated with actinomycin D was quite similar in both cell lines, whether Fas was induced by p53 or by IL-6."

All three carried >80% mutant genome in platelets and were manifesting clinically various degrees of the NARP phenotype. Coupled submitochondrial particles prepared from platelets capable of succinate-sustained ATP synthesis were studied using very sensitive and rapid luminometric and fluorescence methods. A sharp decrease (>95%) in the succinate-sustained ATP synthesis rate of the particles was found, but both the ATP hydrolysis rate and ATP-driven proton translocation (when the protons flow from the matrix to the cytosol) were minimally affected. The T8993G mutation changes the highly conserved residue Leu156 to Arg in the ATPase 6 subunit (subunita). This subunit, together with subunit c, is thought to cooperatively catalyze proton translocation and rotate, one with respect to the other, during the catalytic cycle of the F1F0 complex. Our results suggest that the T8993G mutation induces a structural defect in human F1F0-ATPase that causes a severe impairment of ATP synthesis. This is possibly due to a defect in either the vectorial proton transport from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix or the coupling of proton flow through F0 to ATP synthesis in F1. Whatever mechanism is involved, this leads to impaired ATP synthesis. On the other hand, ATP hydrolysis that involves proton flow from the matrix to the cytosol is essentially unaffected.

It catalyzes ADP phosphorylation using a proton electrochemical gradient generated by the electron transport chain (4.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

It is a ubiquitous, evolutionary conserved enzyme composed by two main sectors: F1, a soluble catalytic sector comprising five different subunits that is bound through two stalks to F0 (8.Karrasch S. Walker J.E. Eur. Bioenerg. Conf. Short Rep. 1998; 10: 49Google Scholar, 9.Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the membrane sector that contains up to 10 different subunits (4.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 10.Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Among these are the evolutionary conserved ATPase 6 and theN,N′-dicycloexylcarbodiimide-binding protein (proteolipid), equivalent to subunits a and c of the Escherichia coli enzyme, respectively (10.Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence supports the notion that F-ATPases of all species consist of similar structural motives and that reversible ATP synthesis coupled to a proton flux across F0 is mediated by conformational changes transmitted from the membrane sector to the catalytic sector of the F0F1 complex (4.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar,11.Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) supports a mechanical coupling between the F0 and F1 sectors based on the rotation of a central rotor, consisting of the smaller subunit(s), with respect to a hexagonal ring made up of the main polypeptides containing the catalytic sites. Energy transduction in this model would occur through a rotation within the F0 sector powered by proton flow, which promotes ATP synthesis and release. Evidence also suggests that the structural rearrangements concerned with this machinery include subunit c of both bacteria and mitochondria (13.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Mutant analyses and chemical modification indicate the existence of intermolecular interactions between the transmembrane helices of subunits c and a. These interactions are thought to be involved in proton translocation since several residues of the E. coli enzyme, including Arg210 (equivalent to Arg159 of the mitochondrial enzyme) and others within the most highly conserved regions of subunits a (residues 190–220) and c(Asp61, equivalent to Glu58 of human subunitc), have been shown to be essential for this function (17.Cox G.B.

The biochemical effect of the T8993G mutation has not been clarified yet, although it was suggested to be an impairment of the F1F0-ATPase complex possibly due to a proton channel defect. However, it remains unclear whether ATP hydrolysis is affected by the mutation. Vazquez-Memije et al. (21.Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davindson E. DeVivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Tatuch et al. (2.Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaun A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the ATP hydrolysis rate of both skin fibroblast and muscle mitochondria from patients harboring >95% abnormal mtDNA did not change significantly with respect to controls. Tatuch and Robinson (22.Tatuch Y. Robinson B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), using mitochondria isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines with high percentage mutant mtDNA, subsequently found the rate of ATP synthesis reduced by 33–46%, whereas the ATPase activity was 42% reduced compared with controls. Similar results were reported by others (23.Tatuch Y. Pagon R.A. Vlcek B. Roberts R. Korson M. Robinson B.H. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 2: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These findings were considered indirect evidence of impaired proton channel function (F0) in NARP patients. However, Houstek et al.(24.Houstek J. Klement P. Hermanskà J. Houstkovà H. Hansikovà H. Van den Bogert C. Zeman J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) found the rate of mitochondrial ATP production in 99% mutant fibroblasts 2-fold lower than in normal fibroblasts and proposed that the mutation could induce structural instability of the enzyme complex. Finally, Trounce et al. (25.Trounce I. Neill S. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8334-8338Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) examined the respiration rate of mitochondria isolated from both patient-derived cell lines and cybrids with the T8993G mutation and found both decreased ADP-stimulated respiration rates and ADP/oxygen ratios suggestive of a proton channel and ADP phosphorylation defect in the F1F0-ATPase. However, the proton transport activity of the mutated enzyme has never been measured directly. To address this point and to clarify whether the ATP hydrolysis rate of the Leu156-to-Arg mutated mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase subunit a was impaired, we analyzed the catalysis and proton translocating properties of the enzyme in platelet-derived submitochondrial particles from three patients, belonging to two unrelated families, harboring at least 80% mutant mtDNA. An ATP-driven proton transport activity similar to that of the enzyme from controls was observed. We analyze this finding in relation to the results of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis rates and discuss the implications for the current model of proton translocation through F0 and its coupling to the conformational changes in F1 leading to ATP synthesis. ATP, ADP, oligomycin A, valinomycin, Hepes, Tris, trichloroacetic acid, and ACMA were obtained from Sigma. 1243-102 ATP monitoring reagent, a mixture of luciferin and luciferase, was a product of BioOrbit (Turku, Finland). We investigated three previously reported Italian patients, from two unrelated Italian families, carrying high percentages of the T8993G mutation. Patients 1 and 2 are two sisters previously reported by Puddu et al. (26.Puddu P. Bordoni P. Mantovani V. Montagna P. Cerullo A. Bragliani M. Molinotti C. Caramazza R. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1993; 77: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and patient 3 belongs to a second unrelated family (proband of family F) reported by Uziel et al. (27.Uziel G. Moroni I. Lamantea E. Fratta G.M. Ciceri E. Carrara F. Zeviani M. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1997; 63: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All three patients presented a disease clinically compatible with the original description of NARP syndrome (1.Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Petty R.K.H. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). We also investigated 12 controls randomly chosen from the general population. Informed consent was obtained in all cases. Human platelets were isolated and purified from 100 ml of venous blood under standardized conditions as previously reported (28.Baracca A. Bucchi L. Ghelli A. Lenaz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To isolate mitochondria, platelets were suspended in a hypotonic medium (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6); 4 min later, the suspension was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min; and finally, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to precipitate mitochondria. This procedure was repeated twice. The mitochondria were suspended at 4–8 mg/ml in 0.25 m sucrose and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8. Coupled submitochondrial particles (SMPs) were prepared essentially according to Baracca et al. (28.Baracca A. Bucchi L. Ghelli A. Lenaz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) by exposing mitochondria to sonic oscillation on a Labsonic U Braun sonicator for 20 s at the minimum output. The particles were suspended in 0.25 m sucrose to give a protein concentration of 6–8 mg/ml and immediately assayed for ATP-driven proton-pumping activity and for ATP hydrolysis and synthesis. Total DNA was extracted from a pellet of the same platelets used for the biochemical assays by the standard phenol/chloroform purification method. To detect the T8993G mutation, a convenient 551-bp segment of mtDNA was amplified by PCR using the pair of primers originally described by Holt et al. (1.Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Petty R.K.H. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar), Forward/8648–8665 and Reverse/9199–9180, according to the Cambridge sequence. The PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C; 29 cycles each consisting of denaturation for 80 s at 94 °C, annealing for 100 s at 56 °C, and extension for 120 s at 72 °C; and a final cycle of “superextension” for 5 min at 72 °C. This last cycle minimizes the possible formation of heteroduplexes between mutant and wild-type strands. The presence of the mutation was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis after digestion with the restriction endonuclease AvaI. The T8993G mutation introduces a new AvaI restriction site; consequently, the 551-bp amplified fragment will be cut in two 345- and 206-bp fragments. The digestion products were separated through a 3% NuSieve-containing 0.5% agarose gel and visualized by UV transillumination after ethidium bromide staining. The co-presence of all three fragments of 551, 345, and 206 bp indicated the heteroplasmy (coexistence of wild-type and mutant mtDNA). The mutation proportion was calculated as the ratio of the 345- and 206-bp fragments versus the 551-bp fragment evaluated as intensity of the bands in the gel photographs using the Molecular Analyst PC image analysis software for the Bio-Rad GS-670 densitometer. The ATP synthesis rate was assayed by incubating 20–30 μg of submitochondrial particles in 25 μl of 0.25 msucrose, 50 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, and 0.2 mm ADP, pH 7.4. 20 mm succinate was added to start the reaction. Incubation was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C, and 5 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. The mixture was centrifuged to remove precipitated protein, and the resulting extract was assayed for ATP by the luciferin/luciferase chemiluminescent method (29.Stanley P.E. Williams S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 29: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Three assays were carried out for each sample. ATP hydrolysis was assayed as follows. Submitochondrial particles (10 μg) were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm Hepes, and 2 mm MgCl2, pH 8, and 1 mm ATP was added to start the reaction. To stop the reaction, trichloroacetic acid was added, and non-hydrolyzed ATP was determined in a diluted sample of the reaction mixture by the luciferin/luciferase method as described above. Three assays were carried out for each sample. The proton-pumping activity coupled to the ATP hydrolysis of submitochondrial particles was determined from the quenching of ACMA fluorescence induced upon 0.8 mm ATP addition to the assay medium as described (30.Papageorgiou S. Melandri A.B. Solaini G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay medium contained (in a 1-ml final volume) 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tricine, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, pH 8, 1 μg of valinomycin, 0.5 μmACMA, and 0.1 mg of submitochondrial particles. The reaction, performed under continuous mixing, was started by the addition of ATP. Two assays of each sample were carried out at 25 °C on a Jasco P450 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission at 412 and 510 nm, respectively. Protein concentration was measured using the method of Lowry et al. (31.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 1% deoxycholate. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. The significance of differences was evaluated by unpaired ttests and accepted when p ≤ 0.05. The results of mtDNA analysis are shown in Fig. 1. All three NARP patients presented high percentages of mutant mtDNA, i.e. 80% or more (range 80–93%), compatible with the heteroplasmy ratios previously reported (26.Puddu P. Bordoni P. Mantovani V. Montagna P. Cerullo A. Bragliani M. Molinotti C. Caramazza R. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 1993; 77: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27.Uziel G. Moroni I. Lamantea E. Fratta G.M. Ciceri E. Carrara F. Zeviani M. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1997; 63: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We performed the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using the same PCR method commonly used for diagnostic purposes. An underestimation of the mutant mtDNA ratio could be due to heteroduplex formation, but this effect had been minimized by performing a final superextension cycle as previously reported (32.Matthews P.M. Brown R.M. Mortem K. Marchington D. Poulton J. Brown G. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, standard curves prepared with PCR products obtained by Tatuchet al. (2.Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaun A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar) with the same primers we used demonstrated a negligible deviation due to heteroduplex artifacts. Because we are not doing a strict correlation between the mutation load and the biochemical results in the single samples, we can affirm that our biochemical observations are related to a percentage, conservatively estimated, of at least 80% of T8993G mutant mtDNA in the same tissue sample investigated, the platelets. We also excluded the presence of the T8993G mutation in the platelet mtDNA of the controls. To assess the biochemical implications of the T8993G mutation, we measured rates of coupled ATP synthesis, ATP hydrolysis, and ATP-driven H+ pumping. Since the available assays for ATP hydrolysis require large amounts of biological material and the amount of submitochondrial particles obtainable from patients' platelets is small, we used an assay procedure, based on the measurement of the luminescence emitted by the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of luciferin and luciferase, that consumes as little as 10 μg of protein/assay. Owing to this method, which allowed us to assay ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis in very small samples of particles, we could also assay the ATP-driven proton-pumping activity of the particles from the same blood sample. The submitochondrial particle preparations from both normal human and patients' platelets had similar cytochrome c oxidase (typically, it was 30 nmol/min/mg of protein), whereas the 5′-nucleotidase activity, used as a probe for contamination, was below the assay sensitivity (specific activity < 1 nmol/min/mg of protein for each sample). These findings indicate comparable and low contamination of the particles in control and mutant samples. The succinate-sustained ATP synthase activity present in the submitochondrial particles from platelets of NARP patients is shown in Table I. The particles from all patients exhibited a greatly reduced ATP synthase activity ranging from 0.11 to 0.25 nmol/min/mg of protein with respect to the control mean of 2.93 nmol/min/mg of protein. Although, on the basis of the evaluated heteroplasmy of the patients' mitochondrial samples, nearly 20% of the F1F0 complexes are active, the ATP synthesis rate decreased by a factor of nearly 20 (on the mean basis, 5% residual synthesis activity). Our expected result was 20% residual activity or higher if the greater driving force for each individual normal F1F0 complex was taken into account, as according to Hatefi (6.Hatefi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi (34.Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14031-14038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the observed lower than expected ATP synthesis rate might be only apparent, for instance, given that the mutated F1F0complexes could still fully exert the ATP hydrolysis activity. In fact, at variance with the ATP synthesis, the ATPase activity of the mutated particles was very close to that of controls (37.0 ± 4.5 nmol/min/mg of protein), without any statistically significant difference (p > 0.3) (Table I). This observation rules out the possibility that the content of F1F0-ATPase might be different in normal and mutated mitochondrial platelets, thus ruling out that a different content of the enzyme could account for the reduction of ATP synthase activity observed in the NARP patients. Finally, it should be mentioned that the oligomycin sensitivity of the different enzyme activities cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the F1F0-ATPase activity since it appears that the inhibitor affects the enzyme from controls and patients differently, as has very recently been suggested (35.Manfredi G. Gupta N. Vazquez-Memije M.E. Sadlock J.E. Spinazzola A. DeVivo D.C. Schon E.A. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The data are presented as means ± S.E.M. F1F0-ATPase-mediated proton-pumping activity in submitochondrial particles prepared from NARP patients' platelets was used as an indication of the enzyme proton channel function and of coupling between transport and catalysis. Acidification of inverted membrane vesicles was monitored by fluorescence of ACMA. Adding ATP to the suspension of SMPs, a time-dependent decrease in the fluorescence of the probe was observed until oligomycin was added (Fig.2). To our surprise, particles derived from the three NARP patients had ATP-driven proton-pumping activity similar to that of controls, and proton transport was completely abolished when oligomycin was added to the particles. This indicates that the fluorescence quenching was in fact due to the ATP-driven proton translocation through the membrane and that the proton transport activity of the mutated enzyme is as sensitive to the inhibitor as the normal type. Although the quenching responses do not correlate linearly with the actual rate of H+ pumping, the use of ACMA has been validated by several authors investigating different types of vesicles (30.Papageorgiou S. Melandri A.B. Solaini G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36.Casadio R. Melandri B.A. J. Bioinorg.

Here, we supply evidence that by slowing the ATPase activity of control particles by lowering the ATP substrate concentration, both the ACMA fluorescence quenching rate and the steady-state fluorescence quenching extent were reduced (Fig.3). Moreover, by inhibiting the enzyme with substoichiometric oligomycin, the ACMA quenching response was reduced (Fig. 3 D). These observations indicate that ACMA fluorescence quenching measurements are a reliable means to reveal changes in the F1F0-ATPase proton transport activity of platelet submitochondrial particles. Therefore, we conclude that the mutated F1F0-ATPase is fully competent for ATP-driven proton transport.Figure 3ATP-driven quenching of ACMA fluorescence by platelet submitochondrial particles. The cuvette contained 0.2 mg of SMP protein in 1 ml of assay medium (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tricine, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, pH 8, 1 μg of valinomycin, and 0.5 μm ACMA (100 μg/ml in ethanol)). The reaction was started by the addition of increasing ATP concentrations, and the fluorescence emission was recorded at 510 nm after excitation at 412 nm. A–C, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mm ATP, respectively, were added.

However, these studies were limited to mtDNA analysis and electron transfer activities, whereas no investigation has been performed on the protonophoric activity of the energy-conserving complexes. The latter is crucial in the pathophysiology of some disorders due to mtDNA mutations, in particular in NARP and maternally inherited Leigh disease phenotypes associated with the T8993G mutation. This mutation is now recognized as the most frequent mtDNA defect associated with Leigh disease (40.Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), although its biochemical effect is still not fully understood. The results reported in this work indicate that substitution of Leu156 with Arg of F1F0-ATPase subunit a causes a reduction of the ATP synthesis rate in platelet submitochondrial particles, whereas both ATPase and ATP-driven proton translocation through F0 are not significantly affected. Thus, the ATP hydrolysis rate of the mutated enzyme, which is controversial in the literature (2.Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaun A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R.

The differences in data reported might be ascribed to the different biological systems assayed since Tatuch et al. (2.Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaun A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar) and Vazquez-Memije et al. (21.Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davindson E. DeVivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) did not find any difference in ATPase activity between skin fibroblasts of patients (with >95% abnormal mtDNA) and controls, whereas Tatuch et al. (23.Tatuch Y. Pagon R.A. Vlcek B. Roberts R. Korson M. Robinson B.H. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 2: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) found reduced activity in lymphocyte mitochondria with >95% heteroplasmy, and Hartzog and Cain (41.Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12250-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found 50% decreased activity in mutated E. coli membranes. However, it remains to be seen why the mutated enzyme from different cells behaves differently. The enzyme may be differently expressed or regulated in different cells. The second point addressed in this work concerns proton translocation. Our data clearly indicate that protons can be translocated by the mutated enzyme as efficiently as by the control, at least in the direction from the matrix (F1-binding site) to the cytosolic side of the membrane. This observation was unexpected on the basis of reports in the literature (2.Tatuch Y. Christodoulou J. Feigenbaun A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Tatuch Y. Robinson B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23.Tatuch Y. Pagon R.A.

Modeling of F0 subunits a and c, both thought to be involved in the proton channel (Fig.4), shows that this mutation has the effect of placing a positive charge in the vicinity of Arg159, a residue generally thought to play an essential role in both H+ transport (13.Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Hatch L.P. Cox G.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the induction of the movement of subunits c relative to subunita via protonation-deprotonation of the couple aArg159/c Glu58. The proposed topography of the transmembrane helices of subunitsa (helix 4 (h4) and helix 5(h5)) andc (helix 2 (h2)) and amino acids considered to be involved in proton translocation through F0, Arg159 (210 in E. coli), His168(Glu219 in E. coli), and Glu194(His245 in E. coli), are shown in Fig. 4. According to the alternative mechanism proposed by Hatch et al. (42.Hatch L.P. Cox G.B. Howitt S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29407-29412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), during ATP synthesis, protons from the intermembrane space, through the involvement of Glu194 and His168, would move to Glu58 of subunitc. This would destabilize the ionic interaction between that Glu58 residue and Arg159 of subunita. Arg159 would then form a salt bridge with the next Glu58, with the energy released driving the rotation of the ring of subunits c relative to subunit a(44.Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J. Hatch L.P. Gibson F. Cox G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and a proton would be released from this residue to the matrix side of the membrane. This mechanism implies that the energy released by the H+ moving down its concentration gradient drives the relative motion of the subunits as described above. One could speculate that the presence of Arg instead of Leu in position 156 of subunita could impede the rotation of subunits crelative to subunit a due to a possible salt bridge between Arg156 of the mutated enzyme and Glu58 of that subunit c next to that interacting with Arg159, therefore inhibiting the ATP synthase activity of the mutated enzyme. In contradistinction, the driving force for the reverse reaction is ATP hydrolysis on F1 that moves the asymmetric rotor, of which the ring of subunits c is part (16.Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). ATP-driven rotation of subunits c relative to subunit a might force H+ to be released from the couple aArg159/c Glu58 to the cytosolic side of the membrane, whatever amino acid residue is present in position 156 of subunit a. The experimental data may also be interpreted in light of another popular model for F1F0-ATPase proton transport coupled to subunit rotation (43.Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereby the protons flow from the mitochondrial matrix side to the couple aArg159/c Glu58, where the movement of subunits is induced, and then to the cytoplasm, no matter whether Leu or Arg is in position 156. The opposite flow of protons, from the cytoplasm to the matrix, appears most difficult to visualize in the mutated enzyme; the presence of the positively charged and bulky Arg instead of Leu in the pathway from the cytoplasm to the aArg159/c Glu58 couple might impede the H+ flow, causing a block of subunit rotation and ATP synthesis inhibition. The results reported in the present paper are consistent with the results of Cain and Simoni (19.Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that they found that the mutations of the E. coli residue equivalent to human Leu156, Leu207 to Cys or Tyr, resulted in partial loss of F1F0-ATP synthase activity, but failed to reduce ATP-driven proton-pumping activity. Similarly, in a very recent paper, Jiang and Fillingame (45.Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported that changing Leu207 to Cys gave transformant strains that grew considerably slower than the wild type on succinate minimal medium, implying that oxidative phosphorylation was impaired. Hartzog and Cain (41.Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12250-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that ATP synthesis and the ATP-driven proton flux through F0 were abolished and that ∼50% residual ATPase activity was still found in the membrane of an E. coli mutant when subunit a Leu207 was replaced with Arg, in contrast with the present findings, where ATP-driven H+ pumping by the mutated mitochondrial enzyme was found to be hardly affected by the mutation. The above data suggest a possible difference between the importance of the homologous residues in E. coli and humans. It has to be considered that the essential residues Glu219 and His245 inE. coli are replaced by His168 and Glu203, respectively, in humans. Moreover, possible subtle differences between the mammalian and bacterial complexes, for instance, in mechanisms present in the eukaryotic enzyme to control proton translocation through F0, have to be considered; the mammalian F1F0 complex contains seven extra polypeptides located in the membrane domain that play unknown roles (46.Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. M. Zeviani (Istituto Neurologico “C. Besta,” Milano, Italy) and Dr. P.

This maternally expressed factor is distributed in a nuclear concentration gradient in the blastoderm embryo (1.Drier E.A. Steward R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and functions as an activator and repressor of transcription to establish multiple domains of zygotic gene activity, thereby subdividing the embryo into several discrete domain along its dorsoventral axis (2.Courey A.J. Huang J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3.Ray R.P. Arora K. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Gelbart W.M. Development. 1991; 113: 35-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Dorsal-binding proteins direct the spatially regulated nuclear import of Dorsal via an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway, which targets Dorsal and its cytoplasmic inhibitor Cactus (4.Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 5.Govind S. Steward R.

A. 1997; 94: 14524-14529Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prior to activation of the pathway, an interaction between Cactus and Dorsal serves to retain Dorsal in the cytoplasm. Activation of the pathway by a signal originating in the ventral extraembryonic space results in phosphorylation of Cactus and Dorsal. The phosphorylation of Cactus triggers its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, freeing Dorsal to enter the nucleus (7.Reach M. Galindo R.L. Towb P. Allen J.L. Karin M. Wasserman S.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the phosphorylation of Dorsal is required to render the factor competent for efficient nuclear uptake (8.Drier E.A. Huang L.H. Steward R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).A very similar pathway involving the vertebrate homolog of Cactus, IκB is involved in the regulated nuclear import of vertebrate Rel family proteins, such as NFκB (9.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 10.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies suggest that the nuclear import of NFκB may be influenced by the Smt3 conjugation pathway (11.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Smt3 is a small ubiquitin-like protein that can be enzymatically conjugated to various protein substrates via an amide linkage between the C-terminal carboxyl group of Smt3 and a lysine ε-amino group on the target protein. Conjugation of mammalian SMT3C to IκB is thought to stabilize IκB by blocking ubiquitylation and therefore subsequent proteasomal degradation. By stabilizing IκB, the vertebrate Smt3 conjugation pathway results in the down-regulation of NFκB activity.In an effort to illuminate further the mechanisms by which Dorsal activity is regulated, we sought to identify novel Dorsal interacting proteins via a yeast two-hybrid screen. One of the proteins identified in this screen was Drosophila Ubc9 (DmUbc9) (12.Joanisse D.R. Inaguma Y. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This protein is homologous to yeast and mammalian Ubc9, which are thought to function as Smt3-conjugating enzymes (13.Saitoh H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Experiments examining the effect of DmUbc9 on Dorsal nuclear uptake and Dorsal-mediated transcriptional activation demonstrate that the effect of the Smt3 conjugation pathway on Dorsal activity is opposite to the effect of this pathway on the activity of the vertebrate Rel family protein NFκB. In particular, we find that DmUbc9 conjugatesDrosophila Smt3 (DmSmt3) to Dorsal and overcomes Cactus-dependent sequestration of Dorsal in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we find that the effects of DmUbc9 on Dorsal activity are enhanced by overexpression of DmSmt3 and a DmSmt3-activating enzyme. Thus, the Smt3 conjugation pathway enhances Dorsal nuclear translocation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that DmUbc9, an Smt3-conjugating enzyme (13.Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), is a Dorsal-interacting protein. We show that DmUbc9 catalyzes the conjugation of DmSmt3 to Dorsal and opposes the inhibitory effect of Cactus on Dorsal nuclear uptake. We also report the identification of DmSAE1/DmSAE2, the Drosophila homolog of the Smt3-activating enzyme. We further show that DmSmt3, DmSAE1/DmSAE2, and DmUbc9 function synergistically to stimulate the activity of a Dorsal-responsive reporter gene. These findings suggest that the Smt3 conjugation pathway enhances Dorsal activity by enhancing its nuclear uptake. Although Ubc9 family proteins have been found to interact with a variety of transcription factors (33.Tashiro K. Pando M.P. Kanegae Y. Wamsley P.M. Inoue S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, our finding that the effects of DmUbc9 on Dorsal activity are potentiated by DmSmt3 and a DmSmt3-activating enzyme provides some of the best evidence to date that Smt3 conjugation is directly involved in regulating transcription factor activity.Smt3 Conjugation as an Evolutionarily Conserved Pathway for the Regulation of Subcellular LocalizationSmt3 homologs have been cloned from eukaryotes as diverse as yeast, Arabidopsis, and humans (16.Johnson E.S.

Ridpath J.F. Berry E.S. Virus Res. 1998; 57: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These proteins in general display greater than 50% identity with one another but also roughly 20% identity with ubiquitin. The identification of the components of the Smt3 conjugation pathway in yeast, humans, and now Drosophila has revealed that Smt3 conjugation and ubiquitin conjugation proceed by similar pathways (16.Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 37.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Both pathways require an activating enzyme, or E1 protein, which becomes covalently attached to ubiquitin or Smt3 via a high energy thioester bond, and a conjugating enzyme, or E2 protein, which accepts ubiquitin or Smt3 from the E1 protein forming a second thioester-linked covalent complex. Ubiquitin or Smt3 is then transferred to an ε-amino group on a final protein substrate. The transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 protein to the final substrate often requires a ubiquitin ligase, or E3 protein. In contrast, an E3-type protein is apparently not required for Smt3 conjugation.Although ubiquitin conjugation targets proteins for proteasomal degradation (42.Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), Smt3 conjugation appears to serve other purposes. Originally identified in yeast as an enzyme required for proper cell cycle progression, Ubc9 has been found to physically interact with a diverse array of proteins including RanGAP1, PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein), bleomycin hydrolase, E2A, androgen receptor, and c-Rel (11.Desterro J.M.

Association of human Ubc9 with RanGAP1 results in the conjugation of RanGAP1 to the Smt3 homolog SMT3C/SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier), allowing it to bind RanBP2 at the nuclear periphery. This allows RanGAP1 to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Ran. Only SUMO-1-conjugated RanGAP1 binds to RanBP2, implying that SMT3C and Ubc9 are required for nuclear import. In the case of PML, interaction with Ubc9 and subsequent SUMO-1 conjugation is essential for targeting PML to discreet subnuclear structures known as PML-bodies or nuclear dots. In acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, the subnuclear localization of PML is altered, suggesting that improper SUMO-1 conjugation may trigger oncogenesis. These studies argue that one function of Smt3 conjugation is to regulate the subcellular localization of proteins.Roles for Smt3 Conjugation in the Regulation of Rel Family Protein ActivityAlthough we have found a possible role for Smt3 conjugation in regulating Dorsal activity, a number of reports have implicated Ubc9 in the modulation of transcriptional activation by other Rel family proteins. For example, a recent study showed that SUMO-1-conjugated IκB is resistant to degradation and, accordingly, that SUMO-1 and Ubc9 work together to inhibit activation of an NFκB-dependent reporter (11.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). This contrasts with our findings showing that the Smt3 conjugation pathway activates Dorsal-dependent reporters. This difference could relate to inherent differences between the NFκB/IκB and Dorsal/Cactus pathways. However, an earlier report (33.Tashiro K. Pando M.P. Kanegae Y. Wamsley P.M. Inoue S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7862-7867Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggests that mammalian Ubc9 can enhance Rel protein function via an interaction with NFκB and/or IκB. Thus, an alternative explanation for the different effects of Smt3 conjugation on Rel protein activity could be that different Smt3 family proteins have different functions. An alignment of DmSmt3 with the three members of the human SMT3 family (Fig. 5 A) reveals that DmSmt3 displays significantly higher homology to SMT3A and SMT3B (77 and 75%, respectively) than to SMT3C/SUMO-1 (55%). Thus, DmSmt3, SMT3A, and SMT3B appear to define an Smt3 subfamily that is distinct from SMT3C/SUMO-1. Perhaps SMT3C/SUMO-1 antagonizes transcriptional activation by Rel proteins, whereas SMT3A/B-like proteins (such as DmSmt3) enhance Rel protein function.The Smt3 conjugation system may also function at other levels in the regulation of Rel family protein activity. For example, Ubc9 has been shown to associate with the type I TNFα receptor and MEKK1 and to synergize with MEKK1 to activate an NFκB-dependent reporter (45.Saltzman A. Searfoss G. Marcireau C. Stone M. Ressner R. Munro R. Franks C. D'Alonzo J. Tocque B. Jaye M. Ivashchenko Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Although we were able to detect a DmSmt3-Dorsal conjugate in cells that were simultaneously co-transfected with Dorsal, DmUbc9, and DmSmt3, the level of conjugation was low: no more than about 10% of the Dorsal protein was found in the DmSmt3-conjugated form. This contrasts with the results of our experiments looking at the localization of a Dorsal-GFP fusion protein, in which we found that DmUbc9 was able to direct the relocalization of a large fraction of the Dorsal-GFP in these cells from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This suggests that the conjugation of DmSmt3 to Dorsal may be transient. Perhaps Dorsal and DmSmt3 are deconjugated as soon as Dorsal enters the nucleus. In accord with this idea, recent observations suggest that a dynamic equilibrium may exist between Smt3-conjugated and unconjugated protein species. In yeast, the vast majority of cellular Smt3p is conjugated to other proteins, although the population of proteins that is covalently modified changes during the cell cycle. Furthermore, a yeast enzyme capable of catalyzing the deconjugation reaction has been identified, and homologs of this enzyme appear to exist in many other eukaryotic species (46.Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).A genetically defined locus, termed semushi was recently found to be identical with DmUbc9. Experiments employing thesemushi allele suggest that DmUbc9 may be necessary for the nuclear import of the anteroposterior patterning morphogen Bicoid (24.Epps J.L. Tanda S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study was silent about potential roles of the Smt3 conjugation pathway in other developmental processes. However, a recent preliminary analysis of embryos lacking maternally supplied DmUbc9 indicates the presence of multiple patterning defects of varying penetrance. 2V. Bhaskar and M. Smith, unpublished data. Because of the complex nature of these defects, their characterization will require extensive phenotypic analysis and the generation of additional DmUbc9 alleles. The possibility that DmUbc9 has pleiotropic developmental roles is not surprising given increasing evidence for wide spread roles of Smt3 conjugation in transcription factor function and in the targeting of proteins to their proper subcellular locales.Note Added in ProofSince the submission of this paper, Smt3/SUMO-1 modification has been reported to activate the transcriptional response of p53 (Gostissa, M., Hengstermann, A., Fogal, V., Sandy, P., Schwarz, S. E., Scheffner, M., and Del Sal, G. (1999)EMBO J. 18, 6462–6471; Rodriguez, M. S., Desterro, J. M., Lain, S., Midgley, C. A., Lane, D. P., and Hay, R. T. (1999)EMBO J. 18, 6455–6461). Dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo is initiated by Dorsal, a member of the Rel family of transcription factors. This maternally expressed factor is distributed in a nuclear concentration gradient in the blastoderm embryo (1.Drier E.A. Steward R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and functions as an activator and repressor of transcription to establish multiple domains of zygotic gene activity, thereby subdividing the embryo into several discrete domain along its dorsoventral axis (2.Courey A.J. Huang J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3.Ray R.P. Arora K. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Gelbart W.M. Development. 1991; 113: 35-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dorsal-binding proteins direct the spatially regulated nuclear import of Dorsal via an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway, which targets Dorsal and its cytoplasmic inhibitor Cactus (4.Belvin M.P. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 5.Govind S. Steward R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6.Yang J. Steward R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14524-14529Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prior to activation of the pathway, an interaction between Cactus and Dorsal serves to retain Dorsal in the cytoplasm. Activation of the pathway by a signal originating in the ventral extraembryonic space results in phosphorylation of Cactus and Dorsal. The phosphorylation of Cactus triggers its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, freeing Dorsal to enter the nucleus (7.Reach M. Galindo R.L. Towb P. Allen J.L. Karin M. Wasserman S.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the phosphorylation of Dorsal is required to render the factor competent for efficient nuclear uptake (8.Drier E.A. Huang L.H. Steward R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A very similar pathway involving the vertebrate homolog of Cactus, IκB is involved in the regulated nuclear import of vertebrate Rel family proteins, such as NFκB (9.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 10.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies suggest that the nuclear import of NFκB may be influenced by the Smt3 conjugation pathway (11.Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Smt3 is a small ubiquitin-like protein that can be enzymatically conjugated to various protein substrates via an amide linkage between the C-terminal carboxyl group of Smt3 and a lysine ε-amino group on the target protein. Conjugation of mammalian SMT3C to IκB is thought to stabilize IκB by blocking ubiquitylation and therefore subsequent proteasomal degradation. By stabilizing IκB, the vertebrate Smt3 conjugation pathway results in the down-regulation of NFκB activity. In an effort to illuminate further the mechanisms by which Dorsal activity is regulated, we sought to identify novel Dorsal interacting proteins via a yeast two-hybrid screen. One of the proteins identified in this screen was Drosophila Ubc9 (DmUbc9) (12.Joanisse D.R. Inaguma Y. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This protein is homologous to yeast and mammalian Ubc9, which are thought to function as Smt3-conjugating enzymes (13.Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14.Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Experiments examining the effect of DmUbc9 on Dorsal nuclear uptake and Dorsal-mediated transcriptional activation demonstrate that the effect of the Smt3 conjugation pathway on Dorsal activity is opposite to the effect of this pathway on the activity of the vertebrate Rel family protein NFκB. In particular, we find that DmUbc9 conjugatesDrosophila Smt3 (DmSmt3) to Dorsal and overcomes Cactus-dependent sequestration of Dorsal in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we find that the effects of DmUbc9 on Dorsal activity are enhanced by overexpression of DmSmt3 and a DmSmt3-activating enzyme. Thus, the Smt3 conjugation pathway enhances Dorsal nuclear translocation. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that DmUbc9, an Smt3-conjugating enzyme (13.Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T. Pu R.T.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), is a Dorsal-interacting protein. We show that DmUbc9 catalyzes the conjugation of DmSmt3 to Dorsal and opposes the inhibitory effect of Cactus on Dorsal nuclear uptake. We also report the identification of DmSAE1/DmSAE2, the Drosophila homolog of the Smt3-activating enzyme. We further show that DmSmt3, DmSAE1/DmSAE2, and DmUbc9 function synergistically to stimulate the activity of a Dorsal-responsive reporter gene. These findings suggest that the Smt3 conjugation pathway enhances Dorsal activity by enhancing its nuclear uptake. Although Ubc9 family proteins have been found to interact with a variety of transcription factors (33.Tashiro K. Pando M.P. Kanegae Y. Wamsley P.M. Inoue S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, our finding that the effects of DmUbc9 on Dorsal activity are potentiated by DmSmt3 and a DmSmt3-activating enzyme provides some of the best evidence to date that Smt3 conjugation is directly involved in regulating transcription factor activity.Smt3 Conjugation as an Evolutionarily Conserved Pathway for the Regulation of Subcellular LocalizationSmt3 homologs have been cloned from eukaryotes as diverse as yeast, Arabidopsis, and humans (16.Johnson E.S.

Ridpath J.F. Berry E.S. Virus Res. 1998; 57: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These proteins in general display greater than 50% identity with one another but also roughly 20% identity with ubiquitin. The identification of the components of the Smt3 conjugation pathway in yeast, humans, and now Drosophila has revealed that Smt3 conjugation and ubiquitin conjugation proceed by similar pathways (16.Johnson E.S.

Both pathways require an activating enzyme, or E1 protein, which becomes covalently attached to ubiquitin or Smt3 via a high energy thioester bond, and a conjugating enzyme, or E2 protein, which accepts ubiquitin or Smt3 from the E1 protein forming a second thioester-linked covalent complex. Ubiquitin or Smt3 is then transferred to an ε-amino group on a final protein substrate. The transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 protein to the final substrate often requires a ubiquitin ligase, or E3 protein. In contrast, an E3-type protein is apparently not required for Smt3 conjugation.Although ubiquitin conjugation targets proteins for proteasomal degradation (42.Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), Smt3 conjugation appears to serve other purposes. Originally identified in yeast as an enzyme required for proper cell cycle progression, Ubc9 has been found to physically interact with a diverse array of proteins including RanGAP1, PML (promyelocytic leukemia protein), bleomycin hydrolase, E2A, androgen receptor, and c-Rel (11.Desterro J.M.

Association of human Ubc9 with RanGAP1 results in the conjugation of RanGAP1 to the Smt3 homolog SMT3C/SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier), allowing it to bind RanBP2 at the nuclear periphery. This allows RanGAP1 to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by Ran. Only SUMO-1-conjugated RanGAP1 binds to RanBP2, implying that SMT3C and Ubc9 are required for nuclear import. In the case of PML, interaction with Ubc9 and subsequent SUMO-1 conjugation is essential for targeting PML to discreet subnuclear structures known as PML-bodies or nuclear dots. In acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, the subnuclear localization of PML is altered, suggesting that improper SUMO-1 conjugation may trigger oncogenesis. These studies argue that one function of Smt3 conjugation is to regulate the subcellular localization of proteins.Roles for Smt3 Conjugation in the Regulation of Rel Family Protein ActivityAlthough we have found a possible role for Smt3 conjugation in regulating Dorsal activity, a number of reports have implicated Ubc9 in the modulation of transcriptional activation by other Rel family proteins.

In this study we report the effects of these ligands on the enzyme structure, as revealed by circular dichroism, and steady-state and dynamic fluorescence measurements. We have found that calcium and GTP induced opposite conformational changes at the level of the protein tertiary structure. In particular the metal ions were responsible for a small widening of the protein molecule, as indicated by anisotropy decay measurements and by the binding of a hydrophobic probe such as 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS). Unlike Ca2+, the nucleotide binding increased the protein dynamics, reducing its rotational correlation lifetime from 32 to 25 ns, preventing also the binding of ANS into the protein matrix. Unfolding of tTG by guanidinium hydrochloride yielded a three-state denaturation mechanism, involving an intermediate species with the characteristics of the so-called “molten globule” state. The effect of GTP binding (but not that of Ca2+) had an important consequence on the stability of tissue transglutaminase, increasing the free energy change from the native to the intermediate species by at least ≈0.7 kcal/mol. Also a greater stability of tTG to high hydrostatic pressure was obtained in presence of GTP. These findings suggest that the molecular mechanism by which tTG activity is inhibited by GTP is essentially due to a protein conformational change which, decreasing the accessibility of the protein matrix to the solvent, renders more difficult the exposure of the active site.

Chem. 1967; 242: 1838-1844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nucleotides (5.Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Peoples K.A. Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16295-16300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Probably the best studied relationship between the function and the structure of tTG is that involving the binding of calcium and GTP. It has been found that the metal ion promotes a transglutaminase activity (6.Folk J.E. Mullooly J.P. Cole P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1838-1844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GTP has an opposite consequence, reducing the affinity of the protein for calcium and thus blocking its cross-linking function (9.Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Bergamini C.M.

Experimental evidence has suggested that these effects are due to the occurrence of induced conformational changes of tTG (5.Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Peoples K.A. Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1776-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6.Folk J.E. Mullooly J.P. Cole P.W. J. Biol.

However, despite many experiments that have been done on the enzyme, little is known about the molecular mechanism that characterizes these structural changes. Since tryptophan emission, the major source of protein intrinsic fluorescence, is strongly influenced by changes in tertiary structure, we used fluorescence spectroscopy in order to characterize the interaction between guinea pig liver tTG and GTP or calcium ions. In particular we have performed steady-state, dynamic fluorescence, and anisotropy decay measurements in the presence of these ligands. The secondary structure of tTG under different conditions has been studied in parallel by CD spectroscopy in the range 200–250 nm, whereas ANS binding and the CD spectrum in the aromatic region were used to characterize changes in the tertiary structure. The protein stability in the presence and absence of calcium or GTP has been also investigated by studying the effects of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl) or of pressure. tTG from guinea pig liver was purchased from Sigma. All spectroscopic measurements were performed dissolving the protein in Tris-HCl 50 mm buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA. The active site titration was performed according to the procedure described by Kim and co-workers (12.Kim S.Y. Kim I.G. Chung S.I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of active tTG was found to be ≈97% of the total protein concentration measured by UV absorption spectroscopy. TGase activity was determined measuring the incorporation of [3H]putrescine into N,N′-dimethylcasein (13.Melino G. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Piredda L. Candi E. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Piacentini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6584-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 90 mm NaCl, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm CaCl2, 12.5 mg ofN,N′-dimethylcasein/ml, 0.2 mm putrescine containing 1 mCi of [3H]putrescine. 100 ng of tTG were incubated at 37 °C with the reaction mixture in a final volume of 150 μl. After 20 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by spotting 50-μl triplicate aliquots onto Whatman 3MM filter paper. Unbound [3H]putrescine was removed by washing with 15, 10, and 5% trichloroacetic acid and absolute ethanol. Filters were then air-dried, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. GdmHCl and ANS were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. and Molecular Probes Inc., respectively. Steady-state fluorescence and anisotropy were measured with a ISS-K2 fluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL) thermostating the sample at 20 °C by an external bath circulator. The fluorescence emission decay was extrapolated fitting the phase-shift and demodulation data obtained as described elsewhere (14.Gratton E. Limkeman M. Biophys. J. 1983; 44: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) using the harmonic content of a frequency-doubled rhodamine 6G-Nd Yag laser (λex ≈293 nm) as excitation source. The emission was detected through a WG 305 cut-off filter to suppress scattered light. Either a discrete sum of exponential functions (see Equation1) f(t)=∑i=1nFie−t/τiEquation 1 or a continuously distributed model (see Equation 2) f(t)=∫0∞Fi(τ)e−t/τdτEquation 2 were employed to fit the data using the GLOBAL Unlimited software (15.Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Proc. SPIE-Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. 1988; 909: 70-81Google Scholar), where for each component F i orF i(τ) and τi or τ represented the fluorescence fractional intensity and lifetime value, respectively. In the case of a continuous function, F i(τ) had a lorentzian shape according to Equation 3, Fi(τ)=(wi/2) 2(τ−τi) 2+(wi/2) 2Equation 3 where w i is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of each component. Rotational correlation lifetimes were evaluated from the analysis of the anisotropy decay measurements, taking into account the relative fluorescence lifetimes (16.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 156-162Google Scholar). High pressure experiments were performed on the same instrument, equipped with the ISS high pressure cell. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter, at 20 °C, using a 0.1- and 1.0-cm quartz cuvette in the peptide and aromatic regions, respectively. The spectra of tTG and tTG in presence of Ca2+ or GdmHCl were corrected by subtracting the blank signal (i.e. Ca2+ or GdmHCl in buffer). In the case of tTG complexed with GTP, the correction was possible only in the aromatic region (260–300 nm), where changes due to the intrinsic absorption of the nucleotide are known to be well distinct from the complex features of the aromatic amino acids transitions (17.Johnson Jr., W.C. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 433-468Crossref Google Scholar). The unfolding of tTG by GdmHCl was achieved by incubating the protein at 4 °C in the presence of different amounts of denaturant for 12 h. Each measurement was repeated at least three times, and the relative standard deviation has been reported in the figures as an error bar. Refolding of tTG was obtained by diluting a highly concentrated, fully unfolded sample in buffer. Due to the non-coincidence of the fluorescence and CD data, the analysis of the equilibrium unfolding transition was performed according to a three-state denaturation pathway, following Scheme 1, N ↔K1 I ↔K2 UEquation EScheme_1 where K 1 and K 2are related to the free energy values ΔG 1 and ΔG 2 which were supposed to vary linearly with the denaturant concentration (18.Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar) (see Equation 4). Ki=e−ΔG0,i−mi[GdHCl]RTEquation 4 The fraction of the native (F N), partially (F I), and fully unfolded (F U) protein species were directly evaluated from the fluorescence and CD data as elsewhere described (19.Kuwajima K. Proteins. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). The steady-state fluorescence spectrum of tTG has been obtained as a function of the excitation wavelength, and the results are reported in Fig.1 a. The broad emission spectrum (FWHM ≈60 nm) and its red-shifted peak, by varying the excitation from 295–305 nm (Fig. 1 a, inset), are clear indications of fluorescence heterogeneity as expected for the presence of 12 Trp residues in tTG (20.Nakanishi K. Nara K. Hagiwara H. Aoyama Y. Ueno H. Hirose S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GTP binding to tTG induced a small decrease (≈ −1%) in the fluorescence quantum yield (Fig.1 b). Even though this change is in the limit of experimental error, the error analysis of the difference spectrum (reported in Fig.1 c) demonstrates that the shape of the tTG fluorescence spectrum is significantly affected by GTP in the wavelength region between 300 and 400 nm. The negative and positive contributions to the difference spectrum almost compensate each other keeping the fluorescence yield practically constant. Ca2+ ions did not affect the overall shape of the emission spectrum but gave a decrease (≈ −8%) of the fluorescence quantum yield (Fig. 1 b), in agreement with previous data (21.Achyuthan K.E. Mary A. Bhaerman R. Greenberg C.S. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1989; 85: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The fluorescence heterogeneity was confirmed by steady-state anisotropy measurements, which are strongly dependent on the emission wavelength, both in presence and absence of ligands (Fig. 1 b, inset). In order to characterize further the spectroscopic properties of tTG, dynamic fluorescence measurements have been carried out using the phase-shift and demodulation technique (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The data have been fit according to different decay models, either discrete or continuously distributed lifetimes (TableI). The emission decay was rather complex and, as demonstrated by the reduced χ2 values and weighted residuals (data not shown), the best fit was obtained using two lorentzian-shaped distributions of fluorescence lifetimes (Table Iand Fig. 2). This finding is consistent with the fluorescence decay expected in general for heterogeneous systems (22.Ware W.R. Ramamurthy V. Photochemistry in Organized and Costrained Media. VCH Publisher, Inc., New York1992: 563-602Google Scholar) and in particular for multitryptophan proteins (23.Bismuto E. Irace G. D'Auria S. Rossi M. Nucci R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24.Di Venere A. Mei G. Gilardi G. Rosato N. De Matteis F. McKay R. Gratton E. Finazzi Agrò A. Eur. J.

Only the longer lifetimes could be detected when the fluorescence of tTG was observed through a cut-off filter at 350 nm (Table I), demonstrating that these lifetimes are associated with tryptophans emitting at the red edge of the spectrum.Table IFluorescence decay parameters for tTG, tTG + Ca 2+, and tTG + GTPtTG decayaDiscrete (exp) or lorentzian (lor) distributed fluorescence decay models, using 1, 2, or 3 components (λex = 293 nm; λem ≥ 305 nm).χ2bReduced χ2 of phase and modulation data fit.C 1cFluorescence lifetime (i.e. center of lorentzian distribution if w 1 or w 2 are reported) in ns (ΔC 1 ≈30 ps; ΔC 2,3 ≈50 ps).w 1dWidth of lorentzian distribution in ns (Δw 1,2 ≈40 ps).F 1eFractional intensity associated to each lifetime component (F 1 + F 2 + F 3= 1; ΔF 1,2,3 ≈0.02).C 2w 2F 2C 3F3〈τ〉fAverage lifetime (Δ〈τ〉 ≈40 ps).ns%ns%ns%ns1 exp16812.641.001 lor332.873.811.002 exp130.880.244.670.762 lor1.01.292.170.404.730.570.601.653 exp1.60.500.122.310.375.900.51λem ≥ 350 nm1.10.81≤0.010.074.491.720.93+Ca2+(1:15)1.01.202.310.384.660.370.621.50−GTP (1:40)1.10.501.260.234.211.040.771.64a Discrete (exp) or lorentzian (lor) distributed fluorescence decay models, using 1, 2, or 3 components (λex = 293 nm; λem ≥ 305 nm).b Reduced χ2 of phase and modulation data fit.c Fluorescence lifetime (i.e. center of lorentzian distribution if w 1 or w 2 are reported) in ns (ΔC 1 ≈30 ps; ΔC 2,3 ≈50 ps).d Width of lorentzian distribution in ns (Δw 1,2 ≈40 ps).e Fractional intensity associated to each lifetime component (F 1 + F 2 + F 3= 1; ΔF 1,2,3 ≈0.02).f Average lifetime (Δ〈τ〉 ≈40 ps). Open table in a new tab The effect of GTP binding on the dynamic fluorescence of tTG is shown in Fig. 2. Although the two components were influenced by GTP to a different extent, the mean lifetime, <τ>, was not affected by the nucleotide binding (Table I). This finding is in keeping with the results of the steady-state measurements, since the quantum yield of the fluorescence spectrum is directly correlated to the average lifetime of the emission decay (16.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 156-162Google Scholar). The fluorescence lifetime distributions in presence of Ca2+ are also reported in Fig.2. Despite much smaller changes in this case, the parameters of both lifetime distributions were significantly different from those of the protein alone (Table I). Also in this case the relative change of <τ> (−9%) upon calcium addition correlates fairly well with the corresponding variation of quantum yield. The different protein fluorescence decays suggested the occurrence of induced conformational changes upon ligand binding, especially in the case of GTP, which could have important consequences on the protein dynamics. In order to test this hypothesis, the rotational correlation lifetimes of tTG and tTG complexed with GTP and Ca2+ were also studied measuring the fluorescence anisotropy decay. The data could be fit using at least two rotational correlation lifetimes that are reported in Table II. The slow rotation (φ2 ≈32 ns) is compatible with the motion of a hydrated sphere of ≈70 kDa (27.Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. 2. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, CA1980: 459-463Google Scholar), and therefore it might be associated with the tumbling of the whole protein molecule. This is the only parameter to be affected by both calcium and GTP, although in an opposite way. In fact Ca2+ binding produced a slighter longer rotational correlation lifetime, whereas GTP significantly reduced this value (Table II).Table IIDynamic fluorescence anisotropy parametersF 1aFractional intensity (ΔF 1, ≈0.02).φ1bRotational correlation lifetime (Δφ1 ≈30 ps; Δφ2 ≈1 ns).φ2χ2cχ2, reduced χ2 value.nsnsnstTG0.940.38320.9tTG + Ca2+(1:15)0.910.42351.1tTG + GTP (1:40)0.950.32251.0a Fractional intensity (ΔF 1, ≈0.02).b Rotational correlation lifetime (Δφ1 ≈30 ps; Δφ2 ≈1 ns).c χ2, reduced χ2 value. Open table in a new tab ANS is essentially nonfluorescent in aqueous solution, whereas its emission intensity increases in a hydrophobic environment. This effect is generally accompanied by a blue-shift in the ANS fluorescence spectrum that can be detected by evaluating the change in the spectral center of mass. These properties have been largely exploited to check the presence of hydrophobic pockets in proteins through ANS binding (16.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 156-162Google Scholar, 28.Brand L. Gohlke J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 843-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The steady-state fluorescence intensity of ANS increased about 4–5 times in the presence of tTG, whereas the spectrum was shifted toward shorter wavelengths (Fig.3 a), demonstrating that the probe was in fact bound to the protein. This effect was much greater in the presence of Ca2+, whereas GTP substantially reduced the ANS fluorescence (Fig. 3 a). The binding of ANS was studied as a function of calcium concentration. The results, reported in Fig. 3 b, demonstrate that the maximum fluorescence intensity was reached when about 4–6 ions per protein molecule were added. In order to check whether this effect was due to a change of the ionic strength, the same experiment was performed with a ratio [Ca2+]:[tTG] ≈1:2 and then adding increasing amounts of sodium chloride. No further changes in the fluorescence of ANS were observed upon addition of salt (Fig.3 b). The effect of Ca2+ and GTP on the tTG structure has been also studied by circular dichroism, both in the peptide and in the aromatic region (Fig. 4, a and b). The analysis of the protein CD spectrum in the range 200–250 nm yielded a large amount of β-structure (≈21% β-strand and ≈20% β-turn) and a significant content of α-helix (≈26%). As shown in Fig. 4 a, calcium binding did not influence the protein secondary structure, whereas a significant change was instead observed with GTP (Fig. 4 a). Previous studies have shown that the tTG secondary structure does not vary in the presence of GTP (29.Tanfani F. Bertoli E. Signorini M. Bergamini C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, it must be concluded that this effect is related to the change in the intrinsic CD signal of the nucleotide, which in fact might increase in a hydrophobic environment (17.Johnson Jr., W.C. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 433-468Crossref Google Scholar). Assuming that the tTG secondary structure does not change, we have used the difference spectrum in order to follow the GTP binding (Fig. 4 a, inset). When the same experiment was done in the presence of calcium ions, the affinity of GTP for tTG was considerably reduced, as demonstrated in theinset of Fig. 4 a. As shown in Fig. 4 b, the CD spectrum of tTG in the aromatic region is clearly structured in individual bands, characteristic of phenylalanine (267 nm), tyrosine (271 and 282 nm), and tryptophan (288 and 294 nm) residues (30.Strickland E.H. Fasman G.D. Critical Reviews in Biochemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Cleveland1974: 113-175Google Scholar). In the presence of calcium ions the spectrum was less structured, as demonstrated by the flattening of all the peaks, except at 294 nm. These types of changes are generally associated with an increased mobility of the aromatic side chains, demonstrating a different local conformation of the tTG tertiary structure upon Ca2+ binding. An opposite effect was obtained in the presence of GTP (Fig. 4 b). In particular a 2-fold increase at 288 and 294 nm and a splitting of the peak at 265 nm into two bands (Fig. 4 b) were observed. The profile of the difference spectrum (Fig. 4 c) suggests that also in this case important changes in the tTG tertiary structure are occurring. In fact, GTP generally contributes to the intensity of the signal but not to its fine structure, which is instead typical of the aromatic amino acids transitions (17.Johnson Jr., W.C. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 433-468Crossref Google Scholar, 31.Bayley P. Brown S.B. An Introduction to Spectroscopy for Biochemists. Academic Press, London, New York1980: 148-234Google Scholar). Denaturation of tTG by GdmHCl has been followed by steady-state fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. The data, reported in Fig.5 a, could not be fit by a simple two-state unfolding process, suggesting the presence of at least one intermediate species. Thus, assuming a three-step transition model, the free energy of unfolding and the population of the native, denatured, and intermediate states were calculated (TableIII and Fig. 5 b). Similar experiments were performed in the presence of Ca2+ or GTP. No effect was observed with Ca2+, whereas the binding of GTP significantly shifted the fluorescence unfolding curve toward higher concentrations of denaturant (Fig. 5 a).Table IIIThermodynamic parameters characterizing the unfolding of tTGSampleΔG 1m 1ΔG 2m 2kcal/molkcal/mol·mkcal/mol·mkcal/mol·mtTG2.1 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.1tTG + Ca2+2.0 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.22.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.2tTG + GTP2.8 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.1Parameters have been obtained fitting the CD and spectrum peak (Fig.5 a) according to a three-state denaturation process. Open table in a new tab Parameters have been obtained fitting the CD and spectrum peak (Fig.5 a) according to a three-state denaturation process. Because of the above-mentioned fluorescence properties, ANS binding has been used to study the partial exposition of hydrophobic patches upon loosening of the protein tertiary structure at increasing concentration of GdmHCl (32.Zhang Y. Gray R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8015-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33.Mei G. Di Venere A. Buganza M. Vecchini P. Rosato N. Finazzi Agrò A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10917-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Actually, the intensity and the position of the ANS emission spectrum (reported in terms of the spectral center of mass) indicate that ANS binding mostly occurred at 1.25 mGdmHCl, where the fraction of the intermediate species is maximum (Fig.5 b). This conformational modification is also accompanied by a total loss of enzymatic activity (Fig.6). A somewhat different behavior was observed when the native protein was previously incubated at 20 °C in the presence of GTP. In particular, the unfolding transition was shifted toward higher denaturant concentration and characterized by a more pronounced blue-shift of the ANS spectrum (Fig. 6 andinset). This result confirms the higher stability of tTG in the presence of GTP already demonstrated by the data reported in Fig.5 a. In order to explore in more detail this particular role of GTP, we also studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure up to 2500 bar on the stability of tTG. The quenching of the protein fluorescence intensity and the red-shifted emission already observed at a few hundreds bar (Fig. 7) indicate a progressive solvation of the inner tryptophan residues (34.Weber G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in presence of calcium, whereas less pronounced effects were obtained when GTP was bound to tTG (Fig. 7). In particular, above 1200 bar no further changes were observed at increasingly higher pressure (Fig. 7 and inset).Figure 7High pressure effects on tTG.

Chem. 1973; 248: 1301-1306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), several studies on the regulation of tTG activity proposed the occurrence of protein conformational changes upon calcium ions or GTP binding (5.Lai T.S.

The experimental evidence for these changes was based on the trypsin digestion patterns of tTG as detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have obtained more direct evidence of tTG conformational changes with spectroscopical techniques, namely CD, steady-state, and dynamic fluorescence, which are particularly suitable to investigate even subtle modifications of protein structure. Of course a detailed analysis of the fluorescence properties of every tryptophan contained in tTG is simply impossible, since proteins containing several tryptophan residues are expected to exhibit a very complex fluorescence dynamics (22.Ware W.R. Ramamurthy V. Photochemistry in Organized and Costrained Media. VCH Publisher, Inc., New York1992: 563-602Google Scholar, 23.Bismuto E. Irace G. D'Auria S. Rossi M. Nucci R. Eur. J.

Nevertheless, we have shown that the fluorescence decay may be resolved into two main distributions of lifetimes, probably associated with two classes of differently solvated tryptophans. An efficient energy transfer among different tryptophans might be another source of heterogeneous emission decay in transglutaminase. Whatever the origin of this complex fluorescence dynamics, we have shown that whereas Ca2+ does not perturb significantly the fluorescence and CD of tTG, the binding of GTP induces major changes that might be summarized as follows: (i) the change of environment of some tryptophan(s) detected through the difference CD spectrum in the aromatic region (Fig. 4 c) with a concomitant quenching of the shorter wavelength emission (Fig.1 b) and shorter lifetimes distribution (Fig. 2); (ii) a general stiffening of the molecule as shown by a shorter rotational lifetime (Table II); (iii) a more compact structure of tTG that requires higher GdmHCl concentration to be unfolded and withstands high pressure (Figs. 5 a and 7, and see below); (iv) a reduced binding of ANS (Fig. 3 a). All these changes do not appear to involve the protein secondary structure (29.Tanfani F. Bertoli E. Signorini M. Bergamini C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although they are reflected in the loss of enzymatic activity (9.Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary Ca2+ substantially increased the binding of ANS to tTG (Fig. 3 a) and the protein rotational correlation lifetime somewhat (Table II). Thus, the conformational change induced by Ca2+ seems to produce a partial “opening” of the protein structure, slowing down the rotational dynamics and allowing ANS molecules to penetrate better into a protein hydrophobic pocket. The binding of ANS may outline the mechanism by which tTG is activated by calcium ions. In fact it is known that TGase activity requires the exposure of a cysteine located in the active site (1.Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ may open the access of substrates to this cysteine. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that our estimate of the Ca2+ ions linked to tTG at the plateau of Fig.3 b is in agreement with previously published results (10.Bergamini C.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,36.Folk J.E. Cole P.W. Mullooly J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2615-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opposite effects of Ca2+ and GTP on the tTG structure reflect their effect on the activity of the enzyme. It is tempting to speculate that the former ligand opens the active site which must be large enough to allow the entrance of the protein substrates, whereas the latter makes it impossible. Equilibrium unfolding experiments show that the unfolding of tTG by GdmHCl occurs with the formation of at least one discrete intermediate species (Fig. 5 b). The most relevant properties of this transition state are as follows: an intact secondary structure with a largely solvated tridimensional folding, as shown by the CD data and by the red-shifted fluorescence spectrum (Fig.5 a); the loss of biological activity (Fig. 6); the enhanced affinity for ANS. These features are those typical of the so-called “molten globule” state, an intermediate species with a native-like secondary structure (but an almost unfolded tertiary arrangement) that has been found in the denaturation pathway of several other proteins (37.Ptitsyn O.B.

We have shown that GTP binding slightly increased the tTG tertiary structure stability (Fig. 5 a and Table III) having a major effect on the fluorescence signal in the range from 1 to 2m GdmHCl. This finding is consistent with the results obtained by Tanfani and co-workers (29.Tanfani F. Bertoli E. Signorini M. Bergamini C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using infrared spectroscopy. On the other hand, following the denaturation transition through the changes in the ANS fluorescence spectrum (Fig. 6), it has been found that GTP stabilized the intermediate species, suggesting a “protective” action extended also to the protein secondary structure. The nucleotide-complexed enzyme was even more resistant to pressure (Fig. 7). Fluorescence (41.Mei G. Di Venere A. Malvezzi-Campeggi F. Gilardi G. Rosato N. De Matteis F. Finazzi Agrò A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and phosphorescence (42.Cioni P. Strambini G.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) studies of monomeric proteins under high pressure have recently demonstrated that tryptophan emission is particularly sensitive to conformational changes occurring already in the range 1–3 kbar. In particular, since the mechanism of pressure-induced unfolding is known to be the entrance of water inside the hydrophobic core of proteins (43.Hummer G. Garde S. Garcı́a A.E. Paulaitis M.E. Pratt L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), a red-shift of the fluorescence spectrum is expected, due to the increasing hydration of buried tryptophans. Thus the effect of GTP might be due to a tTG conformational change that would prevent solvent penetration in the protein core. This hypothesis is in line with a more compact protein structure, as demonstrated by the decrease of the long rotational correlation lifetime (Table II). Detailed knowledge of the structural effects due to Ca2+, GTP, and other ligands might be crucial to understand better the regulation in vivo of the tTG activity and thus its role during cell apoptosis. In particular the higher stabilization by GTP might be crucial. In a viable cell it is in fact expected that cross-linking activity of tTG is suppressed, whereas its role as a signal-transducing GTP-binding protein is maintained (3.Melino G. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has been found that both in vitro (5.Lai T.S. Slaughter T.F. Peoples K.A. Hettasch J.M. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1776-1781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and in situ (44.Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) tTG is protected by proteolysis in the presence of GTP. Thus, the protein conformational change induced by the nucleotide binding responds to a dual function, keeping tTG inactive as transglutaminase but stable and efficient for ATP/GTP hydrolysis. An increase of calcium concentration and the presence of specific cofactors that enhance the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ reverse the effects of GTP, regenerating the cross-linking activity of tTG (5.Lai T.S.

Our results suggest that this change is mainly due to the protein structure that is probably required for the exposure of the active site."

Moreover, the Tat addition to PC12 cells up-regulated the expression of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), a specific member of the cAMP-responsive element modulator transcription factor family, in a cAMP-dependent manner. In turn, ICER overexpression abrogated the transcription activity of the TH promoter in PC12 cells, strongly suggesting ICER involvement in Tat-mediated inhibition of TH gene expression.

In some occasions, HIV-1-infected1 patients may present with an illness virtually identical to Parkinson's disease (PD), whereas, more often, they exhibit a striking sensitivity to dopamine (DA) receptor blocking drugs (3.Hriso E.

Of interest, it has also been reported that the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-1 seropositive patients shows significantly lower levels of DA with respect to HIV-1 seronegative individuals (5.Berger J.R.

Of note, a recent study demonstrated that HIV-1 infection per se induces PD, which, thus, may be considered another primary HIV-1-induced syndrome (4.Mirsattari S.M. Power C. Nath A. Movement Disorders. 1998; 13: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As microglial cells and astrocytes are infected with HIV-1, whereas neurons are not infected (6.Merrill J.E. Chen I.S.Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 23921-23927Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar); it has been hypothesized that HIV-1 viral proteins locally released by infected cells may produce neuronal dysfunction and/or loss.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the HIV-1 Tat protein could play a role in the pathogenesis of the parkinsonian features frequently observed in AIDS patients. As PD is characterized by a slow and protract loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) that project to the striatum, we explored whether Tat was able to modulate the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the PC12 dopaminergic cell line. Moreover, because it has been shown that Tat protein is rapidly taken up by intact cells both in vitro(10.Kolson D.L. Collman R. Hrin R. Balliet J.W. Laughlin M. McGann K.A. Debouck C.

Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 5% fetal calf serum (fetal calf serum, Life Technologies, Inc.). For evaluation of DA release, PC12 cells were serum-starved (DMEM + 0.1% fetal calf serum) for 40 h in 100-mm plates and then: (i) supplemented with 10–100 ng/ml of synthetic Tat (Technogen, Caserta, Italy) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V Chon, Sigma); (ii) transiently transfected with 5 μg of the construct pRPneo/tat, allowing the expression of the tat cDNA under the control of the SV40 promoter or with the pRPneo empty vector (14.Milani D. Zauli G. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Capitani S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); and (iii) stably transfected with the same plasmids described above and cultured under continuous G418 selection, as described previously (14.Milani D. Zauli G. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Capitani S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For studies on inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) promoter, PC12 cells were transiently co-transfected with 5 μg of pRPneo/tat plus 5 μg of one of these previously described plasmids (23.Mao D. Warner E.A. Gurwitch S.A. Dowd D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 492-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): (i) pICER-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), containing the ICER promoter sequence from −378 to +1 from the translational start site cloned into a ptk-CAT plasmid, in which the tk promoter was removed; (ii) pCARE1/4tk-CAT, containing the fragment of the ICER promoter corresponding to base pairs −154 to −92 cloned into a ptk-CAT plasmid; (iii) pCARE1/2tk-CAT, containing the fragment of the ICER promoter corresponding to base pairs −154 to −121 cloned in a ptk-CAT plasmid; (iv) pCARE3/4tk-CAT, containing a fragment of the ICER promoter corresponding to base pairs −120 to −92, cloned in a ptk-CAT plasmid; and (v) pCAT and ptk-CAT empty vectors. For studies on the TH promoter, PC12 cells were transiently co-transfected with 5 μg of the expression pCMV-ICER-Ib construct and 5 μg of the reporter TH2400CAT plasmid or 5 μg of the pCAT empty vector (kindly provided by Dr. C. Tinti, Cornell University, NY). In this group of experiments, forskolin (20 μm, Sigma), a potent activator of TH gene expression (24.Tinti C. Conti B. Cubells J.F. Kim K.-S. Baker H. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was added directly into medium 16 h prior to harvest. All transient transfection experiments were performed using the PerFect transfection kit reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts were prepared and tested in CAT assay as described previously (14.Milani D. Zauli G. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Capitani S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At 48 h after Tat treatment or tattransfection, the culture medium of each PC12 cell sample was harvested, filtered, and analyzed for the DA content by high performance liquid chromatography. In parallel, PC12 cells were analyzed either for TH protein and RNA expression or for the presence of dense core granules by transmission electron microscopy. For this purpose, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde PBS for 1 h, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in veronal buffer, alcohol dehydrated, and embedded in araldite. Thin sections were collected on nickel grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and analyzed with a Philips CM 10 electron microscope at 80 kV. The cAMP assay was performed using the cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after 40 h of starvation in DMEM + 0.1% FCS, 100-mm plates of PC12 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of synthetic Tat, BSA solution (0.1%), or forskolin (20 μm) for up to 30 min. Adding the lysis buffer provided by the manufacturer terminated the incubation. The intracellular cAMP content of the samples was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and expressed as pm/100 μg of proteins. For the analysis of TH protein, Western blot was performed on approximately 10 × 106 cells/experimental point. Cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (without Triton X-100), sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were discharged and the pellets were solubilized in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. These supernatants were harvested as the particulate fractions. 100 μg of proteins were migrated in a 10% acrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose filter as described previously (14.Milani D. Zauli G. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Capitani S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of anti-TH monoclonal antibody or a 1:500 dilution of anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Specific reactions were revealed with the ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the analysis of TH mRNA, a Northern blot was performed starting from total RNA extracted from 10 × 106cells/experimental point with RNAzol (Galveston, TX). 15 μg of RNA from each sample were transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled TH DNA probe, represented by the complete cDNA sequence. A XbaI/Pst 780-base pair fragment of glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase represented control probe. For the analysis of ICER mRNA, aliquots of PC12 cells were harvested, and RNA was purified using the SV total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. Synthesis of first strand cDNA and amplification were performed using an equivalent amount of RNA/each sample as template and the Access reverse transcriptase-PCR system (Promega) following the manufacturers protocol. Primers used for the amplification of ICER were as follows: 5′-ATGGCTGTAACTGGAGATG-3′ (ICER-5′-primer) and 5′-CTAATCTGTTTTGGGAGAGC-3′ (ICER-3′-primer). These primers, designed based on a previously published sequence (25.Bodor J. Spetz A.-L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) amplify two bands of approximately 300 base pairs, corresponding to ICER-Ib and ICER-γ-Ib isoforms (24.Tinti C. Conti B. Cubells J.F. Kim K.-S. Baker H. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25.Bodor J. Spetz A.-L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The conditions of the amplification, carried out for 40 cycles, were 15 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 42 °C, and 20 s at 68 °C. As a control for DNA contamination, equal amounts of RNA were used for PCR without template retrotranscription. The resulting PCR products were separated on 2% Seakem GTG agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization by using an internal oligonucleotide probe spanning the Ib exon of the ICER cDNA (5′-GAGGAACTTGAAACCTTGAAAGACATT-3′). X-ray films were scanned and evaluated by densitometry. To normalize for the quantity of template in each sample, β-actin reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out by using the rat β-actin control primers (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). β-actin PCR products were visualized under UV light after staining of agarose gel with ethidium bromide. In blocking experiments performed with pharmacological inhibitors, PC12 cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C with H89 (10−6m) and PD 98059 (10−4m, both from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO) diluted in DMEM medium, whereas control cells were treated with Me2SO diluted in DMEM + 0.1% BSA. Adult male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were divided into three groups (at least six animals each) and given: 1) BSA (10 μg/each animal) diluted in PBS; 2) synthetic Tat (10 μg/each animal) diluted in PBS, 0.1% BSA; 3) 6-OHDA (20 μg/each animal; Sigma) diluted in PBS, 0.1% BSA. At the time of surgery, the animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and placed into a stereotaxic apparatus for the performance of unilateral injection into the left striatum (coordinates: AP-1, L 3, V 4.5 from Bregma) as described (26.Zetterstrom T. Herrera-Marschitz M. Ungerstedt U. Brain Res. 1986; 376: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). At 1–4 weeks postrecovery, the injected rats were tested for rotational behavior. On the day of testing, rats were individually placed in a cylindrical acrylic cage and left to adapt for 60 min. At that time, the rats were given a subcutaneous injection of amphetamine (5 mg/kg), and rotational behavior was measured for 60 min. One day after the test period, all the animals were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 m sodium phosphate, and 1.5% methanol. Free floating sections (25 μm) were taken through the striatum and the SN and subjected to cytological staining with blue of toluidine as well as to immunohistochemical analysis for TH expression. For this purpose, slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-TH monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem) (dilution 1:25 in PBS containing 1% normal rabbit serum). After two washings with PBS, slides were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody using the avidin-biotin peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) procedure. The negative controls consisted of normal mouse serum (dilution 1:200) followed by identical second step labeling as above. The intensity of TH staining was quantitatively evaluated by using the Quantimet 500 image analyzer (Leica, Milan, Italy). Apoptosis was evaluated on both histological sections obtained from rat striatum or SN and PC12 cells by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick and labeling technique to monitor the DNA fragmentation in situ, following a previously described procedure (27.Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (9136) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using the two-tailed Student's t test. The ability of HIV-1 Tat to interfere with TH expression and DA release was first evaluated using the dopaminergic rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, which has been widely employed as a model system for dopaminergic neurons. In fact, once implanted in the striatum, PC12 cells show the ability to attenuate the DA depletion and sensorimotor impairments in rats with parkinsonian symptoms (28.Lindner M.D. Winn S.R.

As high concentrations (μm) of extracellular Tat have been reported to induce apoptosis of both primary neurons (16.Nath A. Psooy K. Martin C. Knudsen B. Magnuson D.S.K. Haughey N. Geiger J.D. J.

Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in this group of experiments, Tat was either added at low concentrations (10–100 ng/ml corresponding to 1–10 nm) or expressed endogenously in transfection experiments. Under our culture conditions, the viability of both Tat-treated andtat-transfected PC12 cells, evaluated by Trypan blue dye exclusion, was constantly >95% for all the time points examined. Conversely, the percentage of apoptosis in Tat-treated andtat-transfected PC12 cells, analyzed by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick and labeling technique, was <4% in four separate experiments. A clear-cut decrease in the levels of TH protein as well as in the steady-state TH mRNA was noticed in both tat-expressing (Figs. 1 A) and Tat-treated (not shown) cells with respect to control cells. In addition, the spontaneous release in the culture supernatant of high DA levels by PC12 cells was reduced either by the addition in culture of 10 nm extracellular Tat (p < 0.05) or by a transient (p < 0.05) or stable (p < 0.01) transfection with tat cDNA (Fig. 1 B). Of note, tat-expressing PC12 cells also showed a drastic loss of the dense core catecholaminergic granules, as evaluated by ultrastructural analysis (Fig. 1 C). The total number of dense core granules scored in high magnification transmission electron microscopy sections obtained from 50 distinct PC12 cells was 2876 compared with 189 dense core granules counted in transmission electron microscopy sections obtained from 50 tat-transfected PC12 cells. Because it has been previously shown that a specific member of the cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) family of transcription factors, the ICER (29.Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) efficiently represses the transcription activity of the TH gene promoter under both basal and protein kinase A-stimulated conditions (24.Tinti C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); we next investigated the potential role of ICER in mediating the Tat-induced down-regulation of TH gene expression in PC12 cells (Fig.2 A). As expected (24.Tinti C. Conti B. Cubells J.F. Kim K.-S. Baker H. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), background levels of ICER mRNA were observed by reverse transcriptase-PCR in PC12 left untreated. On the other hand, in the presence of 10 nm Tat, significant amounts of ICER mRNA were clearly detectable at 4 h of treatment and progressively increased reaching maximal levels after 8–24 h. In the presence of the positive control forskolin, the peak expression of ICER was observed after 8 h with a decline thereafter. In the next group of experiments, we sought to investigate whether the Tat-mediated up-regulation of ICER occurred at the transcription level. For this purpose, PC12 cells were co-transfected with tatcDNA plus a series of constructs containing the ICER promoter in front of CAT. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Tat transactivated with similar efficiency pICER-CAT, which contains the whole ICER promoter, and pCARE1/4tk-CAT, which encodes a cluster of four CRE-like elements (termed cAMP-autoregulatory elements, CAREs) located in the ICER promoter (23.Mao D. Warner E.A. Gurwitch S.A. Dowd D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 492-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, tat less efficiently transactivated pCARE1/2tk-CAT and pCARE3/4tk-CAT, which contain only two of the four CARE elements. These findings suggested that all the CARE elements significantly contributed to the Tat-mediated transactivation of ICER. Previous studies have demonstrated that Tat can either act directly at the nuclear level (10.Kolson D.L. Collman R. Hrin R. Balliet J.W. Laughlin M. McGann K.A. Debouck C. Gonzalez-Scarano F. J. Gen.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether and which of these pathways were involved in triggering ICER induction in PC12 cells, we have used H89 and PD98059, two pharmacological inhibitors specific for protein kinase A and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, respectively. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that only H89 abrogated the levels of Tat-stimulated ICER (Fig.3 A), whereas no reproducible variations were noticed in the presence of PD98059. Moreover, we found that Tat induced a rapid and transient increase in the intracellular cAMP levels in PC12 cells (Fig. 3 B), with an activation kinetic that was consistent with a role in ICER induction (34.Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To test directly whether ICER can regulate TH transcription in the PC12 cell clone used in this study, the reporter plasmid TH2400CAT and the expression plasmid pCMV-ICER-Ib (24.Tinti C. Conti B. Cubells J.F. Kim K.-S. Baker H. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were co-transfected into PC12 cells, and CAT activities were measured. Co-transfection of the ICER expression construct significantly (p < 0.05) diminished CAT activity (Fig. 4). ICER-mediated repression of forskolin-stimulated transcription of the TH construct was even more dramatic (p < 0.01) than repression of basal transcription. An experimental Parkinson's-like disease, closely resembling human PD, has been established by injecting the catecholaminergic neurotoxin 6 hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the rat striatum (26.Zetterstrom T. Herrera-Marschitz M. Ungerstedt U. Brain Res. 1986; 376: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). 6-OHDA is taken up by TH+ nigro striatal axons and causes retrograde nigral lesions resulting in almost complete destruction of DA neurons. To retrogradely target DA neurons in the SN, male adult Wistar rats received a single monolateral striatal injection of synthetic Tat, BSA, used as negative control, or 6-OHDA, used as positive control (26.Zetterstrom T. Herrera-Marschitz M. Ungerstedt U. Brain Res. 1986; 376: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Clinically, the rats did not show gross motorial abnormalities unless treated with amphetamine (5 mg/kg). This treatment, which enhances the release of DA at the striatal level, significantly (p< 0.01) increased the frequency of rotations ipsilateral to the injection side in rats treated with Tat or 6-OHDA, but not in animals injected with BSA, from week 1 post-injection onward (Fig.5). At various time points postinjection, the animals were sacrificed. Histological sections were performed through the rostrocaudal extent of the striatum and midbrain and stained for TH immunoreactivity to identify nigral DA neurons and fibers. The first signs of ongoing degenerative changes in the SN of Tat-treated animals, observed at 1 week postinjection, were a loss of TH immunoreactivity in both nigral DA neuron cell bodies and fibers on the injected side (Fig.6 A). The mean TH staining of 70 cell bodies in the lesioned and unlesioned side was 41.7 and 89.2 arbitrary units, respectively (p < 0.01). At later time points (4 weeks postinjection) a loss of TH+ neurons and fibers characterized the lesioned side of Tat-injected (Fig.6 B) and 6-OHDA-injected (Fig. 6 C) rats, whereas BSA-injected (Fig. 6 D) animals did not show any difference between the lesioned and unlesioned side. In the effort to evaluate whether the degenerative changes occurring at the level of SN of Tat- and 6-OHDA-injected rats were due to an increase of apoptosis, we applied the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick and labeling technique to histological sections. Despite the degenerative features characterizing SN TH+ neurons in both Tat- and 6-OHDA-injected animals, we were unable to observe any significant increase of apoptosis over background levels (<1.5%) in the lesionedversus the unlesioned side in either Tat- or 6-OHDA-injected animals. Although 6-OHDA (36.Takai N. Nakanishi H. Tanabe K. Nishioku T. Sugiyama T. Fujiwara M. Yamamoto K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37.Yamada M.

The cytosolic PTPs contain only one catalytic domain, whereas the membrane-bound receptor-like PTPs usually contain two tandem catalytic domains.

Previous studies using various synthetic phosphotyrosyl peptides failed to identify a shared by PTP substrate because the peptides studied were not derived from physiological substrates of PTPs. In the present study, we have addressed the structural basis for the substrate specificity of PTPs using SHP-1 and its physiological substrate SIRPα/SHPS-1 as a model. SIRPα is a transmembrane protein of the signal-regulatory protein family. Its extracellular domain contains three immunoglobulin domains, and its cytoplasmic domain contains four phosphotyrosine sites (Tyr(P)427, Tyr(P)452, Tyr(P)469, and Tyr(P)495). SHP-1 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, and contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a neighboring catalytic domain, and a C-terminal tail. Its phosphatase activity is inhibited by both the SH2 domains and the C-terminal tail (11.Townley R. Shen S.H. Banbille D. Ramachandran C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13414-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12.Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2816-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-1 is activated upon the binding of its tandem SH2 domains to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Domain-swapping studies on SHP-1 and its analogue, SHP-2, have shown that the catalytic domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 have distinct substrate specificity (9.Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B.

The C455S mutant of the SHP-1 catalytic domain (245–532) was cloned, expressed, and purified as described elsewhere (16.Liang X. Meng W. Niu T. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 201-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosyl decapeptides were synthesized and purified to 90% purity by SynPep Inc. (Dublin, CA). Crystals of the native enzyme were obtained by vapor diffusion method with 5 mg/ml protein drops equilibrating over reservoir solution containing 1.9 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5. The Tyr(P)469 complex crystals were obtained by co-crystallization method with the protein and the peptide at a 1:1 molar ratio. The Tyr(P)495 complex crystals were grown by soaking native crystals in cryosolvent (30% sucrose, 1.9m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) containing 0.5 mm peptide Tyr(P)495 for 2–3 days. A data set of the Tyr(P)469 complex diffracted up to 2.5 Å was collected at −188 °C using an ADSC cryosystem and MAR imaging plate (Area Detector System Corp., Poway, CA); the x-ray source was generated from a Rigaku (Japan) RU-300 operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. A data set diffracted to 2.3 Å resolution for Tyr(P)495 complex was collected at −180 °C on F1 beamline at CHESS (Cornell University). Both data sets were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (17.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar).

Sect. 1994; A 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar), using coordinates of the native enzyme (Protein Data Bank code 1GWZ) as the search model. The molecular replacement solution for each complex structure was refined by rigid body and positional protocols in X-PLOR (19.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The peptide positions were identified from the initial electron density difference map (F o− F c). However, the electron densities for the peptides were not quite continuous. After several cycles of model rebuilding and refinements, the electron densities for the peptides became clearer, and the peptides were added to the models. The complex models were then subjected to X-PLOR refinement, using the slow cool and positional refinement protocols with the 2 ς cutoff data between 6 Å and the highest resolution. The R-free value was also calculated from the beginning to the penultimate cycle by randomly selecting 10% data as the test set. The model building interspersed with X-PLOR refinement was done by the program TURBO-FRODO (20.Roussel A. Foutecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: C66Google Scholar). In the penultimate cycle, the R-free values were 30.3% and 27.2% for the Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 complexes, respectively. The final crystallographic R-values for the Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 complexes were 19.9 and 20.5%, respectively, with all reflections used in the refinement. Fifty-three water molecules were added in the final Tyr(P)495 complex model; however, no water molecules were added in the final Tyr(P)469 complex model. The final refinement results and geometry analyses for each complex are also summarized in Table I. SIRPα has been identified as a potential physiological substrate of SHP-1 in macrophages (13.Timms J.F. Carlberg K. Gu H. Chen H. Kamatkar S. Nadler M.J.S. Rohrschneider L.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3838-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, the dephosphorylation sites of SHP-1 on SIRPα are still unknown. To identify these sites, we synthesized four phosphotyrosyl decapeptides corresponding to the four phosphotyrosine sites in the cytoplasmic domain of SIRPα and measured the kinetic parameters of the catalytic domain of SHP-1 toward each of them (TableII). The results demonstrated that peptides Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 were effectivein vitro substrates for SHP-1. With respect to amino acid sequence, the four synthetic peptides fall into two groups: Tyr(P)427 and Tyr(P)469, and Tyr(P)452 and Tyr(P)495. The two peptides in each group have very similar sequences for the residues on the C-terminal side of residue Tyr(P). However, only one peptide in each group (Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495, respectively) is the in vitro substrate of SHP-1. Therefore, substrate specificity of the catalytic domain of SHP-1 is determined primarily by residues N-terminal to residue Tyr(P) in the peptide substrates.Table IIKinetic parameters for the catalytic domains of SHP-1 against the four synthetic phosphotyrosyl peptidesPeptidesK mk catk cat/K mμms −1s −1 mm −1Tyr(P)469(EDTLTpYADLD)80.0141.71767.5Tyr(P)495(PSFSEpYASVQ)71.580.01119.5Tyr(P)427(TNDITpYADLN)312.0217.7697.8Tyr(P)452(NNHTEpYASIQ)286.0268.1940.4 Open table in a new tab Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of SHP-1 (with C455S mutation) complexed with peptides Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 were determined at 2.5 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively (Table I). The final electron density maps around the Tyr(P) peptides in both complex structures are shown in Fig. 1 (A andB). The average B factor for peptide Tyr(P)495was higher than the average B factors for peptide Tyr(P)469and the SHP-1 catalytic domain, indicating that peptide Tyr(P)495 was very flexible. Both peptides bound to the catalytic domain of SHP-1 in extended conformations (Fig. 1, C and D). Backbones of the peptides were approximately 45 degrees to the central twist β-sheet that formed the core of the catalytic domain of SHP-1. Binding peptides Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 to the catalytic domain of SHP-1 buried 800 and 660 Å2 solvent-accessible surface, respectively. The binding of peptides Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 to the catalytic domain of SHP-1 did not bring the WPD loop (Trp419–Pro428) into the closed conformation. In contrast, the WPD loop moved from the half-open/half-closed conformation observed in the native enzyme structure (7.Yang J. Liang X. Niu T. Meng W. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28199-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) to the open conformation in the complex structures. In addition to the Tyr(P) subpocket, six substrate-binding subpockets were well defined (Fig. 2). Unlike the Tyr(P) subpocket that protruded into the center of the catalytic domain, these subpockets were relatively shallow and open to the solvent. For the convenience of discussion, we name each subpocket according to the residue numbers within the structure of the Tyr(P)469complex. In both peptides, residues at the C-terminal side of residue Tyr(P) bound to the same binding subpockets of SHP-1 with similar orientations and conformations, except for a slight difference at the P+4 subpocket. The C-terminal residues of the peptides interacted mainly with loop α1/β1 and the α5-loop-α6 motif of SHP-1 (defined in Fig. 2). P-2 was the most distinct subpocket at the N-terminal side of the Tyr(P) subpocket. It was formed by hydrocarbons from the side chains of Lys362 and Arg277 and by side chain of Tyr278. In the Tyr(P)469complex, the P-2 subpocket was occupied by LeuP-2 (Fig. 1,C and E). Surprisingly, it was occupied by PheP-3 in the Tyr(P)495 complex structure, indicating a likely residue shift at the N-terminal side of residue Tyr(P) in the Tyr(P)495 complex relative to the Tyr(P)469 complex. Because of this novel residue shift, the conformations of residue Tyr(P) were also different between the two complex structures. By shifting into the P-2 subpocket, PheP-3 pushed SerP-2 of peptide Tyr(P)495 into the P-1 subpocket, which was occupied by ThrP-1 in the Tyr(P)469 complex structure. At the same time, it pushed GlnP-1 of peptide Tyr(P)495 toward the solvent (Fig. 1 D). The kinetic studies showed that the substrate specificity of SHP-1 catalytic domain was determined mainly by residues N-terminal to residue Tyr(P) in the peptides. Between the Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495complexes, significant conformational differences were observed for peptide residues N-terminal to the P-2 subpocket (Fig. 1 E). These N-terminal residues interacted mainly with the β5-loop-β6 motif of SHP-1. Therefore, the β5-loop-β6 motif determines, at least in part, the substrate specificity of SHP-1. In both complex structures, the β5-loop-β6 motif moved approximately 6.5 Å toward the N termini of the peptides and formed different interactions with the substrates. In the Tyr(P)469 complex, AspP-4 formed a salt bridge with residue Arg360of the β5-loop-β6 motif. This salt bridge was further stabilized by two hydrogen bonds between Arg360 and Asn361(Fig. 2 A). These suggest that either an aspartate or a glutamate will be preferred for the P-4 position of the peptide substrates of SHP-1. In the Tyr(P)495 complex structure, ProP-5 was the corresponding residue to AspP-4. Because of the repulsion between the guanidine group of residue Arg360 and the hydrocarbons of residue ProP-5, ProP-5 swept away from the SHP-1 molecule into the solvent. Residue Arg360 also underwent a conformational change and formed weak van der Waals' interactions with residue ProP-5. Other N-terminal residues, such as ThrP-3 and GluP-5 of peptide Tyr(P)469 and SerP-4 in peptide Tyr(P)495, were exposed to the solvent. Like other PTPs, the signature motif of SHP-1, i.e. HCXAGXGR(S/T), formed the base for the Tyr(P) subpocket and interacted with the phosphate group of residue Tyr(P) by extensive hydrogen bonds in both complex structures (Fig. 2). Because of different binding at the P-2 subpocket, the Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 complexes had different conformations for residue Tyr(P) at the active site and therefore had different hydrogen bond networks. The Oγatom of Ser455 was 2.6 Å from the phosphorus atom of residue Tyr(P) in the Tyr(P)469 complex structure and 2.3 Å from the phosphorus atom of residue Tyr(P) in the Tyr(P)495 complex structure. The walls of the Tyr(P) subpocket were formed by residues Tyr278, Ser456, Ile459, Lys362, Gln502, and Gln506. The most prominent residue was Tyr278 in loop α1/β1, which formed a stable π−π interaction between its phenyl ring and the side chain of residue Tyr(P) in the Tyr(P)469 complex structure. However, this π−π interaction was much weaker in the Tyr(P)495complex structure because of the different conformations of Tyr278 and Tyr(P). The results indicated that peptide Tyr(P)469 had stronger binding affinity and was a more favorable in vitro substrate for SHP-1, which is consistent with the kinetic study results (Table II). In addition, Tyr278 of the enzyme was involved in defining the depth of the Tyr(P) subpocket, making the subpocket too deep to bind either phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residue. We have determined that the β5-loop-β6 motif and loop α1/β1 determined the substrate specificity of SHP-1. We also observed the novel residue shift at the P-2 subpocket. The P-2 subpocket can bind either the P-2 or the P-3 residue of phosphotyrosyl substrates, provided that they are hydrophobic residues. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a residue shift has been observed in protein-protein recognition. This novel residue shift suggests peptides containing the sequence (L/I/V)X npYXX(L/I/V) (n = 1 or 2) be potential substrates for SHP-1. The formation of the salt bridge between residue Arg360 of SHP-1 and residue AspP-4 of peptide Tyr(P)469 in the Tyr(P)469 complex structure suggests that peptides having the consensus sequence (D/E)X(L/I/V)X npYXX(L/I/V) (n = 1 or 2) are favored as substrates of SHP-1. This consensus sequence explains why peptides Tyr(P)427 and Tyr(P)452 are not in vitro substrates for SHP-1. Recently, signal transduction co-receptors CD22 and CD72 were identified as both the activators and substrates of SHP-1 (14.Otipoby K.L. Andersson K.B. Draves K.E. Klaus S.J. Farr A.G. Kerner J.D. Perlmutter R.M. Law C.L. Clark E.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 15.Adachi T. Flaswinkel H. Yakura H. Reth M. Tsubata T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4662-4665PubMed Google Scholar). Using the consensus sequence, we predict that sites Tyr777, Tyr837, and Tyr857 of CD22 and sites Tyr7 and Tyr39 of CD72 are the dephosphorylation sites of SHP-1. The catalytic domain swapping studies on SHP-1 and SHP-2 have demonstrated the different substrate specificity of the catalytic domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 (9.Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Among the six identified substrate-binding subpockets other than the Tyr(P) subpocket, only the P-4 subpocket differs between SHP-1 and SHP-2 (see Fig. 4). Residue 360, which is located at the β5-loop-β6 motif, is an arginine in SHP-1 and a lysine in SHP-2. This residue difference is one of the main reasons for the different substrate specificity of SHP-1 and SHP-2. In addition to residue 360, several other residues in the β5-loop-β6 motif also differ between SHP-1 and SHP-2. These residues confer specific recognition for P-4 and further N-terminal residues of the substrates. Comparison of the Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 complex structures with the PTP1B-hexapeptide structure (21.Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) (Fig.3) indicates significant conformational differences for residues on the N-terminal side of residue Tyr(P) between the Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 complex structures and the PTP1B-hexapeptide structure. The N terminus of the hexapeptide was positioned away from the PTP1B enzyme molecule and extended into the solvent, whereas the N termini of peptides Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 bound much closer to the catalytic domain of SHP-1. Based on the PTP1B-hexapeptide structure, Arg47 of PTP1B (equivalent to Arg279of SHP-1) was proposed to recognize and stabilize the hexapeptide through two hydrogen bonds (34). However, we propose that the different substrate specificity of PTPs is not determined by Arg47, because it is highly conserved among PTPs (Fig.4). In contrast to PTP1B, which shows indiscriminate low K m and highk cat /K m toward phosphotysosyl peptides (22.Zhang Z.Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang Z.-Y. Walsh A.B. Wu L. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5386-5392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), SHP-1 exhibits much higherk cat /K m toward peptides Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 than other phosphotyrosyl peptides (24.Dechert U. Affolter M. Harder K.W. Matthews J. Owen P. Clark-Lewis I. Thomas M.L. Aebersold R. Jirik F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The high K m values of SHP-1 toward peptide Tyr(P)469 and Tyr(P)495 are due to the fact that the substrate specificity of SHP-1 is conferred by both the catalytic domain and the two tandem SH2 domains. Subcellular relocation of SHP-1 by its SH2 domains would significantly increase the local substrate concentrations. Therefore, the SHP-1-peptide complex structures are better representations of the in vivo PTP-substrate interactions than the PTP1B-hexapeptide structure. Residues forming the six substrate-binding subpockets other than the Tyr(P) subpocket were distributed around loop α1/β1, the β5-loop-β6 motif, and the α5-loop-α6 motif. Because the catalytic domains of PTPs share a highly conserved three-dimensional structure, we aligned the amino acid sequences of 21 different PTPs around these three substrate-binding regions (Fig. 4). In addition to the hyper-variable β5-loop-β6 motif, the P+3 and P+4 subpocket-forming residues in the α5-loop-α6 motif were also variable in PTPs. This finding strongly suggests that P+3 and P+4 residues in the substrates also can be the specific recognition sites for PTPs and that the recognition is conferred by the α5-loop-α6 motif of PTPs. Residues forming the P-2 subpocket are highly conserved among PTPs, except for Yersinia PTP, suggesting that the observed residue shift at the P-2 subpocket is also present in other PTPs. Therefore, the P-2 subpocket contributes to the binding affinity of PTPs toward their substrates, without necessarily determining their substrate specificity. Residue 360, the P-4 subpocket-forming residue located in the hyper-variable β5-loop-β6 motif, is either an arginine or a lysine in most PTPs. Therefore, those PTPs will prefer either an aspartate or a glutamate residue at the P-4 position of the peptide substrates. Other residues within the β5-loop-β6 motif are highly variable among PTPs. These residues likely are involved in the formation of the P-4 subpocket and its interaction with further N-terminal residues of the peptide substrates. The above analyses indicate that PTP substrate specificity comes from two regions: the P-4 and further N-terminal sites and the P+3 and P+4 sites of the substrates. The recognition of these two regions was conferred by the β5-loop-β6 and α5-loop-α6 motifs, respectively. We thank Drs. Neal Brown, Michael Czech, Roger Davis, and Michael Green for critical reading of the manuscript."

So far, ninety different capsular polysaccharides have been identified (1.Henrichsen J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2759-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polymers are usually composed of repeating oligosaccharide subunits containing several different monosaccharides and, in many cases, are branched structures (2.Van Dam J.E. Fleer A. Snippe H. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1990; 58: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In S. pneumoniae, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of any one capsular polysaccharide are contained within a single locus on the bacterial chromosome and are termed “type-specific.” Only two type 3-specific genes,cps3D and cps3S, which encode a UDP-Glc dehydrogenase and the type 3 synthase, respectively, are essential for synthesis of the type 3 polysaccharide (3.Dillard J. Vandersea M. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), a linear structure composed of [→3)-β-d-GlcUA-(1→4)-β-d-Glc-(1→] repeating units (4.Reeves R. Goebel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 139: 511-517Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Two other genes, cps3U, encoding a Glc-1-P uridylyltransferase, and cps3M, encoding a homologue of phosphoglucomutases, are present in the type 3-specific locus. These sequences are not essential for type 3 capsule synthesis, however, because the functions they encode are duplicated by other genes in the pneumococcal chromosome (3.Dillard J. Vandersea M. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5.Caimano M.J. Hardy G.G. Yother J. Microb.

Flanking either side of the type-specific genes are sequences common to all capsule types (7.Dillard J. Yother J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8.Guidolin A. Morona J. Morona R. Hansman D. Paton J. Inf. Immun. 1994; 62: 5384-5396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Munoz R.

These common genes have been proposed to play a role in polysaccharide transport and in determination of polysaccharide chain length in some capsular polysaccharides. In type 3 strains, however, most of these sequences are mutated and are not required for polysaccharide synthesis or transport (3.Dillard J. Vandersea M. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5.Caimano M.J. Hardy G.G. Yother J. Microb.

No other sequences likely to be involved in transport of the type 3 polysaccharide have been identified, and this function may be performed by the type 3 synthase. The type 3 polysaccharide synthase (Cps3S)1 shares significant protein homology with several other glycosyltransferases from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including the hyaluronan synthase fromS. pyogenes, the Nod factor oligosaccharide synthase (NodC) from Rhizobium meliloti, FbfA ofStigmatella aurantiaca, pDG42 of Xenopus laevis, and chitin synthases from both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans (3.Dillard J. Vandersea M. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes produce homopolymers or polysaccharides with a simple disaccharide repeat, and current evidence suggests that each is capable of forming all of the glycosidic linkages present in their respective polysaccharides (3.Dillard J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobic cluster analysis of the deduced sequences of these proteins has revealed two conserved domains that are believed to be responsible for binding the nucleotide sugars and catalyzing the formation of the glycosidic linkages (22.Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 28581-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23.Saxena I., R. Brown J. Fevere M. Geremia R. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this analysis, it has been proposed that these glycosyltransferases synthesize polysaccharide via a common mechanism that involves dual addition of sugars to the growing saccharide chain (23.Saxena I., R. Brown J. Fevere M. Geremia R. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smith et al. (24.Smith E. Mills G. Bernheimer H. Austrian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1876-1880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that type 3 synthase activity resides within the particulate fraction of S. pneumoniaelysates. Using a type 3-specific antibody to precipitate and quantitate polysaccharide, they observed synthesis of type 3 polysaccharide using cell-free lysates, uridine nucleotide sugars, and a divalent metal cation (24.Smith E. Mills G. Bernheimer H. Austrian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1876-1880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the observed membrane location of type 3 synthase activity, the deduced amino acid sequence of Cps3S contains four hydrophobic domains potentially capable of spanning the membrane (3.Dillard J. Vandersea M. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The role of Cps3S as the type 3 synthase was demonstrated using isogenic strains containing insertion mutations either in or immediately downstream from cps3S. Type 3 polysaccharide could be synthesized in the in vitro system using crude membrane preparations from the latter but not from the former, thus establishing cps3S as the critical gene (3.Dillard J. Vandersea M. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Expression of the synthase in Escherichia coli has proven difficult, apparently because of toxicity of the membrane protein (3.Dillard J. Vandersea M. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13.Arrecubieta C. Lopez R. Garcia E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The only reported clone expressing the enzyme produced low levels of protein, despite being contained in a high copy number expression vector (13.Arrecubieta C. Lopez R. Garcia E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The possibility of mutations in the clone was not eliminated, but a small amount of type 3 polysaccharide was synthesized in the E. coli strain, further confirming the assignment ofcps3S as the type 3 synthase. Because production of high levels of synthase from cloned products has not been possible, we chose to use membranes isolated from S. pneumoniae as a source of synthase activity for further biochemical studies. Using an assay that measures the incorporation of radiolabeled sugars into polysaccharide, we have characterized the mechanism of type 3 polysaccharide synthesis. Mutanolysin, Type VIII-A β-glucuronidase fromE. coli, β-glucosidase from Caldocellum sachrolyticum, Sepharose 2B, UDP-Glc, and UDP-GlcUA were obtained from Sigma. UDP-[14C]Glc (257 mCi/mmol) and UDP-[14C]GlcUA (287 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Andotek. Todd Hewitt Broth and yeast extract were from Difco. Type 1 and type 3 polysaccharides were from the American Type Culture Collection. Scinti Verse I was obtained from Fisher. Membranes containing type 3 synthase were isolated from S. pneumoniae based on a previously described procedure (25.Yother J. White J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2976-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The encapsulated type 3 strain WU2 and its nonencapsulated isogenic derivative JD908, which contains an insertion mutation incps3S, have been described (7.Dillard J. Yother J. Mol.

Med. 1981; 153: 694-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). A 4-liter culture was grown at 37 °C in Todd Hewitt Broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to a density of 3 × 108 colony forming units/ml. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellets were washed once in 2 liters of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 5.4 mmNa2HPO4·7H20, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and then suspended in 200 ml of protoplast buffer (20% sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2.5 mm Mg2S04). Mutanolysin was added to a final concentration of 20 units/ml, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight. Protoplast formation was checked by examining the cells using a phase contrast light microscope. The protoplasts were sedimented by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 20 min, washed once in 200 ml of protoplast buffer, and then osmotically lysed by suspension in 100 ml of sterile water containing 10 mm EDTA. Lysis was confirmed by light microscopy. The membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, washed three times in 40 ml of 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10 mmsodium thioglycolate, and suspended in 15 ml of the same buffer. The final membrane preparation was adjusted to 3 mg protein/ml in 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10 mmsodium thioglycolate and stored at −20 °C. Type 3 synthase activity was determined by the incorporation of 14C label from either UDP-[14C]Glc or UDP-[14C]GlcUA into polysaccharide. Synthase assays were performed in a 100-μl reaction that contained 100 mm Hepes (pH 8), 10 mmsodium thioglycolate, 10 mm MnCl2, UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcUA, and membranes isolated as described above. The concentrations of UDP-Glc, UDP-GlcUA, and membrane protein are indicated elsewhere in the text and in the figure legends. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 32 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 10 μl of 12.5 m glacial acetic acid, and the reaction components were separated by ascending paper chromatography on 3 MM Whatman paper in ethanol (95%):1 mammonium acetate (pH 7.0), 7:3 (v/v) for 16–18 h. The chromatograms were dried, and the product retained at the origin (1 inch strip) was determined by liquid scintillation counting in Scinti Verse I. Isolated membranes containing 300 μg of total protein were added to reactions containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8), 10 mm sodium thioglycolate, 10 mmMnCl2, UDP-Glc, and UDP-GlcUA in a 600-μl volume. The reactions were incubated at 32 °C, and, at the times indicated in the figure legends, 50-μl samples were taken. These aliquots were submitted to the following protocol to determine the amount of soluble and membrane-associated polysaccharide formed under various experimental conditions. EDTA was added to the aliquots to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the samples were stored on ice. The volume was adjusted to 200 μl with 100 mm Hepes (pH 8) buffer containing 10 mm sodium thioglycolate. The membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatants were saved, and the pellets were suspended in 200 μl of the same buffer. The membranes were sedimented again by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were combined with the previous supernatants, and the pellets were suspended in 400 μl of the same buffer. Aliquots of the supernatant and pellet fractions were chromatographed on paper as described above for the synthase assay. The radioactivity at the origin, as well as that corresponding to authentic UDP-Glc, was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Gel filtration of polysaccharide samples was performed on a 1.4 × 37 cm Sepharose 2B column equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl and 5 mmTris acetate (pH 7.4). SDS was added to the sample to a final concentration of 2% (v/v) prior to application to the column. The column flow rate was 16 ml/h, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The void and total volumes were determined using 0.798-μm diameter latex beads (Sigma) and [14C]Glc, respectively. Polysaccharide that eluted between 18 and 30 ml on Sepharose 2B is referred to as high molecular weight. The components of the hydrolysates were separated by ascending paper chromatography in ethanol (95%)/1m ammonium acetate (pH 7), 7:3 (v/v) or 1-propanol/ethyl acetate/water, 7:1:2 (v/v/v). The chromatograms were cut into 1-cm strips, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Monosaccharide standards were visualized usingp-anisidine-phthalate (27.Zweig G. Whitaker J.R. Paper Chromatography and Electrophoresis. Academic Press, New York1967Google Scholar). Type 3 polysaccharide-specific monoclonal antibody 16.3 (28.Briles D.E. Claflin J.L. Schroer K. Forman C. Nature. 1981; 294: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was coupled to Sepharose 2B as described (29.Springer T.A. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The antibody-conjugated beads (0.5–1 ml) were packed into 2-ml columns and washed with 10 column volumes of 5 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 m NaCl. Labeled polysaccharide was applied to the column, and the column was washed with the same buffer. Three 1.5-ml samples were collected, and 100 μl of each fraction was chromatographed on paper as described for the assay of synthase activity. The percentage of radioactive polysaccharide that bound to the column was determined as 100 × [(total counts applied − recovered counts)/total counts]. Labeled polysaccharide that bound to the antibody affinity column described above was eluted with 0.05 m glycine (pH 2.5) buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.15 m NaCl. Seven 1-ml fractions were collected in tubes containing 100 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). A portion (100 μl) of each fraction was chromatographed on paper as described for the synthase assay, and column fractions that contained labeled polysaccharide were pooled. The type 3 polysaccharide-specific depolymerase was isolated from Bacillus circulans (ATCC 14175) using a modification of a previously described procedure (30.Torriani A. Pappenheimer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 5-ml culture of B. circulans was grown to mid exponential phase in THY, diluted 1/5 in fresh THY, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Expression of the depolymerase by B. circulans was induced by the addition of 50 μl of heat killed type 3 S. pneumoniae strain WU2, grown to late exponential phase, centrifuged, and concentrated 30-fold in THY. A second inoculum (50 μl) of WU2 was added after 60 min, and the B. circulansculture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 60 min. The cells were then heat killed at 65 °C for 20 min and sedimented for 2 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −70 °C. For preparation A, uniformly labeled polysaccharide membranes (300 μg of total protein) were incubated in a 200-μl reaction containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8), 10 mmsodium thioglycolate, 10 mm MnCl2, 400 μm UDP-GlcUA, and 400 μm UDP-Glc (7 mCi/mmol) for 30 min at 32 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% SDS to a final concentration of 2% and chromatographed on Sepharose 2B as described above. For preparation B, terminally labeled polysaccharide membranes (1.5 mg of total protein) were incubated in a 1-ml reaction containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8), 10 mm sodium thioglycolate, 10 mmMnCl2, 400 μm UDP-GlcUA, and 400 μm UDP-Glc for 30 min at 32 °C. The reaction mixture was placed on ice, and 1 ml of ice-cold 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol was added. The membranes in the reaction mixture were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The pelleted membranes were suspended in 2 ml of 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol and sedimented as above. The membranes were washed four more times using this procedure. The washed membranes were incubated in a 1-ml reaction containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8), 10 mm sodium thioglycolate, 10 mm MnCl2, and 2 μm UDP-Glc (287 mCi/mmol) for 30 min at 32 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% SDS to a final concentration of 2% and then chromatographed on Sepharose 2B as described above. For preparation C, low molecular weight terminally labeled polysaccharide membranes (1.5 mg of total protein) were incubated in a 1-ml reaction containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8), 10 mm sodium thioglycolate, 10 mmMnCl2, and 2 μm UDP-Glc (287 mCi/mmol) at 32 °C for 10 min. The reaction was sonicated for 1 min in a sonicating water bath at 80 watts (Ultrasonics, Plainview, NY) to release the polysaccharide from the membrane. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble polysaccharide was purified by chromatography on antibody-Sepharose 2B as described above. Disaccharide produced by partial acid hydrolysis was treated with Type VIII-A β-glucuronidase (27, 800 units/ml) at 37 °C for the times indicated. Digestion of polysaccharide with β-glucosidase was performed in a 100-μl reaction containing 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and β-glucosidase (3 units/ml) at 37 °C for the times specified. Experiments using the type 3 polysaccharide-specific depolymerase fromB. circulans (purification described above) were performed in 20 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.2% sodium azide at 37 °C for the length of time specified. Protein concentrations were determined using the micro protein determination kit from Sigma. Membranes were isolated from the type 3 S. pneumoniae strain WU2 and from an isogenic derivative (JD908) that is nonencapsulated because of an insertion mutation in cps3S. Synthase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of 14C from UDP-[14C]Glc into polysaccharide. Membranes from the parent strain incorporated 15,301 cpm, whereas membranes from the mutant strain, under identical assay conditions, incorporated 31 cpm (data not shown). These data confirmed that Cps3S is the critical enzyme responsible for the activity measured in this assay and that incorporation of label does not occur in the absence of type 3 polysaccharide synthesis. The activity of the parent type 3 synthase was characterized by measuring the incorporation of 14C from both UDP-[14C]Glc and from UDP-[14C]GlcUA into capsular polysaccharide. Formation of 14C-labeled product using membranes isolated from the parent strain was linear with time for up to 30 min and was proportional to protein concentration. Incorporation of [14C]Glc or [14C]GlcUA in the absence of the other substrate was <5% that observed when substrates were at equal concentrations. The synthase was active in the presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+, with the highest level of activity observed with 5–20 mm Mn2+(Fig. 1). The optimal pH for the synthase was between 8 and 8.5 in a reaction mixture containing either 10 mm Mn2+ or 10 mm Mg2+(data not shown). The apparent K m values for both UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA were lower in the presence of Mn2+than with Mg2+ (Table I).Table IThe effect of metal ion on Michaelis-Menton constantsMetal ionaThe concentration of metal ion in each reaction was 10 mm.SubstratebThe concentration of substrate ranged from 0 to 200 μm.K mcK m values were determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots.μmMn2+UDP-GlcUA8.5 ± 1.2UDP-Glc11.9 ± 0.7Mg2+UDP-GlcUA31.3 ± 2.0UDP-Glc64.9 ± 7.0Synthase reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with membranes containing 15 μg of total protein.

The concentration of either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA was held at a concentration of 100 μm, whereas the concentration of the other substrate was varied. The data are the results of duplicate samples. Polymer synthesized in a 2-h incubation with a high concentration (400 μm) of both UDP sugars eluted in the excluded volume of a Sepharose 2B column (data not shown). Polysaccharide labeled with UDP-[14C]Glc was completely hydrolyzed by 4 nHCl to [14C]Glc in 2 h at 100 °C (Fig.2 A). Polysaccharide labeled with UDP-[14C]GlcUA was completely hydrolyzed to [14C]GlcUA and GlcUA-lactone under the same conditions (Fig. 2 B). The presence of Glc and GlcUA in the polymer was confirmed by chromatography in a second solvent containing 1-propanol/ethyl acetate/water, 7:1:2 (data not shown). Hydrolysis in 1n HCl of both [14C]Glc- and [14C]GlcUA-labeled polysaccharide resulted in the liberation of both monosaccharides, as well as a product that migrated between 6 and 11 cm from the origin, suggestive of a disaccharide (Fig.2, A and B). Mild hydrolysis of polysaccharides containing GlcUA readily yields aldobiouronic acids because of the strong resistance of the uronidic linkage to hydrolysis with acids (31.Pigman W.W. Goepp R.M., J. Chemistry of Carbohydrates. Academic Press, New York1948Google Scholar). When the putative disaccharide was digested with exo-β-glucuronidase, 75% of the radioactivity was liberated as free glucose (Fig. 2 C). These results confirmed the presence of a β-glucuronidic linkage and are consistent with the slower migrating product being the disaccharide GlcUA-β-Glc. Additional evidence for the identity of the polysaccharide was obtained by digestion of the high molecular weight polysaccharide with a type 3 polysaccharide-specific depolymerase from B. circulans. This enzyme is highly specific for type 3 polysaccharide and has been shown to hydrolyze the β1,4 linkages of this polymer to yield oligosaccharides with an average length of a tetrasaccharide (30.Torriani A. Pappenheimer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment with the depolymerase for 48 h, the high molecular weight [14C]Glc-labeled polysaccharide was degraded to a lower molecular weight product as determined by chromatography on Sepharose 2B (Fig. 3). Identical results were obtained using [14C]GlcUA-labeled polysaccharide (data not shown). A monoclonal antibody specific for type 3 polysaccharide was coupled to Sepharose 2B and shown to specifically bind the high molecular weight polymer. Columns packed with 0.5 ml of the antibody-conjugated beads bound 99% of both the [14C]Glc-labeled and the [14C]GlcUA-labeled high molecular weight products (data shown in Fig. 4 for the Glc-labeled product). The addition of unlabeled type 3 polysaccharide added along with the labeled polysaccharide resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of binding of the [14C]Glc-labeled polymer (Fig. 4). No inhibition was observed when unlabeled type 1 polysaccharide was added. All of these results confirmed that the isolated product had the expected properties of authentic type 3 polysaccharide. Pulse-chase experiments with the type 3 synthase showed that low molecular weight polysaccharide labeled in a 3-min pulse could be chased after 20 min into high molecular weight chains that eluted near the excluded volume of a Sepharose 2B column (Fig. 5). A polysaccharide of intermediate length was observed after a 5-min chase. These results are suggestive of a processive biosynthetic mechanism, whereby the elongating polysaccharide chain remains associated with the enzyme-membrane complex. To further evaluate the mechanism of the synthase reaction, we investigated the association of polysaccharide with the enzyme complex during the course of synthesis. Reaction mixtures containing 100 μm UDP-Glc and 200 μm UDP-GlcUA were sampled during a 60-min incubation and sedimented by centrifugation to separate the soluble polysaccharide from the membrane-associated polysaccharide. There was a steady increase in the incorporation of [14C]Glc into membrane-associated polysaccharide during the first 30 min of incubation, whereas only a small fraction (12.4%) was incorporated into soluble polysaccharide (Fig.6 A). By 60 min, the fraction of radioactivity found as soluble polysaccharide had increased to 35%, whereas the amount found as membrane-associated polysaccharide had begun to decrease, suggesting that the membrane-associated product might be a precursor to the soluble polymer. At lower concentrations of UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA (2 and 20 μm, respectively), the incorporation of Glc into membrane-associated polysaccharide reached a maximum by 5 min and then declined rapidly so that by 30 min approximately equal amounts of label were found in the soluble and membrane-associated fractions. Again, Glc was initially incorporated into membrane-associated polymer, which was subsequently released as a soluble form. The soluble and membrane associated polysaccharides obtained under a variety of conditions were analyzed by Sepharose 2B chromatography. Similar size profiles were observed for both fractions, indicating that release of the polysaccharide from the membrane was independent of the size of the polymer (data not shown). Although size did not appear to be a factor in polysaccharide release, the increase in the soluble form of polysaccharide in Fig. 6 coincided with the depletion of UDP-Glc.

The life cycle of these parasites alternates between the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector and is characterized by the expression of two major surface glycoproteins: the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG)1 and procyclic acidic repetitive protein (PARP) during the bloodstream and insect mid-gut stages respectively. An extensive literature exists concerning the function and expression of these two surface proteins (1.Borst P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 701-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 2.Pays E. Steinert M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3.Roditi I. Pearson T.W. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 79-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although these studies have provided many fascinating insights, they have tended to occlude the question of other surface proteins in trypanosomes to the extent that by comparison with other eukaryotes our knowledge of trypanosomal surface proteins in general is characterized more by paucity than fecundity. In fact, apart from VSG and PARP only three other surface proteins have been characterized in detail: the heterodimeric transferrin receptor (4.Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J.

This shortcoming has been recognized by several workers, and a variety of approaches have been employed, with varying degrees of success, to provide a more complete description of the content, function, expression, and organization of trypanosomal surface membrane proteins (10.Overath P. Chaudri M. Steverding D. Ziegelbauer K. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 53-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11.Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). First, functional assays have been used to identify receptors for lipoproteins and lytic factors (12.Coppens I. Baudhuin P.

Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar), but the molecular nature of the proteins responsible remains to be established. Second, nucleotide sequencing of the VSG and PARP transcription units has identified several expression site-associated genes, termed ESAGs and procyclin expression site-associated genes, which may code for plasma membrane proteins; but, with the exception of ESAGs4, 6, and 7, the function and cellular location of the proteins encoded by these genes have yet to be established unequivocally (10.Overath P.

Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Third, classical biochemical approaches, involving surface labeling of whole cells using biotinylation or iodination, have allowed the identification, purification, and subsequent cloning of several stage-specific, invariant surface glycoproteins (18.Jackson D.G. Voorheis H.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1032-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19.Ziegelbauer K. Overath P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29212-29221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Finally, the heterologous expression of trypanosomal cDNAs in fibroblasts followed by immunoselection with appropriated antisera has been employed to identify procyclic stage surface proteins (23.Jackson D.G. Smith D.K. Luo C. Elliot J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study extends the latter approach by including an additional round of selection by orientation-specific PCR, using the mini-exon found at the 5′-end of all mature transcripts in trypanosomes, to select and amplify cDNA clones encoding surface membrane proteins from bloodstream as well as procyclic forms of the cell. This strategy led to the characterization of an alanine-rich, bloodstream stage-specific protein in Trypanosoma brucei which was related to the major surface antigen of a different life cycle stage of a different species of trypanosome: the glutamate- and alanine-rich protein, termed GARP, of procyclic forms of Trypanosoma congolense. In contrast to other surface proteins in T. brucei (11.Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), BARP appears to be present in lipid microdomains that are distributed over the entire cellular surface from the posterior end of the cell body to the tip of the flagellum. All radiochemicals and nitrocellulose filters were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. N-Glycosidase F was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Promega and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Other reagents were of the highest purity available. Monomorphic bloodstream forms of T. bruceistrain MITat 1.1 were propagated in laboratory rats and purified as described previously (16.Voorheis H.P. Gale J.S. Owen M.J. Edwards W. Biochem. J. 1977; 180: 11-24Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Insect procyclic forms of T. brucei were cultivated in SDM-79 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum (24.Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Tropica. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperimmune antisera to parasite antigens from each life cycle stage were raised by immunizing rabbits with either live procyclic trypanosomes (2 × 108 cells) or with plasma membranes (∼ 3 mg of protein) purified from bloodstream trypomastigotes (MITat 1.1) as described previously (16.Voorheis H.P. Gale J.S. Owen M.J. Edwards W. Biochem. J. 1977; 180: 11-24Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both antisera were preabsorbed against COS cells in two successive overnight incubations (1.5 ml of serum/1.4 × 108 cells) to remove heterophylic antibodies. cDNA libraries were constructed in pCDM8 (25.Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) using total cellular RNA from bloodstream (MITat 1.1) and insect procyclic forms of T. brucei exactly as described in our original report (23.Jackson D.G. Smith D.K. Luo C. Elliot J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Libraries were transfected separately into COS cells (50 μg of DNA/107 cells) by electroporation (960 microfarads, 750 V/cm). After 48 h in culture (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum), both sets of transfectants were lifted in PBS, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA (1 h, 37 °C). The cells were then incubated (5 °C, 1 h) with antisera against either purified plasma membranes from bloodstream stage parasites or whole procyclic life cycle stage parasites. In each case the antisera were used at a final dilution of 1/12 in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, fetal calf serum (10%, v/v), and sodium azide (0.02%, w/v). Cell suspensions were centrifuged (1,000 ×g, 3 min) through Ficoll 400 (3%, w/v in PBS, pH 7.5) to remove unreacted antibody before “panning” (3 h, 25 °C) on bacteriological plastic dishes coated with affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG, Fc fragment-specific antibody (Jackson Immunochemicals, West Grove, PA). Plasmids were recovered from the adherent surface antigen-expressing cells using the Hirt procedure, transformed into Escherichia coli MC1061p3 by electroporation, amplified, and re-transfected into fresh COS cells by spheroplast fusion for two more rounds of immunoselection by antibody panning. Plasmids rescued from the third round of panning were finally amplified after transformation of E. coli to yield two “mini-libraries” enriched for either bloodstream or procyclic stage surface antigen cDNAs. cDNA mini-libraries enriched for either bloodstream or procyclic stage surface antigen cDNAs were used as templates in two separate PCRs designed to amplify full-length sense-oriented clones containing the trans-spliced mini-exon sequence. Each PCR consisted of the appropriate template DNA (100 ng) in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 0.5 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, the forward mini-exon primer P1EcoRI (5′-CCGGAATTCGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′) the reverse primer pCDM8KpnI (5′-CAGGGTACCTAGGTATGGAAGATCCCTC-3′) each at 0.2 μm, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (0.25 mm each), and Taq polymerase 2U in a final volume of 100 μl. The cycle parameters were 94 °C, 1 min; 42 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 1 min for 30 cycles in a Techne PHC-1A thermal cycler. Products were recovered on glass beads (Geneclean, Bio 101, U. K.), digested with EcoRI and KpnI, and subcloned into doubly digested pUC19. Inserts of positive clones were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (26.Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar) using the U. S. Biochemicals Sequenase version 2.0 kit in conjunction with primer walking where required. Sequence analysis was performed using the GCG/Wisconsin software (27.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The procedures employed for the isolation of DNA and RNA as well as Southern and Northern blot hybridizations are described elsewhere (28.Pays E. Delronche M. Lheureux M. Vervoot T. Bloch J. Gannon F. Steinert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5965-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A 518-base pair XmnI/PvuII fragment that represented approximately two-thirds of the BARP open reading frame was isolated and subcloned into SmaI-digested pGEX2T. The fusion construct was sequenced using flanking vector sequences as primers to ensure that the sequence derived from the BARP gene was in the correct orientation and in-frame with the GST gene. Expression of the fusion product was induced in E. coli(29.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fusion product, which migrated as a single band at the expected molecular mass of about 42 kDa (26 kDa from GST plus 16 kDa from BARP), was clearly visible on SDS-PAGE and was purified by GST affinity chromatography. Polyclonal anti-BARP antibodies were raised in rabbits, and the IgG fraction was prepared as described previously (21.Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blots were performed as described previously (21.Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P.

Trypanosomes were washed once with PBS (136 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mmKH2PO4, 40 mm sucrose, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.6) and then resuspended (2 × 107 cells/ml) in the same buffer at 0–4 °C. The cell suspension was mixed gently by inversion several times with an equal volume (20–25 °C) of freshly prepared paraformaldehyde (6%, w/v) in PBS adjusted to pH 7.6. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After washing, the fixed cells were resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml and applied to polylysine-coated slides. After attachment of the cells the slides were washed with PBS containing glycine (1 mg/ml) and processed as described previously (21.Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using primary anti-BARP antibodies (1/250 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1/500 dilution). The cells were viewed and photographed using a laser confocal microscope equipped with a digital in situ imaging system. All steps were performed at 0–4 °C unless otherwise stated. A sample of surface radioiodinated (21.Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells (1 × 108 cells) was mixed with a suspension of freshly isolated trypanosomes (109 cells). The mixed suspension was washed twice in 50 mm Tes buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 10 mm glucose, and the pellet was resuspended (1.1 ml) in Tes buffer without glucose but containing CHAPS (1%, w/v), 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm E-64, 50 μm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 mm EDTA. After a 1-h incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was washed once, and the combined supernatants (total volume 3.5 ml) were concentrated and the Tes buffer replaced with 30 mm imidazole buffer, pH 6.5, containing 20 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors by repeated ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 filtration units (Amicon). After buffer exchange was completed the extract was applied (0.25 ml/min) to a DEAE-52 column (4 ml of packed resin) which had been equilibrated with imidazole buffer. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer before the application of a pH gradient (pH 6.5–4.0). Fractions were collected and samples analyzed for their content of radioactivity as well as for the presence of BARP by ELISA as described previously for ISG100 (22.Nolan D.P. Jackson D.G.

Fractions containing BARP, as judged by ELISA, or the peak of the 125I label were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against VSG or BARP, and those fractions containing the heterogeneous material corresponding to BARP were pooled. These pooled fractions were concentrated, dialyzed, and the imidazole buffer replaced with Tes buffer by ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 units (Amicon). Samples of these pooled fractions were treated with N-glycosidase F essentially as described previously (21.Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Nolan D.P. Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Pays A. Geuskens M. Michel A. Voorheis H.P. Pays E. J. Biol.

Briefly, SDS and β-mercaptoethanol were added to the to give a final concentration of 0.05% (w/v) and 19 mm, respectively. After these additions the sample was incubated at 75 °C for 3 min, allowed to cool, and then 1/5 of the volume (of the sample) of 6 × deglycosylation buffer (0.3m Na2HPO4, pH 7.6, 60 mm EDTA, N-octyl glucoside (6%, w/v), and β-mercaptoethanol (6%, v/v))was added plus N-glycosidase F (5 units/ml, final) and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. These conditions have been shown to result in the complete removal ofN-linked carbohydrate from several surface proteins fromT. brucei (21.Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Nolan D.P. Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Pays A. Geuskens M. Michel A. Voorheis H.P. Pays E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29212-29221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated trypanosomes were subjected to a cold non-ionic detergent extraction procedure similar to that employed previously for the preparation of detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched microdomain fractions from T cells (30.Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). All manipulations were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. The cells (2–3 × 108 cells) were lysed on ice in 1 ml of MNE buffer (50 mm Mes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, and 1% Triton X-100, w/v) by gentle sonication (five bursts of 5 s at 5 W). The lysate was centrifuged in an Eppendorf for 5 min at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant (1 ml) was mixed with an equivalent volume of 80% sucrose made with MNE buffer and transferred to a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube. This solution was carefully overlaid with 2 ml of 35% sucrose followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose (both prepared in MNE buffer), and the tubes were placed in a cooled AH650 Sorvall rotor. After centrifugation for 16–18 h at 38,000 rpm, the tubes were removed, and the gradient was fractionated by the sequential collection of 2-ml, 1-ml, and finally 2-ml fractions from the top to the bottom of the gradient. The upper 2-ml fraction represented the detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched fraction because these fractions float in these sucrose gradients and are well separated from other detergent-insoluble material such as cytoskeletal assemblies (32.Parton R.G. Simons K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The proteins present in each fraction were concentrated by the precipitation procedure of Wessel and Flugge (33.Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Analy. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). Previously we employed heterologous expression in COS cells to identify cDNAs coding for surface proteins in procyclic forms of T. brucei (23.Jackson D.G. Smith D.K. Luo C. Elliot J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach was extended to include bloodstream forms and included a further round of selection by orientation-specific PCR amplification. A range of different amplification products was obtained from immunoselected mini-libraries from both life cycle stages of T. brucei (Fig. 1). Three of the principal PCR products from either life cycle stage were selected for further analysis (see arrowheads in Fig. 1). Southern blot analysis indicated that all of the selected products were stage-specific (results not shown). The selected products were purified and subcloned into pUC19. Sequence analysis revealed that the two smaller procyclic stage products (∼0.8 and 0.5 kb) coded for two isoforms of PARP, the major surface antigen of procyclic forms ofT. brucei, whereas the largest product (∼1.4 kb) coded for another relatively abundant procyclic surface protein, termed PSSA-2 (23.Jackson D.G. Smith D.K. Luo C. Elliot J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the bloodstream stage amplification products, only one of the selected products (∼1.4 kb) contained a complete open reading frame. Sequencing of this 1.4-kb PCR product revealed an insert of 1344 base pairs beginning with 10 nucleotides of the mini-exon primer (EBI data bank accession numberY17281). The insert contained a single open reading frame with initiation and termination codons at positions 67 and 849, respectively. This was followed by a 3′-untranslated region of 492 nucleotides which lacked a poly(A) tail. The translated amino acid sequence predicted a polypeptide containing 261 amino acid residues (∼27.6 kDa) which was rich in alanine (∼20%) and glutamic acid (∼12%) with a predicted acidic pI of 4.6 and, consequently, was termed BARP for bloodstream alanine-rich protein (Fig.2 A). Two potential sites forN-glycosylation were present in the COOH-terminal half of the protein. The hydrophobicity analysis (34.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the predicted protein was hydrophilic but contained hydrophobic segments at the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the protein (Fig. 2 B). The NH2-terminal region was predicted to function as a leader peptide and contained a possible site for proteolytic cleavage at position 18 (35.Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar), whereas the COOH-terminal hydrophobic extension has the potential to act as a cleavable signal peptide for the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor with glycine at position 238 predicted to be the probable addition site of the anchor (36.Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). A search of existing protein sequences using the FASTA analysis program revealed a potential homology between BARP and the major surface protein of procyclic forms of T. congolense(Fig. 3), a protein termed GARP for glutamate- and alanine-rich protein (37.Bayne R.A.L. Kilbride E.A. Lainson F.A. Tetley L. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38.Beecroft R.P. Roditi I. Pearson T.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition to this homology at the amino acid sequence level, the two proteins also shared a number of additional features, which suggested that these two proteins from different life cycle stages of different species ofTrypanosoma may be related (see “Discussion”). Genomic DNA from T. brucei AnTat 1.1 was singly and doubly digested with SpeI and StuI, both of which cut at a single internal site in the BARP gene (Fig.4 A), and the digested DNA was probed with the purified StuI/SpeI fragment. A band corresponding to the internal StuI/SpeI fragment (∼0.77 kb) was clearly visible in the double digest (Fig.4 B, lane 1). Although the presence of other additional bands in the digests suggested the existence of related genes, there was no evidence for the presence of multiple or tandemly linked copies of the BARP gene as has been reported for other surface proteins (11.Pays E. Nolan D.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of mRNA prepared from different life cycle stages of T. brucei indicated that expression of the gene encoding BARP was likely to be stage-specific (Fig. 4 C). These results demonstrated the presence of a single transcript (∼1.5 kb) in long slender and stumpy bloodstream forms which was less abundant in procyclic forms of the parasite. Finally, the results from genomic zooblots, performed under conditions of high stringency, demonstrated that the gene for BARP was also present in the subspecies T. brucei rhodesiense and T. brucei gambiense as well as the subgenus Trypanosoma evansi but was not detected in other related species, such asT. congolense, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Crithidia fasciculata (data not shown). Polyclonal antibodies against a GST-BARP fusion protein, containing approximately 70% of the BARP open reading frame (see Fig.4 A), were employed to characterize further the protein encoded by the BARP gene (Fig. 5). Although the amino acid sequence predicted a protein with a molecular mass of 26.7 kDa, Western analysis revealed that BARP migrated as an extremely heterogeneous series of bands, with an estimated molecular mass ranging between 50 and 70 kDa. BARP co-migrated to a certain extent with the VSG, and a partial cross-reaction of the anti-BARP antibodies with VSG was observed (see also Fig.6); but overall the pattern of staining was clearly different for both proteins (compare Fig. 5, lanes1 and 3). Similar results were obtained using different bloodstream clonal variants of the same serodeme as well as with different serodemes (data not shown). Significantly, BARP was not detected in cultured procyclic forms of the parasite, which was consistent with the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4 C). An unusual feature of the Western blots using anti-BARP antibodies was the presence of background streaks that were not observed in the case of procyclic forms. The antibodies against BARP behaved poorly in immunoprecipitations, and it was not possible to immunoprecipitate the protein from metabolically or surface labeled cells. Nevertheless, the results from Western blots indicated that BARP was an invariant, bloodstream stage-specific protein.Figure 6Partial purification of BARP.Panel A, a CHAPS extract of surface125I-labeled bloodstream forms of T. brucei was subjected to ion exchange chromatography on DEAE, and the fractions were analyzed for the presence of radioiodinated proteins (CPM, ▪) and BARP (ELISA: antibodies at 405 nm, ●) (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Proteins that bound to the resin were eluted by the application of a pH gradient (○). Panel B, the majority of the heterogeneous material corresponding to BARP was recovered in two peaks as determined by ELISA; samples of the fractions (3–6 and 37–40) from these peaks were subjected to Western"

The analogs retained defensin-like architecture after the characteristic end-to-end, Cys3,31 (C I:C VI), α-defensin disulfide bond was replaced by a backbone peptide bond. The retro-isomer of NP-1 was as active as the parent compound, suggesting that overall topology and amphipathicity governed its antimicrobial activity. A β-tile design with or without a single cross-bracing disulfide bond sufficed for antimicrobial activity, and some of the analogs retained activity against Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium in NaCl concentrations that rendered NP-1 inactive. The new molecules had clustered positive charges resembling those in protegrins and tachyplesins, but were less cytotoxic. Such simplified α-defensin analogs minimize problems encountered during the oxidative folding of three-disulfide defensins. In addition, they are readily accessible to a novel thia zip cyclization procedure applicable to large unprotected peptide precursors of 31 amino acids in aqueous solutions.

Structure-function studies of α-helical antimicrobial peptides have received considerable attention, partly owing to their facile chemical synthesis (5.Nicolas P. Mor A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 277-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Less is known about antimicrobial β-sheet peptides that, like defensins, are challenging to synthesize chemically.Defensins range in size from 3 to 5 kDa and contain three or four intramolecular disulfide bonds (1.Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 2.Hancock R.E. Lehrer R.

They have been grouped into several structural classes, based on their cystine pairings, structures and homologies. These include the α- and β-defensins of vertebrates and the plant/insect defensins. α-Defensins were first identified in granules of leukocytes (1.Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and were later found in small intestinal Paneth cells (4.Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). β-Defensins are expressed by epithelial cells, by some glands, and (in some species)by leukocytes (6.Porter E.M. Liu L.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Insect/plant defensins are larger than α- and β-defensins and have an α-helical structural component absent from vertebrate defensins (11.Terras F.R.G. Eggermont K. Kovaleva V. Raikhel N.V. Osborn R.W. Kester A. Rees S. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Vanderleyden J. Cammue B.P.A. Broekaert W.F. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar).Collectively, defensins exhibit antimicrobial activity toward many bacteria, yeast, fungi, and enveloped viruses (1.Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 2.Hancock R.E. Lehrer R.

Certain defensins also exert chemotactic, mitogenic, corticostatic, and cytotoxic effects (12.White S.H. Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 13.Bals R. Goldman M.J. Wilson J.M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Goldman M.J. Anderson G.M.

The antibacterial activity of α- and β-defensins is greatly affected by the ambient concentration of NaCl, and links between local salt-dependent inactivation of defensins and the chronic pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis have been proposed (13.Bals R. Goldman M.J. Wilson J.M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Goldman M.J. Anderson G.M. Stolzenberg E.D. Kari U.P. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 553-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar).In their monomeric forms, all α- and β-defensins contain three anti-parallel β-strands that are cross-braced by three or four disulfide bonds (15.Cornet B.

The folded structures of α- and β-defensins are very similar, despite differences in disulfide pairing. α-Defensins contain three disulfide bonds and are circularly permutated by an end-to-end, Cys3,31 (C I:C VI), disulfide bond (Fig. 1). Recently, four end-to-end peptide bond-circularized peptides with 29–31 amino acid residues were isolated from plants (17.Gustafson K.R. Sowder R.C., II Henderson L.E. Parsons I.C. Kashman Y.

These molecules (kalata, cyclophyschotride, and circulins A and B) also contain three disulfide bonds and are the largest cyclic peptides yet found in nature. The circulins provide precedents and incentives for designing α-defensin analogs with end-to-end cyclic structures (Fig. 1). In the discussion that follows, we will call such analogs “β-tile peptides.” This paper describes the design, synthesis, and antimicrobial activity of β-tile peptides based on the α-defensin, rabbit NP-1. These novel defensin analogs exhibited promising antimicrobial profiles, and were significantly less salt-sensitive than NP-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSolvents, all of HPLC1grade, were obtained from VWR Scientific Co. and used without further purification. Boc amino acids and 4-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin were purchased from Bachem Biosciences (Torrance, CA). Other chemicals were obtained from Aldrich. Analytical reverse phase-HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu system with a 0.46 cm × 25-cm C18 Vydac column, using a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient of buffer B (60% acetonitrile in H2O, 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid) in buffer A (5% acetonitrile in H2O, 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid). The effluent was monitored at 225 nm. Waters preparative HPLC equipment and a Vydac C18 reverse phase column were used for peptide purification. Mass spectra were obtained with a Kratos instrument in positive matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mode (MALDI-MS).Thioester Resin SupportThioester resins were prepared according to Zhang and Tam (21.Zhang L. Tam J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2363-2370Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar), based on a thioester resin described by Hojo and Aimono (22.Hojo H. Aimoto S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1991; 64: 111-117Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Four equivalents (eq) each of 3-mercaptopropionic acid, HOBt, and DIC were sequentially added to a suspension of MBHA resin in DMF (10 ml/g resin). The mixture was shaken at room temperature until on-resin ninhydrin testing indicated that free amino sites were absent. The resin was washed in order with DMF, DCM, CH3OH, DCM and DMF, and then treated with a mixture of 1 eq each of cysteine methyl ester hydrochloride, triphenylphosphine, and DIEA in DMF/DCM (3:1, v/v) for 2 h. After thorough washing with DMF, DCM, CH3OH, and DCM and drying in vacuo, the mercaptopropionyl MBHA resin 4 was obtained in quantitative yield.Boc amino acid (4 eq) preactivated with BOP (4 eq) and DIEA (6 eq) for 5 min was added to the suspension of mercaptopropionyl MBHA resin (1 eq) in DMF (10 ml/g resin). The mixture was shaken at room temperature for 2 h, and free thiol groups were monitored by Ellman's5 reagent (23.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21092) Google Scholar). The resins were washed in order with DMF, DCM, CH3OH, and DCM and used for stepwise peptide synthesis.Synthesis of Peptide ThioestersAll thioesters were prepared by solid phase synthesis (24.Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6614) Google Scholar, 25.Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 57: 1619-1625Google Scholar) starting from Boc amino acid thioester resin 5. Solid phase synthesis was carried out on a peptide synthesizer 430A (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) using conventional Boc chemistry and DCC-HOBt coupling protocol. The side chain protecting groups of the Boc amino acids were as follows: Arg (Tos), Asp (OcHex), Cys (4-MeBzl and Acm), Glu (OcHex), His (Dnp), Lys (ClZ), Ser (Bzl), and Thr (Bzl). After peptide chain elongation, the resin was treated with a high HF procedure (HF:anisole, 90:10, v/v). After the HF evaporated, the residual solid was washed with ether. The crude peptide thioesters were extracted with 50% acetic acid, purified by preparative HPLC and lyophilized. Alternatively, the crude peptide thioesters were extracted into 8 m urea and these urea solutions were used for “one-pot” cyclization-oxidation.General Procedure for Thia Zip CyclizationIn condition A (“physiological”), the peptide thioester (10 mm) was dissolved in 0.2 m phosphate-citric acid buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3 eq of TCEP. The reaction was monitored by HPLC until completion. In condition B (“denaturing”), the peptide thioesters were dissolved in 8 m urea containing 0.1 mTris-HCl at pH 7.2. 10 eq each of tris(2-carboxyl-ethyl)phosphine and mercaptopropionic acid were added to prevent undesired by-product formation. The 8 m urea solution was sequentially dialyzed in a decanting urea solution that ultimately contained 100% water. The completion of the thio-thioester exchange cyclization was monitored by HPLC.General Procedure for Two-step Disulfide FormationStep 1 was oxidation with Me2SO. After completion of cyclization, oxidation of free SH to form the disulfide bond was achieved by adding 10–20% Me2SO by volume to the peptide solution. The reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC. At the completion of oxidation, the solution was used directly for the next step. Step 2 was concomitant removal of S-acetamido group and formation of disulfide bond(s). The urea peptide solution was adjusted to pH 3 by adding acetic acid. The solution was flushed with nitrogen for 10 min, and then iodine/methanol (10 mm) was added dropwise to the solution until a brown color persisted. The reaction mixture was maintained in a nitrogen atmosphere in a darkened vessel for 45 min, then cooled in an ice-bath and quenched by 1 m ascorbic acid. The peptide was purified on preparative HPLC.CharacterizationPeptides were hydrolyzed with 6n HCl at 110 °C for 24 h, and amino acid analysis was performed to confirm the composition of the desired peptides. Analytical HPLC for all peptides was performed on a Vydac column (250 × 4.6 mm) with a linear gradient of 0–85% buffer B in buffer A (see above) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. All synthetic peptides were characterized by MALDI-MS. CD spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) using a 1-mm path length quartz cell and a peptide concentration of 10−4m in water.Syntheses of Cyclic Defensin 2a and2gStarting from Boc-Leu-thiopropionyl-MBHA resin, the peptide thioester was assembled using a standard DCC/HOBt coupling protocol in an Applied Biosystems 430A synthesizer. After chain elongation, the resin was treated with thiophenol/DMF (1:9 v/v) solution to remove Dnp protecting group from His. The resin then was treated with high HF procedure and the crude peptide thioester (M r: calculated, 4,034.9; found, 4,034.0) was extracted into 150 ml of 8 m urea. To the urea solution was added 10 eq of TCEP and 50 eq of thiopropionic acid. The solution was dialyzed in 2,000 ml of descending concentrations of 8 to 0m urea, 0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 to complete the thia zip cyclization in 24 h. To form the disulfides, Me2SO (10% in volume) was added to the dialyzed cyclic peptide (M r: calculated, 3929.8; found, 3929.0) solution. The solution was stirred and the oxidative folding was monitored by HPLC. After 24 h, the oxidation was completed to give cyclic peptide with Cys10,30 (C III:C V) disulfide and Cys5,20 (C II:C IV) (Acm)2(M r: calculated, 3927.8; found, 3927.0). The peptide solution was adjusted to pH 3.0 by HOAc and treated with I2/MeOH under nitrogen to form the second pair of disulfide bonds in 2a (M r: calculated, 3783.6; found, 3784.5). The total yield of cyclic defensin 2a was 34.2%, based on integration of the HPLC peak area. The retro-isomer2g, which has complete reversal of the sequence of2a, was prepared similarly. The intermediate with Cys14,29 disulfide and Cys4,24(Acm)2 (M r: calculated, 3927.8; found, 3928.3) and product 2g (M r: calculated, 3,783.6; found, 3782.8) were purified by HPLC.Synthesis of Cys5,20 (C II:C IV) Disulfide and Cys10,30 (C III:C V) Disulfide Analogs 2b and2cA procedure described in the general protocol for the synthesis of peptide thioesters, thia zip cyclization and Me2SO oxidation (first step of two step disulfide formation) worked well for the synthesis of 2b and2c to give the designed peptides (M rfor 2b: calculated, 3693.4; found, 3694.2;M r for 2c: calculated, 3693.4; found, 3692.4).Synthesis of 10-Thiol and 10-Sulfonyl c-defensin Analogs 2dand 2e2d was obtained by “one-pot” cyclization procedure after cleavage from the thioester resin (M r: calculated, 3650.4; found, 3650.3). To an ice-cold solution of 2.5 mg of cNP 2d in 250 μl of 88% formic acid and 250 μl of freshly prepared, ice-cooled peroxyformic acid (26.Stewart S.M. Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. 2nd Ed. Pierce Chemical Co. Press, Rockford, IL1984: 113Google Scholar) was added. After cooling the reaction solution in an ice bath for 1 h, 5 ml of water was added and the solution was lyophilized to give 10-sulfonyl-cNP. The product was purified from HPLC, giving 2.1 mg of 2e with a yield of 85% (M r: calculated, 3698.4, found, 3698.2).Synthesis of Dimerized c-NP 2f2.5 mg of cNP2d was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.2 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). To this solution, 0.4 ml of Me2SO was added. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The dimerized product 2f was isolated by HPLC in yield 50% (M r: calculated, 7298.8, found, 7297.7).Two-stage Radial Diffusion AssaysIn the first stage, the target bacteria (typically 1–4 × 105 colony-forming units/ml) were uniformly dispersed in a thin 10-ml gel underlay that contained 1% agarose, 10 mm buffer ± 100 mm NaCl, and 0.3 mg/ml trypticase soy broth. After punching a series of 3.2-mm diameter wells in the underlay, 5-μl samples containing a dilution series of the peptides of interest were introduced. After allowing 3 h for the peptides to diffuse radially into the gel, a nutrient-rich overlay (6% trypticase soy agar) was poured to allow viable bacteria in the underlay to form visible microcolonies. Typically, plates were read after an overnight incubation, although for rapid growers, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the plates could be read within 6 h. The presence of a clear, colony-free zone around the well indicated antimicrobial activity. The assay yields quantitative and reliable minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) data for purified peptides when their concentration is known and a dilution series is applied. The calculations, correlations between radial diffusion, colony count, and microbroth dilution assays, etc., were described by Steinberg et al. and Turner et al. (27.Steinberg D. Lehrer R.I. Shafer W.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 169-187Google Scholar, 28.Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Cho Y. Turner J.S. Dinh N. Lehrer R.I. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2791-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Microbroth Dilution AssaysThe assays were performed according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommended procedures. Because the principal component in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) is derived from casein, a polyanionic milk protein, we modified the NCCLS procedure slightly by subjecting the MHB to anion exchange chromatography prior to use (28.Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Refining the MHB eliminates its propensity to complex and even precipitate polycationic peptides such as defensins. Refined MHB contains essentially the same concentrations of the various amino acids as standard MHB and supports microbial growth well. An alternative procedure to prevent precipitation and complex formation in MHB was recently published (27.Steinberg D. Lehrer R.I. Shafer W.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 169-187Google Scholar). The results of microbroth dilution and radial diffusion assays were similar.RESULTSDisulfide-to-lactam Backbone DesignOur principle for designing β-tile peptides was based on a disulfide-to-lactam backbone replacement strategy that results in a closed-chain structures. This was possible because NP-1 is already circularly permutated owing to its end-to-end disulfide bond arrangement (Fig. 1). In all circularized analog designs, cystine pair (Cys3,31, C I:C VI) of NP-1 was replaced with Gly residues while the NH2 and COOH termini were circularized as a peptide bond. The newly formed ends contained a cluster of highly charged positive charges that mimic protegrins. In addition, the two remaining disulfide bonds were incrementally deleted to create different one-disulfide and no-disulfide analogs. By not altering the size and the amphipathic β-stranded scaffolding of NP-1, we expected to retain their ability to oligomerize and to reach the hydrophobic threshold for membranolytic activity.Analogs Selected for Structure-Activity RelationshipsSeven NP-1 analogs, 2a–2g, were prepared (Fig.2). Peptide 2a was a circularized version of the open-chain NP-1 1, with two Gly replacing the Cys3,31 (C I:C VI) SS pair. Peptides2b and 2c were cyclic analogs, each containing one SS pair (Cys5,20 in 2b and Cys10,30 in 2c). Peptides 2d and2e were cyclic analogs without SS pairs. At position 10, peptide 2d contained a single free thiol and peptide2e had a negatively charged sulfonate. Peptide 2fwas a covalent dimer of 2d formed through SS bond formation at Cys10. Finally, peptide 2g was a retro-isomer of Peptide 2a.Figure 2A, amino acid sequences of NP-1 1, circularized cNP-1 2a and its cyclic retro isomer2g; B, three groups of cyclic analogs of cNP-12b–2f. Open circles indicate unchanged amino acid residues with respect to NP-1. Cys to Gly replacements are shown in shaded circles. Disulfide linkages are shown by connecting lines. Arrow indicates the NH2 to COOH direction of peptide bonds that link the NH2 and COOH termini of NP-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These cyclic analogs allowed us to test the validity of the β-tile designed peptide, e.g. 2a, the structural rigidity of a β-tile peptide with a single SS pair, e.g. 2b, 2c; without any SS pair, 2d-2e; and the topology with a retro-sequence in 2g containing a reversed amino acid sequence of 2a. In a circular permutation, the retro-isomer 2g contains the amide backbone in a reverse direction but retains the overall topology and the same charge clusters as 2a (30.Merrifield R.B. Juvvadi P.

A. 1988; 85: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The retro-isomer could also test whether a circularized β-tile structure is similar to NP-1 and support our hypothesis that the triple β-strands serve as scaffolding with the charges clustered on the ends. Finally, a covalent dimer 2fwas formed with an intermolecular SS pair at Cys10 located at the extended loop but not at the predicted dimeric face of α-defensins. Such an analog was intended as a probe for sites of oligomerization other than the dimeric site revealed by crystal structure (33.Hill C.P. Yee J. Selsted M.E. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 251: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar).Orthogonal Cyclization for the Synthesis of β-Tile PeptidesRecently, our laboratory developed an orthogonal cyclization method for ligating free peptides as end-to-end cyclic peptides in aqueous solutions (34.Liu C.-F. Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6584-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 35.Liu C.-F. Rao C. Tam J.P. J. Am. Chem.

Such an orthogonal cyclization is accomplished without protecting groups or activation steps. More importantly, it can distinguish the reactivity of an α-amine from the ε-amines of Lys in the peptide sequence to impart orthogonality or chemoselectivity to the reaction. Fig. 3illustrates the mechanism of the orthogonal cyclization. It proceeds first through a capture of two segments to give either a branched O- or S-ester intermediate, followed by a downhill, entropic-driven O or S toN-acyl transfer to form the amide bond. The acyl transfer reaction mimics the final step of spontaneous intein splicing through intramolecular acyl transfer (40.Xu M.-Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 41.Xu M.-Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B.

To arrive at the O- or S-ester intermediate, we have developed methods of prior capture through thiazolidine (34.Liu C.-F. Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tam J.P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 933-936Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and acylimidazole (42.Zhang L. Tam J.P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 3-6Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar), yielding thiaproline, Cys, His, or Met at the ligation site. These methods have also been further developed for intramolecular ligation to form circularized peptides and proteins. Recently, we have incorporated a ligation method of an Xaa-Cys bond into a novel strategy (43.Lu Y.A. Tam J.P. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 5599-5602Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) for the synthesis of circularized peptide. This new method was applied to the synthesis of circularized rabbit NP-1 analogs 2a–2g and consisted of the following steps.Figure 3A general scheme of orthogonal cyclization for the synthesis of β-tile peptides 2a–2g. Disulfide formation is only applicable for analogs2a and 2g, which contain two SS pairs. Single SS analogs 2b and 2c do not require the I2/MeOH oxidation step. Analogs 2d and2e do not require Me2SO oxidation. See “Experimental Procedures” for detailed description.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2109935864,"Platelet glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) mediates interaction with both von Willebrand factor and thrombin. Thrombin binds to GpIb via its heparin-binding site (HBS) (De Candia, E., De Cristofaro, R., De Marco, L., Mazzucato, M., Picozzi, M., and Landolfi, R. (1997) Thromb. Haemostasis 77, 735–740; De Cristofaro, R., De Candia, E., Croce, G., Morosetti, R., and Landolfi, R. (1998) Biochem. J. 332, 643–650). To identify the thrombin-binding domain on GpIbα, we examined the effect of GpIbα1–282, a GpIbα fragment released by the cobra venom mocarhagin on the heparin-catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III (AT). GpIbα1–282 inhibited the reaction in a dose-dependent and competitive fashion. In contrast, the GpIbα1–271 fragment, produced by exposing GpIbα1–282 to carboxypeptidase Y, had no effect on thrombin inhibition by the heparin-AT complex. Measurements of the apparent equilibrium constant of the GpIbα1–282 binding to thrombin as a function of different salts (NaCl and tetramethyl-ammonium chloride) concentration (0.1–0.2 m) indicated a large salt dependence (Γ± = −4.5), similar to that pertaining to the heparin binding to thrombin. The importance of thrombin HBS in its interaction with GpIbα was confirmed using DNA aptamers, which specifically bind to either HBS (HD22) or the fibrinogen recognition site of thrombin (HD1). HD22, but not HD1, inhibited thrombin binding to GpIbα1–282. Furthermore, the proteolytic derivative γT-thrombin, which lacks the fibrinogen recognition site, binds to GpIbα via its intact HBS in a reaction that is inhibited by HD22. Neither α- nor γT-thrombin bound to GpIbα1–271, suggesting that the Asp272–Glu282 region of GpIbα may act as a “heparin-like” ligand for the thrombin HBS, thereby inhibiting heparin binding to thrombin. It was also demonstrated that intact platelets may dose-dependently inhibit the heparin-catalyzed thrombin inhibition by AT at enzyme concentrations <5 nm. Altogether, these findings show that thrombin HBS binds to the region of GpIbα involving the Asp272–Glu282 segment, protecting the enzyme from the inactivation by the heparin-AT system. Platelet glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) mediates interaction with both von Willebrand factor and thrombin. Thrombin binds to GpIb via its heparin-binding site (HBS) (De Candia, E., De Cristofaro, R., De Marco, L., Mazzucato, M., Picozzi, M., and Landolfi, R. (1997) Thromb.

Biol. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, GpIb also binds to thrombin with high affinity (1.Clemetson K. Clemetson J. Semin. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 21: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The inhibition of this interaction causes a reduced thrombin-induced platelet activation through an unclear mechanism (3.Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jones G.D. Kornhauser R. Jackson B. Yamamoto N.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GpIb is a 150-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein and contains a 27-kDa β-subunit connected via a disulfide bond to the α-subunit (5.Lopez J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 5: 97-119Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Glycocalicin, the 140-kDa extracytoplasmic portion of GpIbα that bears the von Willebrand and thrombin-binding sites can be prepared by hydrolyzing GpIbα with endogenous calcium-dependent sulfydryl proteases such as calpain (1.Clemetson K. Clemetson J. Semin. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 21: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the GpIbα thrombin-binding site maps to an extensive C-terminal region spanning residues Cys209–Asp287(6.Gralnick J.R. Williams L.P. McKeown K. Hansmann J.W. Fenton J.W. Krutzsch H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6334-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies, indicate that thrombin binds to GpIb via its heparin-binding site (HBS) (7.De Candia E. De Cristofaro R. De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Croce G. Morosetti R. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study the structural mapping of GpIbα domain that interacts with the HBS on thrombin was further localized to 272–282 residues using GpIbα1–282 and GpIbα1–271, fragments released from GpIbα upon exposure to either mocarhagin, a cobra venom extract (9.Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), or mocarhagin plus carboxypeptidase Y. To investigate the consequences of the interaction of thrombin with GpIb, we examined the effect of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that bind either to the HBS or the fibrinogen recognition site of thrombin on (a) the heparin-catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III in the presence of paraformaldehyde-treated platelets or the two GpIbα fragments and (b) thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Human α-thrombin was purified and characterized as previously reported (10.De Cristofaro R. Rocca B. Bizzi B. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). High molecular weight heparin (lot HF2025; molecular weight = 16,000) was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). The molecular weight of this heparin fraction was confirmed by subjecting the material to gel filtration using a Bio-Silect SEC 250–5 column (Bio-Rad) fitted to a high performance liquid chromatograph (Perkin-Elmer, series 10) and monitoring the fractions at 205 nm. Purified heparin oligosaccharides of known molecular weights were used to construct the reference curve. Heparin with high affinity for antithrombin was isolated by affinity chromatography using an antithrombin III column (11.Nordenman, B., and Björk, I. (1978) Biochemistry 3339–3344Google Scholar). Antithrombin III (lot HATIII 540AL) purchased from Enzyme Research Labs migrated as a single band on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent molecular mass of 58 kDa. The antithrombin concentration was calculated spectrophotometrically, using an extinction coefficientE 280 (1%) = 6.5 (12.Nordenman B. Nyström G. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrate HD-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S2238) was from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden). Sodium acetate, C-terminal (55–65) sulfated, and nonsulfated hirudin fragments (Ac-DFEEIPEEY(SO3H)LQ), dansyl-chloride, a dansyl-l-amino acids kit, ethylammonium chloride, lithium carbonate, methanol, trifluoroacetic acid (spectrophotometric grade), trypsin-immobilized agarose (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated), and prostaglandin E1 were from Sigma. Carboxypeptidase Y (excision grade), immobilized on Sepharose CL-4B resin, was purchased from Pierce. Mocarhagin, purified from cobra venom (9.Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Robert K. Andrews (Baker Medical Research Institute, Prahran, Australia). The two single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (a) 5′-AGTCCGTGGTAGGGCAGGTTGGGGTGACT-3′, referred to as HD22, and (b) 5′-GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG-3′, referred to as HD1, were synthesized by the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at McMaster University (Hamilton, ON, Canada). GpIbα1–282 was prepared by mocarhagin treatment of washed platelets using a fast protein liquid chromatography method, as previously reported for glycocalicin purification (7.De Candia E. De Cristofaro R. De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets from outdated platelet concentrates (50 units) were washed three times by centrifugation in 10 mm Hepes, 0.135 m NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 μm prostaglandin E1, pH 7.4. After washing, platelet suspensions were treated with 10 μg/ml mocarhagin for 60 min at 37 °C in the above buffer without bovine serum albumin and containing 1 mmCaCl2. This treatment is reported to cause selective cleavage of the amidic bond between Glu282 and Asp283 of GpIbα (9.Ward C.M. Andrews R.K. Smith A.I. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At the end of incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 mm EDTA, and platelets were precipitated by centrifuging at 800 × gfor 15 min. The supernatant was chromatographed on a high load Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus, and GpIbα1–282was isolated according to previously reported methods for glycocalicin purification, using a gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl for 60 min (7.De Candia E. De Cristofaro R. De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Croce G. Morosetti R. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The peak eluted at 0.55 m NaCl was collected and further analyzed. SDS-PAGE showed that the purified protein had an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. Purified GpIbα1–282 (5 μg) was electrophoresed on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, blotted, and incubated with 2 μg/ml purified mouse MoAb SZ2 purchased from Immunotech (Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano, Italy). This monoclonal antibody recognizes a region of the N-terminal GpIbα domain and inhibits both von Willebrand and thrombin binding to GpIbα. The GpIbα1–282 band was detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). GpIbα1–282 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient equal to 33390 (cm−1), as predicted on the basis of the sequence (13.Lopez J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5615-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), by the method of Pace and co-workers (14.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). Purified GpIbα1–282 (at concentrations ranging from 5 to 10 μm) in 0.5 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.5, was incubated with 0.5 ml of immobilized carboxypeptidase Y (∼6 units) at 37 °C with gentle stirring. At intervals ranging from 10 to 240 min., 50 μl of supernatant from perchlorate-treated samples (0.3m) were removed and subjected to amino acid analysis according to the method of Levina and Nazimov (15.Levina N.B. Nazimov I.V. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 286: 207-216Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the solution was dried in vacuo at 60 °C and evaporated to dryness twice from 5 μl of water. After addition of 40 mmlithium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, and dansyl chloride (10-fold excess relative to GpIbα1–282) in acetonitrile (3 μl), the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min and kept in darkness for 35 min at 20 °C prior to adding 3 μl of 0.1% ethylammonium chloride. After drying at 60 °C, a mixture of 5.7m HCl and trifluoroacetic acid (2:1 v/v, 6 μl) was added to the precipitate, and the resulting solution was frozen. After drying twice with methanol, the sample was dissolved in methanol (5–10 μl) and injected onto a Brownlee (Santa Clara, CA) RP 300 octyl analytical column (220 × 4.6 mm) connected to a guard column of the same resin. Elution was carried out with the following eluants: (a) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and (b) water:acetonitrile (40:60 v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The applied gradient was 0–99% B in 90 min and 99% B for 5 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. In separate experiments, a reference reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography chromatogram was obtained by using a standard mixture of dansylated amino acids. The fragment of GpIbα1–282 remaining after a 240-min exposure to carboxypeptidase Y (GpIbα1–271 fragment) was gel filtered on a Bio-Rad DG10 column and concentrated using an Amicon Centriprep 3 membrane. Its concentration was determined at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient equal to 28920 (cm−1). SDS-PAGE showed that GpIbα1–271 did not undergo further intramolecular fragmentation by carboxypeptidase Y. Because a sulfated tyrosine was expected in the hydrolyzed solution, a reference chromatogram of carboxypeptidase Y-treated (4 h) sulfated and nonsulfated C-terminal hirudin peptide 55–65 (Ac-DFEEIPEEY(SO3H)LQ) also was obtained. The assignment of the chromatographic peak representingO-sulfated l-tyrosine was based on the known amino acid composition of the peptide and the difference in the chromatographic pattern obtained with the sulfated and nonsulfated peptide. Previous studies indicated that thrombin interaction with antithrombin (AT) occurs via the following two-step reaction (16.Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). T+AT⇄T·AT→T­ATEquation 1 where T is thrombin, T·AT is the reversible thrombin-antithrombin adduct andT-AT is the final complex between enzyme and inhibitor. Heparin accelerates the second step of the reaction by binding to both thrombin and AT (17.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, the final T-AT adduct occurs through formation of an intermediary ternary thrombin-heparin-AT complex, which rearranges as follows. T+AT·H ⇄KT·ATH T·AT·H →kT·ATH T­AT+HEquation 2 where AT·H is the reversible antithrombin-heparin complex,T·AT·H is the ternary intermediary thrombin-antithrombin-heparin adduct, K T·ATHis the equilibrium dissociation constant for thrombin binding to the heparin-antithrombin complex, and k T·ATH is the rate constant for the conversion of the intermediary complex to the final T-AT adduct. The heparin-catalyzed thrombin-AT interaction can be kinetically analyzed using a formula describing a rapid equilibrium two-substrate enzyme reaction, in which both thrombin and AT are the substrates and heparin is the “enzyme” (17.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Under experimental conditions where the thrombin concentration is less than K m value for the heparin-thrombin interaction and the AT concentration is more than the value for thrombin, one can assume that the inhibitor concentration does not change during the inhibition reaction. This simplifies the mathematical treatment of a two-substrate Michaelis equation, and the rate of thrombin inactivation is well described by the following differential equation. −dTdt=kcatKT·ATH H0 AT0KATH+AT0T+kuncatAT0TEquation 3 where T is thrombin, AT 0 is the AT concentration, H 0 is the heparin concentration, the ratiok cat/K T·ATH is the specificity constant for thrombin interaction with heparin under saturating AT concentration, K ATH is the equilibrium dissociation constant for AT-heparin interaction, andk uncat is the second order rate constant for the uncatalyzed thrombin-AT reaction. Integration of Equation 3 results in the following. Tt=T0 exp (−kobst)Equation 4 where T 0 and T t are the thrombin concentrations at time = 0 and time =t, respectively. On the basis of Equations 3 and 4 we obtained the following. kobs=kcatKT·ATH H0 AT0KATH+AT0+kuncatAT0Equation 5 Equation 5 shows that thrombin inactivation is described by a pseudo-first order exponential decay, characterized by a rate constant (k obs) that is linearly correlated with the heparin concentration and hyperbolically plus linearly linked to AT concentration. Thus, thek cat/K TATH value can be calculated from the AT dependence of the k obsvalues, once the K ATH value is known. In our experimental set-up, k obs was measured by studying inactivation of 1 nm α-thrombin, in the presence of 4 nm heparin, as a function of AT concentration (5–250 nm) in a final volume of 50 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, 0.1–0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, pH 7.50, at 25 °C. Thrombin inhibition by AT was also studied as a function of GpIbα1–282 and GpIbα1–271 (0–400 nm). At each AT concentration, the reaction was quenched at various intervals by addition of 2 ml of 100 μmPhe-Pip-Arg-pNA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, pH 8.00. The k obs value was then calculated using Equation 4. Because the relationship between the observedK T·ATH/k cat values and GpIbα1–282 concentration was linear, a competitive scheme was applied whereby GpIbα1–282 binding to thrombin inhibited the binding of heparin to thrombin and vice versa. According to this competitive scheme, only theK T·ATH value is expected to increase as a function of the GpIbα fragment. The experimental values ofK T·ATH/k cat(i.e.(K T·ATH/k cat)obs) were thus fitted to the following relation. KT·ATHkcatobs=KT·ATHkcato1+PKiEquation 6 where P is the concentration of GpIbα1–282, K i is the equilibrium binding constant of GpIbα1–282 for thrombin, and (K T·ATH/k cat)° is the value of K T·ATH/k catfor thrombin interaction with the AT-heparin complex in the absence of the GpIbα1–282 fragment. Thrombin inhibition by AT in the absence of heparin was studied using the following reaction scheme for irreversible inhibition (17.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). T+S ⇄Km TS →kcat T+P+AT↓kT­ATEquation 7 where k is the rate constant for irreversible thrombin inhibition. Experiments were performed by using the Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA substrate and α-thrombin at concentrations of 200 μm and 0.5–3 nm, respectively. Antithrombin was typically used at a concentration of 2.5 μm. The buffer used for these kinetic experiments was 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, pH 7.50, at 25 °C. The concentration of pNA released from the substrate was followed at 405 nm, and the experimental points were fitted to the following equation (17.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). [pNA] t=[pNA] inf[1−exp(kt)]Equation 8 where [pNA]t and [pNA]inf are the pNA concentration at time = t and time = infinity, respectively, and k is the pseudo-first rate constant for the irreversible thrombin inhibition. The analysis of these data, along with those pertaining to the experiments described above, was performed using GRAFIT software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK) based on a modified Marquardt algorithm. The proteolytic form of thrombin, referred to as γT-thrombin, was produced using immobilized trypsin, as described previously (18.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, the purified material showed two bands with a molecular mass of about 26 and 14 kDa, respectively. Purified γT-thrombin was 100% active, as determined by active site titration withp-nitrophenyl-guanidinobenzoate. This thrombin derivative did not clot fibrinogen but was readily inhibited by AT in the presence of heparin, as shown using the assay procedure reported above. Typically, 1 nm γT-thrombin, 150 nm AT, and 4 nm heparin were used in these inhibition experiments. The effect of salt and both HD22 and HD1 on the thrombin-GpIbα 1–282 fragment interaction was studied using a solid phase binding assay. The GpIbα1–282 fragment was absorbed to the wells of a Dynatech Immulon microplate by incubating 1 μg/ml GpIb fragment in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.60, overnight at 4 °C. The salt dependence of the K d binding of GpIbα1–282 to thrombin was investigated in the salt concentration range from 0.1 to 0.2 m, when NaCl or tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) were used, or at 0.2m, when NaF was used. Human α-thrombin was used over a range of 5–2500 nm. In the experiments using HD1 and HD22, these oligonucleotides were both used over a concentration range of 0–200 nm. When γT-thrombin was used, its concentration ranged from 7.8 nm to 1 μm, and HD22 was used at 1 μm. A progressive increase in the apparent K d for α-thrombin-GpIb fragment was observed upon HD22 addition. Based on this finding, we analyzed the experimental data by applying a competitive inhibition scheme whereby HD22 competitively inhibits thrombin binding to the immobilized GpIbα fragment and vice versa. Such a scheme was previously used to analyze the heparin effect on the thrombin-glycocalicin interaction (8.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Croce G. Morosetti R. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, because of its high affinity for thrombin (19.Tasset D.M. Kubik M.F. Steiner W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), the concentration of free HD22 changes upon binding to thrombin. In this experimental set up, the two interacting macromolecules (thrombin and HD22) were present in comparable amounts. This forced us to use appropriate equations cast in terms of the total, rather than the free, HD22 concentration (20.Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 21.Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The latter, Hf, is determined as follows. Hf=(Ht−et−Ki+Q)/2Equation 9 Q−(Ht−et−Ki) 2+4K1HtEquation 10 where H t is the total HD22 concentration,e t is the total thrombin concentration, andK i is the equilibrium dissociation constant for thrombin-HD22 interaction. The concentration of bound HD22,Hb, is determined as follows. Hb=Ht−HfEquation 11 From a conservation relationship, it is known that the concentration of thrombin bound to HD22, e b, equals the concentration of bound HD22, Hb. Hence ef=ct−HbEquation 12 Because of the competitive effect of HD22 on the thrombin-GpIbα interaction, the concentration of thrombin bound to the immobilized GpIbα fragment, e − GpIb, was calculated using the following relation. e−GpIb=(e−GpIb) max cf/(ef+Kd)Equation 13 where (e − GpIb)max is the maximum value of e − GpIb complex, and K d* (the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for thrombin-GpIbα interaction in the presence of a given HD22 concentration) is defined by the following equation. Kd*=Kdo(1+Hf/Ki)Equation 14 where K d° is the true equilibrium dissociation constant for the thrombin-GpIbα interaction andK i is the HD22-thrombin binding constant. Experimental points pertaining to the HD22 effect on thrombin-GpIbα were simultaneously fitted to Equations Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12, Equation 13, Equation 14 to enhance the degrees of freedom in the fitting procedure and provide more robust results (8.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Croce G. Morosetti R. Landolfi R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Platelets, gel filtered as described previously (18.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were suspended in 10 mm Hepes, 0.135m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The platelet suspension (200,000/μl) was divided in two aliquots: one was used as control, and the other one was subjected to mocarhagin treatment (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. At the end of incubation, platelets were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min and washed three times in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, 10 μm prostaglandin E1, pH 7.40. The final platelet suspensions were treated with 0.4% (final concentration) formaldheyde at 25 °C for 1 h and washed three times in the above buffer. With cytofluorimetric analysis (Becton Dickinson FACScan instrument) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-GpIbα MoAb SZ2, mocarhagin-treated platelets demonstrated minimal labeling compared with control (see below). The effect of formaldehyde-treated intact or mocarhagin-exposed platelets on the heparin-catalyzed rate of thrombin inhibition by AT was assessed by incubating 0.5–5 nm thrombin at 25 °C with varying concentrations of platelets (30,000–200,000/μl), 15 nm heparin, 0.25 μm AT, and 70 μm of the chromogenic substrate Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA in 10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% PEG 6000, pH 7.50. At intervals, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 nmhirudin, and after precipitating the platelets by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min, the p-nitroaniline in the supernatant was measured at 405 nm. An apparent pseudo-first order rate constant for thrombin inhibition was calculated using GRAFIT software. Platelets, gel filtered as described previously (18.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were suspended in 20 mm Hepes, 0.135 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 5.5 mmglucose, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Platelet aggregation in response to 1 nm thrombin was studied using a dual channel aggregometer according to the Born method, in the absence or presence of HD22 or HD1 in concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 400 nm and from 1.5 to 90 nm, respectively. The maximum velocity of absorbance change was measured and expressed as a percentage relative to a control measured in the absence of effector. Intraplatelet calcium mobilization induced by thrombin was evaluated using the fluorescent dye for Ca2+, Fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester, as described previously (18.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fura 2-loaded gel filtered platelets were divided into two aliquots, one of which was subjected to mocarhagin treatment, while the other served as a control. Platelet suspensions were incubated in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min with either 10 μg/ml mocarhagin or buffer alone. At the end of incubation, 2 mm EDTA was added to quench the mocarhagin activity. Intact or mocarhagin-treated platelets were then stimulated with 1 nm α-thrombin in the presence of 25, 100, and 400 nm HD22 aptamer, and the lag time for calcium increase was the parameter used to evaluate the kinetics of calcium increase under the various experimental conditions, as previously detailed (18.De Cristofaro R. De Candia E. Picozzi M. Landolfi R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,22.De Candia E. De Cristofaro R. Landolfi R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 3308-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mocarhagin treatment of platelets releases a component with a molecular mass of 40 kDa. This purified protein was recognized by a monoclonal antibody, SZ2, directed against the sulfated tyrosine sequence of GpIbα (Fig.1). In contrast, this monoclonal antibody did not recognize the GpIbα1–271, the fragment obtained after 240 min of carboxypeptidase treatment (Fig. 1). After 240-min incubation with immobilized carboxypeptidase Y, the amino acids released from GpIbα1–282 were one threonine, one leucine, one proline, two glutamic acid residues, three aspartic acid residues, 2.6 sulfated tyrosine residues, and"

We identify nucleolin as one of the nuclear polypeptides that interact specifically with the A-Myb and c-Myb, but not B-Myb DNA-binding domains. We show unambiguously that this interaction is direct and takes place in vivo, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenously and exogenously expressed proteins. The minimal DNA-binding domain containing only the R2R3 c-Myb repeats is sufficient for nucleolin binding. Computer analysis of the R2R3 three-dimensional structure, as well as extensive mutational analysis within this region, reveals that the Arg161 residue, present in c-Myb and A-Myb, but not B-Myb, is crucial for this interaction. We show that the interaction of nucleolin with Myb is functional because co-transfection of nucleolin down-regulates Myb transcriptional activity. Nucleolin is a multifunctional phosphoprotein present in both nucleoplasm and more abundantly in the nucleolus and shows helicase and chromatin decondensing activities.

Thus the identification of new protein partners that directly interact with specific transcription factors should allow further definition of the mechanisms of transcription activation. The mammalian Myb family of oncoproteins is composed of three members, A-Myb, B-Myb, and c-Myb, all of which are transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 4.Introna M. Luchetti M. Castellano M.

B-Myb is phylogenetically the most divergent among the three Myb proteins (16.Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 223-235PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike c-Myb and A-Myb, it has usually been found to be a weak or inactive transcription factor on most natural promoters tested and rather to inhibit c-Myb or v-Myb activity (17.Foos G. Grimm S.

The different functional domains of all three Myb proteins have been characterized. The DNA-binding domain (DBD)1 at the N terminus is the most conserved region (4.Introna M. Luchetti M. Castellano M. Arsura M. Golay J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 113-124PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 223-235PubMed Google Scholar). The central portion of A-Myb and c-Myb forms the transactivation domain, whereas the C-terminal half has a negative regulatory function on both DNA binding and transcription (22.Facchinetti V.

The definition of distinct functional domains has led to the search for molecules that interact with them and regulate Myb function. In particular, the CBP/p300 acetylases have been demonstrated to interact directly and synergize with both c-Myb and A-Myb (22.Facchinetti V. Loffarelli L. Schreek S. Oelgeschlaeger M. Lüscher B.

The Myb domain responsible for binding to CBP/p300 is in both cases the transactivation domain, which is conserved in these two proteins. The c-Myb DBD on the other hand has been reported to bind to several proteins in vitro: the coactivator p100 (28.Dash A.B. Orrico F.C. Ness S.A.

Cell. 1998; 1: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although these interactions appear to modify Myb functionin vitro and/or in vivo, direct binding of these proteins in vivo has not been demonstrated. Recently, we have shown that the DBD of A-Myb has a regulatory function on the protein transcriptional activity in addition to that of binding to DNA. In addition, we have shown that the A-Myb DBD binds to several nuclear proteins (32.Ying G.-G. Arsura M. Introna M. Golay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24921-24926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here we characterize one of the proteins that bind to the A-Myb DBD, nucleolin and show that this protein binds only to the DBD of the A-Myb and c-Myb but not B-Myb transcription factors. Furthermore we demonstrate that nucleolin affects Myb transcriptional activity. These data add a novel functional partner for a family of transcription factors, with potential activity in the regulation of chromatin assembly (33.Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The human lymphoid cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Seromed, Berlin, Germany). The 293-derived Phoenix epithelial cell line (34.Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Human Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Steril System, Logan, UT), glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The pGST-A-Myb-DBD construct has been described previously (32.Ying G.-G. Arsura M. Introna M. Golay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24921-24926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). pGST-B-Myb-DBD was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Pfu enzyme (Stratagene). The DNA fragment encoding aa 1–212 was amplified and inserted in theEcoRI site of pGex-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pGST-c-Myb-DBD (aa 2–212) was made by inserting the bluntedNcoI/HindIII fragment from pHM1 (35.Kalkbrenner F. Guehmann S. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 657-661PubMed Google Scholar) into theSmaI site of the pGex-3x vector. For kinase labeling of GST-A-Myb-DBD, the p1500 plasmid (36.Golay J. Loffarelli L. Luppi M. Castellano M. Introna M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2469-2479PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with NdeI and blunted, and the 0.65-kilobase fragment encoding aa 1–217 was inserted into the BamHI site of the pGex-2TK vector. The pGST-c-Myb(R2R3) (aa 93–212) was constructed by digesting pGST-c-Myb-DBD with SacI and BamHI, blunting, and religation of the vector fragment. The c-Myb R2R3 point mutants in the pGex-3x vector background were generated by polymerase chain reaction; the sequences over the mutations were as follows: CAGAAAGTGATAGAGCTTGTAAAGAAA for R102K/Q108K, GGTACGAAACAGTGG for P112/R114Q, and AAGGTACTG for R116V. All three mutant constructs were made in the background of c-Myb aa 93–212 fused to GST in the pGex-3x vector. The same R116V mutation was also introduced into the pSC background (c-Myb cDNA in the pSG5 vector) by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. The pNFor4 plasmid carrying the complete human cDNA in a cytomegalovirus expression vector was a kind gift of Dr. N. Maizels (Yale University, New Haven, CT) (37.Hanakahi L.A. Dempsey L.A. Li M.J. Maizels N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3605-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For Myc-tagged nucleolin, the HindIII fragment encoding aa 1–539 of nucleolin was inserted into the EcoRV site of pCDNA3.1(−)/Myc-hisA (Invitrogen). All constructions were verified by sequencing. Recombinant fusion protein preparation has been described previously (32.Ying G.-G. Arsura M. Introna M. Golay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24921-24926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For eukaryotic nuclear extracts, 10 × 106 exponentially growing cells were lysed in 200 ml of Buffer 1 (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was further extracted for 10 min at 4 °C in 100 ml of Buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, protease inhibitors) and cleared by centrifugation. The extracts were adjusted in the same buffer to a final 180 mm NaCl and incubated with 10 μl of GST-bound glutathione agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged. These precleared extracts were further incubated 1 h at 4 °C with 10 μl GST-A-Myb-DBD bound glutathione-agarose. The agarose beads were washed three times with Buffer 4 (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 180 mm NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40) and analyzed on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting. Nuclear extracts from 20-liter Namalwa cultures were bound to GST-A-Myb-DBD columns, run in a 5% SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained proteins were excised from the blots and N-terminally sequenced by Edman degradation on a pulsed liquid phase 477A/120A protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, AB Division, Foster City, CA) using N-methylpiperidine as a coupling base. Total cell lysates or glutathione-agarose bound proteins were boiled in SDS loading buffer and run in an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The blotting and Western conditions were as described previously using the ECL detection system. The CC-98 mAb specific for human nucleolin was a kind gift from Dr. N. H. Yeh (Insitute of Microbiology and Immunology, Taipei, Taiwan, China) (38.Chen C.-M. Chiang S.-Y. Yeh N.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7754-7758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from 4 × 106cells were run in an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was incubated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5% nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. Binding was carried out in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mmMg2Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 using 250.000 cpm/ml of radiolabeled GST-A-Myb DBD protein in presence of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled purified GST. After 5 h of incubation at 4 °C, the membrane was washed in binding buffer in absence of recombinant protein, dried, and autoradiographed. The anti-A-Myb polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the bacterially expressed and affinity purified fragment spanning aa 218–482, which shows poor homology to other Myb proteins, has been described previously (11.Golay J. Broccoli V. Lamorte G. Bifulco C. Parravicini C. Thomas N.S.B. Delia D. Ferrauti P. Vitolo D. Introna M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2786-2793PubMed Google Scholar). For c-Myb and B-Myb immunoprecipitation, commercial antibodies raised against the C terminus of the proteins were used (Santa Cruz). 40 × 106 BJAB cell nuclear extracts were incubated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) without or with precoupled antibody (50 μg each) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed in phosphate-buffered saline three times, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The Phoenix epithelial cells were transfected by the Ca2+ phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (34.Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Human Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 36.Golay J. Loffarelli L. Luppi M. Castellano M. Introna M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2469-2479PubMed Google Scholar). The KHK-CAT plasmid carrying eight Myb-binding sites upstream from the CAT gene was used as reporter (36.Golay J. Loffarelli L. Luppi M. Castellano M. Introna M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2469-2479PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out in 35-mm dishes using a total of 2–2.7 μg of DNA, including 0.2–1.5 μg of Myb, 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase or RSV-luciferase constructs for normalization, and 0.03–1 μg of pNFor4 plasmid encoding human nucleolin. Equal amounts of total protein, determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay, were used for β-galactosidase, luciferase, and CAT assays. CAT assays were performed using a phase extraction protocol (39.Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene. 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The CAT activity values were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activity was measured with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and light emission was determined with a Berthold Lumat LB 9507 Luminometer. The three-dimensional model of DNA bound B-Myb R2R3 was constructed using c-Myb as structural scaffold (40.Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank accession code 1MSE) and the Proexplore software package. As a first step, the side chain coordinates were generated using a rotamer library and a table of rotamer-rotamer interaction energies was calculated. In the second step, the intramolecular energy was minimized using simulated annealing Monte Carlo technique. Model structure refinement was performed with the Amber 4.1 software package. First the coordinates of the backbone atoms were kept fixed until a RMS (Route Mean Square) of 0.1 Kcal/mol, using steepest descent algorithm. Full optimization of the model was then performed for 10,000 other steps using conjugate gradient algorithm. The solvent-accessible surfaces of Myb R2R3 were calculated using Chem3D Pro package (Cambridge Soft), with a solvent radius of 1.4 Å on a PC-Pentium 200, subtracting the DNA for clarity. To identify new protein partners for the Myb family of transcription factors, we have performed pull-down assays using the DBD of the three Myb proteins fused to GST. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 4 major proteins from nuclear extracts are specifically bound to the c-Myb and A-Myb DBD of apparent molecular masses of 70, 85, 95, and 110 kDa. On the other hand the B-Myb DBD column retained only three of the four proteins, being unable to bind to the 95-kDa protein. We therefore performed a preparative pull-down assay with GST-A-Myb-DBD and suceeded in purifying and microsequencing the p95 and p85 proteins. The first 19 amino acids deduced for p95 corresponded exactly to amino acids 2–20 of human nucleolin (VLAKAGKNQGDPKKMAPP) (Swiss-Prot accession numberP19338), whereas p85 corresponded to the larger subunit of Ku antigen (VRXSGNKAAVVLCMDVGFTM) (Swiss-Prot accession number P13010). To confirm that nucleolin and Ku antigen can bind to the Myb DBD and that this interaction is specific, we performed pull-down assays with GST-A-Myb, GST-c-Myb, and GST-B-Myb DBD as well as a control GST-Max DBD and analyzed the bound products in Western blots. As shown in Fig.1 B, nucleolin did indeed bind to A-Myb and c-Myb DBD, but not to B-Myb or Max DBD. On the other hand Ku antigen bound to all DBD tested, including that of the unrelated Max protein. As expected neither nucleolin nor Ku antigen bound to the GST-TA control containing the A-Myb transactivation domain. These data suggested that nucleolin binds specifically to the c-Myb and A-Myb DBD and that Ku antigen on the other hand may recognize contaminating DNA associated with the DNA-binding domains of all proteins. To confirm still further the specificity of binding of nucleolin to Myb, independently from DNA, we have performed the pull-down assays in the presence of ethidium bromide, which permits identification of DNA-independent protein interactions (41.Lai J.-S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, nucleolin binding was equally strong in the presence or absence of ethidium bromide. On the contrary, the interaction with Ku antigen was abolished already at the lowest concentration of ethidium bromide, showing that Ku antigen binds to DNA. That nucleolin binding to c-Myb and A-Myb takes place independently of DNA was confirmed by performing pull-down assays in presence of DNase-treated A-Myb DBD and cell lysates (data not shown). To demonstrate that nucleolin binding is direct and does not require intervening proteins, a new construct was made encoding the GST-A-Myb DBD containing a phosphorylation site for heart muscle kinase. The purified GST-A-Myb-DBD or GST alone control proteins were labeledin vitro with 32P-ATP and heart muscle kinase and used in Far Western assays on total cell extracts from Namalwa cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). One lane of cell extract run in parallel was cut and used in standard Western blot to identify precisely the location of the nucleolin band (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). The results clearly show that the labeled GST-A-Myb-DBD, but not labeled GST alone, can bind to a protein with exactly the same molecular mass as nucleolin. These data demonstrate that the A-Myb DBD binds to nucleolin directly. In addition, the A-Myb-DBD also binds most evidently to other proteins with apparent molecular masses of 110, 80, and 60 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Finally the binding characteristics of Myb DBD to nucleolin were investigated by performing the assay in different buffer conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the binding of nucleolin to A-Myb is strong and resists 300 mm NaCl conditions and is reduced but not abolished in 500 mm NaCl. On the other hand, as little as 0.1% SDS completely abolishes binding (Fig. 2 B,lane 4). These data suggest that the A-Myb-nucleolin interaction involves both hydrophobic and ionic bonds. These results strongly emphasize the specificity of binding of nucleolin to specific domains of A-Myb and c-Myb but not to the DBD of other transcription factors such as B-Myb or Max. To demonstrate that binding between nucleolin and A-Myb or c-Myb takes place in vivo, we have performed co-precipitation experiments. The different Myb proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were tested for the presence of nucleolin by Western blotting. That the antibodies had indeed specifically immunoprecipitated the respective Myb proteins was also verified by stripping the blots and reprobing them with the appropriate anti-Myb antibodies. As shown in Fig.3 A (lanes 1–3), during the first round of immunoprecipitation (IP), anti-A-Myb antibody specifically brought down A-Myb itself as well as nucleolin. Preimmune serum or empty beads were inactive. As expected, when lysate, which had already undergone one round of immunoprecipitation was again incubated with the same amount of fresh anti-A-Myb serum (second round of IP,lane 6), little further A-Myb or nucleolin could be precipitated. This demonstrates that nucleolin was precipitated specifically with A-Myb and was not due to some spurious activity of the anti-A-Myb antiserum, because nucleolin is a much more abundant protein than A-Myb and clearly cannot be exhausted after only one round of immunoprecipitation with anti-A-Myb antiserum. In accordance with the pull-down assays, anti-c-Myb, but not anti-B-Myb antibodies, directed against the C terminus of these proteins, was able to co-precipitate nucleolin (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8 and9). Incubation of the same blot with anti-B-Myb and anti-c-Myb antibodies confirmed that indeed both proteins had been specifically precipitated (Fig. 3 A). To confirm the specific interaction between nucleolin and Myb in vivo, we also performed the reverse experiment. A nucleolin construct with a Myc tag was prepared and transfected together with c-Myb. As shown in Fig. 3 B (lanes 2 and3), immunoprecipitating the tagged nucleolin with anti-Myc antibodies brought down co-transfected c-Myb only in cells in which the tagged nucleolin was present. As a positive control, precipitation with anti-Myb brought down c-Myb as expected (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). Of note is that the tagged nucleolin construct lacked the last 171 C-terminal aa of nucleolin, showing that this terminal region is not involved in the interaction. We have thus rigorously demonstrated that nucleolin and c-Myb/A-Myb interact in vivo by co-precipitating either partners and both endogenous and exogenous proteins. Given that Myb proteins are highly conserved within their DNA-binding domains, we set out to determine more precisely which region and which aa are involved in binding to nucleolin. We first deleted further the c-Myb and A-Myb DBD at the N terminus and tested them in pull-down assays. As shown in Fig.4 A, a GST fusion construct carrying only the R2 and R3 repeats of c-Myb (aa 91–212) was still able to bind strongly to nucleolin (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). On the other hand, a fusion protein containing the c-Myb N terminus including only R1 (aa 1–89) did not bind (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). Similarly, an R2R3 construct of A-Myb did bind to nucleolin (data not shown). We therefore analyzed the aa differences between human A-Myb/c-Myb and B-Myb R2R3. Most aa differences are conservative, with the exceptions of aa 108, 112, and 114 of R2 and aa 161 of R3 (c-Myb numbering). We therefore decided to mutagenize pairwise four clustered residues in R2 (aa 102 and 108; aa 112 and 114) and singly aa 161 of R3 from their c-Myb to their B-Myb configuration. Thus Arg102 and Gln108 in c-Myb R2R3 were mutagenized to Lys in one construct (102/108). In the second mutant Pro112 and Arg114 were changed to Thr and Gln, respectively (112/114). Finally Arg161 was mutagenized singly to Val in the last construct. In all cases the background was c-Myb R2R3 fused to GST. All mutants were then tested in pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 4 A (lanes 3–5), the point mutants were still able to bind to nucleolin except the 161 mutant, which was completely inactive. That all proteins were made in equivalent quantities and bound equally well to DNA was verified in electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a standard labeled Myb-binding site (mim-A oligonucleotide; Fig. 4 A) (36.Golay J. Loffarelli L. Luppi M. Castellano M. Introna M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2469-2479PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore quantitative bandshift analysis at different concentration of mim-A DNA probe revealed that the affinity of the different mutant proteins was equivalent to that of c-Myb wild type. The calculatedK d for the c-Myb R2R3 161 mutant was 0.07 nm, and for wild type it was 0.09 nm (data not shown). These values are in agreement with those previously described for the c-Myb DBD (42.Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K. Nishimura Y. Ishii S. Sarai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9320-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus these data demonstrate that the Arg residue in position 161 of c-Myb (conserved in position 156 of A-Myb) abolishes specifically nucleolin binding, whereas the other mutated aa in R2 do not. Furthermore we also tested a GST-v-Myb DBD fusion protein, which carries four point mutations relative to c-Myb (I91R, L106H, V117D, and I181V) (43.Introna M. Golay J. Frampton J. Nakano T. Ness S.A. Graf T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1289-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The GST-v-Myb DBD bound nucleolin-like c-Myb wild type (data not shown), showing that these further mutations in R2R3 are not crucial for the interaction. Furthermore these data suggest that the oncogenic form of c-Myb, v-Myb, can bind to nucleolin. To verify that the R161V mutation also affected in vivobinding of nucleolin to c-Myb, we transfected both constructs with the tagged nucleolin and performed a co-precipitation experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 B, c-Myb wild type was efficiently co-precipitated with anti-Myc tag antibody (lane 2), whereas little of the c-Myb 161 mutant was detected (lane 3). Again the control transfectant without c-Myb was negative (lane 1). The data presented so far have suggested that both hydrophobic and ionic interactions are important for binding of c-Myb/A-Myb R2R3 to nucleolin and that Arg161 of c-Myb (Arg 156 of A-Myb) are crucial for this interaction. Because the three-dimensional structure of c-Myb R2R3 bound to DNA has been solved by NMR (40.Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y.

https://openalex.org/W2055041189,"The function of Rab24 is currently unknown, but other members of the Rab GTPase family are known to participate in various protein trafficking pathways. Rab proteins are thought to cycle on and off vesicle membranes in conjunction with changes in their guanine nucleotide state. The present studies indicate that Rab24 possesses several unusual characteristics that distinguish it from other Rab proteins. 1) Based on [32P]orthophosphate labeling of protein-bound nucleotide, Rab24 exists predominantly in the GTP state when expressed in cultured cells. The low GTPase activity is related to the presence of serine instead of glutamine at the position cognate to Ras Gln-61. 2) Posttranslational geranylgeranylation of Rab24, determined by metabolic labeling or detergent partitioning assays, is inefficient when compared with other Rabs ending with the common CXC and CC carboxyl-terminal motifs. This is partly due to the presence of two histidines distal to the target cysteines, but also involves other unidentified features. 3) Most of the Rab24 in the cytoplasmic compartment of cultured cells is not associated with Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors. These findings indicate that, if Rab24 functions in vesicular transport processes, it may operate through a novel mechanism that does not depend on GTP hydrolysis or GDP dissociation inhibitor-mediated recycling. The function of Rab24 is currently unknown, but other members of the Rab GTPase family are known to participate in various protein trafficking pathways. Rab proteins are thought to cycle on and off vesicle membranes in conjunction with changes in their guanine nucleotide state. The present studies indicate that Rab24 possesses several unusual characteristics that distinguish it from other Rab proteins. 1) Based on [32P]orthophosphate labeling of protein-bound nucleotide, Rab24 exists predominantly in the GTP state when expressed in cultured cells. The low GTPase activity is related to the presence of serine instead of glutamine at the position cognate to Ras Gln-61. 2) Posttranslational geranylgeranylation of Rab24, determined by metabolic labeling or detergent partitioning assays, is inefficient when compared with other Rabs ending with the common CXC and CC carboxyl-terminal motifs.

In the activated GTP state, the Rab protein promotes the interaction of specific components of the v-SNARE·t-SNARE complex in a manner that facilitates docking of donor vesicles with the correct acceptor compartment. Finally, in concert with vesicle fusion, the Rab protein reverts to the GDP state, either through its intrinsic GTPase activity or the action of a specific Rab GTPase-activating protein. Once in the GDP state, the Rab protein becomes a substrate for one of several Rab guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs),1 which can extract geranylgeranylated Rabs from membranes and hold them in a cytosolic Rab·GDI complex until they are recruited into a new round of vesicular transport (17.Pfeffer S.R.

In addition, Rab24 is not efficiently geranylgeranylated when compared with other Rab proteins in cell-free systems or intact cells.

https://openalex.org/W2027261095,"Membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may be localized to this organelle by mechanisms that involve retention, retrieval, or a combination of both. For luminal ER proteins, which contain a KDEL domain, and for type I transmembrane proteins carrying a dilysine motif, specific retrieval mechanisms have been identified. However, most ER membrane proteins do not contain easily identifiable retrieval motifs. ER localization information has been found in cytoplasmic, transmembrane, or luminal domains. In this study, we have identified ER localization domains within the three type I transmembrane proteins, ribophorin I (RI), ribophorin II (RII), and OST48. Together with DAD1, these membrane proteins form an oligomeric complex that has oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) activity. We have previously shown that ER retention information is independently contained within the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain of RII, and in the case of RI, a truncated form consisting of the luminal domain was retained in the ER. To determine whether other domains of RI carry additional retention information, we have generated chimeras by exchanging individual domains of the Tac antigen with the corresponding ones of RI. We demonstrate here that only the luminal domain of RI contains ER retention information. We also show that the dilysine motif in OST48 functions as an ER localization motif because OST48 in which the two lysine residues are replaced by serine (OST48ss) is no longer retained in the ER and is found instead also at the plasma membrane. OST48ss is, however, retained in the ER when coexpressed with RI, RII, or chimeras, which by themselves do not exit from the ER, indicating that they may form partial oligomeric complexes by interacting with the luminal domain of OST48. In the case of the Tac chimera containing only the luminal domain of RII, which by itself exits from the ER and is rapidly degraded, it is retained in the ER and becomes stabilized when coexpressed with OST48.

Smith C.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 5: 631-639Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite extensive anterograde and retrograde traffic, cellular organelles maintain the characteristic protein and lipid composition necessary to execute their specific functions. Therefore, defined localization signals are required to establish the residency of a particular protein in a specific organelle or compartment (3.Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). A paradigm for this model has been provided by the identification and characterization of a C-terminal KDEL motif. This motif is found at the C termini of several luminal proteins of the ER1 and serves to mediate the retention of resident proteins of the ER lumen through retrieval from post-ER compartments ER via a transport mechanism involving vesicular and tubular elements (4.Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar, 5.Bannykh S.I. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 130: 1-4Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Another retention mechanism confers ER residency to membrane proteins that contain a cytoplasmically disposed C-terminal dilysine retention motif located close to the C terminus (6.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). This dilysine motif is recognized by coat protein I components, a membrane coat mainly concerned with retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER (5.Bannykh S.I. Balch W.E. J.

Because the majority of ER membrane proteins do not have recognizable retrieval signals, it can be expected that other ER retention mechanisms exist. Misfolded or incompletely folded proteins may interact in the ER lumen with chaperones such as imunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein, calnexin, or disulfide-isomerase, which by themselves carry retrieval signals (3.Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 10.Haas I.G. Curr. Top Microbiol.

Retention may also be achieved by the functional interactions of ER membrane proteins with an organized matrix of luminal ER proteins or with cytoskeletal elements via their cytoplasmic domains (3.Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Another type of retention mechanism involves interaction of membrane proteins with each other to form oligomeric complexes or even larger assemblies. This may be the case for membrane proteins of individual Golgi stacks (13.Nilsson T. Lucocq J.M. Mackay D. Warren G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1367-1375Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14.Munro S.

The mammalian oligosaccharyltransferase is composed of the four ER membrane proteins, ribophorin I and II (RI and RII), OST48, and DAD1, which form an oligomeric complex (22.Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23.Fu J. Ren M. Kreibich G. J. Biol.

Newly synthesized polypeptides may be N-glycosylated by this OST complex by transferring oligosaccharides, which were preassembled on the membrane-bound dolichol-pyrophosphate lipid carrier, to asparagine residues in the context of Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr). RI and OST48, and probably also RII, are type I transmembrane proteins. We have shown that the luminal domain of OST48 interacts with those of RI and RII and that the cytoplasmic domain of OST48 has affinity for the cytoplasmically exposed N-terminal tail of DAD1 (23.Fu J. Ren M. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29687-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The OST complex interacts also with Sec61, the core component of the protein translocation apparatus (24.Görlich D. Prehn S. Hartmann E. Kalies K.-U. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 489-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which also provides ribosomal binding sites (25.Kalies K.-U. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Results from experiments obtained over many years have demonstrated that components of the translocation apparatus, as well as those involved in the cotranslational modification of the newly synthesized polypeptides, are part of a proteinaceous network that confines these membrane proteins to the rough domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (18.Kreibich G. Freienstein C.M. Pereyra B.N. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19.Kreibich G. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2247-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Inclusion of proteins into this network would be an effective means of preventing their incorporation into vesicles that exit from the ER toward the Golgi apparatus. Our working hypothesis is that individual subunits of these oligomeric complexes carry by themselves ER localization motifs that function until the newly synthesized subunits are integrated into oligomeric complexes. Although OST48 contains a typical dilysine retrieval motif, RI, RII, and DAD1 do not carry established ER localization signals. We have previously shown that ER localization information in RII are contained independently in the cytoplasmic domain and in the transmembrane domain together with a short luminal flanking region. 2Fu, J., Pirozzi, G., Sanjay, A.

Here, we report that in RI only the luminal domain contains ER localization information and that replacement of the two lysine residues by serine in the dilysine retrieval motif of OST48 results in the expression of this OST subunit at the cell surface. Coexpression of OST48ss with RI or RII prevents the exit of OST48ss from the ER. This effect is most likely due to interactions between the luminal domain of OST48 with those of RI or RII. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that a Tac chimera where the luminal domain is replaced by that of RII is not only prevented from leaving the ER, but it becomes protected from degradation when coexpressed with OST48. The rat RI cDNA was cloned in this lab by Harnik-Ort et al. (28.Harnik-Ort V. Prakash K. Marcantonio E. Colman D.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J.

The dog OST48 cDNA was a gift of Dr. Reid Gilmore (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) (29.Silberstein S. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human Tac antigen cDNA was obtained by Dr. Greg Pirozzi (Cytogen Corp., Princeton, NJ). To construct pMT-2/RI and pMT-2/OST48, full-length cDNAs encoding the wild type RI and OST48 were generated by PCR using rat RI and dog OST48 cDNAs as templates. The primers used are those described in Tables Iand II. As part of the primers, EcoRI sites were introduced and the cDNAs were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pMT-2 (30.Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using standard molecular cloning methods. To construct pMT-2/OST48ss, oligonucleotides encoding the two lysines in the antisense primer (see Tables I and II) were replaced by those encoding serine residues at −3 and −5 (TTT → ACT and CTT → ACT), and the resulting PCR products were ligated into pMT-2 at EcoRI sites. A cDNA encoding the Tac antigen with HindIII andKpnI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was generated by PCR using the human Tac cDNA mentioned above as a template and the primers described in Tables I and II. The cDNA was subcloned into pExp1 (a gift of Dr. Herbert Samuels, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY). To construct plasmids containing the cDNAs encoding chimeras composed of domains of RI and the Tac antigen, I-T-T, T-I-T, and T-T-I (where I is RI, II is RII, and T is the Tac antigen), we generated cDNAs by using PCR for gene splicing by the overlap extension method as described previously (31.Horton R. Hunt H. Ho S. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR are described in Tables I and II. All three cDNAs have EcoRI sites. The transformation and preparation of plasmid DNA were carried out according to standard protocols.

HeLa cells were grown as monolayer cultures at 37 °C, 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfection of cells, pulse-chase labeling, immunoprecipitation and Endo H treatment were done as described.2 The polyclonal rabbit anti-RI antibody was raised against RI purified from rat liver microsomes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (32.Rosenfeld M.G. Marcantonio E.E. Hakimi J. Ort V.M. Atkinson P.H. Sabatini D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal rat anti-RI antibody was raised against SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified rat RI. It detects an epitope located on the luminal domain of RI (33.Yu Y. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody directed against OST48 was raised in rabbits against a fusion protein containing the luminal domain of dog OST48 fused at its C terminus with glutathioneS-transferase using an expression vector developed by Ron and Dressler (34.Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the antibody that detects the Tac antigen, the mouse myeloma cell line 7G7B6 was propagated in BALB/c 3T3 mice (35.Rubin L.A. Kwrman C.C. Biddeson W.E. Goldman N.D. Nelson D.L. Hybridoma. 1985; 4: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the IgG fraction was purified from the ascites fluid by passing the fluid over a protein A-Sepharose column. Transfected cells were grown on coverslips at 50–70% confluence (about 48 h after transfection), rinsed three times with 1× cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, followed by the same rinsing steps. The cells were treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated for 10 min if they had to be permeabilized. Permeabilized or nonpermeabilized cells were then incubated with 10 mm glycine for 10–20 min. After incubation with blocking solution (5% dried milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. The monoclonal antibody α-RI was used at 1:200 dilution, the polyclonal antibody α-OST48 was used at 1:400 dilution, and the antibody against the Tac antigen, 7G7B6, was used at 1:100 dilution. After washing three times with blocking solution, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody or Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody diluted 1:100 in blocking solution, followed by three washing steps as described before. The coverslips were then mounted with citifluor and labeled proteins located either on the cell surface or in the ER were detected using the Axiphot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with 63× and 100× Plan-neofluar objective lenses. If double labeling was performed, a mixture of the two primary antibodies, RI and OST48, raised in different species such as mouse and rabbit respectively, was used to recognize two overexpressed proteins, followed by staining with a mixture of two secondary antibodies that includes fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey directed against mouse and Texas Red-conjugated donkey directed against rabbit IgG, respectively. Immunofluorescence micrographs shown in Fig. 6 were obtained with the Nikon PCM 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) using the Simple 32 software (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Images were prepared for publication using the Adobe Photoshop software. RI is a type I transmembrane protein of the ER that does not contain identifiable ER localization signals, such as a C-terminally located dilysine motif. From previous studies we know that truncated forms of RI that consist of luminal portions of RI but are not anchored to the membrane are retained in the ER (36.Tsao Y.S. Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the membrane anchored RI-Tac chimera I-T-T was expressed in HeLa cell, it was quantitatively retained in the ER as indicated by the typical ER staining patterns seen in immunofluorescence micrographs (Fig.2 B). On the other hand, the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains contain apparently no ER localization information because the Tac chimera T-I-T and T-T-I were expressed on the cell surface as detected by immunofluoresence of nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 2, C and E). In the case of T-I-T, surface labeling could be detected even in permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that this chimera exits from the ER very efficiently, resulting in high concentrations of the chimera at the cell surface. It appears, therefore, that in RI only the luminal domain contains ER localization information. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments. HeLa cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the Tac chimera I-T-T, T-I-T, and T-T-I, and after 44 h they were metabolically labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and then chased for 0 or 3 h. The chimeric proteins were immunoprecipitated using antibodies directed against RI (for I-T-T) or the Tac antigen (for T-I-T and T-T-I). Half of the samples were treated with Endo H. After a chase period of 3 h, I-T-T remained sensitive to the Endo H digestion (Fig.3, lanes c and d), whereas T-I-T (lanes g and h) or T-T-I (lane k and l) became at least partially Endo H-resistant (marked by an arrowhead). It is interesting to note that more of the chimera T-I-T became Endo H-resistant compared with T-T-I. These results are consistent with immunostaining experiments where cells expressing the chimera T-I-T showed much stronger surface immunofluorescence than those expressing T-T-I (Fig. 2). It appears, therefore, that the cytoplasmic domain of RI contains weak ER retention information. This was also seen when T-T-I was coexpressed with OST48ss (see Fig. 6 K).Figure 3A Tac chimera containing the transmembrane domain or the cytoplasmic domain of RI acquires Endo H resistance.HeLa cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding the Tac chimeras I-T-T, T-I-T, and T-T-I. 44 h after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min at 37 °C and then chased for 0 or 3 h. To immunoprecipitate I-T-T, a polyclonal rabbit anti-RI antibody was used, whereas a monoclonal anti-Tac antibody that recognizes a luminal epitope allowed to isolate the chimera T-I-T and T-T-I. Immunoprecipitates were then treated with Endo H (+) (lanes b, d, f,h, j, and l) or kept as untreated controls (−) (lanes a, c, e,g, i, and k). Samples were analyzed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography.Arrowheads indicate the position of T-I-T and T-T-I that acquired Endo H resistance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) OST48 is a type I ER transmembrane protein that contains a typical dilysine motif close to the C terminus. This motif serves as a retrieval signal in other type I ER transmembrane proteins (6.Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). To test whether the dilysine motif in OST48 behaves indeed as an ER localization signal as predicted, HeLa cells were transfected with a cDNA encoding either the wild type OST48 or a mutant form of OST48 in which the two lysine residues were replaced by two serine residues (OST48ss) (Fig. 1 A). As expected, in permeabilized cells we observed immunostaining of OST48 as a lace-like pattern characteristic of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.4 B), whereas nonpermeabilized cells remained unstained (Fig. 4 A). In HeLa cells expressing OST48ss, surface labeling was detected in nonpermeabilized cells (Fig.4 C), and in addition, ER fluorescence was detected when the cells were permeabilized (Fig. 4 D). These results demonstrated that the overexpressed wild type OST48 was retained in the ER, whereas OST48ss was not only found in the ER but also on the cell surface, thus confirming that the dilysine motif in OST48 does function as an ER localization signal, as was previously shown for the dilysine motif in Wbp1p, a yeast homolog of OST48 (37.Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). RI, RII, and OST48 together with DAD1 form an oligomeric complex that has oligosaccharyltransferase activity (22.Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 38.Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We have also shown that this oligomer is maintained by interactions between the luminal domain of OST48 with those of RI or RII (23.Fu J. Ren M. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29687-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that when OST48ss is coexpressed with RI and/or RII, these subunits may form partial oligomeric complexes by interacting via their luminal domains. Two possibilities may be considered: either OST48ss, RI, and RII move together out of ER to the cell surface because by interacting with OST48ss the retention information of RI and RII is neutralized or OST48ss is retained in the ER because the retention signals of RI or RII are dominant. To test these two alternatives, OST48ss was coexpressed in HeLa cells with RI and/or RII, followed by coimmunostaining. When expressed alone, OST48ss was found both at the cell surface (Fig. 5 A) and in the ER (Fig. 5 B), whereas coexpression of OST48ss and RI resulted only in ER staining of both proteins (Fig. 5, D andF). When OST48ss with RII or OST48ss with both RI and RII were coexpressed, the same results were obtained (data not shown). Retention of OST48ss in the ER was also observed when it was coexpressed with the Tac chimera containing the luminal domain of RI and the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains of the Tac antigen (I-T-T; Fig. 6, A–D) or the chimera containing both luminal and transmembrane domains of RII and the cytoplasmic domain of the Tac antigen (II-II-T) (data not shown).2 We have shown that the chimera T-I-T and T-T-I are expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 2,C and E, respectively). When coexpressed with OST48ss either one of the RI-Tac chimera will exit from the ER and they, as well as OST48ss can be detected at the cell surface (Fig.6, E, G,I, and K). These results are best explained by assuming that the luminal domain of OST48ss interacts with those of RI or RII, as was recently demonstrated (23.Fu J. Ren M. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29687-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and that these partial oligomeric complexes are retained in the ER when one of the partners has ER retention information. As described before, when the chimera II-T-T was expressed in HeLa cells, it exited from the ER and was found at the cell surface, as well as in a lysosomal compartment.2 It was rather quickly degraded (t 12 = ∼2 h), and the addition of leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases, largely prevented its degradation. 3G. Pirozzi and G. Kreibich, unpublished observation. Based on the coexpression experiments shown above, it was expected that II-T-T is retained by OST48 in the ER through the interaction between their luminal domains. We therefore transfected HeLa cells with the Tac chimera II-T-T alone or II-T-T together with OST48, followed by pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation using an antibody directed against the lumimal domain of RII. Aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were then treated with Endo H. As shown in Fig. 7 (lane a), immediately after the pulse period, the major band immunoprecipitated with the anti-RII antibody corresponds to the N-glycosylated form of the Tac chimera II-T-T (II-T-T*), although a small fraction is made as an unglycosylated protein (II-T-T). In addition, two faint bands of about equal intensity (lane a)"

Based on the crystal structure of the α2-I domain, a hypothetical model was proposed in which collagen binds to a groove on the upper surface of the I domain (Emsley, J., King, S. L., Bergelson, J. M., and Liddington, R. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28512–28517). We have introduced point mutations into 13 residues on the upper surface of the domain. Recombinant mutant proteins were assayed for binding to monoclonal antibodies 6F1 and 12F1, to collagen under static conditions, and for the ability to retain adhesive activity under flow conditions. The mutations to residues surrounding the metal ion-dependent adhesion site that caused the greatest loss of collagen binding under both static and flow conditions are N154S in the βA-α1 turn, N190D in the βB-βC turn, D219R in the α3-α4 turn, and E256V and H258V in the βD-α5 turn. Mutation in one of the residues that coordinate the metal binding, S155A, completely lost the adhesive activity under flow but bound normally under static conditions, whereas the mutation Y285F had the converse effect. We conclude that the upper surface of the domain, including the metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, defines the collagen recognition site.

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion (1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8963) Google Scholar). The integrin α2β1 is expressed on several different cell types. Although it is a collagen receptor in platelet and fibroblastic cells, it functions both as a collagen and laminin receptor on endothelial and epithelial cells (2.Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3.Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J.

Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).α2β1 is composed of a 150-kDa α2 and a 130-kDa β1 subunit (5.Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Within the α2 subunit, the 200-amino acid I domain shares homology with the A domains of von Willebrand factor, complement proteins, cartilage matrix protein, and certain other integrins. There is increasing evidence that I (A) domains play an important role in cell-adhesion protein and cell-matrix interaction.Within the α2β1 integrin, the I domain (amino acids 140–349) provides the principal binding site for collagen. Thus, antibodies that block α2β1interaction with collagen recognize epitopes within the I domain (6.Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bahou W.F. Potter C.L. Mirza H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Coller B.S. Beer J.H.

Three groups have shown that recombinant α2-I domain fusion proteins bind specifically to collagen in a divalent cation-dependent manner (9.Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J.

Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Like other I domains, the α2-I domain contains a cation-binding site called the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif (13.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure (14.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the side chains of residues Ser-153, Ser-155, and Asp-254 directly coordinate a Mg2+ion, and Asp-151 and Thr-221 provide water-mediated bonds. One study reported that mutation of residues Asp-151, Thr-221, or Asp-254 abolishes adhesion of the intact integrin α2β1 to collagen (12.Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas of these three residues only Thr-221 is absolutely critical for the binding of the recombinant glutathione S-transferase-α2-I fusion protein to collagen.Very recently we reported (15.Estavillo D. Ritchie A. Diacovo T.G. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35921-35926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) the expression and characterization of a recombinant α2-I protein that inhibits the interaction of platelets with collagen under flow conditions. Furthermore, this recombinant α2-I binds specifically to collagen in a divalent cation-dependent manner.Based on the crystal structure, a hypothetical model of an I domain-collagen complex has been proposed, and specific residues were identified that might be critical for collagen binding (14.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested this model by introducing point mutations into 13 residues surrounding the MIDAS motif. We then expressed recombinant α2-I mutants and analyzed both the collagen binding activity and the ability to bind collagen under flow conditions. We coated beads with the proteins and tested in a flow chamber to resemble the function of a platelet membrane receptor exposed to collagen fibrils. We have identified several amino acids, distinct from the MIDAS residues, which are critical for α2-I domain binding to collagen. The results provide direct experimental support for the hypothetical model.RESULTSAfter induction with IPTG, bacteria transformed with pQE9-α2-I plasmids and expressing α2-I mutants were lysed. As described for wild type α2-I protein (15.Estavillo D. Ritchie A. Diacovo T.G. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35921-35926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the resultant bacterial lysate was then passed over a Co2+ column, and the bound protein was eluted with a step imidazole gradient. The highly purified proteins were dialyzed against TBS. The final yields of the purified mutant proteins were between 1 and 10 mg/liter bacterial culture. All the proteins migrated identically to wild type α2-I protein, when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reduced and non-reduced conditions (data not shown).Effect of Mutations in Binding Monoclonal Antibodies 6F1 and 12F1We previously reported that monoclonal antibodies 6F1 and 12F1 recognize a conformation-dependent epitope within the α2-I domain and block the interaction of α2-I protein with collagen (15.Estavillo D. Ritchie A. Diacovo T.G. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35921-35926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, reactivity with these antibodies was determined to provide an index of the structural integrity of the recombinant α2-I mutant proteins, and decreases in reactivity were used to localize the target epitope(s) of each antibody. The binding data for the α2-I mutants are summarized in Fig. 1. Compared with wild type, 10 mutants bound normally to both antibodies (>80% wild type binding) indicating that they are correctly folded and that the mutations are not a critical component of the bound epitope. Mutation N154S had a binding activity for the two antibodies between 65 and 75% of wild type binding. The mutant, K298E, had the lowest binding activity for antibodies 6F1 and 12F1 (<40%) but had normal collagen interaction (see below), suggesting that this residue, which lies on the edge of the upper surface of the domain, forms part of the target epitope for both antibodies. Mutation S155A had normal binding to 12F1 but showed 50% reduced binding to antibody 6F1, suggesting either that Ser-155 also forms part of the antibody epitope or that there is a partial misfolding of the upper surface of α2-I domain.Effect of Mutations in Binding to CollagenThe collagen binding activity of the α2-I mutants relative to that of the wild type was examined over a range of concentrations (Fig.2).

By comparison, introduction of mutations N154S, N190D, D219R, E256V, and Y285F greatly increased the concentrations required for half-maximal collagen binding (>6.0 μm). Mutation H258V completely impaired the collagen binding activity (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, mutation on the metal coordination residue, S155A, had normal collagen binding and a half-maximal binding of 0.75 μm (Fig. 2). The half-maximal binding values for the mutations L220R, N287D, N289D, L291D, N295F, and K298E were observed between 1.0 and 3.0 μm (data not shown).Figure 2Binding of α2-I proteins to collagen. Increasing concentrations of the α2-I proteins were incubated with immobilized human type I collagen. Bound protein was determined by ELISA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The figure shows the mutant proteins that had a markedly different binding curve than the wild type.

Fig. 3 Ashows a photomicrograph of attached wild type α2-I protein-coated beads to collagen fibrils after 3 min perfusion at a shear rate of 300 s−1. As expected, this interaction was blocked by the addition of either 5 mm EDTA (Fig. 3 B) or monoclonal antibody 6F1 (Fig. 3 C). The number of beads attached in the presence of EDTA or 6F1 was similar to beads coated with BSA (Fig. 3 D). These results confirmed the importance of the MIDAS motif and the structural integrity of this motif in the coupled α2-I protein.Figure 3Adhesion of α2-I protein-coated beads to collagen fibrils at shear rate of 300 s−1. Collagen-coated dishes (100 μg/ml) were perfused with a suspension of α2-I protein-coated beads (3.0–3.8 × 108/ml).

The mutants, D219R and H258V, that yielded half-maximal collagen binding values of 6.0 μm or more (Fig. 2) completely lost their adhesive activity (Fig. 4). In addition, mutations N154S, N190D, and E256V that also had low collagen binding activity retained less than 38% of wild type adhesive activity. Discrepancies between the results of both assays were also observed. Mutant S155A, which had normal collagen binding activity, completely lost adhesive activity. In contrast, mutation Y285F, previously shown to possess a low collagen binding activity, retained 70% of wild type adhesive activity. N289D retained 50% activity, whereas the remaining mutants retained more than 75% of wild type activity. Fig. 4 also shows the inhibitory effect of EDTA and the monoclonal antibodies 6F1 and 12F1.Figure 4Effect of the mutations on the adhesion of α2-I protein-coated beads to collagen fibrils. Adhesive properties of the α2-I mutant proteins were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 3 and under “Experimental Procedures.” The values were normalized to the value obtained for wild type α2-I protein.

In previous studies, we reported the expression of a recombinant α2-I protein that binds to collagen in a metal-dependent manner and inhibits platelet interaction with collagen under flow conditions (15.Estavillo D. Ritchie A. Diacovo T.G. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35921-35926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).This is the first study to demonstrate that polystyrene beads, similar in size to platelets, coated with the recombinant α2-I protein adhere to collagen with the adhesive properties found in the intact platelet α2β1 complex. Similar to the studies that used platelets at shear rates of 300 s−1, our α2-I protein-coated beads adhered to collagen fibrils in a metal-dependent manner (21.Santoro S.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 913-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 22.Zijenah L.S. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and this adhesion was blocked by an anti-functional monoclonal antibody (20.Verkleij M.W. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. de Groot Ph.G. Barnes M.J. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 3808-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of both EDTA and antibodies 6F1 or 12F1 on the adhesion of coated beads provides evidence that the folding and conformation of the isolated I domain is similar to that found in the native GPIa-IIa complex. Our findings, therefore, confirm the important role of GPIa-IIa in mediating platelet adhesion to collagen and show that the I domain is the smallest fragment of the GPIa-IIa complex to mediate this interaction under flow conditions.Based on the crystal structure of the α2-I domain, a hypothetical model was proposed for the collagen-binding site (14.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We mutated residues that were predicted to be collagen contact sites and other residues on the surface of the domain surrounding the MIDAS motif. In general, the mutated residues were completely exposed, did not form salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, or have other contacts with the rest of the domain. Mutations were either uncharged to charged or charge reversal. We also mutated the metal-coordinating MIDAS residue, Ser-155 to Ala.We used the previously described flow system since it provided an efficient and physiologically relevant method to study the function of small quantities of recombinant α2-I mutant proteins. The analysis is also simplified as it utilizes purified recombinant α2-I protein rather than the heterodimeric platelet α2β1complex. Using flow studies as one of the functional end points also eliminates the need to express the α2 chain in the surface membrane of other cell types. The close correlation between the reduced ability of the α2-I mutant proteins to adhere to collagen under shear conditions and results obtained in binding assays (static conditions) helps to validate the flow chamber method and supports the hypothesis that the residues that we have identified by structural studies play a role in platelet adhesion.Very recently, the crystal structure of a collagen-I domain complex has been determined. 2J. Emsley, C. G. Knight, M. J. Barnes, R. W. Farndale, and R. C. Liddington, submitted for publication. The structure confirms the location of the collagen-binding site (Fig.5 A), with a glutamic acid from the collagen directly coordinating the metal ion in the MIDAS motif. Four mutations that resulted in the greatest disruption of collagen interaction, N154S in the βA-α1 turn, D219R in the α3-α4 turn, and E256V and H258V in the βD-α5 turn, form part of the surface surrounding the MIDAS motif that make direct contact with collagen. Other mutations that do not affect collagen binding under flow conditions (Y285F, N287D, N289D, L291D, N295E, and K298E in the C-helix, α6 and C-α6 turn) do not contact collagen.Figure 5Mapping mutations to the structure of the α2-I domain-collagen complex. All atom representation of the α2-I domain, looking down onto the MIDAS face, showing sites of mutation, color-coded according to their effect on adhesion under flow. The collagen triple helix is shown as three coils, and the metal ion in the MIDAS motif as M. A, the high affinity conformation from the crystal structure of the I domain-collagen complex.2 Red balls indicate mutations that reduce adhesive activity by 60% or more. Yellow ball indicates N289D, a mutation that retained 50% of adhesive activity. Blue balls indicate mutations that show 70% or greater adhesive activity to collagen. The green ballindicates K298E, a mutation that reduces 6F1 and 12F1 antibody binding but shows >80% adhesive activity. B, a hypothetical low affinity complex, in which the α2-I domain structure, is that of the unliganded conformation (14.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Note the location of Tyr-285 in the two states; the mutation Tyr-285 reduces binding under static conditions but has little effect under flow, consistent with two different conformations in the two assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The crystal structure also reveals that collagen binding induces dramatic changes in the upper surface of the I domain (compare Fig. 5,A and B), and it was proposed that the conformational shift switches the I domain from a low affinity to a high affinity state. Interestingly, mutation Y285F, which retained 70% of wild type activity in the flow assay, had a low collagen binding activity under static conditions. As seen in Fig. 5 A, Tyr-285 lies atop the MIDAS motif in the “low affinity” conformation and makes contact with collagen. In assuming the high affinity conformation, this residue undergoes a positional change that removes it from the collagen-binding surface. It is therefore possible that in the static assay, binding to the low affinity conformation occurs, whereas in the flow assay, binding to the “high affinity” conformation is observed. Distinct binding modes, and perhaps distinct collagen sequence specificities, under flow versus static conditions are further suggested by both the different cation requirements and the effects of the S155A mutation (Ser-155 forms a direct bond to the metal in the MIDAS motif). The high affinity conformation has a more extended shape than the low affinity conformer, suggesting that the shear forces experienced by the I domain when the platelet engages collagen might provide a direct mechanism of activation by “molecular stretching.” “Catch bonds,” which strengthen when tensile force is applied, have been predicted theoretically (23.Dembo M. Torney D.C. Saxman K. Hammer D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 234: 55-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein (GP)1Ia/IIa (integrin α2β1) is a major platelet adhesion receptor for collagen. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules that mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion (1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8963) Google Scholar). The integrin α2β1 is expressed on several different cell types. Although it is a collagen receptor in platelet and fibroblastic cells, it functions both as a collagen and laminin receptor on endothelial and epithelial cells (2.Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3.Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It also acts as the receptor for the human pathogen echovirus-1 (4.Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). α2β1 is composed of a 150-kDa α2 and a 130-kDa β1 subunit (5.Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Within the α2 subunit, the 200-amino acid I domain shares homology with the A domains of von Willebrand factor, complement proteins, cartilage matrix protein, and certain other integrins. There is increasing evidence that I (A) domains play an important role in cell-adhesion protein and cell-matrix interaction. Within the α2β1 integrin, the I domain (amino acids 140–349) provides the principal binding site for collagen. Thus, antibodies that block α2β1interaction with collagen recognize epitopes within the I domain (6.Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Bahou W.F. Potter C.L. Mirza H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three groups have shown that recombinant α2-I domain fusion proteins bind specifically to collagen in a divalent cation-dependent manner (9.Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 981-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a fourth group has presented conflicting data suggesting that collagen binding is independent of divalent cation (12.Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other I domains, the α2-I domain contains a cation-binding site called the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif (13.Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure (14.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the side chains of residues Ser-153, Ser-155, and Asp-254 directly coordinate a Mg2+ion, and Asp-151 and Thr-221 provide water-mediated bonds. One study reported that mutation of residues Asp-151, Thr-221, or Asp-254 abolishes adhesion of the intact integrin α2β1 to collagen (12.Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas of these three residues only Thr-221 is absolutely critical for the binding of the recombinant glutathione S-transferase-α2-I fusion protein to collagen. Very recently we reported (15.Estavillo D. Ritchie A. Diacovo T.G. Cruz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35921-35926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) the expression and characterization of a recombinant α2-I protein that inhibits the interaction of platelets with collagen under flow conditions. Furthermore, this recombinant α2-I binds specifically to collagen in a divalent cation-dependent manner. Based on the crystal structure, a hypothetical model of an I domain-collagen complex has been proposed, and specific residues were identified that might be critical for collagen binding (14.Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested this model by introducing point mutations into 13 residues surrounding the MIDAS motif. We then expressed recombinant α2-I mutants and analyzed both the collagen binding activity and the ability to bind collagen under flow conditions. We coated beads with the proteins and tested in a flow chamber to resemble the function of a platelet membrane receptor exposed to collagen fibrils. We have identified several amino acids, distinct from the MIDAS residues, which are critical for α2-I domain binding to collagen. The results provide direct experimental support for the hypothetical model. RESULTSAfter induction with IPTG, bacteria transformed with pQE9-α2-I plasmids and expressing α2-I mutants were lysed."

Acetylcholine evoked a K+ current, I ACh, via the endogenous pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi/o proteins. Activation of I ACh was accelerated by increasing the expression of m2R, suggesting a collision coupling mechanism in which one receptor catalytically activates several G proteins. Coexpression of the α subunit of the PTX-insensitive G protein Gz, Gαz, induced a slowly activating PTX-insensitive I ACh, whose activation kinetics were also compatible with the collision coupling mechanism. When GIRK was coexpressed with an m2R·Gαz fusion protein (tandem), in which the C terminus of m2R was tethered to the N terminus of Gαz, part of I ACh was still eliminated by PTX. Thus, the m2R of the tandem activates the tethered Gαz but also the nontethered Gi/o proteins. After PTX treatment, the speed of activation of the m2R·Gαz-mediated response did not depend on the expression level of m2R·Gαz and was faster than when m2R and Gαz were coexpressed as separate proteins. These results demonstrate that fusing the receptor and the Gα strengthens their coupling, support the collision-coupling mechanism between m2R and the G proteins, and suggest a noncatalytic (stoichiometric) coupling between the G protein and GIRK in this model system.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein activated K+channel (Kir3) muscarinic m2 receptor pertussis toxin acetylcholine Members of the Gi/o family of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Go1, Go2, and Gz) regulate numerous effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, protein kinases, etc. (1.Gilman A.G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A great number of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 activate Gi/o proteins while usually being rather ineffective in interacting with the other three large families (Gs, Gq, and G12) (2.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The diversity of Gi/o-coupled GPCRs and of the Gαi/o subunits suggests that the various GPCRs should specifically activate different cellular responses via different Gi/o proteins. Many outstanding examples of specific regulation of effectors by certain Gi/o-coupled GPCRs have been described in vivo; however, only limited specificity is observed on the level of receptor-Gαi/o interaction in intact cells and especially in model expression systems (for review see Ref. 2.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the overall GPCR-effector coupling specificity is defined by factors such as colocalization or scaffolding of the signaling components, the presence of additional regulatory proteins such as regulators of G proteins signaling, effector/G protein specificity, etc. (6.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 7.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8.Gudermann T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, in the Gi/o-related pathways, these factors still remain poorly understood. One proposed mechanism of ensuring a specific activation of a certain Gα by a GPCR is the existence of a stable complex between the receptor and the G protein in the absence of agonist. The existence of such complexes is supported by several lines of data, among them coimmunoprecipitation of several GPCRs with the corresponding Gα proteins in many cell types (6.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 7.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8.Gudermann T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, in other systems, a collision coupling-type mechanism (10.Levitzki A. Marbach I. Bar-Sinai A. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11.Levitzki A. Science. 1988; 241: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) between GPCRs and the G proteins has been demonstrated. In these systems, the receptor is not a priori coupled to Gα, and the coupling takes place only after the binding of an agonist to the receptor. A receptor activated in this way shuttles between and catalytically activates several G proteins in succession.To study activation and effector coupling of individual Gαi/o proteins in separation from the other members of the family, it is necessary to overcome the problem that each of the Gi/o proteins can be activated by almost any Gi/o-interacting GPCR. Attempts to achieve specific coupling in GPCR-Gα pairs were made by creating GPCR·Gα fusion proteins (12.Medici R. Bianchi E. Di Segni G. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7241-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13.Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in Gi/o-containing GPCR·Gα tandems, the tethered receptor still activates “nearby” nontethered Gαi/o proteins (15.Burt A.R. Sautel M. Wilson M.A. Rees S. Wise A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10367-10375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This problem has been partly overcome (14.Wise A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24673-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by utilizing the pertussis toxin (PTX) sensitivity, which is a characteristic of all Gαi/o proteins except Gαz (16.Ho M.K. Wong Y.H. Biol. Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 17.Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PTX catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of a cysteine near the end of the C terminus, preventing the coupling of the agonist-bound receptor to Gα, the dissociation of Gα and Gβγ subunits, and the activation of their effectors (1.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). Changing the C-terminal cysteine to glycine or serine renders Gα insensitive to PTX, but it can still be activated by the receptors (18.Kostenis E. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,19.Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Thus, after PTX treatment, the GPCR of the tandem containing such a mutant Gαi/o interacts only with the tethered Gα. However, another problem arose. In the best studied case, a tandem of the α2A adrenoreceptor with a PTX-resistant mutant Gαi1(C351G), both the receptor-activated GTPase activity and the coupling to the effector (adenylyl cyclase) were substantially impaired as compared with the wild-type Gαi (20.Carr I.C. Burt A.R. Jackson V.N. Wright J. Wise A. Rees S. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21.Sautel M. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is not surprising, given the importance of the C-terminal end of Gα in receptor recognition and coupling (18.Kostenis E. Zeng F.Y. Wess J. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19.Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and the devastating effects of some (although not all) mutations of the C-terminal cysteine on receptor-Gα coupling (22.Garcia P.D. Onrust R. Bell S.M. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4460-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23.Osawa S. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31052-31058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).To avoid the use of mutant Gα and to still be able to compare effector activation by free versus receptor-fused Gαi/o protein, we utilized the naturally PTX-resistant Gαz (24.Fong H.K. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3066-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 25.Matsuoka M. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5384-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Gαz is activated by a variety of Gαi/o-coupled GPCRs and inhibits adenylyl cyclase like other Gαi/o proteins (reviewed in Refs. 16.Ho M.K. Wong Y.H. Biol. Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and 17.Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), but Gαz shows a slower GDP-GTP exchange rate and a very low GTPase activity (17.Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Recently, endogenous α-adrenergic receptors have been shown to inhibit N-type Ca2+ channels and to activate the G protein-activated, inwardly rectifying K+channels (GIRK) in a PTX-resistant manner in sympathetic neurons after overexpression of Gαz (26.Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1201-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+ channel inhibition and GIRK activation are mediated by a direct interaction of these channels with Gβγ normally released from Gαi/o proteins (4.Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 27.Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 28.Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29.Ikeda S.R. Dunlap K. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 131-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of GIRK channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes as an assay to study the receptor-G protein-effector coupling has been widely utilized (28.Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30.Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). It allows a controlled expression of different amounts of proteins under study, simply by injecting different amounts of the encoding RNAs, enabling a quantitative study of various aspects of the coupling mechanism. Furthermore, the binding and unbinding of Gβγ to and from the channel are fast. The rise and decay times of the GIRK current upon agonist application and washout are believed to be limited primarily by the rate of G protein activation (normally, the GDP-GTP exchange at the Gα) and by the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gα, respectively (28.Dascal N. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 31.Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 469-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32.Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Therefore, the kinetics of GIRK currents reflect the kinetics of G protein activation and deactivation. Here, using this system, we demonstrate a collision coupling-type (10.Levitzki A. Marbach I. Bar-Sinai A. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) mechanism in activation of the GIRK by m2R via PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins and via Gz and a substantial improvement of the efficiency of coupling by tethering m2R and the Gα in tandem. Members of the Gi/o family of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, Go1, Go2, and Gz) regulate numerous effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, protein kinases, etc. (1.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar, 2.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 3.Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 4.Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 5.Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A great number of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 activate Gi/o proteins while usually being rather ineffective in interacting with the other three large families (Gs, Gq, and G12) (2.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 6.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The diversity of Gi/o-coupled GPCRs and of the Gαi/o subunits suggests that the various GPCRs should specifically activate different cellular responses via different Gi/o proteins. Many outstanding examples of specific regulation of effectors by certain Gi/o-coupled GPCRs have been described in vivo; however, only limited specificity is observed on the level of receptor-Gαi/o interaction in intact cells and especially in model expression systems (for review see Ref. 2.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the overall GPCR-effector coupling specificity is defined by factors such as colocalization or scaffolding of the signaling components, the presence of additional regulatory proteins such as regulators of G proteins signaling, effector/G protein specificity, etc. (6.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 7.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8.Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9.Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, in the Gi/o-related pathways, these factors still remain poorly understood. One proposed mechanism of ensuring a specific activation of a certain Gα by a GPCR is the existence of a stable complex between the receptor and the G protein in the absence of agonist. The existence of such complexes is supported by several lines of data, among them coimmunoprecipitation of several GPCRs with the corresponding Gα proteins in many cell types (6.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 7.Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8.Gudermann T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, in other systems, a collision coupling-type mechanism (10.Levitzki A. Marbach I. Bar-Sinai A. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11.Levitzki A. Science. 1988; 241: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) between GPCRs and the G proteins has been demonstrated. In these systems, the receptor is not a priori coupled to Gα, and the coupling takes place only after the binding of an agonist to the receptor. A receptor activated in this way shuttles between and catalytically activates several G proteins in succession. To study activation and effector coupling of individual Gαi/o proteins in separation from the other members of the family, it is necessary to overcome the problem that each of the Gi/o proteins can be activated by almost any Gi/o-interacting GPCR. Attempts to achieve specific coupling in GPCR-Gα pairs were made by creating GPCR·Gα fusion proteins (12.Medici R. Bianchi E. Di Segni G. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7241-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13.Bertin B. Freissmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This identification of a second major class of MAT emphasizes the long evolutionary history of the archaeal lineage and the structural diversity found even in crucial metabolic enzymes. S-adenosylmethionine ATP:l-methionineS-adenosyltransferase tripolyphosphate S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1 plays a central role in the metabolism of all known organisms (1.Cantoni G.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 435-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 2.Usdin E. Borchardt R.T. Creveling C.R. Biochemistry of S-Adenosylmethionine and Related Compounds. MacMillan Press, London1982Crossref Google Scholar). AdoMet is the most widely used methyl group donor in cells (3.Chiang P.K. Gordon R.K. Tal J. Zeng G.C. Doctor B.P. Pardhasaradhi K. McCann P.P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In another major role, decarboxylation of AdoMet generates the donor of the propylamine moiety employed in polyamine biosynthesis (4.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar, 5.Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). AdoMet has recently been found to serve as the precursor to the acyl-homoserine lactones that many bacteria use as a means of sensing cell density (quorum sensing) (6.Hanzelka B.L. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5291-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the precursor to a 5′-deoxyadenosyl free radical formed in some anaerobic enzymatic reactions (7.Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Jornvall H. Krook M. Pontis E. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that only ATP is involved in more different metabolic processes (1.Cantoni G.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 435-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The only known route of AdoMet synthesis is catalyzed by ATP:l-methionine S-adenosyltransferase (MAT, orS-adenosylmethionine synthetase) (EC 2.5.1.6) (8.Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 204: 403-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Mudd S.H. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, Inc., New York1973: 121-154Google Scholar, 10.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Adv. Enzymol. 1984; 56: 251-282PubMed Google Scholar). MAT activity has been described in members of the bacteria, eukarya, and archaea, and the enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from organisms of the first two of these domains (11.Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4506-4513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol.

Sequences of MAT from eukarya and bacteria reveal that it is a strongly conserved protein typically having 380–400 residues, with, for example, 59% sequence identity between either of the two human isozymes (which are 84% identical to each other) and that from Escherichia coli. Despite the conservation of MAT in the bacterial and eukaryal domains, no genes encoding MAT have been identified in the published archaeal genome sequences. A previous report described the partial purification and characterization of MAT activity in the crenarchaeonSulfolobus solfataricus, but no sequence data were reported (16.Porcelli M. Cacciapuoti G. Carneti-Fraina M. Gambacorta A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The lack of recognizable archaeal homologs of MAT raised the possibility that archaea use an alternative methyl donor in vivo, a plausible hypothesis given the variety and abundance of euryarchaeal methyl-carrying cofactors (17.DiMarco A.A. Bobik T.A. Wolfe R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 355-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and the chiral and covalent instability of AdoMet at high temperatures and physiological pH (18.Hoffman J.L.

In order to identify the enzyme that catalyzes AdoMet formation in archaea, we have purified the protein from Methanococcus jannaschii, the first archaeon for which the complete genome sequence was determined (19.Bult C.J.

We have used mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides to identify the gene that encodes it. Although the protein sequence is distantly related to the bacterial and eukaryotic MAT proteins, we demonstrate that recombinantly produced M. jannaschii MAT protein is functionally similar to those enzymes. Comparison with the crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme (20.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) indicates that the active site residues are among the few residues conserved across both classes of MAT enzymes. Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless noted. AdoMet was obtained from Research Biochemicals International.l-[methyl-14C]Methionine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Ecoscint scintillation fluid was purchased from National Diagnostics. AdoMet synthetase activity was determined by the [14C]AdoMet filter binding method (12.Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Routine assays were performed at 58 °C in the presence of 0.1 mml-[methyl-14C]methionine (1.9 mCi/mmol), 10 mm ATP in 50 mmHepes·K+ at pH 8.0 with 50 mm KCl, and 20 mm MgCl2. The phosphate forming activity was determined by quantifying orthophosphate production (21.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 168: 1-4Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 22.Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Assays of the tripolyphosphate hydrolytic activity contained 50 mmHepes·K+ at pH 7.8 with 10 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2. The enzyme was stable for more than 1 h at 58 °C. M. jannaschii JAL-1 cells were grown at 85 °C using a H2/CO2/H2S gas mixture in a 12-liter reactor at the University of Illinois Fermentation Facility. Anaerobic growth medium was modified from previously described formulations (23.Daniels L. Belay N. Rajagopal B.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1986; 51: 703-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Mukhopadhyay B. Johnson E.F. Wolfe R.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5059-5065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex medium contained 385 mm NaCl, 38 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 16.8 mmNH4Cl, 4.1 mm KCl, 1.45 mmK2HPO4, 1.85 mmKH2PO4, 1.5 mmNa2CO3, 0.2% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.2% (w/v) tryptone, 73.4 μm nitrilotriacetic acid, 8.4 μm CoCl2·6H2O, 7.8 μm FeCl3·6H2O, 7.3 μm ZnCl2, 5.1 μmMnCl2·4 H2O, 4.5 μmCaCl2·2H2O, 4.2 μmNiCl2·6H2O, 4.1 μmNa2MoO4·2H2O, 3.1 μm CuSO4, 2 μmNa2SeO4, and 2 μmNa2WO4·2H2O. pH was adjusted to ∼7.0 and maintained by the addition of sterile, anaerobic NaOH solution. Since we anticipated that this purification would not be repeated, no attempt was made to optimize any step. At each step, a portion of the protein was used in pilot chromatographic trials; therefore, it was not meaningful to calculate an overall yield. Purification was monitored by SDS gel electrophoresis on a Pharmacia Phast system using 8–25% gradient gels. Cells (5 g) were suspended in 20 ml of 0.1 m Tris·Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.03 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. Cells were lysed by a single pass through a French press at 15,000 p.s.i., followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded. The protein was loaded onto a 2.6 × 16-cm column of phenyl-Sepharose HR equilibrated in 1 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm Tris·Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0. The column was eluted at 2.5 ml/min with 160 ml of starting buffer followed by a 750-ml gradient to a final buffer lacking ammonium sulfate. Enzyme eluted near 0.5m ammonium sulfate. The fractions containing activity were pooled and dialyzed into buffer A (50 mm Tris·Cl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0). The protein was then fractionated by ion exchange chromatography on a 2.6 × 16-cm column of Q-Sepharose equilibrated with buffer A and eluted at 4 ml/min with 150 ml of buffer A followed by a 650-ml gradient to 1 m KCl in buffer A. Enzyme activity eluted at ∼0.3 m KCl. The fractions containing activity were pooled and dialyzed to equilibrate with buffer A. The protein was further purified by chromatography on a 1.6 × 10-cm column of hydroxylapetite (type CHT-1; Bio-Rad). The column was eluted at 4 ml/min with 50 ml of buffer A followed by a 200-ml gradient of 0–0.1 m potassium phosphate in buffer A. Enzyme eluted at ∼75 mm phosphate. Fractions containing activity were concentrated using Centriprep concentrators (Amicon), and 1-ml aliquots were chromatographed on a 1.6 × 40 cm Superdex-200 gel filtration column that was equilibrated and eluted at 0.5 ml/min with buffer A. The column was calibrated with molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) to allow estimation of the native size of the enzyme. Final purification was obtained by chromatofocusing on a Mono-P column (0.5 × 20 cm). Protein was dialyzed into 25 mmimidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8. The sample was then loaded onto the column, which was equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with 10 ml of equilibration buffer, the column was eluted with a solution of a 1:8 dilution of Polybuffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pH 4.0. Enzyme activity eluted at pH 4.2. The protein showed a single band after silver staining a 8–25% gradient SDS gel and a 8–25% nondenaturing gel. The total protein was estimated as 5 μg using the Coomassie Plus protein reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mass spectrometry was performed in the Fanny Rippel Biotechnology Facility at the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Approximately 1 μg of purified protein was electrophoresed on an 8–25% Phast gel. The Coomassie-stained protein band was excised, reduced, alkylated, and proteolytically cleaved with trypsin. Peptide mass maps comprising the ensemble of tryptic peptides were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Voyager DE, Perseptive Biosystems) (25.Yates III, J.R.

The MJ1208 gene was amplified from M. jannaschii genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction using the primers MJ1208FWD (GCATATGAGAAACATAATTGTAAAAAAATTAG) and MJ1208REV (GGATCCTTAGAATGTAGTTACTTTTCC). The NdeI and BamHI sites introduced into the gene through the primers were used to clone the DNA into the pET19b vector (Novagen Inc.). The recombinant plasmid (pMJ1208-1) was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pMJ1208-1 was grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenecillin to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6. MAT expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was allowed to grow for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris·Cl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.03 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0, at a density of 4 ml of buffer/g of cells. Cells were lysed by a sonication for three 30-s cycles, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 30 min. The pellet was discarded. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 5 mm. The solution was purified by chromatography on a nickel-chelate column (2 × 8 cm; Novagen). The column was eluted at 0.75 ml/min with 50 mm Tris·Cl, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmimidazole followed by a 150-ml gradient of 5–500 mmimidazole. The eluted protein was concentrated using a Centriplus device (Amicon) and chromatographed on a 1.6 × 40-cm Superdex-200 gel filtration column in 50 mm Tris·Cl, 50 mmKCl. The enzyme was exchanged into 50 mmHepes·(CH3)4N+, pH 8.0, before use. Amino acid sequences for archaeal-type MAT proteins were obtained from the nonredundant protein data base at NCBI: M. jannaschii (sp‖Q58605),Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH (sp‖O27429),M. thermoautotrophicum str. Marburg (sp‖P26498),Archaeoglobus fulgidus VC-16 (sp‖O30186),Pyrococcus sp. OT3 (dbj‖BAA30943.1), Pyrococcus abyssi (emb‖CAB49302.1), Aeropyrum pernix(dbj‖BAA80596.1), and Aquifex aeolicus (gi‖2983673). Sequence data from partial genome sequences was obtained from TIGR (available on the World Wide Web) for Chlorobium tepidum, the University of Utah (available on the World Wide Web) for Pyrococcus furiosus, Caltech (available on the World Wide Web) for Pyrobaculum aerophilum, and the University of Oklahoma (available on the World Wide Web) for Streptococcus pyogenes. Sequence data for Methanococcus maripaludisJJ were from unpublished data. 2P. Haney and D. E. Graham, unpublished data. Taxa are identified using Swiss-Prot five-letter tags. Amino acid sequences were aligned using the CLUSTALW (version 1.7.4) program (28.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). From the alignment, 426 positions deemed to be confidently aligned were analyzed by protein maximum parsimony methods using a heuristic search algorithm (PAUP* version 4 beta 2; D. Swofford, Sinauer Associates, Inc). The 500 shortest trees were evaluated by maximum likelihood criteria using the PROTML program (version 2.2) in the MOLPHY package (29.Adachi J. Hasegawa M. Comput. Sci. Monogr. 1996; 28: 1-150Google Scholar) with the JTT model for amino acid substitutions. The TreeCons program (version 1.0) (30.Jermiin L.S. Olsen G.J. Mengersen K.L. Easteal S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 14: 1296-1302Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used to standardize and exponentially weight the trees using maximum likelihood scores and the Kishino-Hasegawa test for significance (p ≤ 0.01). The CONSENSE program (J. Felsenstein, PHYLIP (phylogeny inference package), version 3.5c, Department of Genetics, University of Washington) constructed a consensus tree from the weightings. Purification of AdoMet synthetase from M. jannaschiiyielded a protein that chromatographed as an 86-kDa species on gel filtration and gave a single band upon SDS gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa. Thus, the native protein appears to be a dimer. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 0.26 μmol of AdoMet formed/min/mg of protein at 58 °C. A portion of the protein was eluted from a SDS gel and digested with trypsin, and the resultant peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The masses of the peptides were compared with those predicted from the entireM. jannaschii genome. All of the masses were found in the open reading frame containing the MJ1208 gene (TableI). MJ1208 encodes a 406-amino acid protein of 45,252 daltons; we designate this gene as MAT. The peptides identified covered 65% of the protein (264 residues) ranging from residue 3 to 397.Table IMasses of tryptic peptides of M. jannaschii AdoMet synthetasem/z submittedMH+matchedStartEndPeptide sequence713.97714.9338NIIVKK2053.052053.33824KLDVEPIEERPTEIVER2053.052053.33925LDVEPIEERPTEIVERK1999.041999.222543KGLGHPDSICDGIAESVSR1870.711871.042643GLGHPDSICDGIAESVSR2434.482434.735374FGTILHHNTDQVELVGGHAYPK1766.641767.157591FGGGVMVSPIYILLSGR515.28515.68123126KVLR1561.211561.76127139NVDVDKDVIIDCR1566.091566.78140153IGQGSMDLVDVFER2695.962695.95154178QKNEVPLANDTSFGVGAPLST2132.182132.38186204FLNSDELKNEIPAVGEDIK592.19591.75205209VMGLRaThe methionines in these peptides were present as methionine sulfoxide.1448.021447.78213225KITLTIAMAVVDRaThe methionines in these peptides were present as methionine sulfoxide.1394.111394.57229239NIEEYKEVIEK2224.332224.35251269IADGYEVEIHINTADDYER2352.632352.53250269KIADGYEVEIHINTADDYER2023.062023.39295313VNGLITPFRPMSMEAASGKaThe methionines in these peptides were present as methionine sulfoxide.865.08864.98314321NPVNHVGK1659.91659.97322336IYNILANLIANDIAK1437.731437.73347359ILSQIGKPINEPK2321.472321.59360379ALDIEIITEDSYDIKDIEPKa The methionines in these peptides were present as methionine sulfoxide. Open table in a new tab The MJ1208 gene was cloned into an E. coli expression system with an N-terminal decahistidine tag and an inducible T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The recombinant enzyme was then purified using nickel-chelate chromatography and gel filtration. The enzyme is quite thermally stable, losing no activity during incubation for 30 min at 85 °C, conditions under which the E. coli MAT has a half-life of less than 1 min (31.Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18484-18490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity continued to increase at least 90 °C. Functional properties of MAT were assessed at 70 °C. No activity was detectable in the absence of Mg2+, and maximal activity was observed at 10 mm MgCl2 when ATP was present at 5 mm, indicating that MgATP is probably the true substrate and suggesting involvement of additional Mg2+ beyond the Mg2+·ATP complex as is the case for the E. coli and human isozymes (14.Kotb M. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3923-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). MAT activity was stimulated 10-fold by the addition of KCl to a reaction mix to which only large organic amines (Tris+, (CH3)4N+) had been added as monovalent counterions. Half-maximal activation was observed at 25 mm KCl, which is ∼10-fold larger than observed with theE. coli and eukaryotic enzymes (9.Mudd S.H. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, Inc., New York1973: 121-154Google Scholar, 12.Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApparentK m values of 0.25 and 0.14 mm were found for ATP and methionine, respectively. TableII compares steady state kinetic properties of the archaeal enzyme with reported values for bacterial and eukaryal MAT. There are no dramatic functional differences between the archaeal and bacterial enzymes, whereas the eukaryal enzymes have significantly different properties. The two yeast isozymes show cooperative kinetic behavior for both ATP and methionine. The mammalian enzymes have substantially different apparent K mvalues for methionine that vary with isozyme, and the rat liver isozyme also has a much lower V max. Remarkably, the active site residues are all conserved in the functionally distinct bacterial- and eukaryal-type enzymes.Table IIComparative kinetic properties of MAT from different organismsOrganismV maxK m(ATP)K m (methionine)μmol/min/mgmmmmM. jannaschii a70 °C, this work.3.00.250.14E. coli b25 °C, Ref. 12.1.20.110.08S. cerevisiaec37 °C, Ref. 11.

Open table in a new tab All characterized MATs from eukarya and bacteria catalyze a two-step reaction in which reaction of ATP and methionine initially yields the AdoMet and tripolyphosphate (PPPi); the PPPiremains enzyme-bound and is cleaved to pyrophosphate and orthophosphate before product release (9.Mudd S.H. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, Inc., New York1973: 121-154Google Scholar, 10.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Adv. Enzymol. 1984; 56: 251-282PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorous-containing products of the MAT reaction catalyzed by recombinant M. jannaschii MAT were also Pi and PPi, since Pi was produced from ATP in the presence of methionine, and the rate of Pi production tripled in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphatase. M. jannaschii MAT hydrolyzed added PPPi to Pi and PPi. The hydrolytic rate was stimulated by 1.8-fold by AdoMet with half-maximal activation at 19 μm. In the presence of saturating AdoMet, theK m for PPPi was 4.5 μm, and the maximal rate of Pi production was 1.4-fold greater than the maximal rate observed in the MAT reaction. No hydrolysis of 0.1 mm PPi was observed (<5% of the rate of PPPi), differentiating the enzyme from pyrophosphatase. In these properties, this protein is remarkably analogous to the eukaryal and bacterial enzymes. The largest functional difference lies in the ∼10-fold higher concentration of KCl required for activation, commensurate with higher intracellular K+ levels expected for the marine microorganism, M. jannaschii. Data base searches revealed the presence of this highly diverged M. jannaschii form of MAT in all completed archaeal genome sequences, three phylogenetically diverse bacterial genomes and no eukaryal genomes. This observation raises questions about its evolutionary history and origin. A phylogenetic reconstruction of this history (Fig. 1) is congruent with the archaeal small subunit ribosomal RNA phylogeny (33.Maidak B.L. Cole J.R. Parker Jr., C.T. Garrity G.M. Larsen N. Li B. Lilburn T.G. McCaughey M.J. Olsen G.J. Overbeek R. Pramanik S. Schmidt T.M. Tiedje J.M. Woese C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and clearly separates the archaeal sequences from the three bacterial sequences. These results suggest that the archaeal-type MAT was present in the archaeal common ancestor and was vertically inherited throughout the lineage. In contrast, the three bacterial members of the archaeal-type MAT family, found in A. aeolicus, C. tepidum, andS. pyogenes, were probably introduced to their respective genomes by lateral transfer. Curiously, the bacterial members share a unique common ancestor, implicating a single transfer event from the archaeal lineage. All three bacteria also contain bacterial-type MAT genes; this duplicity implies that the archaeal-type MAT genes were recruited for a novel function or for differential regulation of MAT activity, as observed in the S. cerevisiae, human, and plant MAT isozymes (34.Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 35.Schroder G. Eichel J. Breinig S. Schroder J. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36.Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Because we cannot confidently root this tree using the bacterial-type MAT sequences, the origin of these transferred proteins remains uncertain. The extreme sequence divergence of the archaeal-type MAT proteins from the bacterial/eukaryal-type MAT proteins cannot be entirely due to requirements for thermal stability. The bacterial-type MAT protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium A. aeolicus (95 °C optimum growth temperature) is 50% identical to that of the mesophilicE. coli (37 °C). Furthermore the sequence of the archaeal-type MAT protein from the hyperthermophilic M. jannaschii (87 °C) is 72% identical to that of the mesophilic archaeon M. maripaludis (37 °C). An alignment of theM. jannaschii MAT sequence on the E. coli structure was facilitated by the present of short sequences in which active site residues were conserved at similar spacing in the two sequences (Fig. 2). In this alignment all of the insertions and deletions in the M. jannaschiiprotein fall between elements of regular secondary structure in theE. coli protein and are in surface loop regions. Relative to the E. coli MAT, this protein lacks one surface helix at its carboxyl terminus but has an amino-terminal extension; the latter is also present in numerous eukaryal MAT isozymes. All known MATs are homodimers or tetramers. This association is important for catalytic activity, since the E. coli MAT crystal structure shows both subunits of the dimer contributing functional groups to the interfacial active site (20.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Misaki S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 136-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on the alignment of the E. coli MAT sequence with all known archaeal-type MAT sequences, we observe that predicted active site residues are disproportionately conserved. Polar amino acids within 3 Å of the ligands observed in the crystal structure of theE. coli MAT (crystallized with ADP and PO4) are categorically conserved, suggesting that the two different classes of MAT share a common mechanism. A constellation of amino acids contacting Mg2+ and polyphosphate is evolutionarily conserved in the archaeal-type MAT sequences: His-14*, Asp-16*, Lys-165*, Arg-244* and Lys-265 (position numbers refer to the E. coli amino acid sequence and an asterisk indicates amino acids contributed by the second subunit of the homodimeric protein). Two other essential residues in the active site, phosphate-binding Lys-245* and Mg2+-binding Asp-271, are both replaced by Gly. These replacements are particularly surprising because Lys-245 → Met and Asp-271 → Ala mutations in the E. coli MAT reduce activity by nearly 105- and 103-fold, respectively (37.Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32909-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in a linear sequence alignment there are no nearby residues that can replace the missing functional groups, suggesting that the surrogate residues arise from elsewhere in the linear sequence but are brought into the active site in the three-dimensional structure. In contrast, amino acids responsible for binding the adenine moiety of the substrate and product are less stringently conserved. In the crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme, the side chain amide of Gln-98 hydrogen-bonds to the exocyclic N-6 amine of ATP. Thus, the replacement of Gln-98 with a hydrophobic amino acid (Leu) may explain why ITP is a substrate for the M. jannaschii enzyme (K m = 1.4 mm,V max = 2% of ATP) but neither a substrate nor inhibitor of the E. coli enzyme. Similarly, Lys-269 may recognize the N-3 atom of ATP; Lys-269 → Met mutations in theE. coli MAT reduce enzyme activity by 103-fold. The replacement of Lys-269 with His in the archaeal-type MAT, however, may be a conservative substitution, with no detrimental effect on activity. Least conserved are the residues responsible for K+ activation and dimerization of the E. coliMAT. The carboxylate of Glu-42, which is required for K+activation of the E. coli enzyme (38.McQueney M.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), is replaced by more hydrophobic residues (Leu or Met), and Ser-263 is sometimes replaced by Ala. The predicted hydrogen bond between Ser-80 and Ser-80* would be also lost. These changes in interfacial amino acids suggest that the interactions between M. jannaschii subunits may differ from those of the E. coli subunits. Of the additional 68 residues that are conserved in the sequence alignment, 13 (17%) are surface residues in the E. colistructure, and the rest appear to be randomly distributed throughout the protein, suggesting that the majority of the matches may be coincidental. This analysis begs the possibility that the protein fold of the archaeal-type MAT is different from the bacterial enzyme; however, the apparent constraints of active site residues distributed through more than 250 residues in the linear sequence makes the possibility of a common topology seem plausible. This study has identified the methionine adenosyltransferase gene from the hyperthermophilic archaeon M. jannaschii. This sequence has close homologs in the other archaea for which genome sequences have been reported. In contrast, the sequence is highly diverged from the majority of the bacterial and eukaryal MAT proteins, which are similar to each other. We anticipate that this archaeal class of MAT proteins will bolster future work in elucidating the complete mechanism of MAT catalysis. The identification of the sequence of M. jannaschii MAT has also led to the finding that several bacteria, including the pathogenic organismS. pyogenes, contain both bacterial- and archaeal-type MAT genes. The existence of two diverged classes, bacterial/eukaryal and archaeal versions, of a critical metabolic enzyme is reminiscent of previous observations for thymidylate synthase and dihydropteroate synthase (39.Xu H. Aurora R. Rose G.D. White R.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In aggregate, these differences emphasize the profound evolutionary events that accompanied the formation of modern archaeal metabolism. The apparent conservation of active site amino acids between these two diverse classes of MAT focuses our attention on functionally important residues that could not have been identified from alignments of bacterial and eukaryal forms due to the high level of overall sequence identity among those enzymes. Determination of the three dimensional structure of the archaeal enzyme will be of substantial interest."
https://openalex.org/W2061132576,"In the duodenum, pancreatic lipase (PL) develops its activity on triglycerides by binding to the bile-emulsified oil droplets in the presence of its protein cofactor pancreatic colipase (PC). The neutron crystal structure of a PC-PL-micelle complex (Hermoso, J., Pignol, D., Penel, S., Roth, M., Chapus, C., and Fontecilla-Camps, J. C. (1997) EMBO J. 16, 5531–5536) has suggested that the stabilization of the enzyme in its active conformation and its adsorption to the emulsified oil droplets are mediated by a preformed lipase-colipase-micelle complex. Here, we correlate the ability of different amphypathic compounds to activate PL, with their association with PC-PL in solution. The method of small angle neutron scattering with D2O/H2O contrast variation was used to characterize a solution containing PC-PL complex and taurodeoxycholate micelles. The resulting radius of gyration (56 Å) and the match point of the solution indicate the formation of a ternary complex that is similar to the one observed in the neutron crystal structure. In addition, we show that either bile salts, lysophospholipids, or nonionic detergents that form micelles with radii of gyration ranging from 13 to 26 Å are able to bind to the PC-PL complex, whereas smaller micelles or nonmicellar compounds are not.

PL comes into contact with pure triglycerides only during in vitroexperiments. Under these conditions, the enzyme can be completely but reversibly inactivated by bile salts normally found in the duodenum (1.Borgström B. Erlanson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In vivo, the lipase activity on bile salt-emulsified interfaces is possible thanks to the presence of colipase (PC), a 10-kDa nonenzymatic protein found in the pancreatic juice (2.Chapus C. Sari H.

The system lipase-colipase-bile-substrate involves several important interactions, the nature of which are not completely understood.There is significant structural information concerning the protein components of this system. The x-ray structures of the uncomplexed human (4.Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) and horse (5.Bourne Y. Martinez C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 709-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) pancreatic lipases revealed that the enzyme is divided into two domains. The N-terminal domain contains the active site covered by an amphiphilic flap that prevents the access of the substrate. This observation provides an explanation for the low activity of PL on monomeric substrates. The catalytic triad (Ser153-His264-Asp177) is similar to that found in other serine hydrolases. The noncatalytic C-terminal domain is responsible for colipase binding, as shown by the human lipase-porcine colipase structure (6.van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This structure showed that colipase is a flattened molecule that consists of a three-finger-shaped region held together by five disulfide bridges (7.Egloff M.P. Maiguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2571-2762Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The human-porcine complex that was crystallized in the presence of mixed bile salt phospholipid micelles revealed that the flap could move away from the position it occupies in the uncomplexed PL (8.van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The motion of the flap makes the active site accessible to the substrate and unmasks a large hydrophobic region on the surface of the enzyme. This region is thought to be responsible for the binding of the enzyme to the oil droplet-water interface. The structure of the homospecific porcine lipase-colipase complex (9.Hermoso J. Pignol D.

Under these conditions, the enzyme also displays an open active site conformation. The activation of the enzyme was attributed, in this case, to the combined effect of pure detergent micelles and colipase in the crystallization medium. This was confirmed by PL inhibition in solution with the serine specific inhibitor diethylp-nitrophenylphosphate (E600) (9.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C.

Biol. 1980; 139: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have been reported. These results suggest that PC does not bind a significant amount of bile salt monomers but interacts specifically with a preformed micelle. More recently, the neutron diffraction low resolution structure of a ternary lipase-colipase-micelle complex confirmed those results and showed for the first time the structural organization of the three partners of the system (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this activated complex, the disc-shaped micelle interacts with both PC and the distal tip of the C-terminal domain of PL. It indirectly helps to stabilize the PL open flap configuration. The opening of the flap requires the presence of both PC and micelles and is a reversible phenomenon because upon removal of micelles, PL adopts an inactive closed conformation (9.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18007-18016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it was proposed that in vivo, PL adsorption to the emulsified oil droplets is mediated by a preformed PC-PL-mixed micelle complex (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).The aim of the work presented here was to better characterize the formation of the lipase-colipase-micelle ternary complex in solution and to establish its dependence as a function of the size of the micelles. We carried out a series of small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on the PC-PL-bile salt system coupled to PL inhibition by E600 to investigate the ability of different lipids to activate the enzyme (E600 inhibition requires an exposed active site and thus is indicative of the opening of the flap). In addition, because the SANS method coupled to contrast variation is very well adapted to obtaining structural information on systems composed of two components of different scattering density (such as lipid-protein associations (21.Jacrot B. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1976; 39: 911-953Crossref Scopus (630) Google Scholar)), we characterized the formation of a PC-PL-taurodeoxycholate micelle complex in solution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESE600 InhibitionPL and PC were purified from a delipidated acetonic pancreatic powder. PL was purified according to the method of Lombardo et al. (22.Lombardo D. Chapus C. Bourne Y. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 259-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PC was purified according to Chapus et al.(23.Chapus C. Desnuelle P. Foglizzo E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).The inhibition experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl. PL, in the presence of PC and different types of surfactants (bile salts, nonionic detergents, and phospholipids) was treated with 2 mm E600. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn from the mixture at various time intervals. The remaining lipase activity was titrimetrically determined at pH 7.5 and 25 °C using 0.11m emulsified triacylbutyrylglycerol (tributyrin) in 1 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. Control experiments in which PC was omitted were also performed in order to check PL stability.SANS ExperimentsSANS on Different Types of MicellesBile salts (sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC), sodium taurocholate (NaTC)), phospholipids (lecithin and lysolecithin), and nonionic detergent samples (N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide, β-octylglucomaltoside, tetra-ethylene glycolmonooctyl-ether (C8E4)) were prepared from commercial powders in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0 (100% H2O solvent), at submicellar concentrations (between 2 and 10 mg/ml), without further purification.SANS data were collected on the D11 instrument (24.Ibel J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1976; 9: 296-309Crossref Google Scholar) at the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). The two-dimensional multidetector was placed at a distance of 2.5 m from the sample. Incident neutrons of wavelength λ = 10 Å were used. Samples were contained in quartz cuvettes with a path length of 2 mm thermostatted at 20 °C. A buffer solution was used as the blank in the neutron scattering experiments.SANS on Lipase/Colipase in the Presence and Absence of Bile Salt MicellesSample PreparationPL and PC solutions were freshly prepared from the purified freeze-dried proteins in 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.0, containing either 0, 28, 68, or 100% D2O. The protein concentrations were measured by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm (E%= 13.3 and 4 for PL and PC, respectively) and the monodispersity of the solutions was initially checked using dynamic light scattering. Solutions were mixed to obtain a 1:1 molar ratio corresponding to 3 mg/ml (∼5 × 10−5m) lipase-colipase complex. Under such conditions, all lipase and colipase molecules should be involved in a complex (K D = 10−7m). These solutions are called PC/PL below. A buffer solution was used as the blank in the scattering experiments.Aliquots of the different PC/PL solutions were extensively dialyzed for 24 h against solutions containing 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaTDC at either 0, 28, 68, or 100% D2O (M solutions). The resulting solutions are called PC/PL/M. M solutions were used as the blanks in the analysis of the PC/PL/M scattering experiments. The same procedure was used to prepare M and PC/PL/M solutions in 100% D2O with 15 mmNaTC instead of NaTDC.SANS MeasurementsSANS data were collected using the D22 beam-line at the high flux neutron reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin. The two-dimensional multidetector was placed at a distance of either 3 or 1.5 m from the sample. The wavelength was 10 Å. Samples were deposited in quartz cuvettes of either 2 or 1 mm path length, depending on the D2O content of the sample, and thermostated at 20 °C. The D2O content of samples and buffer were verified by neutron transmission measurements. Neutron scattering data were collected for about 20 min to obtain statistically significant spectra for samples in H2O, whereas 10 min were sufficient for samples in D2O.SANS Data ProcessingAll spectra were background-substracted and normalized to the incoherent scattering of a 1-mm-thick sample of water using the standard data reduction programs RNILS, XPOLLY, and RPLOT (25.Ghosh R. ILL Internal Report, 81GH29T. ILL Publishers, Grenoble, France1981Google Scholar). The corrected scattering curvesI(Q) versus Q were interpreted via the linear Guinier approximation for a globular particle, as follows, I(Q)=I(0)exp−Rg2Q23Equation 1 where Q = 4π(sin2θ/λ), 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the neutron wavelength. Hence, a plot of ln(I(Q)) versus Q yields two independent parameters: the radius of gyration, Rg, and the extrapolated zero-angle scattering intensity, I(0).In the case of PC/PL and PC/PL/M solutions, the experiments were carried out as a function of contrast. Extrapolated I(0) values as determined by the Guinier plots allowed the determination of the experimental match points from linear plots of (I(0)/c)1/2 versus D2O concentration in the sample. This match point value is defined as the solvent content for which the scattering density of the macromolecule is equal to that of the solvent. The average scattering density of NaTDC was calculated from its chemical composition (19.Charles M. Semeriva M. Chabre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Assuming that all three hydrogens are exchanged, the average densities in H2O and D2O are 0.88 × 1010 and 1.39 × 1010 cm−2, respectively. These values lead to a theoretical match point of 20%. The average scattering density of the lipase-colipase complex was calculated from its amino acid composition and by using the scattering lengths and volumes of the individual amino acids given by Jacrot (21.Jacrot B. Rep. Prog. Phys. 1976; 39: 911-953Crossref Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In H2O, the average density is 1.87 × 1010 cm−2. In D2O, assuming that all the exchangeable hydrogens have been exchanged with D2O, a scattering density of 3.2 × 1010 cm−2 was obtained. This leads to a theoretical match point of 43% for the protein complex.The knowledge of the experimental match point for the protein solution and protein/bile salt solution allows for the determination of the mass fraction, X, of bile salts in the complex using the expression, X=(ρP−ρS)νP(ρP−ρS)νP−(ρD−ρS)νDEquation 2 where νP represents the partial specific volume of the protein, νD the partial specific volume of the detergent, ρP the scattering length density of the protein at the experimental match point of the complex, ρD the scattering length density of the detergent at the experimental match point of the complex, and ρS the scattering length density of the solvent (26.Timmins P. Pebay-Peyroula E. Welte W. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 53: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The SANS results (the radius of gyration and the bile salt mass fraction in the complexes) were modeled using different molecular structures. The x-ray structure of the lipase-colipase complex (9.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Kerfelec B. Crenon I. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18007-18016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was used in the case of the PC/PL solution spectrum and the low resolution neutron diffraction PL-PC-C8E4 structure (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used in the case of the PC/PL/M solution. In addition, different lipase/colipase/micelle associations were built using the graphic program O (27.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONPancreatic lipase, colipase, and bile salts act synergistically in the lipid hydrolytic reactions of the upper small intestine. Besides the well documented interaction between lipase and its protein cofactor (7.Egloff M.P. Maiguet F. Buono G. Verger R. Cambillau C. van Tilbeurgh H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2571-2762Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar), little structural information on their interactions with bile salts is available. The relevance of a preformed association between lipase, colipase, and a micelle during lipolysis has been highlighted by the resolution of the neutron crystal structure of a lipase-colipase-nonionic detergent micelle complex (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This study has led to a model of the activation process that involves the unmasking of the active site of the enzyme in the aqueous phase through the binding of the micelle to the protein complex (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here, we have further studied the formation of the protein-micelle ternary complex by a series of experiments carried out in solution with natural surfactants. PL inhibition by the serine hydrolax-specific inhibitor E600 has been combined with small angle neutron scattering studies on pure micelle, protein, and protein micelle solutions.In the absence of any water-lipid interface, we demonstrated the ability of a series of amphiphilic compounds (NaTDC, long chain fatty acid, nonionic detergents, and egg lysolecithins) to activate PL, although at slightly different rates. These compounds possess different chemical structures but form micelles in solution with radii of gyration that vary from 13 to 27 Å. The direct involvement of a micelle in PL activation through its binding to the protein complex in solution was shown by SANS experiments with D2O/H2O contrast variation performed on PL-PC solutions and PL-PC-NaTDC solutions. In the presence of micelles, the radius of gyration of the observed complex and the match point of the solution are 56 Å and 38.6% D2O, respectively. Those values are very close to the one calculated for a model built with a stoichiometry of 2 lipase/colipase molecules per micelle, which corresponds to the one observed in the neutron low resolution crystal structure (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, this stoichiometry is likely to result from the very high concentration of PL and PC used in these experiments.In vivo, a stoichiometry of 1 lipase/colipase molecule per micelle is expected, based on the physiological concentrations of the proteins.The requirement of micellar structures for the opening of the PL flap is further illustrated by the results obtained with lecithins. Indeed, pure lecithins, which do not form micelles but rather liquid crystalline bilayers in solution, are unable to stabilize the enzyme active conformation, as shown by inhibition experiments. However, the PL inhibition by E600 is restored when NaTDC is added to lecithin solutions. Addition of bile salts to lecithin solutions has been shown to yield a spontaneous vesicle-to-micelle transition, leading to the coexistence of vesicles and worm-like micelles (30.Pedersen J.S. Egelhaaf S. Schurtenberger P. J. Phys. Chem. 1995; 99: 1299-1305Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The vesicle-to-micelle transition is also likely to occur when lecithin solutions are mixed with other micelle-forming compounds, such as long chain fatty acids or lysolecithins, because incubation of PC-PL with those mixtures leads to the opening of the flap. However, increasing the lecithin concentration beyond a critical value in these mixtures induced the reverse transition (micelles to vesicular structures), abolishing the PL activation process.PL activation by a micelle size-dependent process is further supported by the results obtained in the case of NaTC solutions. NaTC is poorly efficient in lipase activation (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although closely related to NaTDC, NaTC forms smaller aggregates (radius of 8 Å for NaTC, compared to 13 Å for NaTDC). SANS experiments performed on PC-PL NaTC solutions suggest that NaTC micelles are probably too small to maintain PL in its open activated conformation by forming a stable ternary complex.As a result, the differences observed in the capability of the micelles to activate PL are related to their size (lower limit close to 13 Å) or form and to their chemical nature. It must be pointed out that mixed micelles are more efficient than pure micelles. This can be correlated with the observation that, in vivo, mainly mixed micelles enriched in lecithins are present in the duodenum.Taken together, these results reinforce the hypothesis of a micellar activation of PL in the intestine (20.Hermoso J. Pignol D. Penel S. Roth M. Chapus C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5531-5536Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In vitro, in the absence of bile salt, PL can readily bind the triglyceride water interface and fully display its activity. In vivo, the physiological triglyceride vesicles covered by dietary and biliary phospholipids, cholesterol, and bile salts are at equilibrium with smaller mixed aggregates of micellar size in the aqueous phase (32.Hofmann A. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1967; 18: 333-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that those physiological mixed micelles have the suitable size to form a ternary complex with PC-PL in which the enzyme is maintained, in the aqueous phase, in its active conformation. This preformed complex behaves as an entity that determines lipase adsorption to the emulsified substrate. Pancreatic lipase (PL)1hydrolyzes triglycerides at the oil-water interface. PL comes into contact with pure triglycerides only during in vitroexperiments. Under these conditions, the enzyme can be completely but reversibly inactivated by bile salts normally found in the duodenum (1.Borgström B. Erlanson C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In vivo, the lipase activity on bile salt-emulsified interfaces is possible thanks to the presence of colipase (PC), a 10-kDa nonenzymatic protein found in the pancreatic juice (2.Chapus C. Sari H. Semeriva M. Desnuelle P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3.Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Rathe S. Christophe J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 49: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The system lipase-colipase-bile-substrate involves several important interactions, the nature of which are not completely understood. There is significant structural information concerning the protein components of this system. The x-ray structures of the uncomplexed human (4.Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) and horse (5.Bourne Y. Martinez C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 709-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) pancreatic lipases revealed that the enzyme is divided into two domains. The N-terminal domain contains the active site covered by an amphiphilic flap that prevents the access of the substrate. This observation provides an explanation for the low activity of PL on monomeric substrates. The catalytic triad (Ser153-His264-Asp177) is similar to that found in other serine hydrolases. The noncatalytic C-terminal domain is responsible for colipase binding, as shown by the human lipase-porcine colipase structure (6.van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C.

However, the two proteins differ in the requirement for initiating joint molecules and in the polarity of branch migration. Whereas RecA initiates joint molecules from any type of ends on the dsDNA and branch migration proceeds exclusively in the 5′- to 3′-direction with respect to the single strand DNA substrate, initiation mediated by Rad51 requires a complementary 3′ or 5′ overhanging end of the linear dsDNA and branch migration proceeds in either direction. Here we report that the rates of Rad51-mediated branch migration in either the 5′- to 3′- or 3′- to 5′-directions are affected to the same extent by temperature and MgCl2. Furthermore, branch migration in both directions is equally impeded by insertions of non-homologous sequences in the dsDNA, inserts of 6 base pairs or more being completely inhibitory. We have also found that the preference of strand exchange in the 5′- to 3′-direction does not change if RPA is replaced by Escherichia coli SSB or T4 gene 32 proteins, suggesting that the preference for the direction of strand exchange is intrinsic to Rad51. Based on these results, we conclude that Rad51-promoted branch migration in either direction occurs fundamentally by the same mechanism, quite probably by stabilizing successively formed heteroduplex base pair.

Furthermore, both proteins catalyze joint molecule formation and complete strand exchange between circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA in the presence of ATP (6.Sung P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Rad51-mediated strand exchange can be divided into three distinct phases. First, Rad51 binds to ssDNA with a stoichiometry of one monomer per three nucleotides. Unlike RecA, however, binding of Rad51 to DNA requires ATP, and neither ATPγS nor AMP-PNP (nonhydrolyzable analogues) can substitute (9.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6177-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ATP stabilizes Rad51 and promotes a structural alteration that is necessary for efficient binding of Rad51 to DNA (10.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11932-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the second phase, homologous sequences in the ssDNA and the dsDNA are paired and, as a result, a new duplex DNA (hereafter referred to as the heteroduplex DNA) is formed by a switch of complementary strands between the two DNA substrates. However, unlike RecA, Rad51 requires an overhanging complementary 3′ or 5′ end on the dsDNA to initiate the strand exchange (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the third and final phase of the reaction, the relatively short region of heteroduplex DNA is extended by branch migration until complete exchange occurs. In the RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange, the ensuing branch migration requires ATP hydrolysis and is unidirectional in the 5′- to 3′- direction with respect to the ssDNA (11.Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12.West S.C. Cassuto E. Howard-Flanders P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By contrast, branch migration in the Rad51-promoted strand exchange proceeds in either direction depending on whether a 5′ or 3′ end initiates the joint molecule; strand exchange is about 3–5-fold faster in the 5′- to 3′-direction than in the opposite direction (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we address the issue of the mechanism of Rad51-promoted branch migration and aim to understand the molecular mechanism, which could account for the difference in rate in the two directions. One way to reconcile the difference in the rate of branch migrations in the 5′- to 3′- and 3′- to 5′-directions is to propose that they are driven by two different mechanisms. For example, Rad51 could use a “RecA-like” mechanism to drive branch migration in the 5′- to 3′-direction and a “RecA-unlike” process in the 3′- to 5′-direction. We presumed that the two processes might be affected differently in response to different conditions or insertions of non-homologous stretches in the dsDNA substrate. Accordingly, we measured the rates of branch migration in the two directions at different temperatures, with different levels of Mg2+, with insertions of 2–16 bp of heterologous DNA near the middle of the dsDNA, and with different single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. Our results show that the rate of branch migration in either the 5′- to 3′- or 3′- to 5′-directions is affected identically over the temperature range 25–37 °C and with 2.5–24 mm MgCl2. Furthermore, branch migration in both directions is equally impeded by insertions of non-homologous sequences in the dsDNA, inserts of 6 bp or more being completely inhibitory. These results indicate that Rad51-promoted branch migration is fundamentally the same in either direction. Moreover, the preference of strand exchange in the 5′- to 3′-direction is unchanged ifEscherichia coli SSB or T4 gene 32 proteins replace RPA in the strand exchange reaction, suggesting that the difference in the rate of strand exchange in the two directions is intrinsic to Rad51. Yeast Rad51 was expressed in insect cells and purified as described previously (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Yeast replication protein A (RPA) was expressed in E. coli using the pJM126 plasmid (15.He Z. Wong J.M.S. Maniar H.S. Brill S.J. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28243-28249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and purified as described (16.Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). E. coli ssDNA-binding protein SSB and T4 gene 32 protein were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The concentrations of Rad51 and RPA were determined using extinction coefficients of 1.26 × 104 and 8.8 × 104 at 280 nm, respectively. The concentration of the DNA substrates is expressed as nucleotide equivalents. Circular (+) strand ssDNA, 32P-labeled (+) strand pBluescriptSK(+) ssDNA, and pBluescriptSK(+) dsDNA (Stratagene) and its derivatives were prepared as described (14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmids with short heterologous insertions were prepared by inserting of 2 bp (GA), 4 bp (CATG), 5 bp (GATGGA), 6 bp (CATGGA), 10 bp (TGAGCCATGG), or 16 bp (TGAGATCCCATGGACG) into the BspHI site (2881 position) of the pBluescriptSK (+) plasmid. Linear pBluescriptSK(+) dsDNA and its derivatives with different types of termini were prepared by cleavage with appropriate restriction endonucleases; linear dsDNA with 3′ overhanging termini were made with ApaI or PstI endonucleases; linear dsDNA with 5′ overhanging termini were generated with EcoRI or BamHI endonucleases. Strand exchange was measured using the modified agarose gel assay described previously (14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the standard reaction, 32P-labeled circular (+) strand pBluescriptSK(+) ssDNA (20 μm) was preincubated with Rad51 (5.3 μm) in buffer containing K-Mes, pH 6.5 (40 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), glycerol (5%), MgCl2 (2 mm) and ATP (0.5 mm) for 7 min at 37 °C. RPA (1 μm) was then added; 7 min later, linear dsDNA (77 μm), MgCl2 (12 mm), and ATP (3 mm) were added, and the reaction was incubated at 25, 30, or 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS (to 0.5%) and proteinase K (to 0.8 mg/ml), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The concentrations given are final. The products of the reaction were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer containing 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, visualized by autoradiography, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To determine the effect of Mg2+ on branch migration, strand exchange was initiated under standard conditions at 30 °C for 40 min, and then the reaction mixture was diluted with strand exchange buffer containing different concentrations of MgCl2, and incubation was continued for additional time. ATP hydrolysis was measured as described previously (9.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6177-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The effect of Mg2+ on ATPase activity of Rad51 bound to ssDNA or dsDNA was determined as follows. After preincubation of Rad51 (5.3 and 8 μm) with ssDNA (20 μm) or dsDNA (77 μm), respectively, under strand exchange conditions, the reaction mixture was diluted 4 times with the same buffer containing 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH, and different concentrations of MgCl2. Oxidation of NADH, which measures ADP formation, was followed at 30 °C. The effect of temperature on ATP hydrolysis was determined as described above, except that the reaction was diluted with the buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2, and incubation were carried at 25, 30, or 37 °C. Rad51 promotes DNA strand exchange between 32P-labeled circular (+) pBluescriptSK(+) ssDNA and linear pBluescriptSK(+) dsDNA with either a 3′ or 5′ overhanging complementary end. The reaction consists of two distinct steps: rapid formation of joint molecules and a slow lengthening of the heteroduplex DNA by branch migration (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as have others (5.Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 6.Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 7.Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), that the initial DNA pairing is Rad51-dependent. Fig. 1 shows that the subsequent (slow) branch migration is also dependent on functional Rad51. Removal of Rad51 from the joint molecules by the addition of SDS and proteinase K at 30 min after the initiation of strand exchange halts the accumulation of the fully exchanged product, nicked circular dsDNA, over the next 4 h. Once formed, however, joint molecules are not disrupted by removal of Rad51 from the complex. We conclude that branch migration following joint molecule formation requires Rad51. Although yeast Rad51 and E. coliRecA are structurally and functionally similar, they differ in their mode of branch migration. During strand exchange, RecA promotes branch migration exclusively in the 5′- to 3′-direction with respect to the ssDNA substrate (11.Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12.West S.C. Cassuto E. Howard-Flanders P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6149-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), while Rad51 promotes branch migration in either the 5′- to 3′- or 3′- to 5′- direction depending on which end of the complementary strand initiates the joint molecule (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the formation of joint molecules is equally efficient irrespective of which type of end initiates the strand exchange, the ensuing branch migration is more rapid in the 5′- to 3′-direction with respect to the ssDNA (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One way to reconcile the difference in the rates of branch migration in opposite directions is to suppose that they are driven by two different mechanisms. A “RecA-like” mechanism drives branch migration in the 5′- to 3′-direction, and a “RecA-unlike” process is responsible for branch migration in the opposite direction. Consequently, we tested for whether the two processes could be affected differentially. First, we compared the rate of strand exchange reaction between circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA with either a 3′ or 5′ overhanging complementary end at different temperatures. After preincubation of Rad51, RPA, and ssDNA for 10 min at 37 °C and following the addition of dsDNA, incubations were carried out at 25, 30, or 37 °C, and the amount of joint molecules and fully exchanged product were measured (14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 (A andB) shows that the overall reaction has two phases: rapid formation of joint molecules and slow accumulation of the fully exchanged product. After a 40-min incubation at 30 or 37 °C, about 60–70% of the circular ssDNA is converted to joint molecules, irrespective of whether the linear dsDNA had 3′ or 5′ overhanging ends. Joint molecule formation is somewhat slower at 25 °C; however, the reaction reaches about the same level after 80 min of incubation. By contrast, branch migration to form the fully exchanged product is notably more affected by temperature (Fig. 2, A andB). Although the accumulation of fully exchanged product is more than 4 times greater when the strand exchange is initiated by a 3′ overhanging end compared with a 5′ overhanging end, the effect of temperature on the rate of branch migration is about the same: a 2.2 times decrease of the amount of nicked circular dsDNA between 37 and 30 °C and 2.4 times between 30 and 25 °C (Fig. 2 C). Note, however, that strand exchange initiated by a 3′ overhanging end is about 4.5 times greater than when initiated by a 5′ overhanging end (Fig. 2 C). Thus, temperature affects the rate of strand exchange to the same extent irrespective of whether branch migration proceeds in the 5′- to 3′- or 3′- to 5′-direction with respect to the ssDNA. RecA has the remarkable ability to bypass insertions of up to 180 bp of heterologous sequence in the dsDNA substrate during strand exchange. This activity is completely dependent on ATP hydrolysis (17.Rosselli W. Stasiak A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18.Kim J.I. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16438-16443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.MacFarland K.J. Shan Q. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17675-17685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By contrast, short heterologous insertions into the dsDNA substrate (Fig.3 A) impede the completion of the Rad51-promoted strand exchange (Fig. 3 B). The amount of fully exchanged product decreases irrespective of the direction of branch migration as the length of the heterologous insertion increases; no fully exchanged product is formed at 30 °C when the length of the insertion is greater than 6 bp (Fig. 3 B). To determine if Rad51's ability to promote branch migration through the heterologous insertion is influenced by temperature, the rates of accumulation of fully exchanged product were measured at 25, 30, and 37 °C. Under these circumstances, as well, branch migration in either direction is increasingly inhibited as the size of the non-homologous insertion increases. Although the absolute values of the rates of branch migration in the two directions are different, the extent of the inhibition is similar at 25–37 °C (Fig.3 C). The significance of the small effect of the insertion on branch migration initiated at the 3′ overhanging end compared with the 5′ overhanging end, although consistent, is unclear. To separate the effect of temperature on the rate of branch migration from the effect of temperature on bypassing the heterology alone, the results of strand exchange with linear dsDNA having heterologous insertions at 25 and 37 °C were normalized to the results obtained at 30 °C. Fig. 3 D shows that incubation at 37o or 25 °C not only changes the rate of branch migration but also affects the ability of Rad51 to bypass the heterologous insertions. The ability to bypass 2-bp heterologous insertion is unaffected by temperature, but higher temperature increases the efficiency of bypassing the longer heterologous insertions, while the lower temperature decreases the capacity to bypass the insertions. Interestingly, the rate of branch migration increases about 5-fold between 25 and 37 °C, but the efficiency of bypassing the 5-bp insertion increases only 3 times over same temperature range. To determine the effect of Mg2+ on branch migration, strand exchange was initiated under standard conditions, and after 40 min of incubation, the reactions were diluted with the same buffer containing different Mg2+ concentrations. The samples were then incubated further, and the amount of completely exchanged product formed after the dilution was determined. Fig.4 A shows that branch migrations in both the 5′- to 3′- and 3′- to 5′- directions are equally influenced by Mg2+ concentration and that branch migration is most efficient at 2.5 mm Mg2+ decreasing about 4-fold as the Mg2+ concentration increases from 2.5 mm to 24 mm. Rad51's ability to bypass a 4- or 5-bp heterologous insertion is also diminished as the Mg2+concentration increases (Fig. 4, B and C). Curiously, however, the Mg2+ concentration affects branch migration to the same extent irrespective of whether the linear dsDNA lacks or contains a 4- or 5-bp heterologous insertion (Fig. 4,B and C). There results, as well as those with variable temperature, show that increasing the rate of branch migration does not affect the efficiency of bypassing a heterologous insert suggesting that the process of branch migration and bypassing a heterology are independent. ATP hydrolysis is required for the RecA-promoted strand exchange reaction to proceed in a unidirectional manner and to bypass heterologous insertions (20.Cox M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 217-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, a correlation between rates of strand exchange and ATP hydrolysis for RecA has been documented (21.Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22.Nayak S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25979-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rad51's considerably lower ATPase, as compared with that for RecA (6.Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar,7.Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), could account for its lower rate of strand exchange. To explore this parameter, we determined the effects of temperature and Mg2+ on the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of ssDNA or dsDNA. Fig. 5 A shows that the rate of either ssDNA or dsDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis is increased about 2.5-fold with increasing temperature from 25 to 37 °C, while the rate of branch migration increases more then 4.5-fold over the same range (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, while branch migration increases about 3-fold as the Mg2+concentration decreases from 24 mm to 2.5 mm, there is no effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that there is no correlation between the rate of ATP hydrolysis and branch migration in Rad51-promoted strand exchange reaction. RPA is required for Rad51 promoted strand exchange (6.Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 7.Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Quite possibly, progressive preferential binding of RPA in the 5′-to-3′ direction on ssDNA contributes to the preference in the directionality of the strand exchange (23.de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E.

We tested that possibility by substituting other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, E. coli SSB and T4 gene 32 for RPA. Both SSB and gene 32 protein stimulate Rad51-promoted strand, but as with RPA joint molecules initiated with linear dsDNA having 3′overhanging ends are converted to fully exchanged product about 3 times faster than ones initiated by linear dsDNA with 5′ overhanging ends (Fig. 6). Our data suggest that the preference in strand exchange in the 5′- to 3′-direction on ssDNA is most likely an intrinsic property of Rad51. Although Rad51 shares homology with RecA and, like RecA, promotes ATP-dependent strand exchange in vitro, there are similarities and striking differences in the way the two proteins carry out the reaction. Both joint molecule formation and the ensuing branch migration require the respective proteins; once joint molecules are formed, they are stable in the absence of the proteins but branch migration fails to follow. The requirement for joint molecule formation is, however, different. Rad51 initiates joint molecule formation only from overhanging complementary ends of linear dsDNA, while RecA utilizes linear dsDNA with any type of ends. Consequently, unlike RecA, the Rad51 promotes branch migration in either direction depending on whether the 3′- to 5′-end of linear dsDNA initiates the joint molecule (8.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this work, we attempted to characterize several features of the branch migration with a view to determining the basis for the different rates in the two directions. With respect to the temperature of the reaction, joint molecule formation occurs rapidly and is only slightly influenced over the temperature range 25–37 °C; however, the formation of fully exchanged product is slow and more strongly influenced by temperature. Nevertheless, although the rate of branch migration in the 5′- to 3′-direction with regard to the ssDNA is about 4 times faster than in the opposite direction, both are equally affected over this temperature range. Next, we determined if the rate of branch migration in each direction is affected by having to traverse various lengths of heterologous sequences in the linear dsDNA. Our data show that heterologous insertions of 6 bp or more near the middle of the linear dsDNA does not influence joint molecule formation initiated by either 5′ or 3′ overhanging ends, but formation of the fully exchanged product is blocked equally in each case. Moreover, the rate of branch migration in each direction is decreased about 3-fold as the Mg2+ concentration increases from 2.5 mm to 24 mm. The results of the three types of experiments, the effect of temperature, non-homologous insertions in the dsDNA and of Mg2+ suggest that, even though branch migration in the 5′- to 3′- direction proceeds faster than in the 3′- to 5′-direction with respect to the ssDNA, both processes are probably driven by the same mechanism. In a recent study, de Laat and co-workers (23.de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) showed that human RPA binds to ssDNA in the 5′-to-3′ direction. If yeast RPA polymerizes in the same way on the displaced single strand DNA, that could explain the preferred directionality of the strand exchange. However, when E. coli SSB and T4 gene 32 proteins, neither of which are known to have a preferential polarity of ssDNA binding, were substituted for yeast RPA in the Rad51-promoted strand exchange reaction, there was no change in the preferential direction of the Rad51-promoted strand exchange; joint molecules initiated by linear dsDNA with 3′ overhanging ends are converted to fully exchanged product faster than those initiated by 5′ overhanging ends. This indicates that the preference in the direction of strand exchange is most likely a property of Rad51 itself. The resemblance of Rad51 with RecA ends when the role of ATP in strand exchange is compared. Rad51 hydrolyzes ATP much more slowly than does RecA (6.Sung P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11932-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although the role of ATP hydrolysis in RecA-mediated strand exchange is unclear, it is believed to be important for promoting unidirectional branch migration and to account for its ability to bypass insertions of heterologous sequences (13.Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Rosselli W. Stasiak A.

Furthermore, several groups have shown that there is a direct coupling between NTP hydrolysis and RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange (21.Bedale W.A. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5725-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22.Nayak S. Bryant F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25979-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, we have found no indication of coupling between the rate of ATP hydrolysis and branch migration with Rad51. When ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable analogue, is used in place of ATP, RecA promotes branch migration in either direction and fails to bypass heterologous insertions as short as 6 bp in length (13.Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Rosselli W. Stasiak A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant RecA K72R, which is unable to hydrolyze ATP, behaves like RecA with ATPγS (25.Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Shan Q. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5712-5724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because Rad51 behaves in strand exchange, in much the same way as RecA that cannot hydrolyze ATP, we surmise it likely that Rad51 drives branch migration without the need for ATP hydrolysis. What then is responsible for driving branch migration by Rad51 and why the preference in the 5′-to-3′ direction with respect to the ssDNA? The branch migration promoted by Rad51 has very distinctive properties; the rate of branch migration increases with increasing temperature and by lowering Mg2+ concentration. Branch migration is blocked by heterologous insertions of greater than 6 bp in dsDNA. Although the rate of branch migration and the efficiency of bypassing heterology increase with increasing temperature, there is no correlation between the rate of branch migration and ability to bypass heterologous insertions with different Mg2+ concentrations. This suggests that the two are independent. These features are characteristic of spontaneous “thermal” branch migration (27.Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28.Panyutin I.G. Biswas I. Hsieh P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Considering that Rad51 does not utilize ATP hydrolysis for branch migration, we suspect that Rad51 does not act like a helicase by denaturing the dsDNA at the point of strand exchange. Rather, we consider it more likely that Rad51 modulates spontaneous branch migration, possibly, by stabilizing newly formed heteroduplex dsDNA as do E. coli RecT or β protein of phage λ (29.Hall S.D. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3205-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30.Li Z. Karakousis G. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As for the preference in the direction of strand exchange, Rad51 forms a highly regular, right-handed helical filament with ssDNA and dsDNA similar to RecA (4.Ogawa T., Yu, X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 5.Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), so it is likely that there is a polar orientation of Rad51 monomers in the Rad51-ssDNA filament. This polar orientation of the Rad51 monomer or cluster of monomers in the region at or before the branch point could favor a formation of new heteroduplex DNA preferably in one direction over another. We thank Bruce Stillman for the RPA expression plasmid, I. Robert Lehman for critical reading of the manuscript, Marianne Dieckmann for useful discussions throughout this work, and E. Tolstova for excellent technical support."

The Biochemistry of Inorganic Polyphosphate. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 11-35Google Scholar). The principal enzyme that synthesizes polyP from ATP inEscherichia coli is polyP kinase (PPK), a peripheral, membrane-bound homotetramer of 80-kDa subunits (2.Akiyama M. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22556-22561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PPK is highly conserved in many bacterial species, including some of the major pathogens (e.g. Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Neisseria meningitidis) and is a plausible antimicrobial target (3.Tzeng C.M. Kornberg A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). E. coli ppk mutants fail to make the adaptive changes in the stationary phase needed for resistance to various stresses and for survival (4.Rao N.N. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An initial event in converting the γ-phosphate of ATP into polyP chains of 700–800 residues (Equation 1) is the phosphorylation of critical histidine residues His-435 and His-454 (Equation 5) (5.Kumble K.D. Ahn K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14391-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is followed by highly processive polymerization with no detectable intermediates; neither ATP, Pi, nor polyP chains prime the reaction (6.Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reverse reaction (Equation 2), in which ADP is converted to ATP by polyP, is kinetically slower than the forward reaction but can be driven to completion by an excess of ADP. More generally, PPK functions as a nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, converting GDP, CDP, and UDP to their respective nucleoside triphosphates (7.Kuroda A. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Another novel feature of PPK is catalysis of the attack by GDP on a subterminal linkage of polyP, resulting in the transfer of a pyrophosphoryl group to generate the linear guanosine tetraphosphate (ppppG) (7.Kuroda A. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Radiation target analysis was used to examine all five PPK activities with regard to optimal reaction conditions, the effects of chemical agents, the catalytic mechanism of ppppG synthesis, and the subunit organization needed for each of the activities. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis by alanine substitution and deletion mutagenesis were used to identify key residues and fragments within the highly conserved regions of PPK. Purified PPK (100 ng) was added to a reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mmammonium sulfate, 5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C, as described previously (2.Akiyama M. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22556-22561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of polyP, ATP, GTP, and ppppG spots on TLC plates was as described previously (7.Kuroda A. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PolyP accumulationin vivo and enzyme activities in vitro were measured initially in a high throughput, 96-well format and then checked individually. PolyP levels and enzyme activities were measured both by a radioactive method (6.Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by a luciferase-based nonradioactive method (8.Ault-Riché D. Fraley C.D. Tzeng C.M. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assay for PPK autophosphorylation, 60–100 ng of an irradiated enzyme was incubated in 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 40 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm MgCl2, and either 5 μm or 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP on ice for 5 min; the reaction was terminated by adding 40 mm EDTA. The complex was precipitated with two volumes of acetone and then washed with ethanol to remove the unreacted ATP. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer, electrophoresed on a 12% gel, and analyzed with a digital scanner (5.Kumble K.D. Ahn K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14391-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PolyP synthesis or degradation was measured in several activity assays: for polyP synthesis from ATP (Equation 1; for nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK) activities, reverse reaction Equation 2; and GTP synthesis, Equation 3) and for ppppG synthesis (Equation 4). The reactions were terminated by adding 5× urea-PAGE buffer dye (450 mm Tris borate, 15 mm EDTA, 0.125% bromphenol blue, and 50% sucrose). The samples were electrophoresed on 6% urea-polyacrylamide gels at 300 V until the dye migrated 6–8 cm from the top of wells. Labeled polyP was stained with toluidine blue followed by exposure on a PhosphorImager. A 50-μl aliquot of purified PPK (0.2–0.5 μg/ml) in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube was frozen at −80 °C and shipped on dry ice to Taiwan for radiation inactivation. The samples were exposed to γ-rays at −63 °C at 1.5 Mrad/h for various times to obtain the desired dose; nonirradiated samples were assayed as controls. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDHase) was used as an internal standard to measure the functional decay after irradiation by monitoring the rate of NADPH appearance at an absorbance of 340 nm as follows. An assay mixture of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 0.3 mm NADP was incubated with G6PDHase at room temperature. The linear rate of NADPH absorbance during the first 2 min was used to calculate the activity as before (9.Tzeng C.M. Yang S.Y. Yang S.J. Jiang S.S. Kuo S.Y. Hung S.H. Ma J.T. Pan R.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The functional size of G6PDHase with a native molecular mass of 104 kDa was 112 kDa as determined by this method. To determine the structural size of PPK, irradiated samples were electrophoresed directly on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Phast System). Functional sizes and D37 values were calculated from the equation, log m = 5.89 − D37,T − 0.0028T where the D37,T is the radiation dosage in Mrad required to inactivate the activity to 37% that of the control at temperatureT (°C); m is the functional size in daltons, and T is the irradiation temperature (10.Kempner E.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 236-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The kinetic parametersK m, k cat, andK i were determined in duplicate by Lineweaver-Burk plots and time-course titrations (11.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar, 12.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975: 506-845Google Scholar). For initial rate studies, the reactions were started by adding 5 μl of purified enzyme (∼100 ng) to 15 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.2 mm magnesium chloride) at 37 °C containing either 1 mm GDP with 1–100 μm polyP or 0.1–2 mm of GDP with 10 μm polyP. For product-analog inhibition experiments, the conditions used were 0–20 μm polyP65 (Sigma) or 0–2 mm GMP (Sigma) as inhibitors. Reactions were spotted onto TLC plates and separated in 0.75 mKH2PO4 as the mobile phase; the products were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Plasmid pQE30ppk (5.Kumble K.D. Ahn K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14391-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis and the construction of deletion mutants by polymerase chain reaction. The pQE30 (QIAexpressTM, QIAGEN) plasmid vector with the highly efficient isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T5 promoter, and a Hisx6 tag coding sequence was used for overexpression and purification of the wild type and mutant PPK enzymes. E. coli XL2-blue (QIAexpressTM, QIAGEN) was the host strain used for the screening and propagation of plasmids. E. coli CF5802 (MG1655 ΔppkΔppx::kan) (4.Rao N.N. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1394-1400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was the host strain for overexpression. Site-directed, alanine substitution mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc.). The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were all 27 base pairs in length with the target codon in the center changed to GCT for Ala (A). Alignments of PPK amino acid sequences from 18 microorganisms revealed three highly conserved regions at residues 10–60, 350–480, and 550–630 of the 687-residue E. coli PPK (3.Tzeng C.M. Kornberg A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Amino acids within the carboxyl-terminal portion were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis, particularly the charged and the hydrophobic residues. Seven polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: 5′-a, CTCGGATCCATGGGTCAGGAAAAG; 5′-b, CTCGCATGCATTACGCCGATTTTA; 5′-c, CTCGCATGCTTCCGCAATGGTTTT; 3′-a, CTCAAGCTTTTATTGAGGTTGTTC; 3′-b, GAAGCATGCGGGCAGCCCTTGCTG; 3′-c, GAAGCATGCTTTATCAAACCAAAT; and 3′-d, GTTGCATGCGTGCTGACGCAGATA with restriction sites added for subcloning into pQE30. These primers were used to generate six deletion mutants (the expected sizes on agarose gels are given in parentheses): PPKΔ135–687 (0.5 kb), PPKΔ327–687 (0.98 kb), PPKΔ532–687 (1.6 kb), PPKΔ1–134 (1.6 kb), PPKΔ135–326 (1.5 kb), and PPKΔ1–326 (1.09 kb), as well as the wild type (2.07 kb). The expected sizes of the 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced proteins (given in parentheses): PPKΔ135–687 (15 kDa), PPKΔ327–687 (36 kDa), PPKΔ532–687 (55 kDa), PPKΔ1–134 (50 kDa), and PPKΔ1–326 (40 kDa), PPKΔ135–326 (58 kDa), and wild type (72 kDa), agreed with the values determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (data not shown). To verify that the mutations were constructed properly, the entire ppk region of each mutant was sequenced. Standard molecular biology and transformation procedures were used. Wild type and mutant cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with or without 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C and with aeration until the A 600 reached 1.0. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm, and the cultures were grown for an additional 2 h at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min and resuspended to 3 volume/g of wet weight in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 μg/ml lysozyme). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles and sonication for 1 min, and treated with 25 μg/ml each of DNase and RNase for 30 min at 4 °C. At final concentrations of 1 m KCl, 100 mmNa2CO3, and 0.05% Triton X-100 added sequentially, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then sonicated for 1 min to solubilize PPK from the membrane. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 100 mm imidazole. After 10 bed-volume washes, bound PPK was eluted with 10 mm EDTA and pooled by passing through a PD-10 desalting column. Samples were verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and further characterized by activity assays.

The optimal Mg2+levels differ widely for the activities in Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, with respective values of 5, 2, 1, and 0.2 mm. Whereas 10 mm inorganic pyrophosphate inhibited the activities in Equation 1 by 66% and those in Equation 3 by 75%, it increased those in Equation 4 by 100%. With regard to the synthesis of ppppG at low Mg2+ in the absence of PPi (Fig. 1 C), the removal of polyP is distributive, but the appearance of ppppG is delayed. The basis of these kinetics needs to be explored further. Gel-filtration and sedimentation-velocity measurements indicated that native PPK is a homotetramer (6.Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the functional sizes for each of the four activities was not known. To determine these, radiation inactivation was employed in which the function of the target molecule is destroyed with progressive doses of γ-rays or high energy electrons. The exponential rate of the functional decay is compared with standards in which the mass value has been determined for many proteins by other methods (10.Kempner E.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 236-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The decay rates observed for the first four PPK activities (Fig.2, A and B; TableII) indicate that a minimal functional size for the synthesis of polyP (Equation 1), of ATP (Equation 2), and of GTP (Equation 3) is 138–156 kDa which corresponds to a dimer (Fig.2). The unusual pattern of the ppppG synthesis decay rate can be interpreted as a two-phase reaction (Fig. 2, A andC) in which an inactive tetramer (306 kDa) decays to a trimeric state as judged by the subsequent decay rate indicative of a trimer (222 kDa). The decay rate of the tetramer in the first phase was calculated by correcting for the rate determined for the subsequent decay of the trimer.Table IIFunctional oligomeric size of PPK activitiesActivitiesD37Functional sizeSubunit organizationMradkDaSDS-PAGE14.2 ± 0.684 ± 5MonomerSynthesis of PolyP7.4 ± 1.0156 ± 18DimerSynthesis of ATP8.5 ± 0.7138 ± 11DimerSynthesis of GTP8.2 ± 0.4149 ± 17DimerSynthesis of ppppG (phase 1)3.9 ± 0.7306 ± 15TetramerSynthesis of ppppG (phase 2)5.8 ± 0.6222 ± 10TrimerAutophosphorylation at 5 μm ATP4.0 ± 0.2293 ± 14TetramerAutophosphorylation at 1 mm ATP7.3 ± 0.8159 ± 13DimerValues are averages of at least two independent experiments.

The minimal functional size of G6PDHase, the internal standard, is 110 ± 4 kDa compared to its native size of 102 kDa. Autophosphorylation of PPK at histidine residues His-435 and His-454 (Equation 5) to a limit of about 0.2/monomer occurs rapidly at an ATP concentration of 5 μm (5.Kumble K.D. Ahn K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14391-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6.Ahn K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11734-11739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction is far more extensive (3/monomer) at 1 mm ATP, a concentration near the K m for polyP synthesis. Radiation target analysis revealed that the functional size for PPK phosphorylation is a tetramer (293 kDa) at 5 μm ATP, whereas the active form, as in polyP synthesis at 1 mm ATP, is a dimer (159 kDa) (Fig. 3). When degraded by ionization, purified PPK becomes a monomer (80 kDa) as determined by denaturing SDS-PAGE analysis. The kinetic constants for ppppG synthesis and the order of substrate binding based on the initial rate as a function of both GDP and polyP concentrations in Lineweaver-Burk plots ruled out a ping-pong mechanism for Equation 4. Regression lines through the data of the reciprocal of rate (1/V)versus the reciprocal of GDP concentration and of 1/Vversus the reciprocal of polyP concentration plots do not intersect on the 1/V axis (data not shown). These data were used to determine the following kinetic constants for ppppG synthesis: theK m for GDP was 160 ± 29 μm and the k cat (turnover number) was 28.9 ± 1.6 min−1, whereas the K m for polyP was 35 ± 10 μm and k cat was 62.4 ± 7.4 min−1 (TableIII). The catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) were calculated to be 1782 min−1 mm−1 for polyP and 180 min−1 mM−1 for GDP (11.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar).Table IIIKinetics of ppppG synthesisVariable substrateFixed substrateKmk cataThe k cat values were obtained under the stated nonsaturating substrate levels.k cat/K mmmmin −1min −1 mM −1polyP (1–100 μm)GDP (1 mm)0.03562.41782GDP (1–2 mm)polyP (10 μm)0.1628.9180Product inhibitorVariable substrateFixed substrateInhibition patternK iPolyP65 (0–20 μm)polyP750GDP (1 mm)Competitive7.6 μmGDPpolyP750 (10 μm)Competitive1.2 μmGMP (0–2 mm)polyP750GDP (1 mm)Competitive1.4 mmGDPpolyP750 (10 μm)Competitive0.7 mmThe values are averages of two independent experiments.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9772-9781Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the analogs for the products, polyP65 and GMP, were used in inhibition experiments. P65 proved to be a competitive inhibitor of polyP750 and of GDP, both when GDP was held constant (K i = 7.6 ± 0.9 mm) and of GDP when polyP750 was held constant (K i = 1.2 ± 0.3 μm). GMP also proved to be a competitive inhibitor of both polyP750 and GDP, both when GDP was held constant (K i = 1.4 ± 0.3 mm) and of GDP when polyP750 was held constant (K i = 0.7 ± 0.09 μm). These initial-rate and product-analog inhibition studies demonstrate that ppppG synthesis at 0.2 mm MgCl2 occurs by a rapid equilibrium, random Bi-Bi mechanism. The amino acid alignment of 18 prokaryotic PPK sequences demonstrates a high degree of conservation, particularly within specific regions (17% of residues overall and 69% over the 60% most homologous regions). The MEME program (14.Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Fitting a Mixture Model by Expectation Maximization to Discover Motifs in Biopolymers: Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1994: 28-36Google Scholar) revealed 10 motifs of the highest homology among these PPKs. Five of the six most homologous motifs occur in the 300 residues of the carboxyl terminus of E. coli PPK (amino acids ∼360–687) (Fig.4). The motif with the lowest degree of homology is located between residues ∼130 and 320. To determine the critical residues and regions within the 300-residue carboxyl terminus, site-directed mutagenesis was performed based on both sequence-homology analysis and the previous structure-function dissociation results. Initially, 46 single-site alanine-substituted mutants were constructed and verified. Four PPK activities (EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4) in these 46 mutants were assayed at least three times in a 96-well high-throughput format. 2C. M. Tzeng and A. Kornberg, unpublished data. Of the 46 mutants, 34 exhibited PPK activities similar to those of the wild type. Eight mutants with activities that differed from wild type were further purified, checked by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (data not shown), and characterized in detail (TableIV).Table IVActivities of PPK mutantsin vivoin vitroMutantsPolyP accumulationSynthesis ofAuto-phosphorylationpolyPATPGTPppppG% relative to wild typeR375A2 ± 12 ± 14 ± 26 ± 25 ± 1<1S380A1 ± 1<1<1<13 ± 3<1Y468A45 ± 12144 ± 2136 ± 18146 ± 31122 ± 18144 ± 54F488A<14 ± 25 ± 25 ± 32 ± 24 ± 2P507A<13 ± 16 ± 24 ± 36 ± 35 ± 5R564A<11 ± 12 ± 2<1<118 ± 12R621A3 ± 1<1<1<1<1<1Q674A<15 ± 111 ± 7<1<15 ± 4Δ1–1346 ± 43 ± 19 ± 6<1<1<1Δ135–326<1<1<1<1<1<1Δ1–3261 ± 02 ± 15 ± 1<1<1<1Δ135–6875 ± 26 ± 24 ± 2<1<1<1Δ327–68714 ± 69 ± 211 ± 3<1<1<1Δ532–68717 ± 635 ± 530 ± 8<1<1<1All values are the average of four independent preparations and assays. Open table in a new tab All values are the average of four independent preparations and assays. Single-site mutants R375A, S380A, F488A, P507A, R564A, R621A, and Q674A lost all five PPK activities demonstrating that these amino acids are essential (Table IV). Y468A exhibited high levels (120–140%) of polyP, GTP, and ppppG synthesis and autophosphorylation activities (Equations 1 and 3–5) but diminished (20–50%) ATP synthesis activity (Equation 2). The PPK activities of the deletion mutants were also characterized in detail (Table IV). Only PPKΔ327–687 and PPKΔ532–687 exhibited partial polyP and ATP synthesis activities (Equations 1 and 2), suggesting that the essential fragment or domain for these functions is in the amino-terminal region. None of deletion mutants retained GTP and ppppG synthesis activities (Equations 3 and 4) implying that these require a native structure. In addition, none of the deletion mutants underwent autophosphorylation (Equation 5), indicating that an intact native protein is also required for this activity. In mutants R564A, PPKΔ327–687, and PPKΔ532–687 the polyP synthesis (Equation 1) and autophosphorylation (Equation 5) activities were dissociated; R564A autophosphorylated to 20% that of the wild type but lost all four other PPK activities. PPKΔ327–687 and PPKΔ532–687 did not display any autophosphorylation, but retained residual (10–35%) polyP (Equation 1) and ATP (Equation 2) synthesis activities. Mutant Y468A was examined for its NDK activity in substrate competition experiments (Fig. 5). In the presence of 1 mm ADP and 1 mm GDP, the ratio of ATP to GTP synthesis of the wild type enzyme is about 8:1, whereas for the mutant, the ratio is 1:3, and ppppG synthesis is reduced 40-fold relative to the wild type. The ratio of GTP to ppppG synthesis was also changed from 15:1 in the wild type to 25:1 in the mutant. These findings indicate that the catalytic sites of ATP and GTP synthesis are shared. PPK of E. coli has several discrete functions: the synthesis of polyP specifically from ATP, the reverse reaction to form ATP from polyP and ADP, and the substitution for ADP in the reverse reaction by GDP, CDP, and UDP, in essence a nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activity. The contribution of the reverse reactions in the disposal of polyP compared with that of exopolyphosphatase has not been determined, nor has the synthesis of GTP, CTP, and UTP as auxiliary to the activity of the major nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activity been evaluated. In addition to these activities, PPK autophosphorylates certain histidine residues to generate a putative intermediate and also catalyzes the transfer of a pyrophosphoryl group to GDP to generate the linear ppppG. The aforementioned activities of PPK can be distinguished by several agents, such as the optimal concentration of Mg2+ and the effects of guanidine-HCl and inorganic pyrophosphate (Table II). Inasmuch as the native state of PPK is that of a tetramer of 80-kDa subunits, these distinctive effects may depend in part on its oligomeric state. To this end, the subunit structure of the oligomer for each of the five activities was determined by radiation target analysis. Radiation inactivation of an enzyme activity has been used to measure the target size of the functional unit (9.Tzeng C.M. Yang S.Y. Yang S.J. Jiang S.S. Kuo S.Y. Hung S.H. Ma J.T. Pan R.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10.Kempner E.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 236-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The dosage of the γ-rays, generated by 60Co required to inactivate a number of enzymes of known size (e.g. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), provides a scale that can be used to measure the functional size of another enzyme activity. With regard to PPK, the dimeric state best fits the functional size of the forward and reverse activities (Table III; Fig. 2, A and B); the tetrameric state appears to be optimal for autophosphorylation at 5 μm ATP, but the dimer is preferred at 1 mmATP, the concentration needed for the forward and reverse reactions (Table II; Fig. 3, A and B). The functional size for the ppppG synthesis activity is judged to be a trimer (Table II; Fig. 2, A and C) as indicated by the increase in activity as the tetramer is inactivated and the rate of subsequent decay of activity, consistent with the size of a trimer. The PPK of Propionibacterium shermanii like that of E. coli PPK has a subunit mass of 83 kDa and synthesizes polyP processively to a limit of about 750 residues, but unlike E. coli PPK appears to be monomeric (15.Robinson N.A. Clark J.E. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5216-5222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Robinson N.A. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4481-4485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the glucokinase of P. shermanii, which utilizes polyP to phosphorylate glucose, is a homodimer of 33-kDa subunits (17.Phillips N.F.B. Horn P.J. Wood H.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) by either processive (polyP700) or nonprocessive (polyP30) mechanisms (18.Pepin C.A. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4476-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In M. tuberculosis,polyP glucokinase utilizes the long-chain polyP nonprocessively by an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism (13.Hsieh P.C. Kowalczyk T.H. Phillips N.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9772-9781Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of NDKs are highly conserved between E. coli and humans (43% identity) and are believed to be essential for DNA and RNA synthesis (19.De La Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), as well as for bacterial growth, virulence, cell-signaling, and polysaccharide synthesis (20.Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinase (21.Saeki T. Hori M. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1974; 28: 974-981Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and adenylate kinase (22.Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) may also function as NDKs inE. coli. Inasmuch as knockout mutants of E. coli(ndk- and ndk-/pyk-) are still viable (23.Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Mathews C.K. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), PPK by utilizing polyP may provide a backup function as an NDK in vivo. The capacity of PPK to catalyze the attack by GDP on a subterminal linkage of polyP generates ppppG. The activity predominates over the GDP attack on the terminal linkage when the Mg2+concentration is at the low level of 0.2 mm and inorganic pyrophosphate is present. Such a pyrophosphoryl transfer was not observed with ADP. Unlike the forward and reverse reactions, which are highly processive, the synthesis of ppppG is distributive (Fig. 1) and occurs by a rapid equilibrium, random Bi-Bi mechanism (Table III). In yeast, ppppG can be generated by phosphoglycerate kinase (24.Garcia Diaz M. Canales J. Sillero M.A.G. Sillero A. Cameselle J.C. Biochem. Int. 1989; 19: 1253-1264PubMed Google Scholar) and digested by an exopolyphosphatase (25.Kulakovskaya T.V. Andreeva N.A. Kulaev I.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 62: 1051-1052PubMed Google Scholar); ppppG can also stimulate mammalian adenylate cyclase (26.Ignarro L.J. Gross R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 541: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, unlike ppGpp for which regulatory roles are established (27.Kuroda A. Murphy H. Cashel M. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1966; 53: 371-388Google Scholar), the cellular presence of ppppG and its functions are unknown. The availability of high copy number plasmids bearing theppk gene and His tags for PPK should attract proper structural studies of the enzyme to account for its multiple functions. In the meantime, we have carried out some mutational studies and also examined some other bacterial PPKs for comparison with the E. coli enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis was focused on regions where the amino acid alignments of 18 bacterial PPK sequence show a high degree of conservation. Alanine substitutions at 46 sites were made in five of the six most homologous regions (over 60% identity) that make up the 300 residues at the carboxyl end (360–687). Among these, the PPKs isolated from several of them showed a virtual loss of all five activities. However, in one mutant (Y468A) all the activity levels were enhanced except for the synthesis of ATP, which was diminished. Thus, the active site, altered at this residue, discriminates against GDP far less than in the wild type. Mutants in which 100 or more residues were deleted at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, as well as in between (Fig. 4) retained no significant levels of any of the activities. Efforts to separate the functional domains of PPK by proteolytic digestion were not successful. Individual peptides of PPK generated by treatment with trypsin were isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography, but none contained any of the five PPK activities, although low levels were detected in pools of the digests. The PPKs of H. pylori and Vibrio cholerae have been purified and characterized as homotetramers. 2C. M. Tzeng and A. Kornberg, unpublished data., 3N. Ogawa and A. Kornberg, unpublished results. They also generate polyP with about 750 residues and behave much like that ofE. coli PPK. However, Thek cat/K m of the reverse activity of both PPKs was near 100 times greater than that of E. coli PPK, suggesting that PPK in H. pylori and V. cholerae may play more important roles in generating ATP from polyP. PPKs, partially purified from N. meningitidis and P. shermanii, were reported to have masses of 72 and 83 kDa, respectively, as determined by SDS-PAGE. The values forK m (1.5–2.0 mm) and turnover number (40–60/subunit/second), calculated from the efficiency and yield of the purification, are similar to those published for E. coli. Those enzymes also appeared to be attached to cell membranes (31.Tinsley C.R. Manjula B.N. Gotschlich E.C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3703-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An E. coli overproducer of PPK and an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced, overexpressed His-tagged PPK are now available for crystallography to explore structure-function relationships.

The high degree of structural and functional conservation of ARFs cloned from a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms has allowed a diversity of experimental approaches addressing the mechanism(s) and role(s) of ARFs in cell regulation. For example, in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, ARFs are required for protein secretion (2.Stearns T. Kahn R.A. Botstein D. Hoyt M.A. Mol. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The complexity of ARF signaling in any organism or cell is incompletely understood, and the number of immediate downstream effectors continues to expand (6.Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X.J. Chen J.

Kahn, submitted for publication. The two best characterized effectors are the heptameric coat complex, termed coatomer or COP-I, and phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Indeed, the recruitment of COP-I by ARF has been proposed as the nucleating step in budding and subsequent formation of coated vesicles in transport from Golgi stacks (7.Orci L. Palmer D.J. Ravazzola M. Perrelet A. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8.Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the activation of PLD1 by ARF has similarly been proposed as an alternative initiating event in vesicle formation (9.Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Vesicular transport is important not only in the cargo that is selectively shuttled between compartments but also in the maintenance of gradients or differences in the lumenal contents or lipid composition of the donor and acceptor membranes. The presence of protein coats on buds, and later vesicles, emanating from a membrane site is proposed to assist in the formation of the vesicle, in the selection of cargo destined to enter the nascent vesicle, in the targeting to the appropriate docking site, and in the regulation of the fusion by regulating the timing and site of uncoating. There are currently five different, multimeric, protein complexes designated as coats: COP-I, COP-II, AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3. Each of these has been reported to be recruited to membranes by a member of the ARF family; COP-I (10.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), AP-1 (11.Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 999-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), AP-2 (12.West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and AP-3 (13.Ooi C.E. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) by an ARF itself and COP-II by the more divergent SAR1 protein (14.Nakano A. Muramatsu M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The most extensively characterized interaction is that between COP-I and ARF proteins as they were first found to copurify on COP-I-coated vesicles and later purified ARF was found to be necessary and sufficient to support the binding of purified coatomer to Golgi membranes upon activation with the nonhydrolyzable analog GTPγS (7.Orci L. Palmer D.J. Ravazzola M. Perrelet A. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10.Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of ARF is proposed as the initiating event, leading directly to recruitment of coats and later steps that result in the formation of coated vesicles. With the discovery that ARF proteins are direct activators of PLD1 came the realization that another model for ARF action in the regulation of coat protein recruitment is also plausible. PLD catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidic acid has been shown to increase membrane fluidity; the lack of the head group is ideal for the changes involved in membrane reorganization coincident with budding or fission. The model that ARFs could promote coatomer recruitment and coated vesicle formation through the activation of PLD was tested and evidence to support it was provided by Ktistakis et al. (9.Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The localization of PLD1 to Golgi membranes (15.Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) further strengthens this model. However, not all ARF-promoted coat assembly is sensitive to inhibition of PLD (12.West M.A. Bright N.A. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the membrane phosphatidic acid level was not found to increase during the formation of coatomer-coated vesicles (16.Stamnes M. Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13676-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The functions of ARF proteins have been studied in vivo by expressing the dominant, activating mutant, Q71L, because this renders the protein refractory to the hydrolysis of bound GTP which normally accompanies interaction with ARF GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Induction of the expression of [Q71L]ARF1 (17.Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18.Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), [Q71L]ARF3, or [Q71L]ARF4 4C. Zhang and R. A. Kahn, unpublished observation. 4C. Zhang and R. A. Kahn, unpublished observation. in stably transfected NRK cells caused the vesiculation of Golgi stacks and expansion of the ER lumen (17.Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The effects on Golgi morphology are so dramatic as to be readily seen using light microscopy. These effects on Golgi and ER structures were assumed to be mediated by the increased stabilization of COP-I binding at the target membranes but could result from sustained activation of PLD1. To distinguish between and test each of the two prevailing models for ARF action in vesicular transport and to tie the results with in vivo effects of ARF, we sought second site mutations in [Q71L]ARF3 which would specifically ablate the activation of PLD1, or the recruitment of COP-I to Golgi membranes, or the ability to alter the morphology of the Golgi in intact cells. If such a mutant could be found to lose one but not other activities we would be able to resolve one or more activities cleanly and test specific interactions and their consequences in mammalian cells. Regulatory GTPases have at least two switch regions whose conformation is sensitive to the bound guanine nucleotide. First described in Ras proteins (19.Krengel U. Schlichting L. Scherer A. Schumann R. Frech M. John J. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1990; 62: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 20.Moodie S.A. Paris M. Villafranca E. Kirshmeier P. Willumsen B.M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 447-454PubMed Google Scholar), these switch I and switch II regions have been described in G protein α subunits (21.Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and, more recently, in ARFs (22.Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 23.Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Changes in these two switches account in large part for the change in affinity of GTPases for their effectors and modulatory proteins, exchange factors, and GAPs. Thus, targeting these switches for site-directed mutagenesis would likely identify mutants defective in one or more ARF activities. However, the reverse two-hybrid assay offers a powerful means of screening thousands of mutants for loss of specific interactions. Unfortunately, neither PLD1, presumably because of its hydrophobicity, nor COP-I, because of its heptameric nature, is amenable to two-hybrid analyses. Instead, we took advantage of recently described ARF-binding partners from two-hybrid screening to identify loss-of-interaction mutants with those partners and counterscreened them for PLD1 activation, COP-I recruitment, and Golgi vesiculation. Each of the four ARF-binding proteins, LTA1 (6.Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X.J. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), POR1/ARFAPTIN2 (24.Kanoh H. Williger B.-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5421-5429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25.Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), MKLP1 (6.Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X.J. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and GGA13 interacts preferentially with human [Q71L]ARF3 over wild type ARF3. The mutants identified in this study have allowed clear separation of PLD1 activation from COP-I recruitment, indicating that activation of PLD1 cannot be the sole means of promoting COP-I recruitment to Golgi membranes. Surprisingly, neither PLD1 activation nor COP-I recruitment correlates well with the ability to vesiculate Golgi in live cells, leading us to propose the presence of another, as yet unidentified, effector for this action of ARF. Unless otherwise specified, chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Yeast and bacterial media reagents were purchased from Difco. Media and reagents for NRK and Chinese hamster ovary cells were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Human ARF3 and the [Q71L]ARF3 mutant were engineered for expression in yeast as fusion proteins with the addition of the GAL4 binding domain at the COOH terminus, followed by the epitope from hemagglutinin recognized by the 12CA5 antibody. Each of four ARF-binding proteins (LTA1, full-length (6.Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X.J. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R.A. Cell Motil.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (MKLP1, the NH2-terminal truncation mutant (669–960)MKLP1) (6.Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X.J. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); and the ARF binder (GGA1, the truncation mutant (145–531)GGA1))3 was expressed in yeast as a NH2-terminal fusion protein with the GAL4 activation domain as described previously. The original expression vectors (pAS1-CYH2 and pACT2) and yeast strains (Y190 and Y187) were the generous gift of Dr. Stephen Elledge (26.Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 331-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid, pBG4D, which allowed expression of the GAL4 binding domain fusions at the COOH terminus of tester proteins was the generous gift of Rob Brazas. These cells allow read-out of two-hybrid interactions as either β-galactosidase activity or histidine prototrophy, resulting from expression of the HIS3 gene product. These two assays were performed as described (26.Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 331-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and give identical qualitative results, but the β-galactosidase assay is easier to score so that is the one used most often and reported here. For the reverse two-hybrid screen, random mutations were introduced into the open reading frame of [Q71L]ARF3 performing a PCR under conditions designed to reduce the fidelity of the polymerase (1/5 normal dATP concentration and addition of 50 μmMnCl2) (27.Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). A gap was introduced into the plasmid by restriction enzyme digestion to remove only the ARF coding region while the PCR product extended an additional 130 base pairs on each end. The mutagenized PCR product and gapped plasmid were used to transform Y190 cells that already carried plasmids directing the expression of the ARF-binding partner (yeast strain YAB413 (POR1ΔN), YAB453 (MKLP1), and YAB466 (GGA1) (6.Boman A.L. Kuai J. Zhu X.J. Chen J. Kuriyama R. Kahn R.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).3 Transformants were replicated on nitrocellulose membranes and assayed for β-galactosidase activity directly. Colonies giving white or light blue colors were picked and checked for the expression of full-length ARF3 by detection on immunoblots of the hemagglutinin tag at the COOH terminus. For each of the three screens (POR1, MKLP1, and GGA1) about 7,000 transformants were screened with an average of about 350 white or light blue colonies picked. 25–50% of these were found to be full-length. Plasmids expressing a full-length ARF3 were then rescued from yeast and transformed into Y187 to allow mating with each of the other ARF-binding partners in Y190 cells. The diploid strains harboring both plasmids were selected and assayed for protein interactions by the nitrocellulose filter bound, β-galactosidase assay. ARF3 mutants that retained interaction with at least one of the four binding partners were sequenced to identify the mutation. One set of primers from the ends of the open reading frame, which incorporate an NdeI site at the initiating methionine and a stop codon followed by a BamHI site at the 3′-end, were used to amplify the ARF3 mutants from the two-hybrid vectors to allow subcloning into pET3C. The resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression at 37 °C, as described previously (28.Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For myristoylated ARF proteins, the BL21 cells were cotransformed with a second plasmid, directing expression of human N-myristoyltransferase (29.Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, cells were induced at room temperature and after the addition of 200 μM myristic acid (30.Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The purification of ARF proteins was performed as described previously (28.Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The extent of N-myristoylation of each ARF preparation was determined by reverse phase HPLC analysis on a C4 column loaded in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Base-line resolution of the two peaks was readily achieved with retention times for nonacylated and acylated proteins of typically 46 and 52 min, respectively. The binding of [35S]GTPγS to ARF proteins was determined using the nitrocellulose filter trapping method (1.Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to separate bound and free ligand, under two different conditions: the “standard” conditions and those used in the assay for PLD1 activity. The main differences between these conditions are temperature, the concentrations of free magnesium, and the identity and form of lipids/detergents. The standard conditions included incubation at 30 °C of 1 μm ARF, 10 μm[35S]GTPγS, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm sonicatedl-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and 0.1% (2.5 mm) sodium cholate. Binding under PLD1 assay conditions (31.Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) was performed at 37 °C with 4 μm ARF, 30 μm GTPγS, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.7 mm CaCl2, 3.5 mm EGTA, 40 μM EDTA, 80 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaCl, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 690 μm lipid vesicles (10 mol % dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 86 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and 4 mol % phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.) Hexahistidine-tagged human PLD1 was expressed in Hi5 cells using a baculovirus construct, the generous gift of Sung Ho Ryu, Postech University, Pohang, Korea. Membranes from these cells were prepared according to a procedure described by Brown et al.(37.Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Kahn R.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14935-14943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The PLD1 was then extracted from the membrane by resuspension of the membrane in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mmKCl, 1% n-octyl β-d-galactopyranoside, and protease inhibitors. After 1 h at 4 °C, the resuspension was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was diluted with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% n-octyl β-d-galactopyranoside) to a final concentration of KCl of 100 mm before application to a 5-ml HiTrap SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a 100–500 mm KCl gradient in buffer A over a 25-min period at 1 ml/min. The fractions containing PLD activity (fractions 35–43) were pooled to give a final protein concentration of 50 μg/ml and frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80 °C. The PLD assay was performed as described by Lopez et al.(31.Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, the substrate was prepared in the form of lipid vesicles composed of 10 mol % [3H-methylcholine]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 86 mol % dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and 4 mol % phosphotidylinositol 4,5-bis-phosphate at a final concentration of 690 μm. Myristoylated ARF and GTPγS were preincubated in the presence of lipid vesicles at 37 °C for 40 min prior to the addition of PLD1. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform:methanol:HCl (50:50:0.3), followed by adding 350 μl of 1m hCl, and 5 mm EGTA. A portion of the aqueous phase (500 μl) was analyzed for the release of [3H]choline. PLD activity was expressed as the amount of choline released/min/mg of solubilized membrane protein. Bovine brain cytosol was prepared according to the procedure of Serafini and Rothman (32.Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 286-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). From 350 g of frozen bovine brain (Pel-Freez Biologicals), we obtained 140 ml of bovine brain cytosol at 16.0 mg/ml protein. Cytosol (15 ml) was resolved on a Sephacryl S-300, HiPrep 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which had been equilibrated previously with 50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and the presence of COP-I or ARF proteins analyzed by immunoblotting, using the EAGE anti-β-COP (33.Griffiths G. Pepperkok R. Locker J.K. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2839-2856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or R-1023, anti-ARF1/3 polyclonal rabbit antisera (34.Cavenagh M.M. Breiner M. Schurmann A. Rosenwald A.G. Terui T. Zhang C. Randazzo P.A. Adams M. Joost H.G. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18937-18942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions found to be free of ARF and enriched in coatomer were pooled and snap frozen in aliquots for use in the coatomer recruitment assay. Golgi-enriched membranes were prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells as described in Beckers and Rothman (35.Beckers J.M. Rothman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed with 0.5 m KCl on ice before use in the recruitment assay. ARFs and the enriched coatomer preparation were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA 100.1 rotor (Beckman) before use in the assay. All reactions were performed in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. Golgi membranes (10–12 μg of protein/reaction) were incubated with 4 μm myristoylated ARF proteins and 0.6 mg/ml coatomer-enriched cytosol at 37 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 100 μl in the presence of 25 μm of GTPγS or GDPβS, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 msucrose, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm creatine phosphate, and 8 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase. The reaction was terminated by centrifugation of the membranes through a 300-μl cushion of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5m sucrose, and 20 mm KCl. The pellet was washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and dissolved in 15 μl of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were resolved in gradient (8–16%) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes to allow immunoblotting using the rabbit polyclonal antibody to β-COP (R-23200; 33). Immunoreactivity was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate from Amersham. [Q71L]Arf3 was included as a positive control on each gel to help control for variability seen in the electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose. Nevertheless, some variation in background (that seen with no nucleotide or GDPβS added) recruitment of β-COP was observed. For this reason the amount of β-COP recruited to membranes with GTPγS was compared with that seen with GDPβS. These experiments were repeated at least three times, and the ability of each mutant to recruit β-COP in a GTPγS-dependent manner was qualitatively the same in each case. The coding regions of each of the ARF3 mutants were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at theNdeI and XbaI sites to allow constitutive expression under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Purified plasmids (120 ng/ml) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (1.2 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) were injected into NRK cells, grown on coverslips, using an Eppendorf automatic microinjector system. Injections were targeted to the nucleus with the aid of a 400 × light microscope. After injection the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 7 h before indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed using the polyclonal antibody to mannosidase II as primary and Texas red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody as secondary antibody. To test the relationships between PLD1 activation and COP-I recruitment, as well as each of these activities of ARFs to other cellular responses, we sought point mutations in an ARF which would lose one or more of these functions to allow the molecular dissection of ARF signaling both in vitro and in intact cells. The size and hydrophobicity of PLD1 and heptameric nature of COP-I make them unusable as targets in yeast two-hybrid assays as a means of monitoring interactions with ARFs. Thus, we screened for loss-of-interaction mutations with a recently identified set of ARF effectors and then looked among them for specific defects in PLD1 activation and COP-I recruitment. This approach was made possible by the recent identification of at least four different binding partners that bind ARF3 preferentially in the activated GTP-bound state and demonstrate activity in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Reverse two-hybrid screens were performed to identify mutants of human ARF3 which specifically lost the interaction with one effector but retained the interaction with others. Three separate reverse two-hybrid screens were performed with POR1, MKLP1, and GGA1, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In each of the reverse two-hybrid screens the effector was expressed as a fusion protein with the GAL4 activation domain. The ARF3 was also expressed as a fusion protein, with the GAL4 binding domain at the COOH terminus, followed by a hemagglutinin epitope at the COOH terminus. In addition, the ARF3 fusion protein in each case contained the GTPase-deficient, activating, Q71L mutation because this leads to higher levels of GTP-bound ARF in cells and promotes interactions with effectors in the two-hybrid assay. Random mutagenesis of [Q71L]ARF3 was achieved by PCR under conditions of reduced polymerase fidelity. Loss-of-interaction mutants were identified as white or pale blue colonies in the β-galactosidase assay, performed on nitrocellulose filters soaked in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. The presence of a full-length ARF3 fusion protein in each of these colonies was confirmed by immunoblotting, using the 12CA5 antibody to detect the hemagglutinin epitope at the COOH terminus. Plasmids expressing full-length mutants were rescued from yeast and used to transform strain Y187 prior to mating with strains carrying ea"

In this study, we determined whether all-trans-retinoic acid (tRA) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) modulate RARα receptor subcellular localization, leading to changes in its transcriptional activity and protein expression in mouse Sertoli cell lines. We found that tRA induced the nuclear localization of RARα within 30 min and that longer term exposure increased the receptor transcriptional activity and RARα protein expression. Conversely, FSH suppressed the tRA-induced nuclear localization, transcriptional transactivation, and protein expression of RARα. Treatment with two different protein kinase A-selective antagonists reversed the inhibitory actions of FSH on tRA-dependent RARα nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. These results are consistent with the involvement of protein kinase A in mediating the inhibitory effects of FSH. For the first time, we demonstrate a unique signaling convergence between the RARα and the FSH-mediated signaling pathways, which may have significant implications in the testis because both are critical regulators of testis physiology.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). Retinoid receptors are transcription factors that regulate the transcription of retinoic acid-responsive genes. Retinoid receptors belong to the larger superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors. Several members of this superfamily including the progesterone, the glucocorticoid, the estradiol, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are regulated at the level of nuclear trafficking (5.Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6.Akner G. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Fujii K.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 122: 1075-1079Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that activation of cellular kinases increased the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of these receptors (8.Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 9.Ssogawa K. Fujii K.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 122: 1075-1079Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of RARα subcellular localization and how this may affect its subsequent transcriptional activity. Previously, Tahayato et al. (10.Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrin. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) reported that down-regulation of protein kinase C decreased RARα nuclear localization and subsequent retinoic acid response element (RARE)-dependent transcriptional activity. In addition, although the regulation of nuclear trafficking was not examined, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been shown to decrease the transcriptional activity of RARα and to inhibit the tRA-induced expression of all three retinoic acid receptor mRNAs in PC12, B16 melanoma, and F9 teratocarcinoma cells (11.Scheibe R.J. Ginty D.D. Wagner J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12.Xiao Y. Desai D. Quick T.C. Niles R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13.Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, other reports indicate that the phosphorylation of RARα on serine 369 by an overexpressed catalytic subunit of PKA increased the transcriptional activity of the receptor in CV-1, HeLa, and COS-1 cells (14.Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Kim Y.W. Sharma R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-750PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, potential physiological effector molecules, for example, hormones and growth factors, which may stimulate PKA activity and influence RARα transcriptional activity, have not been examined. Of particular interest in the study of Sertoli cells is the potential signaling interaction of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with RARα. FSH signaling in the Sertoli cell is unique because it is the only cell type in males that expresses the receptor for FSH (FSHR) (16.Orth J. Christensen A. Endocrinology. 1997; 100: 103-107Google Scholar). It is well established that FSH interaction with its membrane receptor activates a stimulatory G-protein that leads to an induction of cAMP followed by activation of PKA (17.Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 493-509Google Scholar). Once activated, PKA phosphorylates various proteins, including the transcription factor, cAMP response element-binding protein, thereby potentiating subsequent changes in gene expression (16.Orth J. Christensen A. Endocrinology. 1997; 100: 103-107Google Scholar). Furthermore, both RARα and FSH are critical regulators of testis physiology (18.Lufkin T. Lohnes P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gaub M.P. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7225-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 19.Kumar T.R. Low M.J. Matzuk M.M.

A. 1998; 95: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the activity of RARα is essential for male reproduction. Transgenic RARα knockout male mice are sterile, exhibiting a degenerated testis morphology similar to that of vitamin A-deficient rats (18.Lufkin T. Lohnes P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gaub M.P. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7225-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice harboring targeted gene disruptions for either the FSH-β gene (19.Kumar T.R. Low M.J. Matzuk M.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or FSHR gene (20.Dierich A. Sairam M.R. Monaco L. Fimia G.M. Gansmuller A. Lemeur M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13612-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) have significantly decreased testis size and spermatogenic output (75% fewer sperm) (19.Kumar T.R. Low M.J. Matzuk M.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate how FSH inhibits tRA-induced RARα nuclear translocalization and how this influences receptor transcriptional activity and receptor protein expression in mouse Sertoli cell lines. MSC-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), supplemented with penicillin (105 IU/liter) and streptomycin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C in a saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2. MSC-1F cells, which are MSC-1 cells stably transfected with the FSH receptor cDNA (clone 64), were maintained in culture in the same medium except for the addition of 250 μg G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to approximately 50% confluency before being serum-starved for 48 h with 0.1% FCS in DMEM to reduce endogenous tRA. Cells were treated with various concentrations of tRA (Sigma), dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP) (Sigma), and either human pituitary FSH or ovine FSH (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 1.5 μg/ml. Various concentrations of the PKA-selective inhibitors, H-89 and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), were added 30 min prior to treatment with activators. H-89 has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of PKA (21.Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naaito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Geilen C.C. Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Reutter W. FEBS. 1992; 309: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23.Findik D. Song Q. Hidaka H. Lavin M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), with aK i value of 0.048 μm. H-89 does have the ability to inhibit other cellular protein kinases, but at much higher concentrations (i.e. PKG, K i = 0.48 μm; protein kinase C, K i = 31.7 μm and, casein kinase, K i = 38.3 μm). On the other hand, Rp-8-Br-cAMPS acts as a competitive analog to endogenous cAMP and prevents the dissociation of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA, thus preventing PKA from phosphorylating substrates. The K i value of Rp-8-Br-cAMPS for PKA is 5 μm. Rat FSHR cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from rat Sertoli cell mRNA into pSELECT (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) (24.Liu X. De Pasquale J.A. Griswold M.D. Dias J.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression construct (prFSHRex) was generated by subcloning theEcoRI-XbaI fragment containing the rat FSHR cDNA into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). MSC-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of supercoiled prFSHRex and neomycin-resistant colonies selected by culturing transfected cells in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml G418 for 14 days. Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (24.Liu X. De Pasquale J.A. Griswold M.D. Dias J.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA from stably transfected MSC-1F cells was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. RNA was transferred onto Magna nylon membranes (Micron Separations, Westborough, MA) and cross-linked to the membrane by ultraviolet light. Probe construction and hybridization procedures were performed as described previously (25.Maquire S.M. Tribley W.A. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 1106-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to phosphor screens for 16 h, and the signal was visualized using the Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager 445 SI (Sunnyvale, CA). MSC-1F cells were plated on 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and fixed with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 h before incubation with the anti-RARα antibody at a 1:300 dilution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody at 1:300 dilution for 1 h. Detection of antibody complexes was conducted using fluorescein avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For a negative control, the anti-RARα antibody was incubated with immunizing peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C prior to addition to fixed cells. All digital images were obtained using a laser scanning confocal system (MRC 1024; Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared using a standard method described previously with minor modifications (26.Chilov D. Camenisch G. Kvietikova I. Ziegler U. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Kvietikova I. Wenger R.H. Marti H.H. Gassmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 200 μl of prechilled hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 10 min on ice, 20 μl of 10% IGEPAL detergent (Sigma), an Nonidet P-40 substitute, was added to the suspension, and cells were lysed by vortexing. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s, the supernatant obtained was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. Soluble nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspension of the pellet in 50 μl of prechilled hypertonic buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by incubation on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant collected constituted the nuclear extract. To obtain total soluble cell extract, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were combined. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (28.Akmal K.M. Dufour J.M. Kim K.H. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μg of protein was separated by electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% Blotto (Carnation, Los Angeles, CA), incubated with a polyclonal anti-RARα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:300 dilution, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 1:2500. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric analysis was performed using the Molecular Dynamics SI Densitometer. Levels of RARα were normalized to levels of total protein as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of the membrane. A 2.8-kilobase RARα cDNA from the plasmid LRARαSN (29.Collins S.J. Robertson K.A. Mueller L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the pHook expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). MSC-1 and MSC-1F cells were grown to approximately 75% confluency in 24-well plates containing 5% FCS in DMEM before being serum-starved in 0.1% FCS in DMEM for 24 h. Cells were transfected with 75 ng of pHookRARα, 250 ng of the reporter plasmid pRARE-tk-Luc, and 75 ng of pHookLacZ (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using LipofectAMINE transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 h following transfection, an equal volume of 4% FCS in DMEM was added to the cells. The following day, the medium was replaced with 2% FCS in DMEM, and cells were treated with various agents. Cells were then harvested 16 h post-treatment. Luciferase activity was analyzed using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer (EG&G Microlumat, Berthold Systems, Aliquippa, PA). Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Statistical analysis of normalized RARα protein levels determined by Western blot analysis consisted of one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparison of the means α = 0.05 (Tukey's test, Minitab 10 Xtra; Minitab, Inc., State College, PA). In 1992, Peschon et al. (30.Peschon J.J. Behrigner R.R. Cate R.L. Harwood K.A. Idzerda R.L. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1403-1411PubMed Google Scholar) developed an immortalized Sertoli cell line, designated MSC-1. Although MSC-1 cells share many similar characteristics with primary Sertoli cells, MSC-1 cells do not express FSHR (31.McGuinness M.P. Linder C.C. Morales C.R. Heckert L.L. Pikus J. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine the potential effects of FSH on RARα signaling, MSC-1 cells were stably transfected with the cDNA encoding the full-length FSH receptor. Northern blot analysis was then performed to determine which transfected MSC-1 clones expressed recombinant FSHR mRNA. These analyses identified several clones that expressed appreciable levels of mRNA corresponding to the FSH receptor with approximate size of 2.6 kilobases (data not shown). Clone 64, which expressed FSH receptor mRNA, was selected and designated MSC-1F (Fig.1 A). To confirm that the expressed FSH receptor was functional, MSC-1F cells were treated with FSH for 1 h, and the subsequent induction of the FSH-responsive c-fos mRNA was examined. These analyses confirmed the presence of functional FSH receptors in MSC-1F cells (Fig.1 B). To investigate the factors that regulate RARα nuclear translocation and thus potentially regulate the transcriptional activity of RARα, MSC-1F cells were serum-starved for 48 h and treated with tRA, FSH, dbcAMP, and the PKA-selective antagonists, H-89 and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS. Cells were then fixed with methanol, and the subcellular localization of RARα was detected using anti-RARα antibody. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed that treatment with tRA increased RARα nuclear localization compared with cells treated with the vehicle alone (Fig. 2, compare A and B). Conversely, treatment of cells with FSH inhibited the tRA-induced nuclear localization of RARα (Fig.2 D). Likewise, treatment with dbcAMP, a cell permeable analog of cAMP, also inhibited the tRA-induced nuclear localization of RARα (Fig. 2 G). However, treatment of cells with FSH or dbcAMP in the absence of tRA did not change the subcellular localization of RARα compared with untreated cells (data not shown). Furthermore, to determine whether dbcAMP and FSH suppression of RARα nuclear localization was through the activation of PKA, MSC-1F cells were pretreated with the PKA-selective inhibitors, H-89 and Rp-8-Br-cAMPS. Treatment of cells with these two PKA-selective inhibitors alleviated the inhibitory actions of dbcAMP and FSH on the nuclear localization of tRA-induced RARα (Fig. 2, E,F, H, and I). Similar results were obtained for MSC-1 cells treated with dbcAMP and PKA-selective antagonists (data not shown). To quantitate the changes in RARα nuclear translocation, MSC-1F and MSC-1 cells were treated for 30 min, and nuclear extracts were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclear protein extracts were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis using anti-RARα antibody. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase of RARα protein in the nuclear fraction of MSC-1F and MSC-1 cells following tRA treatment compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3, A andB, respectively, compare lanes 1 and2). This nuclear localization of RARα also occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, indicating that increases in receptor seen in the nucleus is not a result of increased newly synthesized receptor and that no additional protein synthesis is required for nuclear translocation (data not shown). In contrast, Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from MSC-1F cells treated with increasing concentrations of FSH revealed a dose-dependent decrease of tRA-induced RARα nuclear localization (Fig. 3, A, lanes 3–6, andE). Similarly, treatment of MSC-1 cells with dbcAMP also inhibited the nuclear translocation of tRA-induced RARα (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 2 and 3). In addition, it was also observed that pretreatment with H-89 alleviated the inhibitory effects of FSH and dbcAMP in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of FSH on RARα nuclear translocation is at least partially mediated through cAMP-dependent PKA (Fig. 3, A,lanes 7–9, and B, lanes 4–8). To determine the extent of cytoplasmic contamination in the nuclear extracts, which may influence relative levels of RARα, Western blot analyses of these same nuclear extracts and a cytoplasmic extract from MSC-1F cells (Fig. 3 C) and MSC-1 cells (Fig. 3 D) were performed using an antibody against actin, a cytoplasmic protein marker. A low amount of cytoplasmic contamination was evident as indicated by the presence of actin in the nuclear extracts from both cell lines. Equally important, the levels of cross-contamination in the nuclear extracts were consistent across treatments. Therefore, changes in RARα protein levels in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 3, Aand B) cannot be attributed to differential cytoplasmic contamination but are because of changes in nuclear translocalization of RARα under varying experimental conditions. To investigate whether increases in RARα nuclear localization are related to increases in RARE-dependent transcription by RARα, MSC-1F cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct, designated pRARE-tk-Luc (29.Collins S.J. Robertson K.A. Mueller L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), containing three RAREs from the RARβ promoter. In addition, an expression vector containing the wild type RARα gene (pHookRARαSN) was cotransfected to observe more specifically RARα-mediated transcriptional activity. A β-galactosidase plasmid (pHookLacZ) was also cotransfected to normalize for transfection efficiency across treatments. After treatment of transfected cells with various agents, cells were harvested, luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed on cell lysates, and relative luciferase activity was determined (Fig. 4). MSC-1F cells treated with increasing concentrations of tRA demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 4, lane C), whereas treatment with FSH alone (Fig. 4, lane F) had no significant effect on luciferase activity. However, when cells were treated with varying concentrations of FSH and 1.0 μm tRA, FSH abolished the tRA-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. This suppression of tRA-dependent RARα transactivational activity by FSH was found to act at least partially through PKA, because pretreatment with increasing concentrations of the PKA-selective antagonists, H-89 or Rp-Br-cAMPS, abrogated the inhibitory effect of 50 ng/ml FSH, resulting in luciferase reporter expression similar to that without FSH treatment. Previously, we have shown a significant increase in RARα mRNA within 4 h following retinol injection into a rat placed on a vitamin A deficient diet for 9 weeks (28.Akmal K.M. Dufour J.M. Kim K.H. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, a RARE has been identified in the promoter region of the RARα2 (isoform 2) gene (32.Leroy P. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10138-10142Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that transcriptional activation of RARα may lead to positive auto-regulation of the receptor and thus increased expression of RARα protein. Therefore, to investigate whether the expression of RARα in MSC-1 cells changes following tRA treatment, cells were serum-starved for 48 h and incubated with tRA for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. Western blot analysis demonstrates that RARα protein levels increased significantly beginning at 1 h and reached a maximum at 3 h following tRA treatment, approximately a 2.5-fold increase of RARα over levels in the untreated cells (Fig.5 A). Levels of RARα protein then returned to a basal level by 24 h. To determine whether the increase in RARα protein expression was due to new protein synthesis, MSC-1 cells were pretreated with cycloheximide for 30 min prior to treatment with tRA. Cycloheximide suppressed tRA-induced RARα protein expression (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7–11), demonstrating that the up-regulation of RARα expression by tRA treatment is due to new protein synthesis. To investigate whether FSH or dbcAMP had similar inhibitory effects on RARα protein expression as they did with receptor nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, MSC-1F cells were treated with FSH and MSC-1 cells were treated with dbcAMP, in the presence of tRA. Cells were harvested in intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 24 h and Western blot analysis conducted using anti-RARα antibody. Treatment with FSH or dbcAMP abolished the tRA-induced increase of RARα protein expression in MSC-1F and MSC-1 cells, respectively (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 6–13). To determine whether the inhibition of tRA-induced RARα protein expression by FSH and dbcAMP was mediated by PKA, MSC-1F and MSC-1 cells were also pretreated for 30 min with the PKA-specific inhibitor, H-89. The addition of H-89 alleviated the inhibitory effects of FSH and dbcAMP on tRA-induced RARα expression, returning the time-dependent pattern of receptor protein levels to almost that of tRA treatment alone (Fig. 6). The regulation of receptor subcellular localization is of great importance in understanding the transcriptional activity of receptors belonging to the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily (5.Guiochon-Mantel A. Delabre K. Lescop P. Milgrom E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6.Akner G. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.DeFranco D.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 593-597Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8.Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 9.Ssogawa K. Fujii K.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 122: 1075-1079Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that the ligand, tRA, increases the nuclear translocalization of RARα within 30 min in mouse Sertoli cell lines (MSC-1 and MSC-1F) and that this localization is independent of new protein synthesis. This regulation of nuclear localization by ligand is consistent with the previous finding in the vitamin A-deficient rat model in which the RARα subcellular localization in germ cells changed from primarily nuclear to more cytoplasmic following retinol depletion (33.Akmal K.M. Dufour J.M. Vo M. Higginson S. Kim K.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate the importance of ligand in the regulation of RARα receptor subcellular localization. Equally important, this increase in nuclear localization is followed by a dose-dependent increase in the transcriptional activity of an RARE-containing luciferase reporter gene and the expression of the endogenous RARα gene. Specifically, RARα expression is induced in a time-dependent manner by tRA treatment, increasing significantly by 1 h, reaching a maximum of 2.5-fold within 3 h, and then declining by 24 h. This increase requires new protein synthesis and is probably due to the RARα serving as an endogenous RARE-containing reporter gene because an RARE has previously been located within the promoter region of RARα2 (32.Leroy P. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10138-10142Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The pattern of increase in the expression of RARα protein by tRA treatment in mouse Sertoli cell lines parallels the retinol-induced effect on RARα protein expression previously observed in vivo in the testis of vitamin A-deficient rats (33.Akmal K.M. Dufour J.M. Vo M. Higginson S. Kim K.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Following an injection of retinol into a vitamin A-deficient rat, the RARα protein level reached a maximum level at 4 h and then decreased to a basal level within 24 h. At the mRNA level, there was nearly a 3-fold increase of RARα mRNA as early as 2 h post-injection of retinol, followed by a subsequent decrease by 12 h (33.Akmal K.M. Dufour J.M. Vo M. Higginson S. Kim K.H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest a positive feedback loop for RARα operating in the Sertoli cell lines in the presence of tRA, beginning with a relatively rapid nuclear localization of RARα receptor, leading to enhanced transcriptional activity of RARα, and resulting in increased expression of endogenous RARα. Although the ligand, tRA, acted as a positive regulator of RARα nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, treatment of MSC-1F cells with FSH or MSC-1 cells with dbcAMP in the presence of tRA inhibited RARα nuclear translocation, RARE-reporter gene transcriptional activity, and RARα protein expression. The effect of dbcAMP on the expression of RARα and RARE-dependent transcriptional activity is similar to that reported previously (12.Xiao Y. Desai D. Quick T.C. Niles R.M. J. Cell.

Both dbcAMP and 8-bcAMP have been shown to suppress the tRA-induced mRNA expression of all three retinoic acid receptors (RARα, -β, and γ) and the transcriptional activity of RARE-luciferase reporter gene in B16 melanoma and F9 teratocarcinoma cells (12.Xiao Y. Desai D. Quick T.C. Niles R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13.Hu L. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was determined that the RARα mRNA stability was not altered but that the binding affinity of the receptor to its RARE had decreased by 75% (12.Xiao Y. Desai D. Quick T.C. Niles R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect of dbcAMP or 8-bcAMP on decreasing RAR mRNA levels is probably at the transcriptional level. However, the effect of dbcAMP on decreasing RAR mRNA levels may also occur at an earlier event, at the level of nuclear trafficking of RAR. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that both dbcAMP and FSH inhibit the nuclear localization of RARα, and this inhibition influences the transcriptional activity of RARα and the expression of endogenous RARα in mouse Sertoli cell lines. The inhibitory effects of dbcAMP and FSH are dominant over the stimulatory effect of tRA and are apparently mediated by PKA, because treatment with PKA-selective antagonists relieved the FSH and dbcAMP-induced inhibitory effects on tRA-induced nuclear localization and transcriptional activity. Previously, protein kinase C has been shown to be involved in the regulation of RARα subcellular localization (10.Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrin. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The inhibition of protein kinase C activity decreased the tRA-induced RARα nuclear localization and transcriptional activity in COS-7 cells (10.Tahayato A. Lefebvre P. Formstecher P. Dautrevaux M. Mol. Endocrin. 1993; 7: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, we report that PKA is an additional cellular kinase that regulates the subcellular localization of RARα, subsequently altering its transcriptional activity. The mode of PKA regulation of RARα may be a common form of signaling cross-talk because the involvement of PKA as an antagonist to the physiological effects of retinoic acid has been described previously in other cells. It has been demonstrated that PKA may down-regulate tRA-induced neural differentiation (11.Scheibe R.J. Ginty D.D. Wagner J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Scheibe et al. (11.Scheibe R.J. Ginty D.D. Wagner J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that tRA induced neuronal differentiation in two mutant PC12 cell lines that were deficient in PKA but not in the parental PC12 cell line harboring PKA activity. More significantly, the mutant cells lines that were deficient in PKA had an increased expression of retinoic acid receptors, which may be explained by our results. However, other investigators have shown that overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA in CV-1, HeLa, and COS-1 cells enhanced a tRA-induced RARE-dependent RARα transcriptional activity (14.Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Kim Y.W. Sharma R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-750PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This disparity between their results and our data may be due to overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA, which could potentially disrupt normal PKA or RARα signaling mechanism within the cell. Alternatively, differential regulation of the transcriptional activity of RARα by PKA may be a cell type-dependent event. The signaling cross-talk between the retinoid receptor and the FSH receptor may have significant implications during testis development. FSH stimulation of cAMP production in rat testes was reported to start at embryonic day 19 and reach a maximum (23-fold) on day 10 postpartum, followed by a rapid decline, remaining constant thereafter (34.Eskola V Nikula H. Huhtaniemi I. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 93: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have demonstrated that RARα mRNA expression in the developing rat testis does not appear to reach a maximum until 10 days of age (30.Peschon J.J. Behrigner R.R. Cate R.L. Harwood K.A. Idzerda R.L. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1403-1411PubMed Google Scholar) and that the protein is not translocated into the nucleus of Sertoli cells until 20 days of age (35.Dufour J.M. Kim K.H. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that FSH plays a significant role in Sertoli cells early in testis development, possibly playing a role in Sertoli cell proliferation (36.Griswold M. Mably E.R. Fritz I.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1976; 4: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37.Griswold M. Solari A. Tung P.S. Fritz I.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1977; 7: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), while simultaneously inhibiting the transcriptional activity of RARα. It is only when the FSH action diminishes after 10 days of age in rats that RARα plays a dominant role, possibly in Sertoli cell differentiation. It has been well established that retinoic acid signaling induces cell differentiation in many cell types (1.Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2 nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar, 11.Scheibe R.J. Ginty D.D. Wagner J.A. J.

Collins S. Andreeff M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that the interplay between FSH and RARα signaling may initiate an important biological switch in Sertoli cells from proliferation in early testis development to differentiation during later stages of development. In summary, we demonstrate that the ligand for RARα, tRA, positively regulates the nuclear localization, transcriptional activity, and the protein expression of RARα in the mouse Sertoli cell lines, MSC-1 and MSC-1F. We also identify FSH stimulation of the FSH receptor as one upstream physiological event that leads to the down-regulation of RARα signaling in mouse Sertoli cells. Thus, FSH represents a potentially important modulator of RARα activity that may have significant physiologic implications in the testis. In addition, results utilizing PKA-selective antagonists suggest that PKA may be involved in FSH-mediated down-regulation of RARα. With PKA signaling networks found in a myriad of different cell types, it is possible that the modulation of RARα by PKA is a common regulatory mechanism. Further studies will be necessary to determine the exact role of PKA with regards to the down-regulation of RARα.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of the Nef proteins may not be identical for all viral families. Here we investigate the interaction between the Nef protein of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses and SH3 domains from Src family kinases. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoblotting we show that, in contrast to HIV-1 Nef, SIV and HIV-2 Nef poorly interact with Hck SH3 but bind to Src and Fyn SH3 domains. The molecular basis of these differences in SH3 targeting was revealed by sequence analysis and homology modeling of the putative SH3-Nef structures.

Substantial sequence polymorphism has been detected among nef alleles from various cloned isolates of HIV and SIV, suggesting that Nef proteins may have subtype-specific functions or possess different strategies to perform the same task. However, four stretches of residues have been identified that were highly conserved among sequences derived from AIDS patients but also from among sequences of HIV-2 and SIV (3.Shugars D.C. Smith M.S. Glueck D.H. Nantermet P.V. Seillier-Moiseiwitsch F. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these stretches includes a Pro-Xaa-Xaa-Pro motif, the canonical Src homology (SH) 3 domain binding consensus, indicating that SH3 binding is a common feature of all types of Nef alleles. An intact PXXP motif is required for the potential of HIV-1 Nef to enhance viral growth and infectivity in cell cultures (4.Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 5.Goldsmith M.A. Warmerdam M.T. Atchison R.E. Miller M.D. Greene W.C. J.

It has subsequently been shown that HIV-1 Nef binds with high affinity to the SH3 domains of the Src family kinases Hck and Lyn, whereas only with a modest affinity to SH3 domains of other members of the Src family (Lck, Fyn, and Src) (7.Lee C.H.

Ladbury J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14683-14691Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, despite the PXXP motif being strictly conserved in all Nef proteins, an HIV-2 Nef allele has been reported to have lost the high affinity for Hck SH3 (9.Karn T Hock B. Holtrich U. Adamski M. Strebhardt K. Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Virology. 1998; 246: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Controversial data has further been collected for the requirement of the proline-rich motif for AIDS disease progression in infected macaques (10.Lang S.M. Iafrate A.J. Stahl-Hennig C. Kuhn E.M. Nisslein T. Kaup F.J. Haupt M. Hunsmann G. Skowronski J. Kirchhoff F. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11.Khan I.H. Sawai E.T. Antonio E. Weber C.J. Mandell C.P. Montbriand P. Luciw P.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5820-5830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Especially, it was reported that a PXXP to AXXA mutated SIVmac239 protein could still bind to Src kinase (10.Lang S.M. Iafrate A.J. Stahl-Hennig C. Kuhn E.M. Nisslein T. Kaup F.J. Haupt M. Hunsmann G. Skowronski J. Kirchhoff F. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that SIV might have different strategies of interacting with the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases. In an effort to find a unifying explanation for the observed discrepancies in SH3 targeting of different Nef alleles, we investigated the interaction of SIV and HIV Nef proteins with four representatives of Src family SH3 domains, i.e. Src, Fyn, Lck, and Hck SH3. To establish the molecular basis for our biochemical data, we combined sequence analysis with structural data obtained by homology modeling of HIV-2 and SIV Nef alleles. The mutation of residues 139 (Tyr to Trp), 148 (Glu to Thr), and 149 (Glu to Gln) in SIVmac239 Nef were generated by PCR using a single mutagenic primer, allowing construction of SIVmac239WTQ Nef. HIV-1lai Nef, SIVmac239 Nef, SIVmac239WTQ Nef were cloned in βDNA4, a plasmid construct obtained by the substitution of the CMV promoter from pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) by the chicken β-actin promoter derived from the β-actin-luciferase construct (a kind gift from N. Auffan, CIML, France). HA-tagged constructs were developed by PCR using a 3′-primer which introduced the HA epitope-encoding residues. Each construct was verified by sequencing. COS-7 cells were transfected using Fugene6 as recommended by the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with HIV-1laiNef, SIVmac239 Nef, SIVmac239WTQ Nef, or mock-transfected. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection for analysis using detergent buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm Na-vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and pepstatin). Hck-, Lck-, Src-, and Fyn-GST-SH3 fusion proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli cells, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and as described previously (12.Collette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. Harris M. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6333-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Lysates from transfected COS-7 cells were reacted with 10 μg of the recombinant GST-SH3 fusion proteins. Glutathione-Sepharose affinity-purified precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and either HIV-1 (MAT0020 HIV-1 Nef monoclonal antibody, Transgene, France) or SIV Nef immunoblotting (17.2 monoclonal antibody, a kind gift from Drs. K. Krohn and V. Ovod, University of Tampere, Finland), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin and development using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. To verify in vivoforming stable complexes, transfected cells were lysed in detergent buffer. Clarified supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose and then incubated with anti-Hck polyclonal antibody (1/400 dilution, Santa Cruz, TEBU, France) and with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C on a wheel. Immunoprecipitates were washed in detergent buffer and eluted in sample buffer by boiling, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, France) or anti-Hck polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, TEBU, France). The vectors for expression of the HIV-1lai, HIV-2rod and SIVmac239Nef proteins fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4BD) have been described previously (13.Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S.

Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L. Benarous R. Heard J.M. Schwartz O. Immunity. 1998; 8: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Expression vectors of HIV-1sf2 and SIVsmPbJ Nef fused to the Gal4BD were constructed by PCR amplification of the respectivenef genes, which were then inserted into theBamHI-SalI restriction sites of the pGBT10 plasmid (15.Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PA1 mutant, in which the proline residues in positions 72 and 75 of the HIV-1lai Nef protein were replaced by alanines, was provided by G. Cohen (MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts) (4.Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). This Nef PA1 mutant was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into pGBT10. The construction of the vector for expression of the human Hck SH3 domain fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD) was performed by PCR amplification of a 168-base pair fragment (coding from residue Ile-61 to residue Asp-116) using specific primers. This fragment was cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of the pGad1318 plasmid (15.Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodéus M. Durand H. Douté M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two-hybrid interaction assays were performed as described previously (13.Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, the SFY526 yeast reporter strain, containing the LacZ Gal4-inducible gene, was cotransformed with the Gal4BD and Gal4AD hybrid expression vectors and plated on selective medium. Double transformants were patched on the same medium and then replicated on Whatman 40 filters for β-galactosidase activity. This qualitative assay was monitored for 6 h at 30 °C, and the reaction was then stopped with 1 mNa2CO3. The liquid culture assay for determination of the quantitative β-galactosidase activities was performed in triplicate as described previously (13.Liu L.X. Margottin F. Le Gall S. Schwartz O. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13779-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The background level was around 4–6 units and corresponds to SFY526 yeast cells expressing the Nef Gal4BD hybrids and the irrelevant Gal4AD-SNF4 hybrid. Interaction between the Gal4BD-SNF1 and Gal4AD-SNF4 hybrids was used as a positive control in both qualitative and quantitative β-galactosidase assays. The sequences of the Nef isolates from SIVmac239 and HIV-2rod were obtained from the GenBankTM data base. The conserved core domains (residues 71–148 and 178–203) from these isolates share about 60% identity and do not show any deletions or insertions compared with the sequence of HIV-1lai Nef. We used the crystal structure of HIV-1NL4–3 Nef (16.Lee C.H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) in complex with the Fyn R96I mutant SH3 domain (Protein Data Bank code 1efn) as molecular template for the modelizations of SIVmac239 and HIV-2rod bound to the Fyn wild type SH3 domain, whereas the ligand-free molecules were modeled on the base of the unliganded HIV-1 Neflai crystal structure (17.Arold S. Franken P. Strub M.P. Hoh F. Benichou S. Benarous R. Dumas C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1avv). All side chains of conserved residues were frozen in their original conformation in Nef HIV-1. The optimal set of rotamers for the mutated residues was established by cluster analysis of an energy matrix as implemented in the SMD program (18.Tuffery P. Etchbest C. Hazeout S. Lavery R. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1991; 8: 1267-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The modeled complexes containing the new rotamers were then minimized with the AMBER package (19.Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Cadwell J.W. Ross W.S. Chaetham T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. AMBER. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar) in vacuo, utilizing a distance-dependent dielectric function ε = r, as an approximation of solvent screening. Energy minimizations were carried out under various constraints that were gradually released. After SMD and AMBER, the minimized Nef proteins showed an root mean square deviation for all atoms compared with the Protein Data Bank code 1efn (molecule D) of 0.85 and 0.79 Å for SIVmac239 and HIV-2rod models, respectively. Crystal structures of HIV-1 Nef-SH3 complexes (16.Lee C.H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) reveal that both the PXXP motif region (i.e. the amino acids that adopt a polyproline type II helix conformation upon binding to an SH3 domain) and tertiary contacts are involved in ligand binding. By analyzing the SH3 binding site of 710 nef alleles (620 HIV-1, 90 HIV-2/SIV) selected in the data base from the Los Alamos National laboratory (20.Korber B. Hahn B. Foley B. Mellors J.W. Leitner T. Myers G. McCutchan F. Kuiken C. Human Retrovirus and AIDS: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos, NM1997Google Scholar), we noticed the following. All amino acids involved in the Nef-SH3 interface (16.Lee C.H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17.Arold S. Franken P. Strub M.P. Hoh F. Benichou S. Benarous R. Dumas C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) can be clustered into two classes: one that is found conserved in all HIV/SIV Nef isolates, and the other that is systematically characteristic of either SIV/HIV-2 or HIV-1 isolates (Fig. 1), with only very rare exceptions that do not significantly alter the corresponding interface. The canonical PXXP motif region (residues 71–77 in HIV-1lai Nef, comprising Pro72-Xaa-Xaa-Pro75) is very well conserved in all Nef proteins. Only positions 71 and 73 show some variability. Position 71 is frequently an arginine, a lysine, or a threonine. This variation is already present in HIV-1 Nef isolates and has been shown not to significantly influence SH3 binding (4.Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 16.Lee C.H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17.Arold S. Franken P. Strub M.P. Hoh F. Benichou S. Benarous R. Dumas C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Position 73 is a glutamine in HIV-1 Nef and an arginine or lysine in SIV and HIV-2 Nef molecules. The Gln-73 side chain in HIV-1 Nef does not affect SH3 binding directly but contributes to anchor the PXXP motif region to residues 115 and 116 of the underlying core domain. In SIV and HIV-2, the substitution of Gln-73 by arginine or lysine is counterbalanced by the replacement of the opposite Tyr-115 by a glutamic acid, thus establishing an ion pairing interaction (data not shown). In conclusion, it is very unlikely that differences in SH3 targeting arise from the PXXP motif region of Nef. In contrast, systematic differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2/SIV Nef proteins were found within the SH3 binding site but sequentially noncontiguous with the PXXP motif. In detail, the following substitutions occur systematically in HIV-2/SIV Nef: M87(L/I), Y113W, L114(I/V), E117T, E118Q, and I120Y (Fig. 1). Because this region ofnef overlaps the 3′-long terminal repeat in all primate lentiviruses, we also examined the corresponding nucleotide sequences. Several synonymous substitutions were found in the Los Alamos Compendium (not shown), suggesting that the biological significance of these substitutions might be related to their role in binding SH3-containing proteins rather than a role in the U3 functionality. Computer-aided homology modeling of SIVmac239 and HIV-2rod Nef proteins and their complexes with SH3 domains (see “Experimental Procedures”) show that these amino acids are located on the border of a crevice in the surface of Nef (Figs.2 and 3). In both modeled and crystal structures (16.Lee C.H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17.Arold S.

Structure. 1997; 5: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) of the Nef-SH3 complexes, this crevice interacts with a key residue within the so-called RT-loop of the SH3 domain (Fig. 2). Interestingly, this SH3 residue is a critical component of the Nef-SH3 interface and plays a key role in determining the affinity and specificity of Src family SH3 domains for HIV-1 Nef (7.Lee C.H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In HIV-1 Nef, this “specificity pocket” formed between helices αA and αB is dominantly hydrophobic. SH3 domains that have a hydrophobic amino acid (isoleucine in Hck and Lyn SH3) at the position that interacts with this crevice of Nef consequently display a higher affinity for HIV-1 Nef than SH3 domains that have a charged residue there: arginine in Fyn and Src SH3 (7.Lee C.H.

Importantly, the amino acid substitutions found consistently in HIV-2/SIV Nef alleles diminish the hydrophobic character of this pocket and introduce negative charges (Fig. 3). As the hydrophobic pocket of HIV-1 Nef is determining its high affinity for Hck SH3 (K d = 200–600 nm) (7.Lee C.H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K.

The HIV-1lai and HIV-1sf2 Nef proteins associated firmly with Hck SH3 (Fig. 4). Consistent with previous reports (4.Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 10.Lang S.M. Iafrate A.J. Stahl-Hennig C. Kuhn E.M. Nisslein T. Kaup F.J. Haupt M. Hunsmann G. Skowronski J. Kirchhoff F. Nat.

Virol. 1998; 72: 5820-5830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the double mutant PXXP → AXXA has lost the ability to bind to Hck SH3 (Fig. 4). Using the same technique, we further showed that SIVmac239, SIVsmPBJ, and HIV-2rodNef proteins do not detectably interact with Hck SH3. The lack of high affinity for Hck SH3 was further confirmed for cell-derived SIVmac239 by SH3 affinity chromatography followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5 a).Figure 5Preferential interaction of SIV and HIV Nef with different Src family SH3 domains. SIV Nefmac239(a) and HIV-1 Neflai (b), expressed in transfected COS-7 cells, were incubated with agarose-coupled GST-SH3 fusion proteins, purified, and detected by immunoblotting with anti-Nef antibodies. 5% of the reaction input was loaded directly on the gel. Signal intensity of specific bands was determined by optical densitometry (peak area). c, the blot is identical to panel b but overexposed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next addressed the question of whether the introduction of charged residues in the specificity pocket of HIV-2/SIV Nef proteins could favor the interaction with Src SH3 domains that have a charged residue in the key position of their RT-loop. Toward that, we first modeled the complex formed between Fyn SH3 domain and HIV-2rod and SIVmac239 Nef molecules. In these model structures, rather than bending away from the hydrophobic pocket of HIV-1 Nef as seen in the crystal structure (17.Arold S. Franken P. Strub M.P. Hoh F. Benichou S. Benarous R. Dumas C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the Fyn R96 side chain points into the charged pocket of HIV-2/SIV Nef (Fig. 2). The guanidinium moiety is able to form a hydrogen bond with tyrosine 113, and its charge is counterbalanced by glutamic acid 117. Both, HIV-1 Gln-118 and HIV-2/SIV Glu-118 are able to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone of SH3 A95. The charge of Glu-118 may also play a role by contributing to long range electrostatic interactions prior to the association. In summary, our model studies predict a significantly higher affinity of SIV and HIV-2 Nef alleles for SH3 domains encoding for a positive charged residue at the key position within their RT-loop (e.g. Fyn and Src SH3 domains). According to our analysis, the key substitutions in SIV/HIV-2 Nef that should predominantly account for these changes in SH3 targeting are Y113W, E117T, and E118Q. We investigated this second hypothesis by probing the interaction between Fyn and Src SH3 domains and the Nef proteins of SIVmac239 and HIV-1lai. As a result, SIVmac239 Nef binds clearly to the SH3 domains of Fyn and Src (Fig. 5 a). However, it should be noted that the relative affinity of SIVmac239 Nef for both Fyn and Src SH3 is significantly lower than the affinity of HIV-1 Nef for Hck SH3 (Fig. 5,a and b). This may be explained by the difference in flexibility of the RT-loop of these SH3 domains in their free state (8.Arold S. O'Brien R. Franken P. Hoh F. Strub M.P. Dumas C. Ladbury J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14683-14691Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The binding to HIV-1 Nef requires breaking of fewer hydrogen bonds in the RT-loop of the Hck SH3 domain than in the RT-loop of Src or Fyn SH3 domains. Among Src family kinase, the Hck SH3 domain is therefore intrinsically a better ligand for Nef than Src or Fyn SH3 domains. To finally test whether the observed differences in SH3 targeting is effectively because of the triple amino acid substitutions identified in the specificity pocket of Nef, we probed the interaction of an HIV-1-like SIVmac239 Nef mutant with Src family SH3 domains. A Y113W/E117T/E118Q triple mutant was generated and tested in SH3 affinity chromatography and immunoblotting experiments (Fig.6). This mutant expressed a stable protein in transfected cells and exhibited a high affinity for Hck SH3 domain while keeping Fyn SH3 relative affinity unchanged as compared with the wild-type nef SIVmac239-encoded product. We next investigated whether these substitutions would have equally significant functional implications in vivo. Similarly to HIV-1 Nef, when co-expressed with Hck, the Y113W/E117T/E118Q triple mutant formed stable complexes with the kinase in transfected cells, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7). This contrasted to the wild-type nef SIVmac239-encoded product which failed to form such complexes, despite similar efficiency in Hck immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7). We concluded that the switch in affinity is dominantly mediated by the above mentioned three amino acids.Figure 7The Y113W/E117T/E118Q substitutions allow SIVmac239 Nef binding to full-length Hckin vivo. C-terminal HA-tagged HIV-1lai Nef, SIVmac239 Nef, and Y113W/E117T/E118Q SIVmac239 Nef mutant constructs were transfected in COS-7 cells together with Hck encoding plasmid. Transfected cells were lysed in detergent buffer and incubated with anti-Hck polyclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed, and associated Nef protein was visualized by anti-HA immunoblotting (top panel). Control blots show immunoblotting of the same membrane with the anti-Hck antibody, after stripping, and immunoblotting of total cell lysates (5% total input) to demonstrate similar expression of the HA-tagged Nef proteins and of Hck in the differently transfected cells (lower three panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our experiments establish that SIV/HIV-2 and HIV-1 Nef proteins target different Src family SH3 domains. The specific discrimination between SH3 domains is achieved by a mechanism that is independent from the canonical PXXP motif. This selection mechanism is based on the match or mismatch of three residues of Nef forming a “pocket” for a key residue within the RT-loop of the Src family SH3 domains (Figs. 2 and 3). It is intriguing that the triple mutant SIVmac239WTQ still seems to have a lower relative affinity for Hck SH3 as compared with HIV-1 Nef in our GST pull-down experiments. Correspondingly, the overexposure of the immunoblots for HIV-1 Nef-SH3 binding reveal differences in the relative affinity of HIV-1 Nef for Src or Fyn SH3. We previously observed by isothermal titration calorimetry that the thermodynamic parameters for SH3 binding to the Nef core domain are different from those obtained for binding to full-length Nef (8.Arold S. O'Brien R. Franken P. Hoh F. Strub M.P. Dumas C. Ladbury J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14683-14691Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The presence of the N terminus increased the affinity for Hck SH3 by a factor of three and did not affect the affinity for Src SH3 (8.Arold S. O'Brien R. Franken P. Hoh F. Strub M.P. Dumas C. Ladbury J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14683-14691Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our results presented here may indicate that the N terminus of SIV Nef either contributes differently to SH3 binding than in HIV-1 Nef, or, more likely, does not contribute at all. The latter is consistent with the observation that the affinity of SIVmac239 Nef for Src and Fyn SH3 is comparable. The absence of an Hck SH3-specific affinity enhancement by the N-terminal of SIVmac239 Nef would explain why the triple-mutant SIVmac239 WTQ239 still binds to Hck SH3 with a lower affinity than in HIV-1 Nef. It is unclear from where such differences may arise, as the SIV and HIV-1 N termini are different in both sequence and length. One possibility may be that the anchor between HIV-1 W57 (HIV-1lai numbering) and the Nef core domain (22.Grzesiek S. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23.Grzesiek S. Bax A. Hu J.S. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Stahl S.J. Tjandra N. Wingfield P.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1248-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) is not established in SIV and HIV-2 Nef, as these lack a bulky hydrophobic residue corresponding to HIV-1 Trp-57. The contact between Trp-57 and the core domain of HIV-1 Nef may play a role in pre-orientating the PXXP region for association with SH3 domains. Pre-orientating the PXXP region may decrease the entropic cost of fixing it in the Nef-SH3 interface and, in addition, may result in an SH3 binding epitope more adapted for Hck SH3 than other Src family SH3 domains. Further studies should focus on the precise comparison of affinities determined by titration microcalorimetry and will undoubtedly help to decipher these mechanisms. It recently emerged that major activities assigned to Nef in T cells, regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, interaction with the Nef associated kinase (NAK), and down-regulation of cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules through endocytosis induction require an intact Nef:SH3 interface (11.Khan I.H.

Virology. 1998; 250: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Src kinase family members would be attractive candidates for mediating these activities, yet their role in Nef functions remains to establish. Intriguingly, Hck and Lyn, the high affinity targets for HIV-1 Nef, are not expressed in T cells. However, Hck could mediate the action of Nef in macrophages. In contrast, Src is ubiquitous and Fyn and Lck play important roles in TCR-mediated signaling in T lymphocytes (28.Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It is unclear to date whether the clearly weaker interaction of HIV-1 Nef with the SH3 domains of Lck, Fyn, and Src (or possibly other Src family members) is sufficient to render these interactions significant in vivo. Weak interactions with SH3 domains of these kinases could be reinforced by additional contacts between Nef and other domains of these kinases, or by ternary complexes with other molecules. Both have been suggested in the case of Lck (12.Collette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. Harris M. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6333-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29.Baur A.S. Sass G. Laffert B. Willbold D. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1997; 6: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Of interest, the SIV Nef WTQ mutant appears to co-precipitate more efficiently with full-length Hck than HIV-1 Nef in vivo, suggesting some additional mechanisms of binding such as through its SH2 domain. Indeed, although a strong selective pressure was noted in vivo to restore an experimentally disrupted proline motif in SIV Nef (11.Khan I.H. Sawai E.T. Antonio E. Weber C.J. Mandell C.P. Montbriand P. Luciw P.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5820-5830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this motif appears dispensable for Src binding in intact cells (10.Lang S.M. Iafrate A.J. Stahl-Hennig C. Kuhn E.M. Nisslein T. Kaup F.J. Haupt M. Hunsmann G. Skowronski J. Kirchhoff F. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is in strike contrast to HIV-Nef binding to Hck which requires an intact proline motif (30.Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson Smithgall M.T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Further, conversely to HIV-1 Nef, SIV Nef contains a putative tyrosine-based SH2-interacting motif (31.Du Z.J. Lang S.M. Sasseville V.G. Lackner A.A. Ilyinskii P.O. Daniel M.D. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 665-6744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and indeed can interact with either Hck or Lck SH2 domains (32.Greenway A.L. Dutartre H. Allen K. McPhee D.A. Olive D. Collette Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6152-6158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That HIV-1 and SIV/HIV-2 have evolved in parallel to target Src family members, yet through distinct mechanisms of binding, highlights the importance to elucidate the role of these cellular kinases in the primate lentiviruses replicative cycle. Elucidation of incongruences in functional aspects between SIV and HIV-1 Nef molecules is indispensable for the use of SIV Nef as a model for drug design. As an alternative to mutational analysis in the proline motif (4.Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 10.Lang S.M. Iafrate A.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2777-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), we now propose to design mutations that selectively inactivate specific Nef functions to assess their effect on viral replication and pathogenesisin vivo. The striking similarity between the modes of interaction of SH3 domains with Nef and with peptide ligands leads us to propose that the viral Nef protein engages in molecular mimicry, having incorporated a motif derived from cellular proteins. A similar pocket may therefore be a common feature for SH3 recognition by their natural ligands. This hypothesis is also supported by mutational studies that reveal the importance of the SH3 key residues for ligand recognition (33.Erpel T. Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 963-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, Craiget al. (Craig, H. M., Pandori, M. W., Riggs, N. L., Richman, D.

https://openalex.org/W2038877872,"In the course of screening a λgt11 human leukemic T-cell cDNA expression library with an antibody specific to the mitotic target of Src, Sam68, we identified and cloned a cDNA encoding a novel protein with a predicted molecular mass of 51.4 kDa. Polyclonal antibodies raised to a His6-tagged construct of this protein, detected a ∼67-kDa protein in immunoprecipitation experiments, and cytological studies showed that this protein localized to the Golgi complex, through colocalization experiments with specific Golgi markers. Therefore, we designated this protein golgin-67. Sequence analysis revealed that golgin-67 is a highly coiled-coil protein, with potential Cdc2 and Src kinase phosphorylation motifs. It has sequence homologies to other Golgi proteins, including the coatamer complex I vesicle docking protein, GM130. Structurally, golgin-67 resembles, golgin-84, an integral membrane Golgi protein with an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a single C-terminal transmembrane domain. The C-terminal region of golgin-67, which contains a predicted transmembrane domain, was demonstrated to be essential for its Golgi localization."

Our recent efforts have been aimed at understanding the ability of Met to initiate primary tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level, and toward that end, we have identified several genes whose expression is regulated by Met action. Many of these genes encode extracellular matrix proteins or enzymes that degrade these proteins, and this underscores the profound effect that Met action has on the extracellular environment of the cell. For instance, Met not only decreases production of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, but it dramatically decreases cell surface integrin expression, thereby limiting interaction with matrix proteins 2G. A. Taylor and G. F. Vande Woude, unpublished data. (10.Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Webb C.P. Koo H.-M. Anvre M. Sekiguchi K. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, Met signaling increases production of proteases, such as urokinase, that degrade the extracellular matrix, (2.Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) whereas Met signaling reduces the expression of tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases, which are inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteases that degrade the extracellular matrix (11.Koochekpour S.

In the studies described here we used differential display screening to identify other genes that may be important in Met-mediated tumorigenesis. We found a new Met-HGF/SF-regulated mRNA, P311 (12.Studler J.-M. Glowunski J. Levi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), that was down-regulated by Met signaling in several types of transformed cells. We found that this mRNA encoded a relatively small intracellular protein that was targeted for degradation by multiple proteolytic pathways including the ubiquitin/proteasome, resulting in an extremely short protein half-life. Therefore, expression of the P311 gene was under tight regulation by several mechanisms that regulate cellular growth.

HCN-1A and HCN-2 were induced to differentiate by exposure to 25 ng/ml neural growth factor (NGF) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5 mm dibutyrl cAMP (Sigma), and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 3 days. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells using a standard acidic phenol extraction procedure (13.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). 15-μg RNA samples were separated on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and used for Northern blot analysis as described previously (14.Stumpo D.J. Graff J.M. Albert K.A. Greengard P. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4012-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with a 32P-labeled fragment of the 3′-untranslated region of the mouse P311 cDNA that was isolated by differential display screening (see below) or with a 1.2-kilobase pairPstI fragment of pHcGAP, a human glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase plasmid (15.Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.-h. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Probes were also generated from the human P311 cDNA protein coding region using polymerase chain reactions and appropriate primers, and their hybridization patterns were essentially identical to those of the differential display P311 fragment probe. Total RNA was isolated from SK-LMS or SK-LMS/HGF cells and used for differential display screening with the RNAimage kit 1 (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer. One cDNA fragment isolated using primers H-T11A and H-AP2 corresponded to a 280-nucleotide fragment of the 3′ end of the human P311 cDNA (GenBank™ U30521). Using appropriate primers, SK-LMS cDNA, and polymerase chain reactions, the human P311 cDNA coding region was cloned into the pRcCMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) expression vector. The FLAG epitope tag, DYKDDDDK, was cloned onto the 5′ or 3′ edge of this cDNA fragment by inserting sequences coding those amino acids into the polymerase chain reaction primers. The plasmids were transfected into cells using the SuperFect kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The immunoprecipitation protocol has previously been described in detail (16.Taylor G.A. Jeffers M. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Vande Woude G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20399-20405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 60-mm plates, grown to confluence, and labeled in Cys/Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) and 0.5 mCi [35S]-EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products). Cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.), or rabbit polyclonal anti-P311 antisera raised against the peptide CGSSELRSPRISYLHFF, corresponding to the human P311 C-terminal sequence. Precipitated proteins were resolved by 10% tricine gel electrophoresis, and the resulting gels were used for autoradiography. In some experiments the cells were exposed to 10 μm lactacystin (Boston Biochem, Boston, MA), 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.68 μg/ml pepstatin A, 24 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml (1.26 mm) o-phenanthroline, or 1.26 mm 4,7-phenanthroline prior to and during the labeling period. NHA were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated, four-well glass chamber slides (12–550-51 SuperCell culture slides; Fisher) until they reached about 50% confluency. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and blocked with 10% goat serum (v/v), 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The cells were then incubated for 60 min with 1:50 dilutions of a polyclonal anti-C-terminal P311 antibody (see “Immunoprecipitation”) or a polyclonal P311 antibody that recognized the internal sequence KGRLPVPKEVNRKK. In some experiments the cells were costained with 1:400 dilutions of a mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma). Finally, the cells were incubated for 30 min with 1:100 dilutions of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and/or a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were observed and images were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM310 confocal laser scanning microscope; it was configured with a 25-milliwatt argon internal HeNe laser. Nomarski images were made using the 543 laser and appropriate polarizer lenses. Nude mouse protocols have previously been described in detail (2.Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). 106 cells were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice that were monitored daily for tumor growth. To identify genes regulated by Met-HGF/SF signaling we used differential display screening to compare cDNAs from a cell line with low Met-HGF/SF signaling to the same cells engineered to have high signaling. The cells we chose were SK-LMS cells, which were originally derived from a human leiomeiosarcoma; we have shown previously that they express high levels of Met but virtually no HGF/SF and in nude mouse tumor assays, that they are non-metastatic and only weakly tumorigenic (2.Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, when they stably express exogenous HGF/SF, generating an autocrine loop, the cells become metastatic and much more tumorigenic, decreasing the tumor latency period from 10 to 5 weeks (2.Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified a differentially displayed cDNA fragment that was present at moderately high levels in parental SK-LMS cells and at substantially lower levels in a pool of SK-LMS/HGF cells (data not shown); we subsequently verified this result using the fragment as a probe for a Northern blot (Fig.1). Cloning and sequencing revealed that the cDNA fragment corresponded to 280 nucleotides from the 3′-untranslated region of P311, a cDNA whose mouse homolog is highly expressed in late-stage embryonic brain and adult cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb but for which no function has been described (12.Studler J.-M. Glowunski J. Levi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The effect of HGF/SF in decreasing P311 expression in SK-LMS cells required constitutive exposure to the cytokine, in that exposure of parental SK-LMS cells to a single dose of HGF/SF did not appreciably lower P311 mRNA levels (data not shown). Because SK-LMS cells are transformed smooth muscle cells we also examined P311 expression in normal human intestinal smooth muscle cells, in which we found extremely high P311 mRNA levels (Fig. 1), suggesting a progressive decrease in P311 expression in increasingly more transformed smooth muscle cells. We also measured P311 levels in tumors derived from SK-LMS and SK-LMS/HGF cells (Fig. 2). The moderately high P311 expression in the parental cells was decreased to very low levels in two tumor explants of these cells (Fig. 2), an effect that may be partially explained by increased Met-HGF/SF signaling in the tumor cells that we have demonstrated previously (2.Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In tumor explants from SK-LMS/HGF cells, P311 levels remained very low (Fig. 2). Therefore, low P311 expression correlated with increased Met-HGF/SF signaling and tumorigenic growth of SK-LMS cells. Next we examined other cells for the effect of Met-HGF/SF on P311 expression. Because P311 is expressed at its highest levels in brain (12.Studler J.-M. Glowunski J. Levi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) we measured mRNA levels in NHA and in several glioma cell lines that express high levels of both Met and HGF/SF; autocrine Met-HGF/SF signaling in these gliomas is thought to contribute to their transformation (8.Koochekpour S. Jeffers M. Rulong S. Klineberg E. Taylor G. Hudson E.A. Resua J.H. Vande Woude G.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5391-5398PubMed Google Scholar). We found extremely high P311 expression in NHA cells (Fig.3) at levels comparable with those in normal smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1 and data not shown), whereas each of the glioma cell lines had much lower expression (Fig. 3). In the case of U118 glioma cells the low P311 expression was due, at least in part, to Met-HGF/SF action, because addition of a neutralizing HGF/SF antibody to the cell's culture medium increased P311 mRNA levels (data not shown). We also examined whether terminal differentiation of normal neural cells resulted in loss of P311 expression just as transformation of neural cells did. For these experiments we used HCN-1A and HCN-2 cells; these are human cerebral cortical pre-neuronal cell lines that can be induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells by exposure to NGF (17.Ronnett G.V. Hester L.D. Nye J.S. Snyder S.H. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 1081-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both HCN-1A and HCN-2 cells expressed very high levels of P311 mRNA similar to those in NHA, but these levels were decreased when the cells were induced to differentiate by NGF treatment (Fig.4). Therefore, differentiation, as well as transformation, of neural cells resulted in loss of P311 expression. Prior to the studies described here the P311 protein product had not been identified, and in fact it was unclear whether the mRNA was translated in vivo (12.Studler J.-M. Glowunski J. Levi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The human P311 cDNA contains three open reading frames, but only the first reading frame, which encodes a 68-amino acid polypeptide, is conserved among the human, mouse, and chicken P311 cDNAs (12.Studler J.-M. Glowunski J. Levi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, to begin our studies of the protein we generated P311 expression vectors in which this putative protein coding sequence was linked to a FLAG epitope tag at either its N or C terminus. After transient expression of these vectors in COS-7 cells we were able to detect FLAG-P311 and P311-FLAG protein by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.5). However, detection of the protein was only possible if the cells were radiolabeled for very short periods of time (5–10 min); longer labeling times resulting in backgrounds too high to distinguish the 8-kDa band. This suggested that the protein was unstable, and we confirmed this in a pulse-chase experiment in which we found FLAG-P311 to decay with a half-life of about 5 min (Fig.6).Figure 6Rapid decay of FLAG-P311 protein. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a vector expressing FLAG-P311 protein. 24 h later the cells were pulse-labeled for 8 min with [35S]Met/Cys and then exposed to unlabeled amino acids for the indicated times. Lysates from the cells were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies. The precipitated proteins were resolved by 10% tricine gel electrophoresis. The positions of selected molecular mass markers are shown on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Extremely rapid decay of P311 protein suggested that it may be targeted by a specific intracellular proteolysis system. One such system is the ubiquitin/proteasome system, which degrades proteins with PEST domains by covalently linking ubiquitin to lysine residues of the protein, thereby allowing recognition and degradation of the protein by the proteasome (for review see Ref. 18.Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Because P311 contains PEST domains as well as lysine residues we examined it for proteasome-mediated degradation by conducting a pulse-chase experiment in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (19.Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Destree A.T. Grenier L. McCormack T.A. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Palombella V.J. Parent L.A. Plamondon L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) (Fig.7). In the presence of this inhibitor essentially no degradation of FLAG-P311 took place during the 30-min period of the experiment (Fig. 7) demonstrating that FLAG-P311 was targeted by the proteasome system. Next we examined expression of wild-type P311 that lacked a FLAG epitope tag. Two polyclonal antisera were raised against P311, one that recognized an internal sequence and another a C-terminal sequence. Both of them were able to immunoprecipitate the 8-kDa P311 band from NHA lysates, and this band was seen only in cell lysates and not in conditioned media (data not shown). We assessed the stability of wild-type P311 in a pulse-chase experiment following transient expression of wild-type P311 in COS-7 cells, and, as expected, it decayed very rapidly with a half-life of about 5 min (Fig.8 and data not shown). Surprisingly, however, lactacystin did not block decay of the protein (Fig. 8), demonstrating that some other protease that had not been active against FLAG-P311 degraded wild-type P311. To determine the nature of this protease we performed pulse-chase experiments in which cells were treated with lactacystin in combination with a series of protease inhibitors including o-phenanthroline, pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Only the combination of lactacystin and the metalloprotease inhibitor, o-phenanthroline, was able to block degradation of P311 (Fig. 8 and data not shown). In contrast, a combination of lactacystin and 4,7-phenanthroline, a non-chelating analog of o-phenanthroline, did not block degradation, implying that the ability of o-phenanthroline to inhibit P311 degradation required its chelating capacity. Taken together, these data suggested that P311 was subject to rapid degradation by both the ubiquitin/proteasome system and an unknown metalloprotease. The reason that the addition of the FLAG epitope to P311 blocked degradation by the metalloprotease was not determined. In other experiments we found that endogenous P311 in normal human smooth muscle cells also had a very short half-life and that its degradation also could be blocked by the lactacystin/o-phenanthroline combination (data not shown). In all of the experiments in which cells were exposed to lactacystin and o-phenanthroline we detected a slightly smaller band (Fig. 8), similar in size to a band precipitated from P311in vitro translations (Fig. 5). This band may result from translation initiation from an internal ATG at codon 21 (12.Studler J.-M. Glowunski J. Levi-Strauss M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 614-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We examined the subcellular localization of endogenous P311 by immunocytochemistry of normal human astrocytes. Two different antisera that recognized distinct P311 regions showed similar patterns, with staining of nucleoli in all cells and staining of focal adhesions in some cells (Fig. 9 C and data not shown). Focal adhesion staining occurred only along the leading edge of cells with an obvious motile morphology. Simultaneous staining with monoclonal antibodies recognizing the focal adhesion protein, vinculin (20.Geiger B. Tokuyasu K.T. Dutton A.H. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4127-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), showed colocalization of P311 and vinculin in the focal adhesions (Fig. 9 C). In related biochemical experiments we fractionated pulse-labeled cells into nuclear and cytosolic fractions and used each fraction for P311 immunoprecipitation. Again, P311 was present in both fractions with slightly higher levels in the cytosol (data not shown). To determine whether overexpression of P311 had a direct effect on the tumorigenicity of U118 cells we stably transfected them with the P311-FLAG expression vector. A pool of cells that expressed high levels of P311-FLAG mRNA (data not shown) was injected subcutaneously into nude mice along with the parental U118 cells. Within about 4 weeks both groups of cells formed palpable tumors that slowly increased in size at about equal rates (not shown). At 10 weeks we isolated the tumors and found that exogenous P311-FLAG expression remained high, at levels comparable with those of the input pool of cells (not shown). Therefore, P311 overexpression did not interfere with the tumorigenic growth of U118 cells. We have shown that P311 expression is tightly regulated at several levels by mechanisms that control cellular growth and transformation. At the mRNA level we found that P311 expression was reduced substantially in both smooth muscle and neural cells transformed by coexpression of Met and its ligand, HGF/SF. Signaling through Met initiates transformation of a wide variety of mesenchymal and epithelial cells (1.Jeffers M. Rong S. Vande Woude G.F. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but the down-stream molecular pathways that are important in their transformation have not been completely delineated. Regulation of P311 expression is thus a novel pathway that could be of importance for Met-induced tumor growth. Overexpression of P311 in U118 glioma cells, in which Met-HGF/SF signaling is active, did not interfere with tumorigenic growth, implying that P311 does not have a dominant tumor suppressor function in that context. However, the strong correlation between loss of P311 expression and tumorigenesis suggests that low P311 could be a contributing factor to tumorigenesis. In addition, P311 may be a useful marker for distinguishing between normal and transformed smooth muscle or neural tissue. We also found that P311 expression was controlled at the level of protein stability. In both smooth muscle and neural cells the protein had a half-life of 5 min or less, with the rapid degradation being directed by two pathways: the ubiquitin/proteasome system and a metalloprotease whose identity we have not determined. Ubiquitin is a 76-residue protein that is covalently linked to lysines of proteins with PEST sequences, thereby tagging the proteins for degradation by the proteasome (18.Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This pathway is thought to regulate major biological processes including the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, and neural function (18.Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). For instance, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is subject to ubiquitin-proteasome degradation as a result of its association with mdm2, and this profoundly influences p53 function and consequently, cellular growth (21.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2847) Google Scholar, 22.Crook T. Ludwig R.L. Marston N.J. Willkomm D. Vousden K.H. Virology. 1996; 217: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A second protein subject to rapid turnover by the proteasome is p35, a neuronal-specific activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, that drives neuronal migration and development of the mammalian cortex (23.Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Thus, P311 represents another protein that has links to neural function and cellular transformation/differentiation and that is turned over rapidly by the proteasome. Although our studies propose the involvement of P311 in cellular growth and differentiation, the function of the protein remains unknown. The primary amino acid sequence of P311 is apparently novel among proteins in the current data bases and thus suggests no function. In the immunostaining experiments the protein was present in both the nucleus and the cytosol. The nuclear localization was found in all cells, but the cytosolic localization occurred only in those cells with a motile morphology, with the protein concentrated along the periphery of the cells in focal adhesions. This suggests that the protein could be involved in the processes of gene expression or cellular motility or could possibly form a link between the two. The apparent increase in P311 concentrations in motile cells may represent another level at which its expression is regulated. It may also explain why the overall concentration of P311 in a population of cells seems to be quite low and precluded attempts to detect the protein by Western blotting. Based on our studies, future work should address the potential roles of P311 in cellular differentiation, transformation, and motility.

Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation demonstrated that a short sequence element within the cytoplasmic tail of human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B was sufficient to translocate the membrane protein CD8 to the inner nuclear membrane.

While the outer nuclear membrane shares the membrane proteins of the RER, the INM contains a distinct set of integral proteins (4.Rolls M.M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), including the lamin B receptor (LBR) (5.Worman H.J. Yuan J. Blobel G. Georgatos S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In cells that are virus-infected, the various cellular membranes are decorated with specific viral proteins in addition. In the case of herpesviruses that undergo a characteristic nuclear phase of maturation, viral transmembrane glycoproteins are also translocated from the site of their synthesis into the INM, e.g. the glycoprotein B (gB) homologues of Epstein-Barr virus (8.Gong M. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Qualtiere L.F. Pearson G.R. Int. J.

Virology. 1990; 177: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The specific localization in the INM not only suggests a role of these proteins in herpesvirus envelopment at the inner nuclear membrane (12.Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2231-2295Google Scholar) but also implies that specific mechanisms mediate their transport from the RER to the INM compartment. It is currently not precisely known how this apparently specific targeting of cellular and viral transmembrane proteins is achieved. For soluble proteins, there is clear evidence that nuclear transport depends on specific sequence motifs, e.g. the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the SV40 T antigen (13.Kalderon D.

Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Such signal sequences have been successfully used fore.g. nuclear targeting of reporter proteins. This observation raised the question of whether comparable signal sequences might exist to target transmembrane proteins to the INM. In previous reports, this aspect was studied for the cellular INM integral proteins LBR and LAP2 as well as the gB homologues of HSV-1 and HCMV. In the case of LBR, two nonoverlapping INM targeting signals have been identified (16.Smith S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Soullam B.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); i.e. the nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domain as well as the first transmembrane segment appeared to confer nuclear translocation. In the case of LAP2, a type II integral membrane protein, the domain required for targeting to the INM has been restricted to 76 amino-terminal amino acids (19.Furukawa K. Fritze C.E. Gerace L. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For HSV-1 gB, it has been suggested that an INM localization signal resides in the membrane anchor domain (21.Gilbert R. Ghosh K. Rasile L. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2272-2285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Rasile L. Ghosh K. Raviprakash K. Ghosh H.P. J.

Our previous experiments have shown that in the case of HCMV gB, the nucleoplasmic COOH-terminal 51 amino acids are essential for targeting to the INM (24.Bogner E. Anheier B. Offner F. Smuda C. Reschke M. Eickmann M. Radsak K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We then asked if a specific signal within this domain might function in a modular fashion to mediate localization of a reporter protein to the INM and also what are the specific sequence requirements for such a function. Further experiments were performed to answer the question of signal conservation between the gB homologues of different herpesviruses. Experimental evidence is presented in this study that a short sequence element (amino acids 865–906) within the cytoplasmic tail of HCMV gB exhibits the specific potential to localize the type 1 transmembrane protein CD8 used as a reporter into the INM. This signal sequence had no detectable NLS activity for a soluble reporter protein and could not be replaced by the NLS of SV40 T antigen. A comparable element was identified in HSV-1 gB. The sequence sufficient for INM localization of the reporter molecule was further restricted to a minimum of only six amino acids. These findings strongly support the concept of a novel short and modular signal sequence that mediates transport of transmembrane proteins to the INM compartment. Unless otherwise indicated, routine chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Enzymes for DNA cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Roche Molecular Biochemicals; media and reagents for cell culture were from Seromed (Berlin, Germany).

Other plasmids for protein expression in transfected cells were designed as described below. To produce cDNA inserts for cloning, PCR was performed using the GeneAmp Kit (Perkin-Elmer). Parameters for PCR were denaturation for 30 s at 96 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C; a total of 35 cycles were followed by 7 min at 72 °C for final extension. Custom oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG-Biotech GmbH (Ebersberg, Germany). Unless otherwise indicated, standard methods (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for DNA purification, restriction endonuclease digestion, DNA ligation, bacterial transformation, and preparation of plasmid DNA. All recombinant plasmids were analyzed by restriction analysis. Plasmids in which PCR was used to generate coding sequences were also analyzed by DNA sequencing performed on a model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Plasmids encoding CD8/HCMVgB and CD8/HSV-1gB chimeras were constructed using pCMUIV-CD8/E19. For the chimeras CD8/HCMVgB-CT, CD8/HCMVgB-CTΔ865–906, CD8/HCMVgB 865–906, CD8/HSVgB-CT, CD8/HSVgB 868–904, CD8/HSVgB-CTΔ868–904, CD8/HSVgB 797–831, and CD8/HSVgB 832–867, plasmid pCMUIV-CD8/E19 was digested with XbaI andBamHI, and the desired cDNA inserts were inserted between these restriction endonuclease sites. The following pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides forming an upstreamXbaI and a downstream BamHI restriction site (each underlined) and encoding specific internal amino acid sequences of HCMV gB (template for PCR: pRC/CMV-gB) or HSV-1 gB (template for PCR: pCDNA3-HSV gB) were used: 5′-GCTCTAGAACTCGACAGCGGCGT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGACGTTCTCTTCTTC-3′ for CD8/HCMVgB-CT, 5′-GCTCTAGAACTCGACAGCGGCGT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAACCGTTCTGCTGCGC-3′ for CD8/HCMVgB-CTΔ865–906, 5′-GCTCTAGAACAGATTCTTTGGACGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGACGTTCTCTTCTTC-3′ for CD8/HCMVgB 865–906, 5′-GCTCTAGACGCTACGTCATGCGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCACAGGTCGTCCTCGTCG-3′ for CD8/HSVgB-CT, 5′-GCTCTAGATCTACGAGCGCGCTGCTC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCACAGGTCGTCCTCGTCG-3′ for CD8/HSVgB 868–904, 5′-GCTCTAGACGCTACGTCATGCGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGCCCTTCTTCTTGGC-3′ for CD8/HSVgB-CTΔ868–904, 5′-GCTCTAGACGCTACGTCATGCGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCACTCCTCGCCCTC-3′ for CD8/HSVgB 797–831, 5′-GCTCTAGATCTGGCGGCGACTTTGACGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGCCCTTCTTCTTGGC-3′ for CD8/HSVgB 832–867. For the chimeras CD8/HCMVgB-TM and CD8/HSVgB-TM, plasmid pCMUIV-CD8/E19 was digested with XbaI and BamHI, and an insert encoding the COOH terminus of CD8 generated with the following pair of oligonucleotides (template for PCR: pCMUIV-CD8) was inserted between these restriction sites: 5′-GCTCTAGAAGGAACCGAAGACCTGTTTGC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′. Subsequently, the generated plasmid was digested withEcoRV and XbaI, and inserts encoding the membrane anchor of HCMV gB or HSV-1 gB were inserted, respectively. The following oligonucleotides that form an upstream SmaI and a downstream XbaI restriction site (each underlined) were used: 5′-TCCCCCGGGTTCGGAGCCTTCACCATC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCTATAGATCAAATAAGTG-3′ for CD8/HCMVgB-TM, 5′-TCCCCCGGGCCCTTTGGGGCGCTGGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCTAAAGGCGAAGAAAGCCGCC-3′ for CD8/HSVgB-TM. For the generation of the plasmid encoding β-galactosidase/HCMVgB 865–906, the plasmid pCDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His/lacZ (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was digested with BamHI and HindIII, and an insert encoding the residues 865–906 of HCMV gB (template for PCR: pRC/CMV-gB) was inserted between these restriction sites. The following pair of oligonucleotides was used: 5′-CGGGATCCACAGATTCTTTGGACG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCAGACGTTCTCTTC-3′. To construct the plasmid encoding HCMVgB-Δ865–906-NLS SV40 T antigen, the plasmid pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) was digested with BamHI and XbaI. An insert generated with the following oligonucleotides from the template pRC/CMV-gB was inserted in the digested plasmid: 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAATCCAGGATCTGGTGCC-3′ and 5′-CTCTAGATCAGAGGACCTTGCGCTTTTTCTTGGGTGGACCGTTCTGCTGCGCTCGC-3′. To generate the plasmid encoding HCMVgB 885D-A, 886R-A, 889H-E, and 890R-E, the GeneEditor TM in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as recommended by the supplier. The following oligonucleotide was used: 5′-GCCTAACCTGCTAGCCGCCCTGCGAGAAGAGAAAAACGGCTAC-3′. To construct the plasmid encoding CD8/HCMV gB 865–906 885D-A, 886R-A, 889H-E, and 890R-E, plasmid pCMUIV-CD8/E19 was digested with XbaI and BamHI. Between these restriction endonuclease sites, an insert generated with the following oligonucleotides was inserted: 5′-GCTCTAGAACAGATTCTTTGGACGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGACGTTCTCTTCTTC-3′. The plasmid encoding HCMVgB 885D-A, 886R-A, 889H-E, and 890R-E was used as a template. For generation of the constructs encoding CD8/DRLRHR, CD8/ARLRHR, CD8/DALRHR, CD8/DRARHR, CD8/DRLAHR, CD8/DRLRAR, and CD8/DRLRHA, the plasmid pCMUIV-CD8/E19 was digested with XbaI and BamHI, and the desired DNA fragments were inserted. The sense oligonucleotide 5′-GCTCTAGAAACCGAAGACCTGTTTGC-3′ was used with the following antisense oligonucleotides in a PCR with the template pCMUIV-CD8, respectively: 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGCGATGTCGCAGCCGGTCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′ for CD8/DRLRHR, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGCGATGTCGCAGCCGTGCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′ for CD8/ARLRHR, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGCGATGTCGCAGTGCGTCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′ for CD8/ DALRHR, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGCGATGTCGTGCCCGGTCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′ for CD8/DRARHR, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGCGATGTGCCAGCCGGTCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′ for CD8/DRLAHR, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAGCGTGCTCGCAGCCGGTCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′ for CD8/DRLRAR, 5′-CGGGATCCTTATGCATGTCGCAGCCGGTCGACGTATCTCGCCGAAAGG-3′ for CD8/DRLRHA. COS7 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were transfected at 60% confluency with DNA using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) as recommended by the supplier. Analysis was carried out at 48 h after transfection by immunofluorescence on cells grown in Petri dishes of 60-mm diameter with glass coverslips and by cell fractionation with cells grown in Petri dishes of 145-mm diameter. Transfection efficiencies were determined to range between 30 and 40% by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies specific for the expression products. Cells or isolated nuclei were washed with PBS after each step of fixation and antibody incubation. Transfected cells on coverslips as well as air-dried nuclei on glass slides were fixed with acetone at −20 °C for 15 min. Fixed samples were incubated for 30 min with one of the following primary antibodies: HCMV gB-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 27-156 (29.Spaete R.R. Thayer R.M. Probert W.S. Masiarz F.R. Chamberlain S.H. Rasmussen L. Merigan T.C. Pachl C. Virology. 1988; 167: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), HSV-1 gB-specific mAb 2c (30.Eis-Hübinger A.M. Mohr K. Schneweis K.E. Intervirology. 1991; 32: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), CD8-specific mAb OKT8 (31.Hoffman R.A. Kung P.C. Hansen W.P. Goldstein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4914-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), or β-galactosidase-specific mAb (Promega), followed by a 30-min incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:40 diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS; Dakopatts, Hamburg, Germany). Preparations were evaluated with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with automatic camera equipment (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Transfected COS7 cells in 145-mm diameter Petri dishes (3 × 106 cells) were washed with PBS and refed with 10 ml of culture medium lacking methionine for 1 h. Radiolabeling was carried out with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (specific activity of 1,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany)/ml of methionine-free culture medium for 3 h. All buffers used for cell fractionation contained 100 units of trasylol/ml and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell cultures were washed twice with cold PBS, harvested by scraping into cold PBS, and collected by sedimentation (1,000 × gfor 5 min). Cell pellets were resedimented in hypotonic buffer (TKM; 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C for 5 min prior to the addition of 1 ml of TKM containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (23.Raviprakash K. Rasile L. Ghosh K. Ghosh H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1777-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated with occasional vortexing for 5 min on ice. After incubation, an aliquot of 200 μl was saved (homogenate fraction). Nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant fraction was used as the postnuclear fraction. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in TKM containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm NaCl and resedimented at 2,100 × g for 15 min through a 3-ml cushion of 1.62 m sucrose in TKM. The pelleted nuclei were washed with TKM containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm NaCl. The quality of the nuclear fraction was examined by phase-contrast microscopy. In some instances, cell fractionation was carried out by an alternative procedure exploiting density properties for separation of nuclear from membrane fractions as described by Graham (32.Graham J. Rickwood D. Centrifugation, a Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 219-249Google Scholar). In brief, following harvest in PBS, cells (3 × 106) were resuspended in 3 ml of TKM and broken with approximately 10 strokes of a type S pestle of a Dounce homogenizer. Subsequently two volumes of 2.3 msucrose were added to bring sucrose concentration to 1.62m, and the mixture was layered over a 3-ml cushion of 2.3m sucrose in TKM. By ultracentrifugation at 130,000 ×g in a SW41 rotor of a Beckman centrifuge, nuclei were sedimented through the cushion to the bottom of the tube, whereas membranes remained at the interface. Nuclei were consecutively washed in PBS or PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 prior to a final washing step in PBS. For immunofluorescent staining of isolated nuclei, an aliquot of the nuclear fraction was air-dried on glass slides. For immunoprecipitation, the nuclear pellet was lysed in nuclear lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% deoxycholate). Postnuclear and homogenate fractions were adjusted to the identical concentrations of salt and detergents of the lysis buffer. All fractions were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min prior to use. Homogenate fraction, nuclear fraction, and ¼ of the postnuclear fraction, respectively, were precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads (Sigma) prior to incubation overnight at 4 °C with mAb 27-156, mAb 2c, or mAb OKT8. Immunocomplexes were adsorbed for 2 h at 4 °C onto protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads coated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dakopatts). Following six cycles of washing with detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 100 units of trasylol/ml, and 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and one washing cycle with TN buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 units of trasylol/ml, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the precipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar) and consecutive fixation and fluorography (34.Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5619) Google Scholar) of the dried slab gels. Preliminary experiments were carried out in order to substantiate that the experimental approach of cell fractionation and consecutive immunoprecipitation reliably separated RER-resident proteins from those in the INM (4.Rolls M.M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23.Raviprakash K. Rasile L. Ghosh K. Ghosh H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1777-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, parallel cultures of COS7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids pRC/CMV-gB encoding INM-bound authentic HCMV gB (25.Reis B. Bogner E. Reschke M. Richter A. Mockenhaupt T. Radsak K. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or with pCMUIV-CD8/E19 encoding an ER-resident CD8 chimera (27.Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Transfected cultures were radiolabeled at 48 h posttransfection and subjected to analysis by the combined procedures of cell fractionation and immunoprecipitation as described above. The results shown in Fig. 1 B(a) demonstrate that HCMV gB was recovered from nuclear as well as postnuclear fractions (lanes N andPN), whereas CD8/E19 was precipitated from postnuclear but not from nuclear fractions (Fig.1 B (b),lanes PN and N). This observation strongly suggested that the separation procedure used adequately served the experimental purpose. Our previous experiments have shown that translocation of recombinant HCMV gB to the INM was dependent on the 51 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (24.Bogner E. Anheier B. Offner F. Smuda C. Reschke M. Eickmann M. Radsak K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In order to address the question of whether the putative signal within this domain was transferable, chimeras of defined segments of HCMV gB and the plasma membrane protein CD8 as a reporter were constructed (Fig. 2 A). Following transfection of respective expression plasmids into COS7 cells, subcellular localization of the chimeric proteins was examined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 B). In order to distinguish between localization of the chimeras in the RER or INM (see “Experimental Procedures”) immunoprecipitations from nuclear and postnuclear fractions of radioactively labeled transfected cells (Fig.2 C) were carried out as well. For this purpose, nuclear fractions were prepared by treatment with nonionic detergent which removes outer nuclear and RER membranes and does not affect the integrity of the INM (23.Raviprakash K. Rasile L. Ghosh K. Ghosh H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1777-1782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Rolls M.M. Stein P.A. Taylor S.S. Ha E. McKeon F. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence of the transfected cells with the appropriate monoclonal antibodies yielded consistent images for each expression product, as depicted in Fig. 2 A. For wild-type gB (Fig.2 A, a) characteristic staining was obtained of the RER and the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2 B, a), which corresponded to that in infected or stably transfected cells described previously (24.Bogner E. Anheier B. Offner F. Smuda C. Reschke M. Eickmann M. Radsak K. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations confirmed the presence of HCMV gB in solubilized nuclear fractions representing INM as well as postnuclear fractions representing solubilized cytoplasmic membranes including RER and plasma membranes (Fig. 2 C, a). These results suggested that a significant portion of authentic HCMV gB was localized in the INM of transiently transfected COS7 cells. Transfections with authentic CD8 (Fig. 2 A, b), on the other hand, resulted predominantly in cell surface and Golgi staining (Fig. 2 B, b). As expected, CD8 was not detected in nuclear fractions by immunoprecipitation (Fig.2 C, b). Distribution of chimeric CD8 with the cytoplasmic tail of HCMV gB (Fig. 2 A, c), however, again showed localization in the RER and at the nuclear rim (Fig. 2 B, c), and immunoprecipitation demonstrated its presence in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 2 C,c). Identical results were obtained when chimeras were examined consisting of the amino-terminal portion of CD8 including the transmembrane domain fused to carboxyl-terminal residues 865–906 of HCMV gB (Fig. 2, A–C, d). As expected, the CD8 chimera with the cytoplasmic tail of HCMV gB lacking amino acids 865–906 was not localized in the INM (Fig. 2, A–C,e). Also, replacement of the membrane anchor of CD8 by that of HCMV gB (Fig. 2 A, f) resulted in neither nuclear rim staining (Fig. 2 B, f) nor immunoprecipitation from the nuclear fractions (2C,f). These data suggested that the carboxyl-terminal 42 amino acids of HCMV gB are sufficient to translocate a heterologous transmembrane reporter protein to the INM. Experiments were performed to examine functional analogies between a conventional NLS of soluble proteins and the signal residing at the carboxyl terminus of HCMV gB. For this purpose, the NLS of SV40 T antigen or amino acids 865–906 of HCMV gB were fused to soluble β-galactosidase (Fig.3 A), and subcellular localization of the transiently expressed chimeric proteins was examined by immunofluorescence. This approach resulted in the exclusive intranuclear detection in the case of the β-galactosidase/NLS chimera (3B, b), whereas for the β-galactosidase/HCMV gB 865–906 chimera, cytoplasmic staining comparable with that of authentic β-galactosidase was observed (Fig. 3 B(c and a)). This observation suggested that the domain of HCMV gB was not a functional substitute for a conventional NLS for soluble proteins. Vice versa, the effect of replacement of the carboxyl-terminal domain of HCMV gB by the conventional NLS on subcellular distribution was examined (Fig.4, A–C, c). Authentic HCMV gB and HCMV gB with a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain served as controls (Fig. 4, A–C, a andb). The immunofluorescence pattern obtained for this chimera (Fig. 4 B, c) equaled that of HCMV gB with the carboxyl-terminal deletion (Fig. 4 B, b). Correspondingly, no significant amounts of the protein were recovered from nuclear extracts by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 C,c). From these experiments it was concluded that the carboxyl-terminal domain of HCMV gB is functionally distinct from the NLS of soluble proteins. In previous reports it has been suggested that transport of HSV-1 gB to the INM depends on the transmembrane domain (21.Gilbert R. Ghosh K. Rasile L. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2272-2285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Rasile L. Ghosh K. Raviprakash K. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Raviprakash K. Rasile L.

The proteasomal degradation of apoB-100 was postulated to be an intrinsic property of the protein that occurs even in the presence of optimal amounts of lipids supplied to the cell. We examined apoB-100 and apoB-48 biogenesis in CaCo2, a human colon carcinoma cell line. To our surprise, apoB-100 and apoB-48 were quantitatively secreted by CaCo2 cells; essentially none of the newly synthesized apoB was degraded before secretion in a 2-h period whether the cells were cultured on filter or on plastic. Furthermore, although ubiquitin immunoreactivity was readily detected in the intracellular apoB isolated from HepG2 cells, little or no ubiquitin was detectable in the intracellular apoB from CaCo2 cells. The amounts of free ubiquitin and total and non-apoB ubiquitinated proteins were comparable in HepG2 and CaCo2 cells, indicating that CaCo2 cells have the necessary machinery for tagging ubiquitin chains onto cellular proteins for proteasomal degradation. Incubation in lipoprotein-deficient serum did not induce apoB degradation, but the addition of a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor led to apoB degradation in CaCo2 cells. Finally, similar proportions of apoB polypeptide in isolated microsomes from CaCo2 and HepG2 cells were accessible to exogenously added trypsin, indicating that the mere exposure of apoB nascent chains to the cytosolic compartment is insufficient to cause the proteasomal degradation. Therefore, the intracellular degradation of apoB is not an intrinsic property of the protein, and the phenomenon is neither universal nor inevitable.

The hypothesis for the involvement of such a wasteful pathway for an important protein like apoB-100 is that it is a mechanism by which the cell rids itself of misfolded apoB-100. ApoB-100 is one of the largest proteins known and has a complex structure (17.Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Its production requires the co-expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in the absence of which the newly synthesized apoB-100 is completely degraded (19.Gordon D.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MTP has been postulated to effect the early minimal lipidation of apoB-100. The bulk lipidation of the protein occurs at a later stage and is MTP-independent (5.Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Gordon D.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is thought that insufficient supplies of lipid affect apoB-100 folding adversely and divert the protein to the 26 S proteasome for degradation. In HepG2 cells, in which most of the apoB-100 degradation experiments have been conducted, the addition of oleate down-regulates the intracellular degradation and allows more of the apoB-100 to be secreted from the cell (20.Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, even in the presence of optimal amounts of oleate, a significant proportion (20–35%) of apoB-100 is degraded intracellularly before the rest is secreted into the medium. This apparent intrinsic susceptibility of apoB-100 to proteasome-mediated degradation has turned apoB-100 into a paradigm for proteasome-degraded proteins (11.Zhou M. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24649-24653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,15.Du E.Z. Fleming J.F. Wang S.-L. Spitsen G.M. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ApoB degradation has been assumed to be a universal and inevitable phenomenon. ApoB-48 is an essential structural component of intestinal chylomicrons. It is the translation product of an edited apoB mRNA (17.Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Chen S.-H. Habib G. Yang C.-Y. Gu Z.-W. Lee B.R. Weng S.-A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.-J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whether apoB-48 is degraded by proteasome-mediated events in intestinal cells is unknown. We initiated this study to examine the biogenesis of apoB-100 and apoB-48 in a model human intestinal cell line, CaCo2, that has been used extensively to study apoB biogenesis in the past (25.Levy E. Mehran M. Seidman E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To our surprise, we found that newly synthesized apoB-100 and apoB-48 are quantitatively recovered in the cellular lysate and the medium in CaCo2 cells and do not seem to be subject to proteasome-mediated degradation. The fact that apoB-100 (and apoB-48) in a model intestinal cell line escapes intracellular degradation has important implications for the use of apoB as a paradigm for proteasomal protein degradation. Millicell-HA filters (PIHA03050 and PIHA01250) were from Millipore. Nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schuell.

HepG2 and CaCo2 cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere with 5% CO2 and in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone), penicillin (100 unit/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). CaCo2 cells were either plated directly on 24-well plates (Falcon) or on 12-mm Millicell-HA filters that were placed in the 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% FCS, penicillin (100 unit/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). HepG2 cells were plated on 24-well plates without the filters. Culture medium was changed 3 times a week. Pulse-chase analysis of apoB and apoA-I was performed as detailed previously (7.Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) on cells that were ∼3 weeks post-confluence. In brief, the cells were preincubated for 30 min in methionine-free medium followed by a 60-min labeling with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml). Chase was initiated by replacing the labeling medium with RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% FCS and cold methionine (15 g/liter). At the times indicated, the culture medium was harvested, and the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against apoB and apoA-I as described previously (16.Liao W. Yeung S.-C.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic manipulations before and during pulse-chase periods were indicated in the figure legends. Immunoprecipitates were released by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE buffer in the presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 6% gel or 4–12% gradient gel (for apoB) or on 4–20% gradient gel (for apoA-I). Gels were dried, and the autoradiographic image was captured by a phosphor storage system (CycloneTM, Packard) and analyzed by OptiQuant Image analysis software. Data were expressed as digital light units/h. Western blot analysis was performed on the cell culture medium or cell lysate as described previously (16.Liao W. Yeung S.-C.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The lipoproteins in the culture medium were concentrated with fumed silica (28.Vance D. Weinstein D. Steinberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 792: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the concentrated proteins on the silica beads were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and eluted in SDS-PAGE buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol by boiling for 5 min. The cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2% sodium cholate in HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm ALLN, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Insoluble material in the cell lysate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. ApoB was immunoprecipitated as described above. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes, probed with monoclonal anti-ubiquitin or anti-apoB antibodies that were peroxidase-conjugated using an EZ-LinkTM Plus Activated Peroxidase kit (Pierce), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative intensity of the immunoblot bands was quantified by AlphaImagerTM 2000 Documentation & Analysis system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The lipoproteins present in the medium were separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation according to Borén et al. (29.Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each gradient was formed by layering the following solutions from the bottom of the tube: 2 ml of 47% sucrose, 2 ml of 25% sucrose, a 5-ml sample in 12.5% sucrose, and 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C for 65 h. Gradients were unloaded from the top of the tube into 12 fractions. Lipoproteins in each fraction were concentrated with silica and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and apolipoproteins were eluted into SDS-PAGE buffer and separated by 6% SDS-PAGE as detailed above. ApoB was visualized by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against human apoB (1D1). HepG2 cells and CaCo2 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. At ∼3 weeks post-confluence, microsomes were then prepared and trypsin-digested as described previously (16.Liao W. Yeung S.-C.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, two flasks of each cell type were harvested by scraping the cells into phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation and homogenized in 4 ml of 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) on ice. The homogenate was first centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to pellet the microsomes. The microsomes were suspended in an appropriate volume of 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES. The protein concentration of the microsomes was adjusted to 1 μg/μl. Trypsin was then added to the microsome (50 μl) at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 25 min. The reaction was terminated by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. The samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then denatured by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels, and Western blot analysis of apoB was performed with peroxidase-conjugated 1D1 monoclonal antibody as described above. The membrane was stripped once and reprobed with monoclonal antibody against protein disulfide isomerase. Since the microsomes contained relatively much more apoB in HepG2 than in CaCo2 cells, for each lane we loaded 14.3 μg of total microsomal proteins from CaCo2 cells and 5.7 μg total microsomal proteins from HepG2 cells. Construction of adenoviral vector containing human MTP large subunit (AdMTP) was as described previously (27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another viral vector containing luciferase (AdLuc) was used as a control. At ∼3 weeks post-confluence, we transduced the HepG2 and CaCo2 cells with 2 × 109 viral particles/well. On the first day post-transduction, the medium was changed for a further 2-day culture, at the end of which the culture medium was collected for immunoblot analysis of apoB as described above. The cells were lysed, and the supernatant from the lysate was used for immunoblot analysis of MTP large subunit as described previously (27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When CaCo2 cells grown on plastic are compared with those grown on membrane filters, there is a difference in the relative levels of expression of apoB-100 versus apoB-48 (30.Moberly J.B. Cole T. Aplers D.H. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31.Jiao S. Moberly J.B. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 695-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the accumulation and secretion of apoB-100 and apoB-48 by CaCo2 cells under both culture conditions (Fig.1 A). For cells grown on plastic (Fig. 1 A, lanes 11–15), there is abundant secretion of apoB-100 into the medium. The amount of apoB-48, in contrast, is barely detectable. For cells grown on filters, we examined the protein secreted from both the apical and the basolateral regions (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–10). The majority (∼80%) of the apoB is secreted from the basolateral region, and the amount of apoB-48 produced went up with the time of plating of the CaCo2 cells, which is related to the differentiation state of the CaCo2 cells (30.Moberly J.B. Cole T. Aplers D.H. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 31.Jiao S. Moberly J.B. Schonfeld G. J.

Cell Res. 1997; 236: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On days 14–16 after plating, about 50% of the apoB secreted is in the form of apoB-48 (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), much higher than the relative amount of apoB-48 secreted by cells grown on plastic. When we examined the relative amounts of the two species of apoB inside the cell, the cells grown on filters contained slightly more apoB-48 than apoB-100 (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3 and 4), whereas those grown on plastic contained almost all apoB-100 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1and 2). The apoBs secreted into the medium are recovered on lipoprotein particles with relative densities that vary from that of high density lipoproteins to that of very low density lipoproteins, with the apoB-48 showing a major preference for the heavier, and apoB-100, the lighter particles (Fig. 1 C). We next performed a pulse-chase experiment to examine what proportion of the newly synthesized apoB was degraded intracellularly before secretion (Fig. 2). To our surprise, we found that both apoB-100 and apoB-48 were recovered quantitatively from inside the cell plus the medium; we detected essentially no intracellular degradation of the 35S-labeled apoB during a 2-h pulse-chase experiment in CaCo2 cells. This was true whether the cells were grown on filters (Fig. 2, F and G) or on plastic (Fig. 2 E). In this experiment, apoA-I was also quantitatively secreted from these cells (Fig. 2, B andC), although in some other experiments we actually observed a small amount of (up to about 20%) of degradation of apoA-I (see below). Because of the unexpected finding on apoB, we examined the production of apoB and apoA-I in HepG2 cells in a parallel experiment. We found that, as previously reported by our laboratory (7.Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and other laboratories (4.Ginsberg H.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5.Yao Z. Tran K. McLeod R.S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1937-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), during a 2-h chase a significant proportion (38% in this experiment (Fig. 2 D), consistently between 35–65% in other experiments, data not shown) of the newly synthesized apoB-100 was degraded intracellularly before secretion, but apoA-I was quantitatively secreted by the HepG2 cells (Fig. 2 A). The pulse-chase analysis on apoB production in CaCo2 cells is quite reproducible; in multiple experiments we consistently found essentially no intracellular degradation of the newly synthesized apoB-100 or apoB-48. We and others have shown that, in HepG2 cells, a substantial portion of intracellular apoB-100 is tagged for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination (7.Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8.Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We next examined whether apoB in CaCo2 cells is ubiquitinated. Intracellular apoB was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the presence of immunoreactive ubiquitin in the purified apoB was examined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3 and as reported previously (7.Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16.Liao W. Yeung S.-C.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), apoB-100 isolated from HepG2 cells was heavily ubiquitinated (Fig. 3,lane 11). Furthermore, the degree of ubiquitination was greatly enhanced when the proteasomal degradation of apoB was inhibited by lactacystin (Fig. 3, lane 12). In contrast, we detected hardly any immunoreactive ubiquitin in the apoB isolated from CaCo2 cells, irrespective of whether the cells were cultured on plastic or on filter (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). The left-hand panelof Fig. 3 shows that substantial amounts of apoB-100 (and substantial, although smaller, amounts of apoB-48 for the filter-grown sample) are present in the sample, and the almost complete absence of immunoreactive ubiquitin was not caused by an absence of apoB on the membrane. This experiment was repeated three times, and consistently, very little or no ubiquitin was detectable in the intracellular apoB isolated from CaCo2 cells, whereas abundant amounts of immunoreactive ubiquitin were present in the apoB isolated from HepG2 cells. Since to our knowledge CaCo2 cells have not been used in previous experiments on proteasomal protein degradation, we examined this cell line for the presence of ubiquitinated proteins. Total lysates were isolated from CaCo2 and HepG2 cells, and immunoreactive ubiquitinated proteins in these lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. In Fig.4 A, the left-hand panel (lanes 1–6) presents data on the immunoreactive ubiquitin in 15 μg of total cellular lysate proteins, and theright-hand panel (lanes 7–12), the immunoreactive ubiquitin in apoB isolated from 315 μg of total lysate proteins, i.e. ∼20-fold more starting material. It is evident that abundant amounts of ubiquitinated proteins were detected in intracellular proteins isolated from both types of cells. It was also readily detected in the intracellular apoB isolated from HepG2 cells (lanes 11 and 12) but not the apoB isolated from CaCo2 cells, whether the cells were grown on plastic (lanes 7 and 8) or filters (lanes 9 and10). Furthermore, the ubiquitin immunoreactive proteins increased in the presence of lactacystin (Fig. 4 A,lanes 2, 4, 6, and 12). We then determined the relative amounts of free ubiquitin in CaCo2 and HepG2 cells by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B, bottom panel). We found that CaCo2 and HepG2 cells contained approximately similar amounts of free ubiquitin, a substrate used by the cell to tag apoB and other proteins for proteasomal degradation. We next depleted the cell lysates of apoB by immunoprecipitation and checked the apoB-free proteins for the presence of immunoreactive ubiquitin. It is clear from Fig. 4 B (top panel) that substantial amounts of ubiquitinated proteins are represented in these non-apoB proteins in both CaCo2 and HepG2 cells. Therefore, there is no apparent defect in the ability of CaCo2 cells to modify the intracellular proteins by ubiquitination. At least some of the ubiquitinated proteins were destined for proteasomal degradation, because the amount of ubiquitinated proteins was greatly enhanced in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitors, lactacystin or ALLN (Fig.4, A and B). As noted previously, the supply of optimal amounts of oleate reduces, but does not abolish, apoB degradation in HepG2 cells (20.Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates the importance of lipids in preventing apoB degradation. Since under basal conditions, apoB production in CaCo2 cells seems to have escaped degradation, it may be that lipids are not limiting in these cells like they are in HepG2 cells. We therefore examined the effect of limiting amounts of lipid on apoB biogenesis in CaCo2 cells. CaCo2 cells were grown either in 20% FBS or in bovine lipoprotein-deficient serum for 2 days before we examined the intracellular fate of apoB by a pulse-chase experiment (Fig.5). Although the amount of apoB produced in the lipoprotein-deficient serum was reduced by about 25% compared with nonlipoprotein-deficient serum (compare groups 3 and1), the mild limitation of lipid availability associated with the use of lipoprotein-deficient serum did not stimulate intracellular degradation of apoB-100 in CaCo2 cells (comparegroups 4 and 3). We next turned our attention to the role of MTP, another well studied factor that may be important in stabilizing apoB in the endoplasmic reticulum (33.Wang S. McLeod R.S. Gordon D.A. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14124-14133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 34.Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). MTP transfers lipids to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nascent apoB peptide chain and facilitates its correct folding, thereby preventing its intracellular degradation (34.Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 35.Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To compare the role of MTP in apoB-100 production in HepG2 and in CaCo2 cells, we acutely increased the intracellular MTP content by adenovirus-mediated transfer of the large subunit cDNA for MTP to the two types of cells. As shown in Fig. 6, this maneuver stimulated the accumulation of the MTP large subunit protein in both cell types, as had been demonstrated by us in HepG2 cells (27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as reported previously (27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), there was a marked stimulation of apoB-100 secretion into the culture medium in AdMTP-treated HepG2 cells compared with control vector (AdLuc)-treated cells (Fig. 6, left-hand panel). In contrast, there was only a minimal difference in the amount of apoB-100 secreted into the culture medium of CaCo2 cells following treatment by these vectors (Fig. 6, right-hand panel). We conclude from this observation that under basal conditions there is optimal expression of MTP in CaCo2 cells protecting the newly synthesized apoB, whereas HepG2 cells produce suboptimal amounts of MTP, which can be boosted by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. However, this is not the whole story, because we recently showed that even marked overexpression of MTP in HepG2 cells fails to completely inhibit the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of apoB (27.Liao W. Kobayashi K. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This contrasts the essential lack of degradation in the CaCo2 cells under basal conditions. There must be additional factors that account for the difference in the stability of apoB between HepG2 and CaCo2 cells. To further explore the role of MTP and to find out whether we can induce apoB degradation in CaCo2 cells by an even more drastic limitation of apoB lipidation, we treated CaCo2 cells with an MTP inhibitor (BMS-197636) (Fig.7 A). The addition of the inhibitor during the preincubation and labeling periods led to substantial inhibition of incorporation of [35S]methionine into apoB-100 (compare groups 2 and 1), consistent with the interpretation that deficiency of MTP activity causes co-translational degradation of apoB (9.Benoist F. Grand-Perret T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20435-20442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas there was little degradation of apoB under basal conditions (compare groups 3 and 1), inhibition of MTP during the labeling and chase periods caused substantial (69%, compare groups 4 and 3) intracellular apoB-100 degradation in CaCo2 cells. Substantial intracellular degradation was also observed when the inhibitor was added only during the chase period (compare groups 5 and 1 (55% degraded) and5 and 3 (52% degradation)). We performed a parallel experiment examining the effect of MTP inhibition on apoA-I dynamics in CaCo2 cells (Fig. 7 B). In this experiment we found that under basal conditions, a small amount (18%) of apoA-I was degraded (compare groups 3 and 1). The amount, however, was the same in the presence or absence of MTP inhibition. The experiments thus far show that apoB produced inside CaCo2 cells is relatively resistant to degradation. It is quantitatively secreted under basal conditions, and limiting the availability of lipid by the use of lipoprotein-deficient serum did not induce degradation. However, the nascent polypeptide is not totally immune to degradation, because the inhibition of core lipidation by an MTP inhibitor stimulates apoB degradation in these cells. We next examined whether there is a fundamental difference between HepG2 and CaCo2 cells with respect to the orientation of apoB-100 in the endoplasmic reticulum. In HepG2 cells, the nascent apoB polypeptide is partially exposed to the cytosol and is accessible to exogenously added proteases (16.Liao W. Yeung S.-C.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 36.Du E.Z. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ubiquitination seems to affect only the cytosolically exposed apoB (16.Liao W. Yeung S.-C.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility for the difference between CaCo2 and HepG2 cells in the susceptibility of apoB to proteasomal degradation may be that the nascent apoB polypeptide displays differential accessibility to the proteasomal machinery located in the cytosolic compartment in these two cell types. We examined this hypothesis by comparing the effects of limited proteolysis on microsomes isolated from HepG2 and CaCo2 cells (Fig.8). Under the conditions of the experiment, the intraluminally located protein, protein disulfide isomerase, is completely protected from trypsin digestion (comparelanes 6 versus 5, and 8 versus 7). As reported previously, a substantial amount (∼70%) of apoB-100 in the HepG2 microsomes was accessible to and degraded by the exogenously added trypsin. Interestingly, a similar proportion (∼71%) of the apoB-100 in CaCo2 microsomes was also accessible to and digested by trypsin treatment. Therefore, the nonsusceptibility of apoB-100 to intracellular degradation in CaCo2 cells is not caused by a fundamental difference in the orientation of the apoB polypeptide with respect to the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosolic compartments. In the series of experiments above, we have demonstrated that under the conditions used in these experiments apoB-100 and apoB-48 appear to escape intracellular degradation in CaCo2 cells. ApoB-100 especially is a highly complex protein, and it has been postulated that a significant proportion of apoB-100 molecules always undergoes misfolding and is subsequently removed by the cell largely via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (3.Yeung S.J. Chan L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 6-12Crossref Google Scholar, 7.Yeung S.J. Chen S.-H. Chan L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13843-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 8.Fisher E.A.

Supplying HepG2 cells ample amounts of lipids or up-regulating MTP activity by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer reduces the number of molecules that are misfolded, but experiments in HepG2 cells indicate that there remains a significant proportion of molecules that undergo proteasomal degradation when the cells are supplemented with oleate (12.Mitchel D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20.Dixon J.L. Furukawa S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7532-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The intracellular degradation of apoB has been observed not only in HepG2 cells but also in other cell types such as McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells (14.Cavallo D. McLeod R.S. Rudy D. Aiton A. Yao Z.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9435-9442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We note, however, that these are all liver-derived cells. The previously purported universal occurrence of this phenomenon has led to the conclusion that the susceptibility to intracellular degradation of apoB is an intrinsic property of the protein. This is a plausible hypothesis, given the huge size and complexity of apoB. Therefore, our observation of the virtual absence of intracellular degradation of apoB-100 and apoB-48 in CaCo2 cells is totally unexpected and revolutionizes our thinking on apoB biogenesis. From a mechanistic standpoint, we found that during the transit of the apoB polypeptide chain in the endoplasmic reticulum, the relative accessibility of the apoB polypeptide chain to the cytosolic compartment is not unique to HepG2 cells but is also observed in CaCo2 cells (Fig. 8). It has been postulated that the unusual orientation of apoB during its transit into the endoplasmic reticulum exposes the nascent protein to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (12.Mitchel D.M. Zhou M. Pariyarath R. Wang H. Aitchison J.D. Ginsberg H.N. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14733-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,16.Liao W. Yeung S.-C.J. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our observations indicate that the accessibility of apoB to the cytosolic compartment is not sufficient in itself to promote proteasomal degradation. Therefore other signals unique to apoB/HepG2 or apoB/CaCo2 organellar interactions must account for the difference in the susceptibility of apoB to intracellular degradation in these cell types. ApoB production has been examined in CaCo2 cells in the past (40.Murthy S. Albright E. Mathur S.N. Davidson N.O. Field F.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 691-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Dashti N. Smith E.A. Alaupovic P. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 113-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Tsai H.-L. Kou G.-H.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 749-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the potential role of intracellular degradation in the regulation of apoB biogenesis in these cells was not addressed specifically in any of these publications. Because of the different experimental objectives, e.g. often only apoB secreted into the basolateral media was collected, it is difficult to determine from the published data how much, if any, of the newly synthesized apoB was degraded. In conclusion, we found that despite the fact that CaCo2 cells have the capacity to tag some of their intracellular proteins for degradation by the proteasome pathway, the apoB-100 and apoB-48 produced by these cells manage to largely escape this fate. The intracellular degradation of apoB is neither universal nor inevitable. This observation is important, because it indicates that susceptibility to degradation by this pathway is not intrinsic to apoB and forces us to look for other determinants for the proteasomal degradation of apoB in hepatocytes. The unconditional use of apoB as a paradigm for intracellular protein degradation is not warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1997527618,"Regulatory features of protein-induced membrane fusion are largely unclear, particularly at the level of the fusion peptide. Fusion peptides being part of larger protein complexes, such investigations are met with technical limitations. Here, we show that the fusion activity of influenza virus or Golgi membranes is strongly inhibited by minor amounts of (lyso)lipids when present in the target membrane but not when inserted into the viral or Golgi membrane itself. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we employ a membrane-anchored peptide system and show that fusion is similarly regulated by these lipids when inserted into the target but not when present in the peptide-containing membrane. Peptide-induced fusion is regulated by areversible switch of secondary structure from a fusion-permissive α-helix to a nonfusogenic β-sheet. The “on/off” activation of this switch is governed by minor amounts of (lyso)-phospholipids in targets, causing a drop in α-helix and a dramatic increase in β-sheet contents. Concomitantly, fusion is inhibited, due to impaired peptide insertion into the target membrane. Our observations in biological fusion systems together with the model studies suggest that distinct lipids in target membranes provide a means for regulating membrane fusion by causing a reversible secondary structure switch of the fusion peptides.

The overall fusion machinery, including molecular factors for targeting, attachment, and regulation of these events, can be quite complex. For example, the SNARE (Soluble NSFAttachment protein REceptors) system, mediating intracellular fusion events, consists of specific membrane proteins, present on vesicle (v-SNARE) and target membrane (t-SNARE), and cytosolic ATPases, such as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein or p97, together with their cofactors α-SNAP (Soluble NSF AttachmentProtein) and p47, respectively (1.Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Typical features of the “fusion machinery,” be it a viral or an intracellular system, are careful assembly into distinct complexes, conformational changes and an overall enhanced α-helical structure (3.Fasshauer D.

Questions therefore remain as to what mechanisms cause the fusion process to be “switched on,” and once it proceeds, which mechanisms cause fusion to stop. Because our understanding of mechanisms of biological membrane fusion is still rudimentary, the use of artificial membranes, isolated fusion proteins, or fusogenic peptides is of great value. Synthetic fusion peptides can only partly mimic the overall mechanism by which viral or cellular proteins induce membrane fusion; in particular, the involvement of segments of the proteins other than the fusion sequence cannot be assessed with these peptides. Nevertheless, fusogenic peptides have provided precious information on structural requirements for fusion, e.g. with respect to amino acid specificity (8.Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), secondary structure and orientation in the target membrane (9.Martin I. Pécheur E.I.

Here, the regulation of fusion by target membrane lipids was assessed in two biological systems, the influenza virus and Golgi membranes. Evidence was obtained, indicating that lipids blocking fusion displayed a pronounced inhibitory effect when present into thetarget membrane and much less when present into the membrane that bears the fusogen. Molecular dissection of these intriguing observations was accomplished by using a simplified membrane system, which relies on a membrane-anchored peptide model that has been shown to trigger fusion with target membranes in a structure-dependent manner (10.Pécheur E.I. Martin I. Bienvenüe A. Ruysschaert J.M. Hoekstra D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14.Pécheur E.I. Hoekstra D. Sainte-Marie J. Maurin L. Bienvenüe A.

However, when covalently attached to liposomes, it folds into an amphipathic α-helix. As a consequence, the peptide-coupled liposomes fuse with target membranes. Hence, the coupled peptide represents a convenient model for a fusion peptide, like that located in a membrane-anchored fusion protein. The potential of this model to reveal regulating features of membrane fusion at the molecular level in terms of switching membrane fusion “on” or “off,” was addressed in the present work. By combining structural data obtained by infrared spectroscopy and tryptophan fluorescence with functional assays for fusion, we report that a reversible and target membrane lipid-dependent switch from a fusion-permissive α-helix to a fusion-inhibiting β-sheet regulates fusion. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). TbCl3.6H2O was from Alfa. Oleoyl-l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (oleoyl-l-α-LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) from egg yolk, acrylamide, and dipicolinic acid were from Sigma. Large unilamellar WAE-coupled vesicles (LP-WAE) (final peptide/lipid ratio, 1:40), consisting of PC and cholesterol (3.5:1.5) were prepared as described previously (14.Pécheur E.I. Hoekstra D. Sainte-Marie J. Maurin L. Bienvenüe A. Philippot J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3773-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fusion was monitored by lipid mixing, using an assay based upon energy transfer (15.Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). To this end the peptide-coupled vesicles were labeled with 1 mol % each of N-NBD-PE andN-Rh-PE, and at time 0, target vesicles composed of PS/PE (10:3) were added to the WAE-liposome suspension in a 6-to-1 ratio (total lipid concentration, 70 μm), in 10 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The initial rates of lipid mixing were determined from the tangents drawn to the steepest parts of the fusion curves. Contents mixing was assayed between LP-WAE loaded with 2.5 mm TbCl3 and target PS/PE vesicles loaded with 50 mm dipicolinic acid, as described earlier (14.Pécheur E.I. Hoekstra D. Sainte-Marie J. Maurin L. Bienvenüe A. Philippot J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3773-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As a measure of peptide penetration into the target membrane, the intrinsic fluorescence change of the N-terminal Trp residue was determined. PS/PE target vesicles were added to LP-WAE in buffer containing 2 mm Ca2+ (total lipid concentration, 70 μm), and emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm (λexc = 280 nm). The spectra were corrected for the vesicle blank (scatter) and for the dilution caused by the liposome addition. The increase in the fluorescence quantum yield is expressed asF/F 0, where F andF 0 denote the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm after and before the addition of target vesicles, respectively. For acrylamide quenching experiments, emission spectra were recorded at λexc = 295 nm, in the presence of increasing amounts of acrylamide. The quenching data were analyzed by the Stern-Volmer plot using the equation: F 0/F = 1 +K sv[Q], where F 0 andF are the fluorescence intensities at 340 nm in the absence or presence of a given acrylamide concentration [Q], andK sv is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. Oriented multilayers were obtained by slow evaporation of the lipid vesicles under an N2 stream at room temperature on one side of the germanium plate, which is the internal reflection element (50 × 50 × 2 mm, Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45o, yielding 25 internal reflections (16.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Hilderson H. Ralston G. Determination of Soluble and Membrane Protein Structure by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. 23. Plenum Press, New York1994: 329-450Google Scholar). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were then recorded at room temperature on a Bruker IFS55 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector at a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1 and encoded every cm−1. The conformation analysis was performed on the amide I region of deuterated samples, located in a region of the spectrum often free of other bands and composed of 80% pure C=O vibration (16.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Hilderson H. Ralston G. Determination of Soluble and Membrane Protein Structure by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. 23. Plenum Press, New York1994: 329-450Google Scholar). To quantify the area of the different components of amide I as revealed by self-deconvolution, a least-squares iterative curve fitting was performed to fit lorentzian line shapes to the spectrum between 1700 and 1600 cm−1. Each band was assigned to a secondary structure according to the frequency of its maximum. The area of all bands assigned to a given secondary structure was then summed up and divided by the total area. This ratio gives the proportion of the polypeptide chain in that conformation (16.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Hilderson H. Ralston G. Determination of Soluble and Membrane Protein Structure by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. 23. Plenum Press, New York1994: 329-450Google Scholar). The frequency limits for each structure were first assigned according to the data determined theoretically or experimentally: 1662–1645 cm−1, α-helix; 1689–1682 cm−1 and 1637–1613 cm−1, β-sheet; 1644.5–1637 cm−1, random; 1682–1662.5 cm−1, β-turns. These limits have been slightly adjusted to obtain a good agreement between the proportion of each structure determined by attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR and x-ray crystallography. For the deuteration kinetics, samples were spread on the germanium plate, and 10 spectra were recorded by ATR-FTIR to verify the reproducibility of the measurements and stability of the system. At time 0, a D2O-saturated N2 flux was applied to the sample with a flow rate of 100 ml/min, controlled with a Brooks flow meter. The spectrum at each time point is the accumulation of 24 scans, with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The amide I and II band areas were measured between 1700–1600 and 1585–1502 cm−1, respectively. The amide II area was divided by the amide I area for each spectrum to correct for any change in total intensity of the spectra during the deuteration process. The 100% value is defined by the amide II/amide I ratio obtained before deuteration, and the 0% value corresponds to a zero absorption in the amide II region (17.de Jongh H.H. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Anal. Biochemistry. 1996; 242: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recombinant influenza A virus strain X-47 (H3N2) was incubated with LPC (final phospholipid concentration, 5 mol %), for 15 min at room temperature, in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Unincorporated LPC was eliminated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and virus was subsequently labeled with octadecylrhodamine B-chloride (R-18; 15 nmol of R-18 per mg of viral protein). Noninserted fluorophore was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25. The amount of LPC incorporated into the virus membrane represented 10 mol % with respect to total phospholipid (i.e. 11 μm), as quantitated by densitometric analysis of silica TLC plates, after lipid extraction by the Bligh-Dyer procedure. The amount of R-18 incorporated into the virus membrane was quantitated by fluorescence measurements, as described (18.Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and represented 7% of the total phospholipids. For the lipid mixing assay influenza virus (20 μg of viral proteins) was prebound for 3 min with washed red blood cells in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 37 °C under mild agitation. Subsequently, fusion was triggered by lowering the pH in the cuvette to 5 by injecting citric acid. The increase in fluorescence (recorded at λexc = 560 nm, λem = 590 nm) was normalized to the maximum dequenching signal obtained at infinite dilution of the probe by lysing the virus with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. Rat liver Golgi membranes were prepared as described earlier (19.Otter-Nilsson M. Hendriks R. Pécheur E.I. Hoekstra D. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2074-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and resuspended in 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6.7. An aliquot (50 μg of protein/ml) was kept for 30 min on ice in the absence or presence of 30 μm LPC and added to a 37 °C-thermostatted cuvette containing fluorescently labeled PC:PS:PE or PS:PE liposomes (final lipid concentration, 70 μm) suspended in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8. Alternatively, Golgi membranes were added to a suspension of liposomes preincubated with 12 μm LPC for 3 min. The 100% fluorescence was obtained as described above. We monitored the fusion of influenza virus with erythrocytes, after treating either the virus or the red blood cells with LPC. The data revealed that relative to control, the presence of LPC in the donor (viral) membrane caused only a limited inhibition of fusion, whereas a drasticinhibition was seen when the lipid was present in the targetmembranes at identical concentrations (Fig.1 a). Along the same lines, fusion of isolated Golgi membranes with liposomes was affected and controlled in a corresponding fashion: 40–50%-inhibition of fusion was seen when 30 μm LPC was incorporated into Golgi membranes, containing the peripherally associated fusogenic complex p97/p47 (“donor” membranes; see Ref. 19.Otter-Nilsson M. Hendriks R. Pécheur E.I. Hoekstra D. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2074-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas fusion was almost completely abolished when only 12 μm LPC were included into the target liposomal membranes (Fig. 1 b). Recent data obtained on Golgi- and endosome-derived transport vesicles isolated from permeabilized HepG2 cells also showed a prominent inhibition of fusion when LPC was incorporated into the target membrane, and much less so by including LPC in the vesicle membrane. 2O. Maier, E.-I. Pécheur, and D. Hoekstra, unpublished observations. Membrane fusion is thought to be driven by the insertion of a specific peptide domain, contained in the fusion protein, into the target membrane. This will lead to bilayer destabilization, and subsequently, membrane merging occurs. Direct evidence for such a penetration has been demonstrated for the N terminus of the influenza HA2subunit in hemagglutinin, and of the F1 subunit of the Sendai virus F protein (20.Pak C.C. Krumbiegel M. Blumenthal R. Raviv Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14614-14619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Novick S.L. Hoekstra D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7433-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the light of these data, our observations could imply that the penetration of such a “fusion-inducing domain,” be it the N terminus of HA2or a yet-to-be-identified domain of a Golgi- and/or endosome-associated protein, is impaired by the presence of lysophospholipids in the target membranes. If so, the next issue would then be to reveal the mechanism underlying such an impairment. Testing this hypothesis (and its implications) at the level of an entire protein or protein complex is not yet possible, due to technical limitations. However, the WAE peptide model system does provide this possibility, in that it closely reproduces the membrane-anchored environment of a fusion peptide in its biological context. WAE-coupled vesicles and target liposomes (diameter ≈ 100 nm) were prepared and mixed in fusion buffer at 37 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following aggregation, peptide-induced fusion occurs as revealed by either lipid (Fig. 2, curve a) or contents mixing (Fig. 2, curve b). In the present system, membrane aggregation was accomplished by calcium. Indeed, aggregation but not fusion occurred upon addition of Ca2+ to peptide-devoid vesicles (Fig. 2, curve f), whereas, importantly, WAE-induced fusion is not affected when Ca2+is added to a system that does not require the divalent cation for aggregation (14.Pécheur E.I. Hoekstra D. Sainte-Marie J. Maurin L. Bienvenüe A. Philippot J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3773-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (not shown). Furthermore, neither did fusion occur when 2 mm Ca2+ was added to target vesicles alone. Thus in the present system, Ca2+ causes close apposition of the membranes, which allows WAE to trigger fusion. Note that the fusion event was essentially nonleaky, as reflected by the remarkable similarity in the kinetics of mixing of membrane lipids and aqueous contents. How does WAE bring about membrane fusion? Current experimental evidence concerning the mechanism of protein-induced membrane fusion supports a stalk-pore model of fusion intermediates (22.Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 23.Siegel D.P. Epand R.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3089-3111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Formation of the stalk is affected by modulating the intrinsic curvature of the membrane. Thus, lipids advancing negative intrinsic curvature, like the cone-shaped HII phase-forming dioleoyl-PE, promote fusion. This can be counteracted by lipids favoring positive curvature, such as inverse-cone shaped, micelle-forming lysolipids. The mechanism by which LP-WAE vesicles fuse with PS/PE target vesicles is entirely consistent with this scenario. Insertion of LPC, accomplished by either exogenous addition to target vesicles (Fig. 2, curve e; Fig. 3, circles) or upon incorporation during their preparation (not shown) inhibited WAE-induced fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Similar alterations in the fusion activity were observed with LPE (not shown, see below), and intriguingly, also when the target membrane contained as little as 2 mol % dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (Fig. 2,curve d). Interestingly, when LPC (or LPE) was incorporated into the LP-WAEdonor membrane, its propensity to fuse with target vesicles was impaired in comparison with LPC-devoid donor membranes, but to a much lesser extent than when LPC was present in the targetmembrane at identical concentrations (Fig. 2, compare curves c and e, respectively). Hence, depending on its localization relative to that of the fusion-inducing peptide, LPC affects fusion differently. The effect of lysophospholipids on the capacity of WAE to penetrate into the target membrane was assessed by monitoring changes in intrinsic fluorescence of the N-terminal Trp residue of the peptide. As shown in Fig. 3 (squares), in parallel to the LPC-dependent inhibition of fusion (circles), the intrinsic Trp fluorescence dropped. This decrease, in conjunction with a red shift of the emission maximum (10–15 nm) is indicative of an LPC-induced shift in the environment of the peptide from a hydrophobic to a more hydrophilic one. It thus appears that LPC impairs the capacity of WAE to engage in hydrophobic interactions with and penetrate into the target membranes. To more accurately define the molecular environment of the peptide upon fusion, in either the presence or absence of fusion-inhibiting lipid species in the target membrane, we monitored the accessibility of the Trp residue to an aqueous quencher, acrylamide. Thus the more hydrophilic the environment, the better Trp should be accessible to acrylamide quenching. Second, we monitored by ATR-FTIR the proton/deuterium (H/D) exchange of the peptide, implying that the state of deuteration should increase when the peptide faces a hydrophilic environment (24.de Jongh H.H. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 a, after fusion, WAE was less accessible to acrylamide quenching (compareclosed versus open circles). Hence, at fusogenic conditions, the peptide is (at least partly) buried into the target membrane. Surprisingly, at conditions at which fusion is strongly inhibited, i.e. in the presence of LPC, a further decrease in the accessibility of the peptide to the aqueous quencher was seen. To clarify this point, the accessibility of WAE to deuterium oxide (D2O) was monitored as a function of the exposure time to D2O-saturated nitrogen, by determining the H/D exchange of the amide group. As shown in Fig. 4 b, prior to fusion, WAE was fully accessible to H/D exchange, which was completed after approximately 10–15 min. After fusion with target vesicles in the absence of LPC, this exchange amounted to approximately 50–60%. Hence, in accordance with the Trp fluorescence quenching experiments, the reduced accessibility of the peptide was due to its penetration into the target membrane. Intriguingly, this exchange is severely diminished when the target membranes contained LPC, consistent with the Trp data. Again, a very similar feature was seen when the target membrane contained only a few mol % of DPPC (Fig. 4), which, like LPC and LPE, strongly inhibits WAE-induced fusion (Fig. 2, curve d). However, the degree of exchange is such (approximately 20%, compared with approximately 50% at control conditions) that these data are unlikely explained by an enhanced insertion of WAE at notably nonfusogenic conditions. Rather, a potential explanation could be that the peptide becomes clustered, thereby shielding the Trp residues and, similarly, protons for deuterium exchange. The data thus dictate that structural features of the peptide should be taken into account. Secondary structure determination in a lipidic environment at the various experimental conditions was carried out by FTIR (16.Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Hilderson H. Ralston G. Determination of Soluble and Membrane Protein Structure by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. 23. Plenum Press, New York1994: 329-450Google Scholar). Prior to fusion, the coupled peptide showed an α-helix content of approx. 55% and little if any β-sheet structure (Fig. 5 a, upper panel). A virtually identical spectrum was obtained in the presence of PS/PE target vesicles with Ca2+ (Fig. 5 b, spectrum 1) or when LPC or LPE were inserted into the peptide-coupledvesicles by exogenous addition in the absence (Fig. 5 a, lower panel, and Table I) or presence of target vesicles (Table I). These data thus indicate that under fusogenic conditions, the secondary structure of the peptide per se was affected neither by target vesicles nor by LPC or LPE (see also legend to Table I). Indeed, LPC-containing LP-WAE vesicles still fuse, although less avidly than LPC-devoid vesicles, because the effect on donor membrane curvature obviously interferes with their fusion susceptibility (Fig. 2, curve c, and see above). However, when LPC was incorporated into the target vesicles, followed by addition of the peptide-coupled vesicles, a dramatic shift in the structure of the peptide from an α-helix to a β-sheet was observed (Fig. 5 b, spectrum 2). Under these conditions the α-helix content decreases from 55 to 25%, whereas the β-sheet content increases from 3 to 63–75% (depending on the topology of the LPC; Table I). Consistently, a very similar increase in the β-sheet content (up to 90%) was observed when the target membrane contained LPE (Fig. 5 b, spectrum 2; Table I) or 2 mol % DPPC (Fig.5 b, spectrum 3; Table I), accompanied by a decrease in the α-helix content.Table IEstimates of the secondary structure contents of WAE coupled to donor liposomes before and after fusion with PS/PE target vesiclesSampleα-HelixaSecondary structure determination was performed from the analysis of the shape of the amide I band using a Fourier self-deconvolution curve-fitting procedure (see under “Experimental Procedures”).

Thus, the presence of relatively minor amounts of distinct lipids in the target membrane provoked a switch in the secondary structure of the (coupled) fusion peptide from a fusion-permissive α-helix to a fusion-inhibiting β-sheet. Furthermore, the maximum absorbance of the β-sheet was observed at approximately 1625 cm−1 (Fig.5). This low frequency suggests that the β-strands formed strong hydrogen bonds arising from intermolecular bonds between aggregated or oligomerized peptides (25.Gasset M. Baldwin M.A. Fletterick R.J.

However, in the presence of heparin reaction of antithrombin with both proteinases is greatly accelerated and thus provides an endogeneous mechanism for regulation of the activity of antithrombin. This key role of heparin in accelerating the reactions of antithrombin with blood coagulation proteinases also accounts for the widespread clinical use of heparin as an anticoagulant (1.Olson S.T. Björk I. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1994; 1: 479-501Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the reactions of antithrombin with both thrombin and factor Xa, the ability of long heparin chains to bind to both inhibitor and proteinase contributes significantly to the rate acceleration, though much more so to the thrombin-antithrombin reaction (∼2000-fold) (2.Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) than to the factor Xa-antithrombin reaction (∼90-fold in the presence of Ca2+) (3.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A second contribution to the rate acceleration of these reactions is a major conformational change in the reactive center loop induced by heparin binding to antithrombin, which alters both the conformation and flexibility of the scissile bond (P1-P1′) and thereby increases the substrate-like initial interactions with proteinase (4.Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This conformational change results in an ∼300-fold rate increase for the factor Xa-antithrombin reaction. The thrombin-antithrombin reaction is much less sensitive to the conformation of the reactive center loop and shows only an ∼2-fold rate increase. Both biochemical (5.Huntington J.A. Olson S.T.

A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) support a mechanism for the heparin-induced conformational change in the reactive center loop in which the P15 and P14 residues at the N-terminal end of the reactive center loop, which are inserted into β-sheet A as strand 4 in the low reactivity state of native antithrombin, are expelled from the β-sheet upon heparin binding (Fig.1) to give a reactive center loop that is very much more reactive toward factor Xa. As part of the heparin-induced conformational change, the strands of β-sheet A that flank residues P15 and P14 in the native state are thought to close up. Because the remarkable mechanism by which serpins inhibit target proteinases requires insertion of the whole of the reactive center loop (from P15 to approximately P3) into β-sheet A as strand 4 (12.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), β-sheet A of antithrombin must reopen at the critical point of the mechanism to allow re-insertion of residues P15 and P14, as well as the remainder of the reactive center loop, with the proteinase covalently bound to the P1 residue. It follows from the putative effects of heparin on the conformation and reactivity of the reactive center loop of antithrombin toward factor Xa and from the need for re-insertion of the P15 and P14 residues as part of the proteinase-inhibition mechanism, that it might be possible to create an antithrombin variant that is activated as an inhibitor of factor Xa by introducing a mutation at P14 that favors the loop-expelled conformation prior to reaction with factor Xa but does not block the subsequent and obligate efficient reinsertion of the loop into β-sheet A during the inhibition mechanism. We had previously attempted this by making a P14 Ser → Trp variant (5.Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and later a P14 Ser → Cys variant that could be derivatized on the cysteine (6.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Neither variant satisfactorily fulfilled both requirements. Thus the P14 Ser → Trp variant showed only a small increase in reactivity toward factor Xa in the absence of heparin and a greatly reduced efficiency as an inhibitor, with a stoichiometry of inhibition (SI)1 of 29 compared with 1.2 for wild-type antithrombin. The P14 Ser → Cys variant was very much more reactive toward factor Xa upon derivatization of the cysteine with the fluorescein moiety (6.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the bulky fluorescein interfered with the inhibition pathway, with the result that the species was activated only as a substrate for factor Xa. We therefore sought to create a different P14 antithrombin variant that might be activated as an inhibitor of factor Xa, to test both the feasibility of this as well as the proposed role of the P15/P14 hinge in activation of antithrombin and its subsequent inhibition of proteinases. We report here a P14 serine → glutamate variant of antithrombin (S380E) that has such properties. S380E antithrombin was created using human antithrombin cDNA on an N135Q background. The N135Q background reduces heterogeneity arising from differences in glycosylation of the recombinant antithrombin by eliminating the glycosylation site at position 135 (14.Fan B. Crews B.C.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resulting antithrombin resembles the β-form of plasma antithrombin. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out in M13mp19 as described previously (16.Fan B. Turko I.V. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14156-14161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), using coding strand template 5′-GTAAATGAAGAAGGCGAGGAAGCAGCTGCAAG-3′ (mutation siteunderlined). The change was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The expression vector, together with the selection plasmids pRMH140 and pSV2dhfr, was used to stably transfect baby hamster kidney cells, as described previously (17.Zettlmeiβl G. Wirth M. Hauser H. Küpper H.A. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1988; 82: 26-34Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected by resistance to neomycin and methotrexate. The antithrombin variant was isolated from serum-free cycles of medium collected from stably transfected baby hamster kidney cells grown to confluence in roller bottles. The level of antithrombin in the growth medium was monitored by radial immunodiffusion assay using commercially available plates containing sheep anti-human antithrombin antibody (Binding Site Ltd., Birmingham, United Kingdom). The S380E antithrombin variant was purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose. The protein was initially purified on heparin-Sepharose, using a 0.1–4 m salt gradient for elution. Antithrombin eluted between 2.5 and 4 m salt, at a salt concentration higher than that for control N135Q antithrombin eluted from the same column (see “Results”). The thrombin inhibitory activity was measured for each fraction by incubation of aliquots overnight with thrombin and measuring the residual thrombin activity, as described previously (18.Olson S.T. Frances-Chmura A.M. Swanson R. Björk I. Zettlmeissl G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fractions containing anti-thrombin activity were collected and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Further purification to remove any bound heparin was carried out by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, using a 0.02–1 msalt gradient to elute the antithrombin. Fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, concentrated, and frozen at −70 °C until needed. The concentration of S380E antithrombin was determined using the extinction coefficient of wild-type antithrombin of E 280 nm1% = 6.5 (19.Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The ability of the S380E antithrombin to form covalent complexes with proteinases was determined from the appearance of characteristic SDS-stable high molecular weight bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antithrombin was incubated with proteinases at room temperature for the times and in the amounts indicated in the figure legend. The reactions were stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the products were run on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescence emission spectra of S380E antithrombin and control antithrombin and their complexes with full-length heparin were recorded at 25 °C on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer or SPEX fluorometer, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and a bandpass of 4 nm. For comparison of spectra from control and S380E antithrombins, intensities were normalized based on a concentration determined from absorbance at 280 nm, assuming equivalent extinction coefficients for the two proteins ofE 1% = 6.5 (19.Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Such an assumption is likely to be in error by a maximum of ∼5% (20.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3444) Google Scholar). Emission spectra were recorded with a 2-nm step and bandpass of 2 nm, using an antithrombin concentration of 100 nm. A saturating amount of heparin was added for spectra of antithrombin-heparin complexes. Basal fluorescence intensities and enhancements caused by heparin are reported as the average of 5–10 separate measurements. Except for the reactions of factor Xa and thrombin with control antithrombin and of thrombin with S380E variant antithrombin, for which the second order rate constants were slow, all rate constant determinations were made from continuous progress curve assays, using the change in absorbance at 405 nm resulting from hydrolysis of chromogenic substrate. For these measurements the antithrombin:proteinase ratio was at least five times the SI to maintain pseudo first order reaction conditions. Progress curves were fitted to a single monoexponential (Equation 1) and corrected for competition from substrate according to Equation 2 (21.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).

Substrate consumption was less than 10% in all cases. Substrates used were spectrozyme Xa for factor Xa (K m 350 μm), S2238 for thrombin (K m 7 μm), and S2222 for trypsin (Km 33 μm), all at 100 μm. Measurements were made at 25 °C in I0.15 buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Factor Xa reactions used 0.5 nm factor Xa and 10–90 nm antithrombin in the absence of heparin and 100 nm-1 μmantithrombin in the presence of heparin. Thrombin reactions in the presence of heparin used 0.1–0.3 nm thrombin and 20–100 nm control antithrombin or 500 nm-2 μm S380E antithrombin. Trypsin reactions used 1–2 nm trypsin and 20–100 nm control antithrombin or 100–500 nm S380E antithrombin. Optimal heparin concentrations were determined empirically by carrying out experiments using increasing heparin concentrations until the measured rate plateaued. These optimal concentrations represent a molar excess of heparin over antithrombin, with concentrations in the range 1–5 μm. The reactions of factor Xa and thrombin with control antithrombin and of thrombin with S380E variant antithrombin were all monitored by discontinuous assay in which antithrombin at a concentration at least five times the SI was incubated with proteinase, and the loss of proteinase activity was determined at discrete time points by the removal of an aliquot of the reaction mixture and assay of enzymatic activity upon dilution into 100 μm chromogenic substrate, using spectrozyme Xa for factor Xa and S2238 for thrombin. The pseudo first order rate constant k obs was determined from the slope of a plot of log of residual enzyme activity against time and then converted into the second order rate constant by dividing by the antithrombin concentration (21.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Measurements by both continuous and discontinuous methods were carried out at least five times. The rate constants reported are the averages of these measurements. SI (defined as the number of mols of antithrombin required to inhibit 1 mol of target proteinase) was determined by incubating antithrombin over a range of concentrations (0–2 μm) with fixed concentration of proteinase (30–100 nm) in polyethylene glycol-coated tubes. Reactions were allowed to go to completion, and residual proteinase activity was measured from the rate of substrate hydrolysis at 405 nm. The stoichiometry of inhibition was determined by plotting residual proteinase activity against the ratio of antithrombin to proteinase. SIs determined in the absence of heparin were carried out in buffer containing 100 μg/ml polybrene to avoid effects of any traces of contaminating heparin. For SIs determined in the presence of heparin, saturating amounts of heparin over antithrombin were used. SIs reported are the average ± S.D. of 3–5 measurements. Thermal denaturation of antithrombin was followed by monitoring change in ellipticity at 220 nm of the CD spectrum as a function of temperature. CD measurements were made on a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter in a 1-mm pathlength-jacketed cell. The temperature was controlled by a Neslab water bath. Antithrombin concentrations were 0.4 mg/ml in I0.15 buffer. A bandwidth of 2 nm, step resolution of 0.5 °C, response time of 16 s, and rate of temperature change of 0.5 °C/min were used. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human factor Xa was prepared as described previously (22.Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). α-Thrombin was prepared from prothrombin, isolated from outdated human plasma by the method of Miletich et al. (23.Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Majerus P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), by reaction with snake venom as described (24.Lanchantin G.F. Friedmann J.A. Hart D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5956-5966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length high affinity heparin,M r 15,000, was prepared by fractionation of heparin first by size-exclusion chromatography and then by antithrombin affinity chromatography, as described (25.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An approximately 35–40% enhancement of the fluorescence emission spectrum of plasma and recombinant wild-type antithrombin, together with a 2-nm blue shift in the position of the emission maximum occur as a result of the conformational changes that occur upon heparin binding (26.Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence enhancement has been shown to arise predominantly (>70%) from changes in the environment of tryptophans 225 and 307 as a result of expulsion of the hinge of the reactive center loop from β-sheet A (27.Meagher J.L. Beechem J.M. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23283-23289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These fluorescence changes have been routinely used as an indicator of the occurrence of such structural changes in antithrombin. In the absence of heparin, we found that the S380E variant had a normalized fluorescence intensity that was already 35 ± 5% higher than that of control antithrombin, suggesting that the conformation of the variant was similar to that of heparin-activated antithrombin, and specifically that the environments of tryptophans 225 and 307 had been changed in the manner expected from expulsion of the reactive center loop from β-sheet A. In keeping with this conclusion, binding of heparin caused only a 3 ± 2% increase in the emission intensity of the S380E variant, together with a 2-nm blue shift, whereas heparin caused a 40% enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of the control antithrombin and a 2-nm blue shift (Fig. 2). The small increase for the S380E variant is consistent with the expected direct contact effects of heparin binding on tryptophan 49. Because there was such a small change in the tryptophan emission spectrum of S380E antithrombin upon addition of heparin, it was not possible to use change in tryptophan fluorescence as a means of determining the heparin-antithrombin dissociation constant for the variant. Instead we compared the elution positions of control antithrombin and S380E antithrombin from heparin-Sepharose under identical conditions, as a qualitative measure of affinity. We found that the S380E variant eluted at significantly higher salt concentration (∼2.2 m) compared with control antithrombin (∼1.5 m) (Fig.3). Similar behavior has been seen previously for a S380W variant of antithrombin (5.Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), where the Ser → Trp mutation led to a partial shift toward the activated, loop-expelled state. For the purposes of analysis and interpretation of the other experiments presented here, such a qualitative assessment of heparin affinity is sufficient, because we can be sure that under similar antithrombin and heparin concentrations for wild-type and S380E antithrombins, the S380E variant will be saturated to the same or greater extent. In wild-type antithrombin it is thought that the P15 and P14 residues inserted into β-sheet A in the native state contribute to the overall stability of the protein. It is therefore expected that, if the mutation of the P14 residue to glutamate has displaced these residues from the β-sheet, there might be a reduction in the stability of the variant protein. We used change in ellipticity of the CD spectrum of the protein to follow thermal denaturation and found (Fig. 4) that the S380E variant denatured at a temperature 5° lower than that of the control antithrombin (52.5 °C versus 57.5 °C, respectively). This is consistent with the S380E variant existing in the loop-expelled conformation in which the P15 and P14 residues do not contribute to the stability of the protein, in contrast to the loop-inserted control antithrombin. The ability of the S380E variant to form the SDS stable complexes with proteinase that are the hallmark of proteinase inhibition by the serpin suicide substrate mechanism was examined for reaction with factor Xa, thrombin, and trypsin. For each proteinase there was clear evidence for the presence of lower mobility bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis corresponding to a covalent complex between antithrombin and the proteinase (Fig.5). However, from the relatively low intensity of bands corresponding to high molecular weight covalent complexes compared with the much higher intensity of bands corresponding to reactive center loop-cleaved antithrombin, it can be gauged that the SI for reaction with each proteinase must be much greater than 1. The same reactions were also examined in the presence of heparin but in each case gave only cleaved antithrombin as a detectable product (not shown), indicating that any complex formed must represent a very small fraction of the total reaction products and therefore be below the detection limit of this method. To obtain more accurate values for the SIs for inhibition of factor Xa, thrombin, and trypsin than could be obtained from SDS gels, both in the absence and presence of heparin, we used kinetic assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plots of residual activity against antithrombin concentration for fixed proteinase concentration gave straight lines in each case, showing that the covalent complexes were stable over the time course of the experiments (Fig. 6). Whereas control antithrombin gave SI values for each proteinase close to the expected values of about 1, the S380E variant was less efficient as an inhibitor and gave elevated SI values in the absence of heparin and very much increased SI values in the presence of heparin (TableI). The S380E variant was most effective as an inhibitor of thrombin (SI = 4.2) and trypsin (SI = 5) and less effective as an inhibitor of factor Xa (SI = 7). The effect of increasing the temperature from 25 to 37 °C was examined for the antithrombin-factor Xa reaction but was found to give only a small increase in inhibition efficiency (SI = 6.5). For all three proteinases, the effect of having heparin present was to greatly increase the SI so that less than 1% of the reaction intermediate followed the branch of the pathway to a stable complex compared with >99% that followed the substrate branch of the pathway (Table I). Because heparin is known to stabilize the loop-expelled antithrombin conformation and so acts to hinder the re-insertion of the reactive center loop during the inhibition reaction, the findings indicate that the S380E variant is much more sensitive to this hindrance than is control antithrombin, consistent with the higher heparin affinity of the variant. This is also in keeping with the SI values in the absence of heparin being >1, such that flux along the substrate branch of the pathway is already significant relative to the inhibitory branch.Table IStoichiometries of inhibition of proteinase by antithrombinFactor XaThrombinTrypsinAntithrombin−Heparin−HeparinaDetermined at 37 °C rather than 25 °C.+Heparin−Heparin+Heparin−Heparin+HeparinControl1.3 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.1S380E7 ± 0.56.5 ± 0.5550 ± 504.2 ± 0.3650 ± 305 ± 0.3195 ± 10a Determined at 37 °C rather than 25 °C. Open table in a new tab Second order rate constants were determined for the reactions of control and S380E variant antithrombins with factor Xa, thrombin, and trypsin both in the absence and presence of heparin. Because the rate constants were determined from the kinetics of loss of proteinase activity, the apparent rate constants determined in this way must be corrected for the flux along the substrate pathway to give the true second order rate constant. These corrected rate constants show (TableII) that in the absence of heparin, the S380E variant reacts with factor Xa ∼190-fold faster than does control antithrombin. In contrast, the S380E variant reacts with thrombin only twice as fast as control and with trypsin five times as fast as control. This selective enhancement for the factor Xa reaction is in keeping with the conformation of S380E antithrombin being that of the loop-expelled, activated form, because only the reaction of factor Xa with antithrombin shows a strong dependence of the rate on the conformation of the reactive center loop (25.Olson S.T.

Thus the reaction with factor Xa was increased only a further 7-fold, corresponding to a small bridging contribution in the absence of Ca2+ (3.Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For reaction with thrombin, where almost all of the large rate enhancement from full-length heparin arises from a bridging contribution, heparin gave rise to large enhancements for both control and S380E variants (to 1.7 × 107m−1s−1 and 0.7 × 107m−1 s−1, respectively). For trypsin there are only small rate enhancements from both conformational change and bridging. In keeping with this the rate of reaction of the S380E variant in the presence of heparin was only 6-fold faster than in its absence. With the demonstration that the S380E variant of antithrombin is an inhibitor of proteinases by the serpin suicide substrate inhibition mechanism, through its ability to form covalent SDS stable complexes, and the finding that it reacts with factor Xa at a rate 190-fold higher than that of control antithrombin, we have established the feasibility of creating an activated inhibitory antithrombin through modification of the hinge region of the reactive center loop. The tryptophan fluorescence, heparin affinity, and thermal stability of the S380E variant are all consistent with activation resulting from the reactive center loop being fully expelled from β-sheet A, whereas the high sensitivity of the SI to heparin being bound is consistent with the importance of facile reinsertion of the reactive center loop into β-sheet A for efficient inhibition of proteinase. The agreement between the observed and expected properties of this variant provides strong support for the currently favored model of how antithrombin inhibits proteinases and how heparin influences both the rate of reaction of antithrombin and proteinase and the outcome of the reaction with respect to relative fluxes along the inhibitory and substrate branches of the serpin pathway. The tryptophan emission spectra in the absence and presence of heparin provide direct structural evidence that the S380E variant is a P14-expelled form. Of the four tryptophans in antithrombin (at positions 49, 189, 225, and 307), only tryptophan 49 is within the heparin binding site. However, we have previously shown that tryptophans 225 and 307 are responsible for ∼70–80% of the heparin-induced fluorescence enhancement and are therefore specific reporters of the longer range conformational change effects of heparin binding. This is now understandable in molecular terms from the recently determined structure of the antithrombin-heparin pentasaccharide complex, which shows that heparin binding removes the P14 side chain from contact with tryptophan 225 and causes a 180° flip of the side chain of tryptophan 307 (11.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The ∼35% enhanced tryptophan fluorescence of S380E antithrombin and relative insensitivity of the fluorescence to further change upon binding heparin are therefore probably due to the environments of tryptophans 225 and 307 being equivalent to those of heparin-activated antithrombin, which would require the P15 and P14 residues to have been expelled from β-sheet A. Heparin binding should then cause no further change with respect to these two tryptophans, even though it should still induce conformational change within the heparin binding site. The small blue shift and 3% enhancement upon binding heparin to the S380E variant are consistent with this, because we have also previously shown that direct contact of heparin with tryptophan 49 causes a small increase in fluorescence intensity, together with the overall blue shift of the tryptophan emission spectrum of antithrombin (27.Meagher J.L. Beechem J.M. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23283-23289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The lower thermal stability and higher heparin affinity of the S380E variant compared with control antithrombin are also consistent with such a loop-expelled conformation. Two other P14 variants of antithrombin that we have previously examined show alterations in thermal stability and heparin affinity that parallel whether the loop-inserted conformation is favored or disfavored. Thus an S380W variant, which favors loop expulsion, is less stable than control antithrombin by 5.5 °C (5.Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas an S380C variant, which favors loop insertion, is more stable by 2.3 °C (6.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The heparin affinities show the reverse pattern, with higher affinity for the less stable S380W variant and lower affinity for the S380C variant. The observed rate constants for reaction of the S380E variant with different proteinases also show the expected changes from control antithrombin. Thus, the expectation for reaction of factor Xa with a reactive center loop-expelled conformer of antithrombin is that the rate constant should be increased several hundred-fold. This is because the IAGR sequence of the P4-P1 residues of antithrombin, although close to the optimal one for factor Xa (IEGR), is thought to have an inappropriate fixed conformation in the loop-inserted state of antithrombin but to become more conformationally labile and hence more reactive in the loop-expelled conformation. In contrast, because the P3-P1 residues, AGR, are far from the optimal sequence for reaction with thrombin (FPR), the change in conformational flexibility arising from loop expulsion results in little increase in reactivity of antithrombin with thrombin. For trypsin, which has low specificity for residues other than P1, the rate of reaction with the loop inserted conformation of antithrombin is already quite high (∼105m−1 s−1) and gives a relatively modest increase upon expulsion of the reactive center loop. The rate constants for reaction of the S380E variant are in agreement with these expectations for each of the three proteinases. In addition, the further effects of long chain high affinity heparin are also as expected if the S380E conformation is already in the loop-expelled conformation, because only additional bridging contributions would be expected, which would be modest for factor Xa (in the absence of Ca2+) and trypsin (as seen) but very large for thrombin (again as seen). In addition to the large changes in reaction rate and altered fluorescence, thermal stability, and heparin affinity, the other major difference between control and S380E variant antithrombins is the elevation of SI values, which is moderate in the absence of heparin and very large in the presence of heparin. To understand these effects it is useful to review the serpin inhibitory mechanism. Serine proteinases recognize serpins as substrates and initiate a normal proteolytic cleavage at the P1-P1′ scissile bond. At the acyl enzyme intermediate stage, i.e. while the carbonyl is still covalently linked to the active site serine of the proteinase, a conformational change occurs in which the central strands of β-sheet A of the serpin separate and the reactive center loop inserts as a new antiparallel strand dragging the proteinase with it (28.Kaslik G. Patthy A. Bálint M. Gráf L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29.Kaslik G. Kardos J. Szabó L. Závodszky P. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. Gráf L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5455-5474Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30.Plotnick M.I. Mayne L. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7586-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because loop insertion leading to inhibition is in competition with deacylation and release of the proteinase and cleaved serpin, there are two possible products of reaction-covalent serpin-proteinase complex and cleaved serpin whose relative proportions reflect the relative rates of the two processes, loop insertion versus deacylation. Anything that speeds loop insertion relative to deacylation will favor inhibition, whereas anything that hinders loop insertion will favor substrate cleavage, if the hindrance is great enough. The increases in SI for the S380E variant in the absence of heparin most likely result from slower loop insertion. This is not surprising, because normal loop-inserted forms of serpins have the P14 side chain pointing below β-sheet A into the protein interior. Other things being equal, it is likely that there would be a higher activation energy for burial of a charged glutamate than a neutral serine and hence a slower initiation of loop insertion. This is also consistent with the conclusion that the native state of the S380E variant has the P14 glutamate displaced from β-sheet A, in contrast to the inserted wild-type serine. Similar increases in SI have been seen in other serpins when the P14 residue has been changed to a charged one, such as Thr → Arg in both α1-proteinase inhibitor (31.Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and α1-antichymotrypsin (32.Lukacs C.M. Zhong J.Q. Plotnick M.I. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The further large increases in SI for the S380E variant in the presence of heparin are also explicable in terms of a reduced rate of loop insertion. Thus, heparin binds much more tightly to the P14-expelled state than the P14 loop-inserted state. When heparin is bound and therefore stabilizing the loop-expelled state, it is harder to re-insert the reactive center loop into β-sheet A than it is in the absence of heparin. The consequent effect on SI has been well illustrated for wild-type antithrombin-thrombin complex formation, where, in the presence of heparin, the SI increases as a function of decrease in ionic strength and consequent increase in heparin affinity (33.Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the thrombin-antithrombin reaction the SI was 1.1 at I0.3, but increased to 9.8 at I0.01. In terms of change in k 4, the rate constant for the inhibitory branch of the serpin pathway, this represents an 88-fold change, i.e. of comparable magnitude to the changes seen here for the S380E variant upon binding heparin (e.g. ∼80-fold for the reaction with factor Xa). Finally, given that the S380E has properties that are consistent with it being a loop-expelled and therefore activated inhibitor of factor Xa, the possible basis for this shift in conformation should be considered. On the one hand the mutation might destabilize the loop-inserted form, whereas on the other it might stabilize the loop-expelled form. Both may also occur together. The result most relevant to this is the thermal stability of the variant, which is less than that of the control antithrombin. This suggests that the destabilizing effect on the loop-inserted form must dominate. Also, because the variant is still an inhibitor, the destabilizing effect of the mutation on the loop-inserted form must not be too great, otherwise inhibition, requiring loop re-insertion, might be slowed too much. This suggests that any stabilizing effect on the loop-expelled form, such as might occur from new salt bridge interactions, should be small. If this is correct, the effects of the mutation are rather straightforward in the absence of heparin and suggest that introduction of other charged residues, such as arginine, lysine, or aspartate might give variants with qualitatively similar properties.

Transcription activation involves a poorly defined interaction of activator proteins, bound at remote sites, with the ς54 holoenzyme bound at a promoter as a transcriptionally inactive closed complex (4.Cannon W.

Our objectives are to determine the contributions of the ς54 protein to RNA polymerase function and activation through structure-function studies.

Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12145-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ς factors contribute to several functions of the holoenzyme, and although discrete activities are known to reside within individual domains, the domains appear to interact with each other for the full function of the ς54. In the present paper, the structural organization of the 54-kDa monomeric ς54 protein fromKlebsiella pneumoniae bacteria is analyzed using x-ray solution scattering (SAXS),1the method yielding low resolution structural information at nearly physiological conditions. Two methods of ab initio shape restoration (10.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The latter shape can be unambiguously positioned within the former, providing insight about the structural organization of the ς54 molecule. Further, the shape of the 30-kDa fragment exhibits similarity with that of the crystal structure of a fragment of the Escherichia coli ς70 protein that also binds the core RNA polymerase. A prediction of potential ς54 DNA binding surfaces is also made. K. pneumoniaeς54 protein (amino acids 1–477) and the 30-kDa core binding fragment (amino acids 70–324) with an 11-amino acid amino acid extension (MARIRARGSSR) at its N terminus were overproduced as soluble proteins in E. coli and purified as described previously (13.Missailidis S. Cannon W.V. Drake A. Wang X.Y. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). They were concentrated to 15–20 mg/ml and buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0, at 4 °C by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Concentrated samples were stored at −70 °C and thawed on ice prior to the scattering experiments. Protein concentrations of ς54 and the 30-kDa fragment were determined side by side using the Bio-Rad dye assay and bovine serum albumin as standard. The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected using standard procedures on the X33 camera (14.Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum.

Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Samples at concentrations between 2 and 15 mg/ml were measured at a wavelength λ = 0.15 nm for sample-detector distances of 2.9 and 1.4 m covering the momentum transfer ranges 0.20 < s < 2.0 nm−1 and 0.35 < s < 5.0 nm−1, respectively (s = 4π sinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam, corrected for the detector response; the scattering of the buffer was subtracted; and the difference curves were scaled for concentration using the program SAPOKO. 2D. I. Svergun and M. H. J. Koch, unpublished results. The curves recorded at a sample-detector distance of 2.9 m were extrapolated to zero concentration and merged with the data obtained at 1.4 m. The maximum dimensions D max of the ς54 and the 30-kDa core were estimated from the experimental data using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (19.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The distance distribution functions p(r) and the radii of gyration R g were evaluated by the indirect Fourier transform program GNOM (20.Svergun D.I. Semenyuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 21.Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2874) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the solutes were estimated by comparison of the extrapolated forward scattering I(0) with that of a reference solution of bovine serum albumin. Prior to the shape analysis, undesirable contributions from the scattering due to the internal particle structure at higher scattering angles that become significant above approximately s = 2.0 nm−1 were removed by subtracting a constant from the experimental data. This procedure ensures that the intensity decays ass −4 following Porod's (22.Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) law for homogeneous particles and yields an approximation of the “shape scattering” curve (i.e. scattering due to the excluded volume of the homogeneous particle with a constant density). The shape scattering curves in the ranges up to s max = 2.8 nm−1 (ς54) and 3.3 nm−1 (30-kDa core) were used to compute the excluded volumes V of the hydrated particles (22.Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) and for the ab initio shape determination. The outer portions of the curves dominated by the scattering from the internal structure were discarded in the further analysis. The low resolution particle shapes were restored from the experimental data using two ab initioprocedures. In the method of Svergun et al. (10.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 798-802Crossref Google Scholar), the shape is represented by an angular envelope function r= F(ω), where (r,ω) are spherical coordinates. The envelope is parameterized as follows (23.Stuhrmann H.B. Z. Phys. Chem. 1970; 72: 177-198Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), F(ω)=∑l=0L ∑m=−llflmYlm(ω)Equation 1 where Y lm(ω) are spherical harmonics and the multipole coefficients f lm are complex numbers. The maximum order of the spherical harmonicsL is selected to keep the number of free parametersM = (L + 1)2 − 6 close to the number of Shannon channels N s =D max s max/π in the experimental data (10.Svergun D.I.

University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL1949Google Scholar, 25.Moore P.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Crossref Google Scholar). The scattering intensity of the envelope is as follows, I(s)=2π2∑l=0∞ ∑m=−ll‖Alm(s)‖2Equation 2 where the partial amplitudesA lm(s) are calculated from the coefficients f lm using the recurrence relation of Svergun and Stuhrmann (26.Svergun D.I. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 736-744Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These coefficients are determined by the program SASHA (10.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B.

The spatial resolution of the envelope function representation is approximately δr = √5πR g/(√3 (L + 1)). Another ab initio procedure employs a particular implementation of a general method (12.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). A sphere of diameterD max is filled by densely packed small spheres (dummy atoms) of radius r 0 ≪D max. The structure of this dummy atoms model (DAM) is defined by a configuration X, assigning an index to each atom corresponding to solvent (0) or solute particle (1.Helmann J.D. de Haseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The scattering intensity from the DAM is computed using Equation 2 with the following partial amplitudes, Alm(s)=il2/π∑jjl(srj)Ylm+(ωj)Equation 4 where the sum runs over the dummy atoms withX j = 1 (particle atoms);r j,ω j are their polar coordinates; and j l(x) denotes the spherical Bessel function. The number of dummy atoms in the search model M DAM ≈ (D max/r 0)3≫ 1 significantly exceeds the number of Shannon channels. To reduce the effective number of free parameters in the model, the method searches for a configuration X minimizingf(X) = χ2 + αP(X), where the looseness penaltyP(X) with a positive weight α > 0 ensures that the DAM has low resolution with respect to the packing radiusr 0. The weight of the penalty is selected to have significant penalty contribution at the end of the minimization. The latter is performed starting from a random approximation using the simulated annealing method (27.Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt Jr., C.D. Vecci M.P. Science. 1983; 220: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (30259) Google Scholar); details of the procedure are described elsewhere (12.Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). The spatial resolution provided by the DAM is defined by the range of the momentum transfer as δr = 2π/s max. Since the shape determination methods yield models with an arbitrary orientation and handedness, they were appropriately rotated for comparison with each other and also with the atomic model of a ς70 subunit fragment from E. coli RNA. The latter was taken from the Protein Data Bank (28.Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8135) Google Scholar), entry 1sig (29.Malhotra A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The model of the fragment of the B-DNA was generated with the program Turbo-FRODO (30.Roussel A. Cambilleau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-79Google Scholar), and the three-dimensional models were displayed using the program ASSA (31.Kozin M.B. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 811-815Crossref Google Scholar). The experimental scattering curves from the ς54 and its 30-kDa fragment are presented in Fig. 1, and the structural parameters computed from these curves are listed in TableI. The molecular masses of the solutes indicate that both ς54 and the 30-kDa fragment are monomeric in solution, in agreement with the results of analytical ultracentrifugation. 3D. Scott and J. Hoggett, personal communication. The experimental values of D max andR g suggest that the two macromolecules, and especially ς54, are rather anisometric. The volumes of the hydrated ς54 and the 30-kDa fragment are twice the dry volumes expected from the molecular masses (about 75 and 42 nm3, respectively). This reveals a very high hydration (0.4 g of H2O/g of protein) characteristic for extended macromolecules with high specific surface accessible to the solvent. The profiles of the distance distribution functions p(r) in Fig.2 are typical for elongated particles (32.Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987: 83-87Google Scholar). It follows that ς54 is a very elongated protein and that the 30-kDa fragment, although having a 2-nm smaller maximum diameter, is still rather elongated.Table IExperimental and model parameters of ς54 and of its 30-kDa fragmentParameter/Sampleς5430-kDa fragmentExp.aExp, calculated from the experimental data.Env.bEnv, parameters of the envelope models.DAMcDAM, parameters of the dummy atoms models.Exp.Env.DAMMass (kDa)58 ± 632 ± 4D max (nm)13.0 ± 0.510.412.511.0 ± 0.58.311.0R g (nm)3.43 ± 0.063.043.393.05 ± 0.052.513.08V (nm3)155 ± 1014415285 ± 672.286.7Free parameters11.6dNumber of Shannon channels is given.19224311.6dNumber of Shannon channels is given.19295Discrepancy χ1.791.181.490.88Resolution (nm)2.82.22.41.9a Exp, calculated from the experimental data.b Env, parameters of the envelope models.c DAM, parameters of the dummy atoms models.d Number of Shannon channels is given.

Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The restored envelopes are presented in Fig. 3(left column), and the fits to the experimental data are displayed in Fig. 1, a and b. The envelope of the 30-kDa fragment can be unambiguously positioned inside that of ς54. Moreover, a boomerang-like shape of the core correlates well with the gross structure of the core RNA polymerase-binding fragment of the E. coli ς70 protein (the atomic model of the latter is superimposed with the low resolution models in Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the shape reconstruction using envelope functions has its limitations for elongated particles like ς54. To keep the model at low resolution and the number of model parameters reasonably small, higher spherical harmonics are omitted in the description of the envelope (Equation 1). This ensures uniqueness of the model restoration (10.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) but leads to a termination effect especially noticeable for anisometric particles for which the higher harmonics play a significant role. As a result, the radius of gyration and the maximum size of the restored envelopes are lower than those determined experimentally (Table I), and the calculated curves display systematic deviations from the experimental data (Fig. 1). A much less restricted description of the particle shape is provided by the alternative DAM technique. The search volume for the ς54 contained M DAM = 2243 dummy atoms with a packing radius r a = 0.45 nm within a sphere with the diameter D max = 13 nm. Of those, 295 dummy atoms were attributed to the particle in the final model of ς54, and they further defined the search volume for the 30-kDa fragment. The obtained DAMs presented in Fig. 3 (right column), yield better fits to the experimental data in Fig. 1 than those provided by the envelope models and also the structural parameters that neatly agree with the experimental values (Table I). To verify the uniqueness of the shape restoration using DAM, several independent restorations were performed using different conditions (by varying the packing radius r a and by starting from random initial configurations). These restorations yielded reproducible results similar to that in Fig. 3 (right column). In particular, the shape of the 30-kDa fragment restored ab initio within the spherical search volume withD max = 11 nm was very similar to that presented in Fig. 3. An ab initio shape restoration from solution scattering data is not unique unless the search model is kept at low resolution (10.Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The two ab initio procedures employed here use different restrictions. In the envelope restoration, higher spherical harmonics are omitted in the description of the envelope function so that the number of the adjustable parameters is comparable with that of the Shannon channels in the scattering data. In the DAM retrieval, the number of parameters is much larger (M DAM ≈ 103), and the looseness penalty ensures that the final model is compact and interconnected. Given the differences in parameterization and in the numbers of model parameters, similarities in the low resolution models independently restored by the two methods are remarkable. The differences between the two restorations in Fig. 3are largely attributed to the termination effects in the envelope method, which are significant for elongated particles like ς54. It should be stressed that although the shapes obtained with the DAM technique are still low resolution models, their better nominal resolution (Table I) and more detailed appearance compared with the envelope models are fully justified by better fits to the experimental data. DNA footprinting experiments have shown that ς54 interacts with promoter DNA from −33 to −5. Major points of contact are within four base pairs (TGCA) centered at −12.5 and seven (CTGGCAC) centered at −24, within the consensus sequence of ς54 DNA-binding sites. The distance between these contact centers suggests that unless ς binds to a non-B-DNA conformation, interactions between ς and DNA will involve contacts made by structures within more than one of the well developed lobes revealed by the SAXS analysis. Superposition of the low resolution dummy atoms models with a 28-base pair B-DNA fragment in Fig. 3 (top right orientation) summarizes a relationship between ς54, the 30-kDa fragment, and promoter DNA that can account for the known extent of ς-promoter DNA interactions. The 30-kDa fragment analyzed by SAXS lacks the ς DNA-binding domain and region I sequences that also contribute to DNA recognition. It therefore seems probable that the lobe missing from the 30-kDa fragment (Fig. 3) but present in ς54 includes some of the structures that direct promoter binding. The upper surface of ς54 depicted in Fig. 3 (top right orientation) further distinguishes the full-length protein from the 30-kDa fragment and may contribute additional DNA contacting structures. Together, the lobe and the upper surface can provide DNA-contacting surfaces of approximately the necessary extent to fully interact with promoter DNA. The direction of the DNA sequence displayed in Fig. 3 is arbitrary, since no experimental data correlating which structure recognizes the −12 or −24 sequences are available. The low resolution solution structure for ς54 determined in this work provides the first initial model for a protein that functions to convert E. coli RNA polymerase into an enhancer-dependent enzyme (3.Wang J.T. Syed A. Hsieh M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1995; 270: 992-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Clearly developed structures are present that probably represent either a discrete individual domain or alternately domains that are directly interacting within the tertiary structure. The amino-terminal domain required for transcription silencing and activator responsiveness and the C-terminal DNA binding domain are thought to interact (9.Casaz P. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12145-12150Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Comparison of the structure of the 30-kDa fragment that lacks both of these domains with the full-length protein structure is consistent with such an interaction, since one lobe is clearly absent (Fig. 3). Possibly, both the amino-terminal domain and C-terminal domain contribute to this lobe and do directly interact with each other. Another striking observation is that the fragment of ς70 for which the atomic structure has been determined has a similar shape and size compared with the 30-kDa fragment of ς54 (Fig. 3). Both fragments bind to the same core RNA polymerase. Assuming the shape of the fragments is related to core binding, it seems that ς70 and ς54 are probably located in similar places on the core. The sequence differences that exist between ς54 and ς70 are, however, sufficient to account, at least in part, for the different properties of the two holoenzymes. Some interactions with core may nevertheless be conserved between the two ς types. The low resolution solution structure of ς54 shows a well developed anisometric shape. Similarity to a part of ς70 that binds to the core RNA polymerase and interacts with the −10 promoter DNA is evident. Now that crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy are beginning to reveal the structures of multisubuit RNA polymerases (18.Mooney, R. A., and Landick, R. (1999) Cell 687–690Google Scholar), one can also begin to evaluate the functional significance of this similarity. These structural approaches together with the use of tethered iron chelate methods for examining proximity relationships within transcription complexes should help determine the organization of RNA polymerase holoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2062997176,"The behaviour of glutamate semialdehyde aminomutase is markedly affected by the extent to which the central intermediate in the reaction, 4, 5-diaminovalerate, is allowed to dissociate from the enzyme. The kinetic properties of the wild-type enzyme are compared with those of a mutant form in which a flexible loop, that reversibly plugs the entrance to the active site, has been deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. The deletion has three distinct effects: i) the dissociation constant for diaminovalerate is increased 100-fold; ii) the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme is lowered 30-fold; iii) during the aminomutase reaction, the mutant enzyme undergoes absorbance changes not seen with the wild-type. These are proposed to be due to an abortive reaction of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2089589409,"Ran GTPase is required for nucleocytoplasmic transport of many types of cargo. Several proteins that recognize Ran in its GTP-bound state (Ran·GTP) possess a conserved Ran-binding domain (RanBD). Ran-binding protein-1 (RanBP1) has a single RanBD and is required for RanGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis and release of Ran from nuclear transport receptors (karyopherins). In budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), RanBP1 is encoded by the essential YRB1 gene; expression of mouse RanBP1 cDNA rescues the lethality of Yrb1-deficient cells. We generated libraries of mouse RanBP1 mutants and examined 11 mutants in vitro and for their ability to complement a temperature-sensitiveyrb1 mutant (yrb1-51 ts) in vivo. In 9 of the mutants, the alteration was a change in a residue (or 2 residues) that is conserved in all known RanBDs. However, 4 of these 9 mutants displayed biochemical properties indistinguishable from that of wild-type RanBP1. These mutants bound to Ran·GTP, stimulated RanGAP, inhibited the exchange activity of RCC1, and rescued growth of the yrb1-51 ts yeast cells. Two of the 9 mutants altered in residues thought to be essential for interaction with Ran were unable to rescue growth of the yrb1 ts mutant and did not bind detectably to Ran in vitro. However, one of these 2 mutants (and 2 others that were crippled in other RanBP1 functions) retained some ability to co-activate RanGAP. A truncated form of RanBP1 (lacking its nuclear export signal) was able to complement the yrb1 ts mutation. When driven from the YRB1 promoter, 4 of the 5 mutants most impaired for Ran binding were unable to rescue growth of the yrb1 ts cells; remarkably, these mutants could nevertheless form ternary complexes with importin-5 or importin-β and Ran-GTP. The same mutants stimulated only inefficiently RanGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis of the Ran·GTP·importin-5 complex. Thus, the essential biological activity of RanBP1 in budding yeast correlates not with Ran·GTP binding per se or with the ability to form ternary complexes with karyopherins, but with the capacity to potentiate RanGAP activity toward GTP-bound Ran in these complexes.

The direction of transport and accumulation against a concentration gradient are driven by the Ran GTPase (6.Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), which cycles between GTP- and GDP-bound states, like other G proteins. Ran itself is predominantly nuclear, and likewise, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran, RCC1, is associated with chromatin, ensuring that nuclear Ran is largely GTP-bound (8.Seki T. Hayashi N. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9.Renault L. Nassar N. Vetter I. Becker J. Klebe C. Roth M. Wittinghofer A.

Nuclear Ran·GTP binds to importins and thereby dissociates incoming importin-cargo complexes; conversely, nuclear Ran·GTP cooperatively promotes formation of exportin-cargo complexes (11.Görlich D.

Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, as the result of both import and export, Ran·GTP ends up in the cytosol in association with a transport factor and must be released to permit further rounds of transport. Release is driven by GTP hydrolysis. The GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP),1 responsible for catalyzing hydrolysis is present both in the cytosol and is attached to fibrils that extend from the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pores (20.Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21.Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, RanGAP alone only weakly stimulates hydrolysis of Ran·GTP bound to importins or exportins (11.Görlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 23.Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A cofactor is required to permit efficient RanGAP action and to dissociate transport factor complexes from nuclear pores. In mammalian cells, two proteins, RanBP1 (24.Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and Nup358 (also called RanBP2) (25.Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T.

RanBP1 contains one copy and Nup358 contains four copies of a highly conserved, 135-residue domain that can bind Ran·GTP with high affinity, form a ternary complex with Ran·GTP and importins, and co-activate RanGAP (27.Beddow A.L.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This domain is referred to as the Ran-binding domain or RanBD. Nup358 is a giant nucleoporin that is a component of the fibrils that extend into the cytosol from the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore and associates with a form of RanGAP that is modified via attachment of a small ubiquitin-like polypeptide, SUMO-1 or Smt3 (32.Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T.L. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 33.Matunis M.J. Wu J.A. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A related protein in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, Ranup96, contains 2 RanBDs (27.Beddow A.L. Richards S.A. Orem N.R. Macara I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the first RanBD (RanBD1) from Nup358, in a complex with Ran bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog (GppNHp), has been solved (34.Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). RanBD1 possesses a β-barrel fold, similar to those of pleckstrin homology, phosphotyrosine binding, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology-1 domains. The N terminus of RanBD1 loops around Ran, and the C-terminal extension of Ran almost completely encircles RanBD1, in a mutual embrace. The Switch I effector loop in Ran makes contact with an invariant sequence, EWKERG, within the RanBD (residues 66–71 in mouse RanBP1). Other conserved regions in the RanBD, such as an -RXXMRRD- motif (residues 87–93 in mouse RanBP1), also make direct contact with Ran. In contrast to Nup358, RanBP1 is a small (25 kDa) cytosolic protein. The budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) homolog of RanBP1, Yrb1, is essential for viability (35.Ouspenski I.I. Mueller U.W. Matynia A. Sazer S. Elledge S.J. Brinkley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1975-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and two temperature-sensitive mutations,yrb1-1 ts (E146D/F151S) andyrb1-2 ts (L55P) (numbering according to equivalent positions in mouse RanBP1), display defects in both nuclear protein import and RNA export (36.Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yrb1(E146D/F151S), but not Yrb1(L55P), still binds to activated (GTP-bound) yeast Ran, Gsp1(G21V), at the restrictive temperature (36.Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, in vivo, the yrb1-1 ts mutant shows a less pronounced phenotype than theyrb1-2 ts mutant with respect to nuclear protein import; interestingly, however, the potency of these same mutations in preventing RNA export is the reverse (36.Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yeast contains no obvious counterpart of Nup358, but other smaller proteins with less well conserved RanBDs are present, including Yrb2 and Nup2. However, unlike a yrbΔ1 null mutant, yrb2Δ andnup2Δ cells are viable. Thus, Yrb1 is most likely the primary agent available to bind to Ran·GTP in transport receptor complexes in the cytosol and to assist yeast RanGAP (Rna1) to catalyze GTP hydrolysis and dissociation of Ran·GTP from these complexes. There is some evidence, however, that RanBP1 and its homologs may possess other functions, distinct from Ran binding (37.Turi T.G. Mueller U.W. Sazer S. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9166-9171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38.Ouspenski I.I. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As one approach to examine the essential physiological function(s) of RanBP1, we first randomly mutagenized the RanBD segment of mouse RanBP1, generating a library of mutants, many of which contain alterations of conserved residues in the RanBD. Second, the RanBP1 mutants were expressed in and purified from bacteria and analyzed for the known biochemical properties of RanBP1. Finally, to correlate the defects observed in vitro (if any) with function in vivo, we examined the ability of each mutant RanBP1 to rescue viability of a yeast strain containing a novel temperature-sensitive allele, yrb1-51 ts (A53D) (numbered according to the equivalent position in mouse RanBP1), which shows dramatic defects in both nuclear protein import and RNA export at restrictive temperature. 2M.

This method utilized oligonucleotides synthesized in such a fashion that each position (other than the first 6 and last 6 bases) was spiked at 6% with a mixture of all four phosphoramidates, to give an error rate of about 0.045. The resulting oligonucleotides were then used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the murine RanBP1 in pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the template and a 3′-pGEX primer, using VentTM DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), so as to create a fragment encoding the 3′-end of the RanBP1 coding sequence. This product was then used in a second round of PCR together with a 5′-pGEX primer to produce the full-length RanBP1 coding sequence. The resulting PCR products were cut with BamHI and EcoRI and then ligated into pGEX-2T to create the library. Ligation was performed in a 100-μl volume, using all the digested DNA product, so as to obtain a representative library. Three sets of spiked oligonucleotides, corresponding to residues 29–43, 66–79, and 90–101 of the RanBD of RanBP1, were used. Colonies from the libraries were isolated at random, and the plasmid DNAs were sequenced to determine the location and number of mutations present. The method of Zhou et al. (39.Zhou Y.H. Zhang X.P. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) was used to introduce mutations within RanBP1 by limited template PCR using Taq DNA polymerase. Because the error rate of the Taq produces, on average, only one mutation per 600 base pairs in about 35% of the product, a Ran overlay assay was used to screen for mutations that reduced Ran binding. The PCR reaction contained 5′- and 3′-pGEX primers and wild-type RanBP1 in pGEX-2T as the template. The resulting product was cut with BamHI and EcoRI and religated into pGEX, as described above. After transformation into Escherichia coli strain DH5α, colonies were pooled to produce the library. The bacteria were then spread onto LB + ampicillin plates at a dilution so as to yield ∼1000 colonies per plate. Nitrocellulose filters soaked in 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) were laid onto the plates for 3 h. The filters were lifted, and bacterial colonies adhering to the filter were lysed, first by exposure to chloroform vapor for 30 min and second by incubation overnight in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA plus 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 mg of lysozyme/ml, 0.1 unit of DNase/ml, 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% SDS, and 0.05% Tween 20. The filters were then probed by incubation with Ran loaded with [α-32P]GTP, as described previously (40.Lounsbury K.M. Beddow A.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11285-11290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After exposure of the nitrocellulose to x-ray film to detect Ran-binding colonies, the film was compared with the agar plates, and colonies that did not give rise to positive spots in the overlay assay were picked for further examination. As a secondary screen, the colonies apparently deficient in Ran binding were grown in liquid culture in the presence of 1 mm IPTG for 3 h and then lysed, and the extracts were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of SDS. After transfer to nitrocellulose and a Ran overlay assay, the nitrocellulose was incubated with anti-GST antibodies to confirm that full-length GST-RanBP1 was being produced. Plasmids encoding full-length protein that exhibited defective Ran binding were sequenced to identify the location and number of the mutations present. To generate GST fusions to Ran, to RanGAP, to RCC1, and to the RanBP1 mutants of interest, DH5α transformed with the appropriate pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) construct was grown to A 600 nm = 1 and then induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4–16 h at 23 °C. The GST fusion proteins were purified from cell lysates using a glutathione-Sepharose matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and concentrated to 1 mg of protein/ml using a Centricon-10 device (Aminco). Where necessary, the GST was removed by cleavage with purified thrombin (provided by Paula Tracy, University of Vermont). Importin-5 (RanBP5) was expressed as an N-terminally (His)6-tagged protein from plasmid pQE70 (provided by Dirk Görlich, University of Heidelberg). S-tagged importin-β (provided by S. Adam, Northwestern University) was induced in bacterial strain BL21(DE3) containing a pET-p97 construct as described previously (41.Palacios I. Hetzer M. Adam S.A. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by binding to S-agarose. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay or from their calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm. Protein integrity during preparation was monitored by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue dye. Ran overlay assays were performed as described previously, using Ran loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (40.Lounsbury K.M. Beddow A.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11285-11290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solution binding assays were performed using 20 pmol of GST-RanBP1 (or mutants thereof) attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl of a 50:50 buffer:beads slurry). Ran that had been preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP (10 μm; 5 Ci/mmol) was incubated with the beads for 30 min on ice and then rapidly washed, and the amount of radioactivity retained was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Inhibition of RCC1-mediated GTP/GDP exchange on Ran was determined in a similar manner to that described previously, using recombinant RCC1 with [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Ran (42.Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32834-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, 80 pmol of Ran (produced by thrombin cleavage of GST-Ran) was loaded with 20 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) and then diluted 10-fold in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml. RCC1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein and cleaved from the GST using thrombin. The [α-32P]GTP:Ran was diluted into reaction buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 6.25 mmMgCl2, and 0.63 mm each of GDP, GTP, and NaH2 PO4) plus GST-RanBP1 (or mutants) at the desired concentration. RCC1 was added at time 0 to a final concentration of 1.5 nm, in a volume of 50 μl, at 30 °C. At 3 min, 20 μl of the sample was subjected to filter binding through nitrocellulose and quantitated by scintillation counting. GTP dissociation rate constants (k off) were calculated assuming simple exponential decay of a single species. Curves were fit to the RanBP1 inhibition data assuming a competitive inhibition model, using Kaleidagraph software. Co-activation of RanGAP by RanBP1 was measured using recombinant GST-mouse RanGAP (42.Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32834-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ran was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP, as described above. The Ran·[γ-32P]GTP complex was diluted into reaction buffer, plus the desired concentration of GST-RanBP1, and hydrolysis was initiated by addition of RanGAP to a final concentration of 2.5 nm, in 50 μl at 30 °C. Samples (20 μl) were removed after 3 min and filtered, as above. GTP hydrolysis rate constants (k cat) were determined assuming a single exponential, as above. Curves were fit to the data assuming that binding increases the rate constant for hydrolysis without altering the K m for RanGAP. To determine the ability of the RanBP1 mutants to facilitate RanGAP activity toward Ran·GTP in complex with an importin, importin-5 was used. N-terminally (His)6-tagged importin-5 was expressed in bacteria and purified using Ni2+-saturated nitrilotriacetic-agarose beads (43.Jakel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). GAP assays were performed essentially as described by Deane et al. (44.Deane R. Schafer W. Zimmermann H.P. Mueller L. Görlich D. Prehn S. Ponstingl H. Bischoff F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using 0.6 nm Ran that had been loaded with [γ-32P]GTP and preincubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of 40 nm GST RanBP1 and/or 40 nm importin-5. RanGAP was added to a final concentration of 400 nm, for 5 min at 30 °C, and [γ-32P]GTP remaining bound to the Ran was determined by filter binding, as described above. Assays of binding to importin-5 were performed in 1.0 ml of Ran binding buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 100 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween), using 8 nm importin-5, 20 nm GST-RanBP1, plus wild-type Ran (20 nm) that had been preloaded with GTP (28.Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After incubation at 4 °C for 90 min, complexes were captured onto glutathione-Sepharose beads (40 μl) and washed three times with binding buffer containing 0.1 mm GTP. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, bound proteins were detected using anti-Ran (Signal Transduction R32620/L1), anti-RanBP1 (Santa Cruz sc-1159), and anti-His (Qiagen anti-(His)5) antibodies. Binding to importin-β was performed using S-tagged importin-β attached to S-agarose beads (45.Chi N.C. Adam S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Formation of a GST-RanBP1·Ran·GDP·importin-β complex was performed in a similar manner, except that [α-32P]GDP-loaded Ran replaced Ran(G19V), and the complex was detected by washing the beads and counting for bound radioactivity. Two vectors were used for heterologous expression of RanBP1 in yeast. To obtain relatively high level expression, the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) was modified by introduction of a triple HA1 tag between the uniqueEcoRI/HindIII sites downstream of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. The tag was designed to possess BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites at its 3′-end, in the same reading frame as in pGEX-2T, so as to facilitate subcloning between the two vectors. The resulting vector was called pYESH3. To create a low copy version of this vector, the segment (SmaI-ClaI) containing the 2-μm DNA origin of replication was deleted and replaced with a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment (SpeI-ClaI) containing CEN4-ARS that was excised from yCplac33 and had its 5′-overhang filled in by incubation with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and all four dNTPs, yielding pYECH3. Wild-type and mutant RanBP1 coding sequences were transferred from pGEX into both pYESH3 and pYECH3. To express HA-tagged RanBP1 mutants at levels comparable with the endogenous Yrb1, the 570-base pair promoter region 5′ to theYRB1 gene was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR and subcloned (as a PstI-XbaI fragment) into yCplac22, yielding yCplacTY. The RanBP1 mutants of interest were then inserted into this vector, and the resulting plasmids were then introduced by DNA-mediated transformation into either yeast strain JY525 (MATa fus1Δ1 ura3-52 his4-Δ29 trp1-Δ63 ade2-101) or its otherwise isogenic derivative, JY604 (MATa yrb1-51 ts fus1Δ1 ura3-52 his4-Δ29 trp1-Δ63 ade2-101). Due to theyrb1-51 ts mutation strain JY604 cannot grow at a temperature above 30 °C, whereas the parental strain JY525 grows well, even at temperatures as high as 37 °C. Growth of JY604 at restrictive temperature is fully restored by expression of either YRB1 or mouse RanBP1 cDNA (HTF9a). 3J. Trueheart and J. Thorner, unpublished observations. Transformants were selected on synthetic medium containing 2% glucose but lacking uracil (SCGlc-Ura) at 20 °C. The resulting colonies were grown in liquid SCGlc-Ura medium under the same conditions and then patched onto agar plates containing the same medium with either glucose (2%) or galactose plus raffinose (2% each) as the carbon source and incubated either at 20 or 37 °C. To detect expression of the HA-tagged RanBP1 mutants in yeast, JY604 transformants were grown overnight in 5 ml of SCGlc-Ura at 23 °C. When the cultures reached an A 600 nm = 1.0, 3 ml of each was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of SCGal/Raf-Ura and incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. The yeast were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with water, resuspended in 0.1 ml of water containing protease inhibitors (4 μmaprotinin, 30 μm leupeptin, and 250 μmPMSF), and disrupted by addition of boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by vigorous vortex mixing with glass beads. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and the protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed for expression of the (HA1)3-tagged RanBP1 proteins by immunoblotting with an anti-HA1 monoclonal antibody (12CA5). Libraries of RanBP1 mutants containing mutations within the RanBD sequence were constructed in two ways (see under “Experimental Procedures”). For the libraries of mutants produced using spiked oligonucleotides, no selection or screen was performed because mutations were introduced at a defined rate and within a known region of the RanBD. Rather, clones were chosen at random and sequenced. Mutant sequences were obtained at a frequency of about 15%. To identify mutants from the library obtained using template-limited PCR, we developed and applied an overlay method for screening colonies to assess the ability of the RanBP1 mutants to associate with Ran·GTP (Fig. 1). Bacteria containing pGEX alone or mutated pGEX-RanBP1 were plated onto LB agar plus ampicillin and grown overnight. To induce expression of GST or the GST fusion proteins, the colonies were overlaid with a nitrocellulose filter soaked in IPTG and incubated for 3 h. Colonies adherent to the filter were lysed, and the released filter-bound proteins were incubated with [α-32P]GTP:Ran and then washed to remove unbound probe. Colonies expressing GST alone did not retain detectable radioactivity, upon exposure to x-ray film. In contrast, colonies expressing GST-RanBP1 bound [α-32P]GTP:Ran, and the exposed film could be readily aligned with the original colonies. Moreover, it was relatively easy to identify coloni"

In order to test the proposed charge and hydrogen bonding roles in catalytic function, each lysine has been changed to an uncharged methionine or alanine, and the histidine has been altered to asparagine. The resultant enzyme variants are all tetramers like the wild type enzyme; however, circular dichroism spectra show reductions in helix content for the K245*M and K269M mutants. (The asterisk denotes that the residue is in the second subunit.) Four mutants have k cat reductions of ∼103–104-fold in AdoMet synthesis; however, the k cat of K165*M variant is only reduced 2-fold. In each mutant, there is a smaller catalytic impairment in the partial reaction of tripolyphosphate hydrolysis. The K165*A enzyme has a 100-fold greater k cat for tripolyphosphate hydrolysis than the wild type enzyme, but this mutant is not activated by AdoMet in contrast to the wild type enzyme. The properties of these mutants require reassessment of the catalytic roles of these residues.

AdoMet plays a myriad of biological roles including acting as the primary methyl group donor in all organisms and as a precursor to the polyamines, as well as a precursor to the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical used by some enzymes (1.Usdin E.

The synthetic reaction is composed of two sequential steps, AdoMet formation and the subsequent hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate (PPPi), which occurs prior to release of AdoMet from the enzyme, as depicted below. L­Methionine+ATP+H2O→(AdoMet+PPPi)+H2O→Equation 1 AdoMet+PPi+PiThe structural and mechanistic properties of AdoMet synthetase have been extensively studied in the Escherichia coli metKenzyme, which is a tetramer of identical 383-residue subunits (10.Markham G.D.

The crystal structure of E. coli AdoMet synthetase has been solved as the apoenzyme and in the presence of ADP and Pi(which arose from enzymatic ATP hydrolysis in the crystals) as well as with the bound products PPi and Pi (17.Takusagawa F.

A binding site for the product AdoMet has been proposed based on NMR studies; crystals of complexes with AdoMet or methionine have not been found. The polar active site residues are all conserved in the more than 30 reported AdoMet synthetase sequences. Although naturally occurring human variants have been recently discovered in patients with familial hypermethioninemia (21.Chamberlin M.E. Ubagai T. Mudd S.H. Levy H.L. Chou J.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 540-546PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Chamberlin M.E. Ubagai T. Mudd S.H. Wilson W.G. Leonard J.V. Chou J.Y. J. Clin.

Genet. 1997; 75: 395-400Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the only variation in an active site residue is at an arginine whose crucial role in the E. coli enzyme has been characterized (15.Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The active site of the enzyme resides between two subunits, with contributions from side chains of residues from both subunits (Fig.1). The phosphate groups bind at the bottom of a deep cavity with the adenosyl group nearer the entrance (19.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Within the active site are four lysines, two from each subunit, and a histidine residue (a residue from the second subunit is denoted by an asterisk; e.g. His-14*, Lys-165*, Lys-245*, Lys-265, Lys-269). When suggesting the possible roles of these residues, it must be recalled that the available crystal structures are of a product complex and the products of a side reaction; thus, the structures of the active complexes may differ in detail from the structures observed to date, particularly since one substrate (or product) is absent in each of the available structures. The side chain of lysine 269 appears to interact with the N-3 of the adenine ring; however, slight rotations of the side chain would bring it near O-5′ to facilitate C-5′–O-5′ bond cleavage during AdoMet formation. The other four side chains of interest are also positioned near the sites of catalytic action; Lys-165* may hydrogen-bond to one of the oxygens of the β-phosphoryl group, perhaps to facilitate the hydrolytic reaction. Lys-245* is near the Pi, which originates as the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP and thus could participate in catalysis of hydrolysis; Lys-265 lies intermediate between the α- and γ-phosphoryl groups and could be involved in either reaction. Histidine 14* is also near the β-phosphoryl group; it is unclear whether the imidazole of His-14* is protonated; however, the proximity to the positively charged lysines and the two active site Mg2+ ions suggests that it might not be protonated, in which case it could function to aid in deprotonation of the water that is involved in the hydrolytic reaction. Alternatively, it was noted that a slight rearrangement of the active site in the presence of ATP could make a protonated side chain of His-14* a proton donor to O-5′ to facilitate C-5′–O-5′ bond cleavage (19.Takusagawa F. Kamitori S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present studies, the active site histidine residue (His-14*) has been changed to asparagine to remove potential proton donor and electrostatic contributions to binding and catalysis while attempting to maintain steric and (altered) hydrogen bonding capabilities. The lysine residues (Lys-165*, Lys-245*, Lys-265, and Lys-269) have been changed to methionine to remove charge and hydrogen bonding contributions while maintaining steric bulk to as great an extent as possible; the K265M mutant was unstable, thus the residue was also changed to alanine so that potentially detrimental hydrophobicity of the side chain would be reduced. In a complementary approach, we have examined the activity of the enzyme with the ATP analogs A(NH)TP, which has a C-NH-P linkage and therefore would require a proton donor to be a substrate, and 3-deaza-ATP to provide a further probe of the importance of hydrogen bonding to N-3 of the purine. The properties of these mutants and the behavior of alternate substrates provide insight into the important side chain properties for both enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless noted. AdoMet was purchased from Research Biochemicals International.l-[methyl-14C]Methionine was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Ecoscint scintillation fluid was purchased from National Diagnostics. A(NH)TP was synthesized by the reaction of 5′-amino-5′-deoxyadenosine with trimetaphosphate (24.Trowbridge D.B. Yamamoto D.M. Kenyon G.L. J. Am. Chem Soc. 1972; 94: 3816-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25.Letsinger R.L. Wolkes J.S. Dumas L.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The nucleoside (0.22 meq of the tosylate salt) was incubated with sodium trimetaphosphate (0.88 meq) in 2.2 ml of water at pH 11 for 2 days at room temperature; the pH decreased during the reaction and was occasionally adjusted back by the addition of KOH. The reaction was diluted to 25 ml, and the product was purified by ion exchange chromatography on a 50-ml column of Source-Q15 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with three volumes of water and then eluted with a linear gradient to 1 m triethylamine bicarbonate, pH 9. The UV-absorbing peak that eluted near 0.35m triethylamine bicarbonate was taken to dryness under vacuum, with additions of Tris base to maintain the pH above 8, since this type of compound readily reverts to the starting material below neutral pH (25.Letsinger R.L. Wolkes J.S. Dumas L.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 292-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A(NH)TP was obtained in 45% yield based on the nucleoside. At pH 8.5, proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra, not previously reported, showed peaks at −0.9 ppm (doublet,P α, J αβ = 20 Hz), −6.1 ppm (doublet, P γ,J βγ = 20 Hz), and −21.6 ppm (triplet,P β). In the absence of 1H decoupling, the resonance at −0.9 ppm was a multiplet with a 10-Hz coupling to the NH proton and broadening from smaller couplings to H-5′, 5′′. 3-Deaza-ATP was prepared by phosphorylation of the nucleoside with POCl3 as described by Sowa and Ouchii (26.Sowa T. Ouchi S. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1975; 48: 2084-2090Crossref Google Scholar). The monophosphate was isolated by ion exchange chromatography as described for A(NH)TP. The nucleotide (10 μmol) was converted to the triphosphate enzymatically using 50 units of adenylate kinase fromBacillus steareothermophilus and 100 units of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase in 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes/KOH, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2. A 4-fold molar excess of phospho(enol)pyruvate was used, and the reaction was primed with a 1% molar equivalent of A(S)TP (10.Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since A(S)TP is readily separated from ATP, and it is not a substrate for AdoMet synthetase. The reaction was monitored by ion exchange HPLC on Mono-Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the 3-deaza-ATP was isolated as described for A(NH)TP; 31P, 1H, and ultraviolet spectra were consistent with the expected structure. The E. coli strains used were XL1-Blue (an E. coli K12 derivative) and RSR15(DE3) (anE. coli B derivative). RSR15(DE3) is a metKderivative of strain BL21(DE3); extracts of this strain have no detectable AdoMet synthetase activity (14.Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18484-18495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in mutagenesis were prepared in the Fannie Ripple Biotechnology Facility at the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Mutants were constructed using the Quikchange kit (Strategene). The plasmid used was pT7K (14.Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18484-18495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which has the E. coli metK gene inserted between the PstI and EcoRI sites of plasmid pT7–6. Plasmid DNA was extracted from ampicillin-resistant transformants using the Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA Purification System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Mutants were identified by automated DNA sequencing. In each case, the complete DNA sequence confirmed that only the desired mutations were introduced. Plasmids were transformed into strain RSR15(DE3) for protein isolation. Cultures were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenecillin. Following overnight growth, protein expression was enhanced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 30 min prior to harvesting. Mutant proteins accounted for ∼10–20% of the total cellular protein. A standard purification protocol was used to isolate both wild type and mutant AdoMet synthetases (14.Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18484-18495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The procedure consisted of ammonium sulfate fraction followed by successive chromatography on the hydrophobic interaction matrix phenyl-Sepharose HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then hydroxylapatite CHT-I (Bio-Rad), followed by weak anion exchange resin aminohexyl-Sepharose (EAH-4B; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All characterized AdoMet synthetases were electrophoretically homogeneous. AdoMet synthetases were analyzed for oligomerization state by native gel electrophoresis on 8–25% gradient gels (14.Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18484-18495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Secondary structure was assessed by circular dichroism spectra recorded on an Aviv Model 62A spectropolarimeter. Samples (0.3 mg/ml protein in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mm KCl, pH 8.0) were placed in 1-mm path length cells; spectra were recorded from 200 to 260 nm and were corrected for buffer contributions. When present, the AdoMet concentration was 0.1 mm. AdoMet synthetase activity was determined by the [14C]AdoMet filter binding method (10.Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in the presence of 0.01–0.5 mml-[methyl-14C]methionine (1.9 mCi/mmol), 0.05–15 mm ATP (Tris+ form) in 50 mm Hepes·(CH3)4N+ at pH 8.0 with 50 mm KCl and 50 mmMgCl2. The tripolyphosphatase activity was determined by quantifying orthophosphate production (27.Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 168: 1-4Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 28.Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Assays contained 3–500 μm PPPi (Na+ salt) in 50 mm Hepes·(CH3)4N+ at pH 7.8 with 10 mm KCl and 10 mmMgCl2. AdoMet synthetase-catalyzed hydrolysis of A(NH)TP to A(NH)DP was followed by coupling diphosphate formation to NADH oxidation using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (10.Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); NADH oxidation was followed at 340 nm. Substrate saturation data were evaluated using the kinetic equations of Cleland (29.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar) as implemented in the program Scientist (MicroMath, Inc.) or the Enzfitter program (Elsevier Biosoft). The six mutants constructed have varying physical properties, ranging from indistinguishable from wild type in secondary and quaternary structure (H14*N, K165*M, K265A) to tetrameric but with reduced helical content (K245*M, K269M) to unstable and refractory to purification (K265M). The variation in secondary structure is illustrated by the circular dichroism spectra shown in Fig. 2; the 220-nm trough reflective of helical content is substantially reduced in the K245*M and K269*M variants. This is consistent with locations observed in the crystal structure, where residues Lys-245* and Lys-269 are located at the beginning of helices, whereas residues His-14* and Lys-265 are located in coil regions, and Lys-165* is in a β-sheet. Each of the mutations affects the catalytic behavior of the enzyme, especially the AdoMet synthesis activity, in all but K165*M (TablesI and II; illustrated graphically in Fig. 3). As a result of the variation in physical properties, the mutants are discussed individually in terms of their catalytic properties and the functional implications.

Uncertainties in k cat (mol of product formed/mol of enzyme active site/s) are within 15%, and uncertainties inK m or K a are within 20%. Tripolyphosphatase activity was measured in the presence and absence of 40 μm AdoMet as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Uncertainties in k cat values are within 15%, and uncertainties in K m orK a values are within 20% unless noted. The AdoMet synthetase activity of the H14*N mutant is reduced by 104-fold, with less than a 50% change in substrate K m values. In the PPPihydrolysis reaction, the k cat in the absence of AdoMet is reduced 16-fold, with a 55-fold increase inK m. The presence of AdoMet results in a 6-fold decrease in the K m and a 10-fold increase ink cat for PPPi hydrolysis, yielding a much more efficient enzyme; this k cat value is 165-fold higher than the k cat for AdoMet synthesis, showing that the first step in the overall reaction has been preferentially impaired. The AdoMet-induced 10-fold increase ink cat is comparable with the 20-fold increase seen with the wild type enzyme and appears to be a property shared by mutants that do not affect the protein interactions with AdoMet. However, the affinity for AdoMet is decreased 35-fold; this is the only mutation that we have found to have an effect on AdoMet affinity; from the crystal structure, this would appear to be an indirect effect. Since the change corresponds to only 2.1 kcal/mol, a modest change in hydrogen bonding or environmental polarity could be responsible. The interpretation of the observations in terms of the crystal structure is facilitated, since the physical properties of this mutant are indistinguishable from the wild type enzyme. The much larger effect on AdoMet formation than PPPi hydrolysis supports the suggestion that ATP binds slightly deeper in the active site than is seen in the ADP complex, and H14* acts as a proton donor to O-5′ during AdoMet formation. A protonated imidazole side chain is consistent with the inability to inactivate the enzyme with histidine-selective chemical modifying reagents such as diethylpyrocarbonate (10.Markham G.D.

In order to independently test the interactions with O-5′ proposed from the crystal structures, we examined the behavior of the wild type enzyme with the C-NH-P-linked ATP analog A(NH)TP, which would require a proton donor to be a substrate. No substrate activity was detected at 2 mm, <0.1% of the activity of ATP. The lack of activity of A(NH)TP is analogous to the lack of substrate activity of the C-S-P-linked compound A(S)TP, although in that case the lack of activity might be attributed to the poor hydrogen bonding ability of the sulfur (10.Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of methionine, A(NH)TP was a substrate for the ATPase activity of the enzyme, with a K m of 0.14 mm and a k cat of 0.03 s−1; the rate was not altered by the presence of 1 mm methionine. This k cat is larger than that for hydrolysis of ATP (10−3 s−1,K m = 1.3 mm) but less than the value of 2.2 s−1 for A(S)TP (K m = 0.6 mm). Thus, for AdoMet synthetase, A(NH)TP is a better analog of ATP than A(S)TP. However, the combined mutagenesis and substrate analog results do not resolve whether O-5′ must be protonated for AdoMet synthesis. This mutation has minimal effects on the AdoMet synthetase reaction, a 2-fold decrease in k catand a 3-fold increase in the K m for methionine. Remarkably, the k cat enzyme for hydrolysis of PPPi by this enzyme is 100-fold greater than the wild type enzyme in the absence of AdoMet. However, theK m for PPPi increased more than 600-fold; thus, the enzyme is not particularly efficient. AdoMet causes an ∼5-fold decrease in the K m for PPPiand a 6-fold decrease in k cat. The mutants that we had previously found to lack AdoMet stimulation of the PPPi hydrolytic rate were near the proposed methionine binding site, D118N and D238*N (16.Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32909-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but Lys-165* is not near this site in the structure. The roles of Lys-165* and His-14* would appear similar based on the crystallographic data alone; however, the mutations at these residues have drastically different effects, suggesting that in the truly functional structures these amino acids are in slightly different positions than observed to date. This variant has the lowest AdoMet synthetase activity of any mutant that we have studied, 42,000-fold lower than the wild type enzyme. The altered CD spectrum of the enzyme demonstrates that the protein is conformationally modified and makes interpretation of the kinetic data in terms of residue function ambiguous. Nevertheless, the K m values for both ATP and methionine are within 20% of the wild type values, suggesting that the binding sites are not grossly disrupted. The k cat for the PPPi hydrolysis is reduced by a relatively meager 155-fold in the presence of AdoMet, and the K m is 24-fold increased. In the absence of AdoMet, the PPPi hydrolysis reaction is undetectable, <0.1% of the wild type activity. Although AdoMet activates the enzyme for PPPi hydrolysis, it does not alter the circular dichroism spectrum of the protein, indicating that activation does not result from a large structural change. The large decrease in the k cat for PPPihydrolysis in the absence of AdoMet and the recovery of activity in the presence of AdoMet are reminiscent of the behavior of mutants at the Mg2+ binding residue Asp-16* (D16*A and D16*N (16.Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32909-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). The crystallographic data show that Asp-16* is spatially adjacent to Lys-245* (Fig. 1); mutations at Asp-16* cause a 1000-fold reduction in the k cat for AdoMet synthesis, with less than 1.5-fold increase in K m values; these mutations do not cause alterations in CD spectra. The effects of mutations at Lys-245* and Asp-16* may both reflect the impaired ability to neutralize the negative charge that develops during hydrolysis (with Asp-16 acting through positioning a Mg2+ that coordinates all three phosphoryl groups) and the ability of AdoMet to modify the protein conformation to reduce the detrimental impact of the alteration. The effects of the K245*M mutation are significantly different from the effects of mutations at the adjacent arginine 244* (15.Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although in the crystal structures both residues interact with the Pi. The R244*L mutation causes a 1000-fold decrease ink cat and ∼10-fold increases inK m for both ATP and methionine, whereas the K245*M has a 40-fold greater impairment of k cat without changes in K m values. Furthermore, the effects onk cat and K m for PPPi hydrolysis are more than 10-fold larger for the K245*M mutant. Thus, the detailed roles of these residues in AdoMet synthesis appear distinct, with Lys-245* having a primary role in transition state stabilization and Arg-244* having a role in both ground state and transition state interactions. The K265M mutant was unstable and lost at different stages of several independent purifications. Although this protein appears to have trace activity, the specific activity could not be reliably quantified. Since Lys-265 lies at the beginning of a helix, we constructed the K265A mutant to maintain helix forming propensity while decreasing the bulk hydrophobicity of the side chain. The circular dichroism spectrum of the K265A mutant shows no difference from the wild type enzyme. This mutant had a 10,000-fold decrease ink cat for AdoMet synthesis and increases in theK m values for ATP and methionine of 47- and 7-fold. In contrast, the PPPi hydrolytic rate in the absence of AdoMet is 3.5-fold greater than the wild type enzyme, although theK m is increased 75-fold. Thek cat does not increase in the presence of AdoMet, although the K m decreases 7-fold. While these properties resemble those of the K165*M mutant and the previously studied methionine binding site mutants, this residue is not near the proposed methionine binding site. In the crystal structures, Lys-265 is hydrogen-bonded to Asp-271, a ligand to a Mg2+ ion. The D271N and D721A mutants have 20-fold less impairment of thek cat for AdoMet synthesis than the K265A mutant and no changes in K m values; however, these were 4–5-fold more impaired in the k cat for PPPi hydrolysis in the presence and absence of AdoMet than is the K265M mutant. These comparisons suggest that the increasedK m values for the K265A mutant may reflect minor conformational alterations rather than changes in specific enzyme-substrate interactions. This mutant at an adenine binding residue was structurally altered from the wild type enzyme; circular dichroism spectra indicated a reduction in α-helix content, consistent with its position at the beginning of helix. The kinetics of the AdoMet synthetase reaction show not only a 2100-fold decrease ink cat but an 89-fold increase in theK m for methionine with only a 1.5-fold increase in the K m for ATP. This is the first mutant that we have found that has a selectively increased K m for methionine. In the PPPi hydrolytic reaction, while thek cat is reduced 4-fold in the absence of AdoMet (and the K m is increased 7-fold), the notable feature is that the k cat is only enhanced 3-fold by AdoMet, in contrast to the 20-fold for the wild type enzyme. The modest AdoMet enhancement of the k cat is reminiscent of mutants at other residues proposed to be near the methionine binding site, Asp-118 and Asp-238* (12.Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9063-9068Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the affinity for AdoMet is only decreased 2.5-fold by the mutation. The NMR model for AdoMet binding does not indicate a role for the ε-amino group of Lys-269 in binding, since the methionyl side chain points away from any position readily occupied by Lys-269. While the size of smaller Met-269 side chain could reduce favorable interactions, it as likely that the effects are indirect and result from the conformational alterations. Like the wild type enzyme, AdoMet does not prompt alterations in the circular dichroism spectrum of the protein, showing that catalytic function is not trivially related to this measurement of protein structure. In order to further test the importance of hydrogen bonding to N-3 of ATP, we synthesized 3-deaza-ATP and characterized its activity as a substrate, since it cannot form the putative hydrogen bond with Lys-269. With the wild type enzyme, 3-deaza-ATP was a poor substrate, with a K m of 0.29 mm, or 2.6-fold higher than the K m for ATP, and ak cat 468-fold lower than found with ATP. Thus, the data do not support an important role for the amino group of Lys-269 in binding the adenine ring in enzyme-substrate complexes, although an interaction is apparently important in catalysis. The mutants reported here were constructed to clarify the functions of the conserved active site basic residues, roles that were unclear based on the crystallographic and NMR data. The preferential impairment of AdoMet formation seen in most of these mutants is common with the seven of the eight other residues that we have studied by mutagenesis: the K+ binding glutamate 42 residue (13.McQueney M.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the reactive cysteines, Cys-89 and Cys-239 (14.Reczkowski R.S. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18484-18495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the active site arginine 244* (15.Reczkowski R.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13499-13506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the two Mg2+ binding aspartates, and the aspartate 238* that interacts with the α-amino group of methionine/AdoMet (16.Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32909-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The K165*M mutant resembles the D118N mutant, which affects a side chain that is proposed to interact with the sulfur of methionine/AdoMet, in comparably reducingk cat values for both AdoMet synthesis and AdoMet-activated PPPi hydrolysis, and this is due to AdoMet inhibition rather than activation of the PPPi hydrolysisk cat (16.Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32909-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all of the mutations thus far studied have had effects on AdoMet synthesis despite varying locations in the protein structure. The most remarkable change in catalytic capability found in this set of mutants is the 100-fold increase in PPPi hydrolytic activity seen with the K165*M enzyme; however, the K m value is increased more than 600-fold, rendering it ineffective at low PPPiconcentrations. While it is unlikely that there was evolutionary effort to optimize the PPPi hydrolytic reaction, it is interesting to find that the maximal catalytic activity of the enzyme can be enhanced in at least in one reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2029972799,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the mechanism of interaction between the catalytic subunit of human protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1cγ) and members of the calyculin family of toxins. Clavosines A and B are related to calyculins but are glycosylated with a trimethoxy rhamnose group. We provide experimental evidence implicating Tyr-134 as an important residue in PP-1cγ that mediates interactions with the calyculins. Mutation of Tyr-134 to Phe, to prevent hydrogen bond formation, resulted in a slight increase in sensitivity of PP-1cγ to clavosines A and B and calyculin A. In contrast, a Y134A mutant was 10-fold less sensitive to inhibition by all three inhibitors. The greatest effect on inhibition was found by substituting an Asp for Tyr-134 in the phosphatase. Clavosine B inhibited PP-1cγ Y134D with a 310-fold decrease in potency. Clavosine A and calyculin A were also markedly poorer inhibitors of this mutant. These results suggest that a hydrogen bond between Tyr-134 and the calyculins is unlikely to be essential for inhibitor binding to the phosphatase. The clavosines and calyculin A were tested for their ability to inhibit other mutants of PP-1cγ (including Ile-133, Val-223, and Cys-291). Our mutagenesis studies provide an experimental basis for assessing models of calyculin binding found in the literature (Lindvall, M. K., Pihko, P. M., and Koskinen, A. M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23312–23316; Gupta, V., Ogawa, A. K., Du, X., Houk, K. N., and Armstrong, R. W. (1997) J. Med. Chem. 40, 3199–3206; Gauss, C. M., Sheppeck, I. J., Nairn, A. C., and Chamberlain, R. (1997)Bioorg. Med. Chem. 5, 1751–1773). A new model for clavosine and calyculin A binding to PP-1c is presented that is consistent with previous structure-function experiments and which accommodates key structural features of the clavosines, including the novel rhamnose moiety.

Potts M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 372-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.-P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic protein phosphatases are inhibited by a structurally diverse array of natural product toxins. These include the polyether okadaic acid from marine dinoflagellates, cyclic peptide microcystins and nodularins from cyanobacteria, and the spiroketal calyculins isolated from marine sponges (3.MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 17: 444-447Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The first member of the calyculin family of phosphatase inhibitors was identified in 1986 (4.Kato Y. Fusetani N. Matsunaga S. Hashimoto K. Fujita S. Furuya T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2780-2781Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Calyculin A was originally purified from a hydrophobic extract of the marine sponge Discodermia calyx. It was found to be cytotoxic toward P388 and L1210 leukemia cells and to be a strong inhibitor of starfish egg development (4.Kato Y. Fusetani N. Matsunaga S. Hashimoto K. Fujita S. Furuya T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2780-2781Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 5.Kato Y. Fusetani N. Matsunaga S. Hashimoto K. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1988; 14: 723-728PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently characterized as a powerful inhibitor of the catalytic subunits of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases, PP-1c1 and PP-2Ac, two of the four major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatases (6.Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Calyculin A was also shown to have tumor-promoting activity as potent as that of okadaic acid (7.Suganuma M. Fujiki H.

Chem. 1997; 62: 2636-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), have since been identified. Recently we reported the isolation of two novel glycosylated members of the calyculin family, clavosines A and B from the marine spongeMyriastra clavosa (15.Fu X. Schmitz F.J. Kelly-Borges M. McCready T.L. Holmes C.F.B. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 7957-7963Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Clavosines A and B are potent inhibitors of mammalian PP-1c and PP-2Ac and were found to be more cytotoxic overall than the calyculins and the calyculinamides (14.Dumdei E.J. Blunt J.W. Munro M.H.G. Pannell L.K. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 2636-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15.Fu X. Schmitz F.J. Kelly-Borges M. McCready T.L. Holmes C.F.B. J. Org.

Res. 1995; 34: 91-109Crossref Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The polyfunctional structure of clavosines A and B and calyculin A is depicted in linear diagrams (Fig. 1 a) and space filling models (Fig. 1 b). The clavosines (Fig.1) have many structural features in common with the calyculins but differ markedly from them in having a methyl group at C-32 and an unusual trimethoxy rhamnose group at position C-21. Like the calyculinamides, and unlike calyculin A, the clavosines possess an amide at the end of their tetraene tail, as found in the calyculinamides (14.Dumdei E.J. Blunt J.W. Munro M.H.G. Pannell L.K. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 2636-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Clavosine A differs from clavosine B in having Z (cis) rather than E (trans) geometry at the C-2=C-3 double bond. Despite the large number of calyculins identified and characterized, we lack a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their interactions with the protein phosphatases. The mode of interaction of calyculin family members with protein phosphatases is controversial (17.Gauss C.M. Sheppeck I.J. Nairn A.C. Chamberlain R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1751-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18.Gupta V. Ogawa A.K. Du X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19.Lindvall M.K. Pihko P.M. Koskinen A.M.P. J. Biol.

Lett. 1993; 3: 1029-1034Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several models found in the literature are based on the assumption that the phosphate-containing calyculins bind in the same fashion as a phosphorylated substrate or inhibitor. However, a dephosphorylated analog of calyculin A has been found to strongly inhibit PP-1c and PP-2Ac (12.Matsunaga S. Wakimoto T. Fusetani N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 3763-3764Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests that the phosphate group may not play a major role in the interaction of calyculin A with these protein phosphatases. Recently, the NMR solution structures of calyculin A and dephosphonocalyculin A were determined (21.Volter K.E. Pierens G.K. Quinn R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The structure of dephosphonocalyculin A was found to be quite similar to that of calyculin A in both methanol and chloroform, implying that the phosphate group is not solely responsible for determining or stabilizing the calyculin structure. To evaluate the roles played by specific amino acid residues in clavosine binding to PP-1c, we have prepared a series of PP-1c mutants. In this study we have characterized the effects of these mutations on the ability of clavosines A and B and calyculin A to inhibit PP-1c. We have exploited this data to develop structural models that describe features important in mediating interactions between the clavosines and PP-1c. Clavosines were purified as described previously (15.Fu X. Schmitz F.J. Kelly-Borges M. McCready T.L. Holmes C.F.B. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 7957-7963Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Calyculin A was obtained from Calbiochem. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The cDNA encoding PP-1cγ was cloned from a human teratocarcinoma NT2 cDNA library (Stratagene) and subcloned into pBluescriptSK (Stratagene). The PP-1cγ insert was sequenced in its entirety and compared with the published sequence of the γ-isoform (22.Norman S.A. Mott D.M. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). PP-1cγ mutants were generated using the QuikChange Mutagenesis kit and nativePfu polymerase (Stratagene). All mutant constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. Fragments comprising the wild-type and mutant PP-1cγ cDNA sequences were cloned into the expression vector pCW (generously provided by Dr. Dahlquist, University of Oregon) 17 bases downstream of the promoter and transformed into theEscherichia coli strain DH5α. The recombinant PP-1cγ enzymes (Y134F, Y134A, Y134D, V223A, V223C, I133Y, and C291A) were expressed and purified to homogeneity as described previously (23.Craig M. Luu H.A. McCready T.L. Williams D.

Preparations of PP-1cγ mutants had specific activities comparable to wild-type recombinant PP-1cγ. Protein phosphatase-1 inhibition was assayed using 10 μm[32P]phosphorylase a substrate as described previously (25.Holmes C.F.B. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Control phosphatase activity was standardized to 15% release of total phosphate from the substrate for each enzyme. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate, and assays were performed in duplicate. Reactions involving the clavosines were performed under low light conditions to prevent photochemical isomerization of the terminal tetraene unit. Structures and binding models were generated on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2T. L. McCready and C. F. B. Holmes, manuscript in preparation.

Docking simulations were performed using the extensible subset forcefield with the fixed docking method of Insight II. Energy minimization was performed using the Discover 3 (ver. 3.0) module of Insight II with the extensible subset forcefield. The structure of Calyculin A (4.Kato Y. Fusetani N. Matsunaga S. Hashimoto K. Fujita S. Furuya T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2780-2781Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (code DUPSUW). In contrast to previous work published in collaboration with our laboratory (26.Bagu J.R. Sykes B.D. Craig M.M. Holmes C.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), this calyculin A structure was inverted to obtain the correct, natural enantiomer (27.Matsunaga S. Fusetani N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 5605-5606Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the absolute configurations of the clavosines have not been determined, they are assumed to be the same as those established for calyculins (15.Fu X. Schmitz F.J. Kelly-Borges M. McCready T.L. Holmes C.F.B. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 7957-7963Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Charges were adjusted to −2 for the phosphate group, but the dimethylamine was maintained in the free base form (27.Matsunaga S. Fusetani N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 5605-5606Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic coordinates of PP-1cα bound to microcystin-LR (28.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code1FJM). Chain B of the structure was deleted, as was microcystin-LR and all water molecules. To complete the structure, amino acid side chains only partially detected by crystallographic methods were added, as were hydrogens appropriate for pH 7. Docking was carried out with half of the amino acid residues of PP-1c (those comprising the active site “face” of the protein) designated as the ligand-binding subset. We employed Metropolis docking at a temperature of 300 K with 200 minimization steps between structure evaluations. Several starting positions were investigated for each inhibitor. The lowest energy structures generated were examined and subjected to a more rigorous energy minimization using Discover 3. Promising structures were used as the starting position for a second round of docking. During minimization of the docked models, subsets of the protein were defined so that amino acid residues within 10 Å of the inhibitor were allowed to be flexible, while the rest of the protein was held fixed. The PP-1c-inhibitor complex was soaked with water molecules at a thickness of 5 Å and minimized to a convergence of 0.05 kcal/mol/Å using the steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms. Clavosine A inhibited PP-1cγ and PP-2Ac (Fig. 2, IC50 = 0.5 and 0.6 nm, respectively) with virtually identical potency to calyculin A (Fig.2, IC50 = 0.7 and 0.5 nm, respectively). These data presumably reflect the similarities in orientation and overall structure of calyculin A and clavosine A. Clavosine B inhibited recombinant PP-1cγ with decreased potency (IC50 = 13 nm) but was almost as effective a PP-2Ac inhibitor (IC50 = 1.2 nm) as clavosine A or calyculin A. Whereas the C-2/C-3 E geometry of clavosine B resulted in a >25-fold increase in IC50 for this compound against PP-1cγ, this increase could not be attributed to the presence of a bulky rhamnose group, because clavosine A was as potent a protein phosphatase inhibitor as calyculin A. To further understand the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of PP-1cγ by the clavosines, we examined the inhibitory effects of these toxins on a number of mutants of PP-1cγ. The crystal structure of microcystin-LR bound to PP-1c (28.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and molecular modeling studies of microcystins and okadaic acid bound to PP-1 (17.Gauss C.M. Sheppeck I.J. Nairn A.C. Chamberlain R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1751-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18.Gupta V. Ogawa A.K. Du X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggest that Tyr-134 may be important for interaction with calyculins and clavosines. Three Tyr-134 PP-1cγ mutants allowed us to thoroughly investigate the role this amino acid residue plays in inhibition of the phosphorylase aphosphatase activity of PP-1cγ by the clavosines and calyculin A (Fig. 3). The first mutant was PP-1cγ Y134F, in which the potential for hydrogen bonding with bound toxins was abolished with the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation. The second mutant was Y134A, in which both the hydroxyl and hydrophobic aromatic ring were replaced by an alanine sidechain. The third mutant was Y134D, in which an aspartic acid residue was inserted to introduce a negative charge in this region. PP-1cγ Y134F was inhibited by clavosine A, clavosine B, and calyculin A slightly more strongly (IC50 = 0.2, 9.5, and 0.3 nm, respectively) than wild-type recombinant PP-1cγ (IC50 = 0.5, 13, and 0.7 nm, respectively). In contrast, Y134A was inhibited less potently by clavosine A, clavosine B, and calyculin A (IC50 = 5.5, 145, and 2 nm, respectively). Y134D was significantly resistant to inhibition by clavosine A, clavosine B, and calyculin A (IC50 = 93, 4050, and 125 nm, respectively). Calcineurin (protein phosphatase-2B) is a protein phosphatase homologous to PP-1 but strongly resistant to inhibition by calyculin A (3.MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 17: 444-447Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In calcineurin the residue corresponding to Val-223 in PP-1cγ is a cysteine (Cys-256). It was therefore of interest to mutate PP-1cγ Val-223 to Ala and Cys in order to determine whether this residue may be involved in clavosine inhibition of PP-1cγ (Fig.4). PP-1cγ V223C was inhibited by clavosine A, clavosine B, and calyculin A with similar potency (IC50 = 0.6, 22, and 0.9 nm, respectively) to wild-type PP-1cγ (IC50 = 0.5, 13, and 0.7 nm, respectively). Surprisingly, V223A was more strongly inhibited by clavosine A, clavosine B, and calyculin A (IC50 = <0.1, 1, and 0.1 nm, respectively) than the wild-type enzyme. These experiments suggest that replacing the more bulky side chain of valine with alanine may allow the calyculins, especially clavosine B, to interact more closely with PP-1c in this region, thus reducing the IC50 values for each inhibitor. The clavosines and calyculin A were additionally tested for inhibitory activity against other PP-1cγ mutant enzymes. The results from these studies are depicted in Table I. Despite its proximity in sequence number to Tyr-134, mutation of Ile-133 to Tyr resulted in no significant change in response to the clavosines and calyculin A. We also examined the effect of replacing Cys-291 with Ala on toxin inhibition. This residue was chosen for our mutagenesis studies because it has been proposed (29.Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) to be part of an essential binding motif that is involved in the interaction of PP-1c with inhibitor-1, a phosphoprotein inhibitor specific to PP-1c. 2T.

Each value (± S.D.) represents the average of 3–5 independent experiments with a full range of inhibitor concentrations. We carried out modeling studies on the interaction between the clavosines and PP-1c to address three aspects of calyculin and clavosine structures: the position of the phosphate group with respect to the phosphatase, correlation of IC50 data with the orientation of the amide/nitrile portion of the tetraene tail, and accommodation of the rhamnose moiety in the PP-1c-clavosine complex. Using the experimental data generated in our mutagenesis studies and exploiting PP-1c structure-function information found in the literature (9.Matsunaga S. Fujiki H. Sakata D. Fusetani N.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we generated hypothetical models for clavosine binding to PP-1c. Our models of clavosine A, clavosine B, and calyculin A binding are depicted in Fig.5. Use of the extensible subset forcefield allowed us to perform all docking and minimization steps with manganese ions present at the active site of PP-1c. We were therefore able to initiate docking without fixing any portion of the clavosines in the active site. In this way, our modeling studies were performed without initial bias. It was necessary to use coordinates of the α-isoform of PP-1c (28.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) for the modeling studies as coordinates for the γ-isoform were not available. The α- and γ-isoforms of PP-1c are nearly identical, with primary sequence differences located almost exclusively in the first 5 residues of the amino terminus and the last 29 residues of the carboxyl terminus. The inhibitor/phosphatase structures generated in our modeling studies were similar for each inhibitor. Tyrosine 134, one of the PP-1c residues mutated in this study, is predicted to lie within 3 Å of the dimethylamine group in all of the inhibitor models, in close proximity with the amine (Fig. 1 a) in the clavosine A and calyculin A structures and the C-35 hydroxyl in clavosine B. Val-223 is within 3.5 Å of each inhibitor, residing closer to clavosine B (<3 Å) than the other two compounds. From the model, the phosphate group in clavosine A and calyculin A is predicted to form a hydrogen bond with Arg-96 in PP-1c. All three models suggest a contact between the C-13 hydroxyl of the calyculin or clavosine and Arg-221 in PP-1c, with the clavosine B predicted to lie the closest to this amino acid. In both clavosine models, the C-1 amide carbonyl group is predicted to form a contact with Lys-211, whereas the amide NH2 group in clavosine B may also interact with Asp-210. Asn-124 appears to reside within 3 Å of the C-33 carbonyl of each inhibitor. Additional residues in PP-1c predicted to reside within 4 Å of the inhibitor in every model include: His-66, Asp-92, His-125, Ile-130, Arg-132, Trp-206, Asp-208, Pro-209, Asp-210, Asn-219, Asp-220, Thr-226, His-248, Gln-249, Val-250, and Tyr-272. In addition, the manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme are within 4 Å of the inhibitors in all of the models. Fig.6 displays residues in PP-1c mutated in this study, relative to the active site of the phosphatase. In addition, some of the amino acids shown to be involved in calyculin A inhibition of PP-1c by other researchers (30.Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) are highlighted. Asp-210 and Lys-211, two residues proposed to be involved in clavosine and calyculin binding by computer modeling studies contained in this paper, are also indicated. In this study clavosines A and B have been identified as powerful protein phosphatase inhibitors, comparable to the other members of the calyculin family of natural product toxins. We have also shown that the Tyr-134 residue of PP-1cγ is an important mediator of inhibition by these compounds. Mutation of Tyr-134 to Phe resulted in a slight decrease in IC50 for all three inhibitors, possibly indicative of an increased hydrophobic interaction with the Phe side chain in the absence of a hydroxyl group. Substitution of the aromatic side chain in this position for alanine significantly increased the IC50values of clavosines A, B, and calyculin A. The most dramatic effect on clavosine inhibition of PP-1c was found by substituting Asp in place of Tyr-134. Clavosine B inhibited PP-1cγ Y134D with an approximately 310-fold decrease in potency compared with its inhibition of wild-type enzyme. Clavosine A and calyculin A were also markedly poorer inhibitors of the Y134D mutant (200- and 175-fold worse, respectively). These results clearly show that the presence of a negative charge at residue 134 in PP-1c is unfavorable for calyculin or clavosine inhibition. A recent computer modeling paper (18.Gupta V. Ogawa A.K. Du X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) has suggested that Tyr-134 may be involved in calyculin binding to PP-1c. Our mutagenesis data is the first experimental evidence to confirm the importance of this residue for inhibitor binding. The only known three-dimensional structure of an inhibitor bound to PP-1c is the x-ray structure of a microcystin-LR-PP-1cα complex determined by Goldberg et al. (28.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). One of the three areas of interaction between microcystin-LR and the phosphatase involved a possible hydrogen bond between the d-erythro-β-methyl aspartic acid carboxylate group and Tyr-134 of PP-1c. Therefore, mutagenesis of Tyr-134 serves as an important first starting point to test proposed models for binding of other toxins to PP-1c. In fact, the PP-1c Y134F mutant is actually more susceptible to inhibition by clavosine A/B and calyculin A than wild-type enzyme, thus arguing against the importance of hydrogen bonding between this residue and the calyculins. In addition to the present work, there are three recent docking/modeling papers that address calyculin A binding to PP-1c: Gauss et al. (17.Gauss C.M. Sheppeck I.J. Nairn A.C. Chamberlain R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1751-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Gupta et al. (18.Gupta V. Ogawa A.K. Du X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and Lindvall et al. (19.Lindvall M.K. Pihko P.M. Koskinen A.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23312-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Gupta et al. (18.Gupta V. Ogawa A.K. Du X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) publication proposes a direct role for Tyr-134 in calyculin binding to PP-1c. Their modeling studies propose hydrogen bonding between 1) the C-17 phosphate and C-35 hydroxyl of calyculin A with Arg-96 and 2) the C-34 hydroxyl and C-37 methoxy group of calyculin A with Tyr-134. We chose to test whether Tyr-134 was likely to make any hydrogen bond contact with the calyculins by mutating this residue to Phe. In view of the data presented here, it is possible that this model is incorrect with respect to hydrogen bond formation between calyculin A and PP-1c. The calyculin binding models of Gauss et al. (17.Gauss C.M. Sheppeck I.J. Nairn A.C. Chamberlain R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1751-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Lindvall et al. (19.Lindvall M.K. Pihko P.M. Koskinen A.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23312-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) make no direct mention of the involvement of Tyr-134 in calyculin A binding. In contrast, our mutagenesis experiments suggest a role for the bulky aromatic ring of the Tyr-134 sidechain in phosphatase inhibition by the calyculins. The models of calyculin and clavosine binding presented in Fig. 5 allow for close interaction with Tyr-134 but not Ile-133 (see Fig. 6). This is an important point, because in this study we showed that mutation of Ile-133 to Tyr did not affect the potency of PP-1c inhibition by the clavosines (Table I). It has been widely suggested in the literature (recently in Refs. 17.Gauss C.M. Sheppeck I.J. Nairn A.C. Chamberlain R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1751-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,18.Gupta V. Ogawa A.K. Du X. Houk K.N. Armstrong R.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, and 30.Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that many of the natural product inhibitors of PP-1c are similar enough in structure and chemical composition to create a common set of contacts with residues in the active site of the enzyme. Our proposed models of clavosine binding to PP-1c are consistent with this idea. Other recent mutagenesis studies have determined that Tyr-272 and Arg-96 mutant PP-1c enzymes exhibit decreased sensitivity to calyculin A (30.Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The mutants Asn-124, Asp-208, Arg-221, and His-248 also displayed resistance to this inhibitor (30.Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. Goldberg J. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3530-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In our models, all of these residues are found to be within 4 Å of clavosines A, B, and calyculin A. The clavosine structures generated in our modeling experiments maintain the compact nature of the (inverted) calyculin A crystal structure (4.Kato Y. Fusetani N. Matsunaga S. Hashimoto K. Fujita S. Furuya T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2780-2781Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and NMR solution structure (21.Volter K.E. Pierens G.K. Quinn R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), forming a “wedge” shape that fits into the active site of the phosphatase (Fig. 5). Our models are based on the premise that calyculins bind in a compact manner, as opposed to the extended calyculin model structures found in the literature (19.Lindvall M.K. Pihko P.M. Koskinen A.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23312-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, the NMR solution structures of calyculin A and dephosphonocalyculin A in organic solvents were determined (21.Volter K.E. Pierens G.K. Quinn R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In chloroform, the solution structure of calyculin A is very similar to the reported crystal structure (4.Kato Y. Fusetani N. Matsunaga S. Hashimoto K. Fujita S. Furuya T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2780-2781Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Clavosine B inhibits recombinant PP-1cγ with an IC50value 26-fold greater than that observed for clavosine A. This increase in IC50 is in agreement with the model shown in Fig.5 b. Our model suggests that the C-2/C-3 geometry of clavosine B forces the amide portion of the inhibitor toward the phosphatase structure, which results in a slight “downward” shift away from the active site of PP-1c. In both clavosine models, the C-1 amide carbonyl appears to form a contact with Lys-211 of PP-1c. However, the orientation of clavosine B may allow formation of an additional contact between Asp-210 and the amide NH2 group of the inhibitor, perhaps explaining the shift in the modeled complex. This movement away from the active site of the phosphatase may account for the reduction in effectiveness of clavosine B as an inhibitor of the recombinant enzyme. Our models of clavosine binding to PP-1c orient the phosphate group of each of the clavosines and calyculin A such that it interacts closely with Arg-96 of the phosphatase. However, given the strong inhibitory activity of dephospho-calyculin A toward PP-1c (12.Matsunaga S. Wakimoto T. Fusetani N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 3763-3764Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that this interaction forms the sole driving force for inhibition of the phosphatase. We found that calyculin A does not appear to depend solely on the phosphate group for maintaining its internal structure or its interaction with PP-1c, as dephospho-calyculin A docked similarly to the models in Fig. 5, despite loss of contact with Arg-96 (data not shown). During docking and energy minimization, the dephosphonoanalog exhibited internal structural changes consistent with previously determined experimental and structural observations (12.Matsunaga S. Wakimoto T. Fusetani N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 3763-3764Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to compare our model to the recently published NMR structure of the dephosphonoanalog when the coordinates become available (21.Volter K.E. Pierens G.K. Quinn R.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The calyculin phosphate group is an important part of an “extended” model of calyculin binding to PP-1c that has been presented in the literature, which proposes that the phosphate-containing calyculin is a mimic of the phosphorylated PP-1c inhibitor protein inhibitor-1 (or the related protein DARPP-32). Several models of calyculin binding (17.Gauss C.M. Sheppeck I.J. Nairn A.C. Chamberlain R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1751-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19.Lindvall M.K. Pihko P.M. Koskinen A.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23312-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) appear to be based, at least in part, upon models of phospho-DARPP-32 or inhibitor-1 interactions with PP-1c. Our computer simulations of clavosine binding suggest that the calyculin family of inhibitors do not bind as linear, phospho-peptidomimetics as has been previously proposed (19.Lindvall M.K. Pihko P.M. Koskinen A.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23312-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In our models the trimethoxy rhamnose group found in the clavosine structures is positioned so that it cannot interfere with toxin/protein binding. This is in accordance with data from our PP-1c inhibition assays (Fig. 2), which indicate that calyculin A and clavosine A inhibit PP-1cγ with similar potencies. In both clavosine models the rhamnose resides close to Glu-275 and Phe-276 in PP-1c but is clearly oriented away from the enzyme. The average cytotoxicity of the clavosines was higher than that of calyculin A in the NCI cell culture screens (15.Fu X. Schmitz F.J. Kelly-Borges M. McCready T.L. Holmes C.F.B. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 7957-7963Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This implies a targeting role for the rhamnose group. Lectins are a group of proteins that recognize specific carbohydrates and are involved in host-pathogen interactions, targeting of proteins within cells, and cell-cell interactions (32.Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 33.Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 34.Elgavish S. Shaanan B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is possible that a rhamnose-specific lectin could be involved in clavosine binding and uptake by a particular cell type or in an intracellular targeting mechanism. Rhamnose-specific lectins have been predominantly identified in fish eggs (35.Hosono M. Kawauchi H. Nitta K. Takayanagi Y. Shiokawa H. Mineki R. Murayama K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36.Gabius H.J. Cancer Invest. 1987; 5: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37.Tateno H. Saneyoshi A. Ogawa T. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Saneyoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19190-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Perhaps the clavosines discourage predation of marine sponges and/or associated microorganism(s) that produce the compounds; species of fish with rhamnose-specific lectins could be harmed if the clavosines were ingested. Interestingly, some cancer cell types may have receptors that recognize a rhamnose or rhamnose-like residue. Binding of solasodine glycosides (rhamnose-containing sugars) to tumor cells is thought to occur via a rhamnose moiety. These sugars selectively destroy tumor cellsin vivo (38.Cham B.E. Daunter B. Cancer Lett. 1990; 55: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In conclusion, there is a great need for further NMR or x-ray crystallographic work in this area. Determination of the structure of the clavosines or calyculin A in complex with PP-1c would address many of the controversial questions regarding the specific mode of interaction between the calyculins and type 1 protein phosphatase. Investigations along these lines are currently underway in our laboratory. Further characterization of the anti-tumor activity of the calyculin family members is also needed if we are to take full advantage of this cell permeable class of phosphatase inhibitors.

Using transformed flies, we asked how these deletions affected the <i>in situ</i> tissue-specific pattern of expression. Sequence comparisons between evolutionarily divergent species helped guide the placement of these deletions. A section of DNA important for expression in all cell types was subdivided and reintroduced into the mutated control region, a piece at a time, to identify which portion was required for promoter activity. We identified 55-, 214-, and 20-nucleotide sequences that control promoter activity. Different combinations of these elements activate the promoter in adult muscle, larval muscle, and tracheal cells."

When the passed segment (the T segment) and the transient double-strand break (the DNA gate) are on the same circular DNA molecule, a change in the linking number of the DNA results. When the two segments are on two different DNA molecules, catenation or decatenation occurs. In prokaryotes, the ATP binding and hydrolysis and the DNA cleavage and religation activities reside on different subunits that associate to form a heterotetramer (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2.Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 3.Levine C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Even though ParC, the DNA cleavage and religation subunit ofEscherichia coli topoisomerase IV (Topo IV)1 is a stable dimer in solution (4.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it cannot cleave DNA by itself, it must be associated with the ATP-binding subunit, ParE (4.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because ParC binds DNA nearly as well as the intact enzyme, 2E. Mossessova and K. J. Marians, unpublished data. this implies that ParE either contributes amino acid residues to the active site that are necessary for catalysis or that signals from ParE, in the form of conformational changes presumably driven by either the binding or hydrolysis of ATP, are required for DNA cleavage to proceed. As described in an accompanying article (6.Nurse P. Bahng S. Mossessova E. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4104-4111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Topo IV proteins reconstituted from ParC and mutant ParE proteins that are defective in either ATP binding or hydrolysis are still capable of covalent complex formation and DNA cleavage. This suggests that there must be other amino acid residues of ParE that are not involved in either ATP binding or hydrolysis, but are required for covalent catalysis. We have identified several such residues in this report. We isolated six independent alleles in a screen for dominant-negative mutations in parC (7.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The corresponding mutant ParE proteins all formed catalytically inactive Topo IV when reconstituted with ParC. In an accompanying article (6.Nurse P. Bahng S. Mossessova E. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4104-4111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we describe the characterization of three of the mutant Topo IV proteins that had defects in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, we report our characterization of the ParE E418K, ParE G419D, and ParE G442D mutant Topo IV proteins. While these proteins were relatively unaffected in their ATP-directed functions, they were severely reduced in their ability to form covalent complex or cleave DNA: a reaction mediated by ParC. Given the current understanding of the structure of type II topoisomerases (8.Berger J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), this indicates that a large conformational rearrangement is required to bring these amino acid residues in ParE in the vicinity of the active site Tyr in ParC in order to open the DNA gate. Reagents, enzymes, and DNAs are all as described in the accompanying articles (6.Nurse P. Bahng S. Mossessova E. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Assays for ATP hydrolysis, ParE dimer formation, decatenation of Crithidia kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), ParC covalent complex formation, and fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration of Topo IV were as described in the accompanying articles (6.Nurse P.

Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ParE is the ATP binding and hydrolysis subunit of Topo IV (4.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first article in this series, we described six mutant ParE proteins that, when reconstituted with ParC, gave Topo IV proteins that were unable to relax negatively supercoiled DNA (7.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Three of these, the ParE G110S, ParE S123L, and ParE T201A Topo IV, proteins also exhibited hyper-DNA cleavage. These enzymes were shown to be defective in ATP hydrolysis and DNA religation (6.Nurse P. Bahng S. Mossessova E. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4104-4111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the underlying defects in the other three mutant Topo IVs. All three of the mutations arose in amino acid residues that are highly conserved between type II topoisomerases. Glu418 and Gly419 are part of the EGDSA motif that is conserved in all type II topoisomerases (12.Caron P.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 279-316PubMed Google Scholar). Gly442 is part of the PLRGKILN motif and is conserved in all type II topoisomerases exceptCaenorhabditis elegans 2C, where the corresponding residue is an Arg (12.Caron P.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 279-316PubMed Google Scholar). None of these residues are present in the structure of AMP-P(NH)P bound to the N-terminal fragment of GyrB (13.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that they are involved in either ATP binding or hydrolysis directly. However, these amino acid substitutions could still affect these activities; Ser127 and Thr201 are also distant from the ATP, but they affect binding and hydrolysis (7.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The ability of the ParE E418K, ParE G419D, and ParE G442D Topo IV proteins to hydrolyze ATP was therefore examined (Fig.1). ATP hydrolysis by the ParE E418K and ParE G442D enzymes was essentially indistinguishable from that of the wild type protein, whereas the specific activity of the ParE G419D Topo IV was about one-third that of the wild type. This was a modest decrease in activity, particularly when compared with the defect in ATPase activity manifested by the ParE G110S, ParE S123L, and ParE T201A Topo IVs, where activity was decreased to between one-fifteenth and one-fortieth that of the wild type (7.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because the ParE E418K, ParE G419D, and ParE G442D Topo IVs could all hydrolyze ATP, they should also be able to dimerize in the presence of AMP-P(NH)P. This is measured by protein-protein cross-linking in the presence of dimethyl suberimidate. All three of the mutant ParE proteins could be cross-linked to give a dimer of ParE in the presence of AMP-P(NH)P (Fig. 2). Thus, none of these three mutants were defective in either of the signature activities of ParE: ATP hydrolysis or the ability to close their ATP-dependent clamp. Although neither the ParE E418K, ParE G419D, nor ParE G442D Topo IVs could relax DNA, at very high concentrations the ParE G442D enzyme appeared to be able to catenate DNA (7.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of the mutant enzymes to decatenate kDNA (Fig.3). At 40 μm ATP, a concentration sufficient to support maximal rates of decatenation by the wild type enzyme (Fig. 3 A), none of the mutant proteins could decatenate DNA when present at equivalent concentrations as the wild type (Fig. 3, B–D). At both higher protein and ATP concentrations, however, the ParE G442D Topo IV could decatenate the kDNA (Fig. 3 E). A roughly 100-fold greater concentration of the mutant protein than the wild type effected about the same level of decatenation. As argued in the accompanying article (6.Nurse P. Bahng S. Mossessova E. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4104-4111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that this activity is a result of wild type ParE contaminating the preparation of ParE G442D. The mutant Topo IVs were not significantly defective in ATP hydrolysis and could close their ATP-dependent clamp. This suggested that they were defective either in binding DNA or in covalent catalysis. A significant defect in DNA binding seemed unlikely, because the ATPase activity of all the mutant proteins was stimulated by DNA.2 This was checked directly by measuring the ability of the mutant Topo IVs to bind to linear pBR322 DNA using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (Fig. 4). The ParE E418K Topo IV bound DNA as well as the wild type, withKD values of 16.5 and 12.5 nm, respectively. Both the ParE G419D and ParE G442D Topo IVs showed modest defects in DNA binding, giving KD values of 51.2 and 66.3 nm, respectively. This is unlikely to account for their inability to relax negatively supercoiled DNA, because no activity was manifest even at concentrations of protein as high as 1 μm. In addition, the KD for binding to supercoiled DNA is expected to be one-tenth that for binding to linear DNA (9.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These data pointed to a defect for the mutant enzymes in covalent catalysis. There are three aspects of this that can be examined: (i) the ability to mediate SDS-dependent DNA cleavage, (ii) the ability to form a covalent complex between ParC and DNA, and (iii) the ability to form a ternary complex between the topoisomerase, DNA, and a quinolone antibacterial drug such as norfloxacin. All three aspects of covalent catalysis were examined for the mutant enzymes. Once bound to DNA, topoisomerases engage in a cleavage-religation equilibrium. In the open form of the topoisomerase-DNA complex, the DNA is cleaved and covalently bound to the enzyme. This represents the opening of the DNA gate. In the case of Topo IV, the DNA is bound to ParC. Normally, free cleaved DNA is not obvious in a reaction where a topoisomerase is allowed to bind to DNA. To observe DNA cleavage, the topoisomerase must be denatured while it is bound to DNA in the open complex. Treatment with SDS of Topo IV bound to DNA that has a 5′-32P label on one end produces a characteristic set of fragments representing the distance between the Topo IV cleavage site and the labeled end of the DNA. This pattern is evident for the wild type enzyme in Fig. 5. None of the mutant Topo IV proteins showed any DNA cleavage activity in this assay (Fig.5). In general, the cleavage-religation equilibrium is far to the side of religation. This acts to protect the cell from the accidental generation of a lethal double-strand break. Thus, it was possible that the lack of cleavage observed for the mutant Topo IV proteins derived from a shift in the cleavage-religation equilibrium even further toward religation. The quinolone family of antibacterials affect bacterial type II topoisomerase activity by shifting the cleavage-religation equilibrium toward cleavage. Thus, they would be expected to increase DNA cleavage in the assay shown in Fig. 5. That experiment was performed in the absence of such drugs. We have developed a very sensitive assay for formation of the Topo IV-DNA-quinolone ternary complex. It makes use of the fact that Topo IV cannot bind in a stable fashion to a duplex 24-nucleotide-long oligonucleotide composed of a defined Topo IV binding site sequence in the absence of quinolone (11.Marians K.J. Hiasa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9401-9409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Binding is measured using nitrocellulose filters. The ability of the wild type and mutant enzymes to bind to the 24-mer in the presence of 0.5 mm norfloxacin was therefore determined (Fig. 6). Only binding by the wild type enzyme could be detected; no binding for any of the mutant Topo IVs was evident. This suggested that the observed DNA cleavage defect derived from an inability to form the covalent complex. This was tested directly. If Topo IV is allowed to come to equilibrium bound to uniformly32P-labeled DNA followed by digesting the DNA with nuclease, a fraction of the label will be transferred to the ParC subunit as a result of the Topo IV-DNA complex becoming destabilized and falling apart. Analysis by SDS-PAGE can be used to reveal the label transfer. When treated in this fashion, covalent complex formation by the mutant Topo IVs could not be detected, although it was clearly evident with the wild type enzyme (Fig.7). As discussed above, even though ParC can bind DNA, it cannot form a covalent complex with DNA in the absence of heterotetramer formation with ParE. Thus, the failure of the mutant Topo IVs to form a covalent complex could be because of the lack of a stable association between the mutant ParE proteins and ParC. This was examined by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration chromatography. Both ParE E418K and ParE G442D formed heterotetramers with ParC that could be isolated by gel filtration (data not shown). On the other hand, the combination of ParE G419D and ParC clearly did not elute during gel filtration as a heterotetramer (Fig. 8). However, ParE G419D did elute slightly ahead of the position of free ParE. This suggested that it did interact with ParC, but that the interaction was weakened compared with the wild type. Type II topoisomerases catalyze the formation and resealing of transient double-strand DNA breaks. During cleavage, the 5′-phosphates of the DNA break are transferred to the enzyme via the formation of a phosphotyrosine bond. Religation reverses this reaction. Cleavage of the DNA corresponds to opening of the DNA gate on the enzyme through which another segment of DNA (the T segment) is passed to the interior of the protein. Once the DNA gate is closed by religation of the break, the topology of the DNA substrate has been altered. Opening of the DNA gate clearly requires a large conformational rearrangement of the enzyme. Two crystal structures give us an idea of the movement required. The structure of the central core of the yeast topoisomerase II (14.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) presumably represents the open conformation. Here, the dimer-related active site tyrosines are over 27 Å apart, and it was estimated that they would have to move 35–40 Å toward and past each other to assume an appropriately staggered position to catalyze DNA cleavage. The structure of a 59-kDa N-terminal fragment of GyrA (equivalent to the A′ region of the yeast topoisomerase II structure) presumably represents the closed conformation (15.Cabral J.H.M. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Here the active site tyrosines are appropriately staggered, but the inter-tyrosyl distance (30 Å) is larger than the width of a double helix of DNA, suggesting that some additional rearrangement of either the DNA or the enzyme must occur to bring the tyrosines close enough to the scissile bonds to effect cleavage. The chemical mechanism of DNA cleavage and religation remains obscure. Based on the GyrA59 structure, Cabral et al. (15.Cabral J.H.M. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) proposed that the active site of the breakage-reunion activity is formed from Tyr122, which forms the covalent bond with DNA, and Arg121 from one monomer and His80, Arg32, and Lys42 from the other monomer. Bergeret al. (16.Berger J.M. Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) noted a structural similarity between domain 1 of bacterial topoisomerase 1 and the B′ region of the yeast topoisomerase II. In the type I enzyme, this domain lies very close to the active site Tyr (17.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Both domains contain a nearly invariant set of acidic residues, Glu9, Asp111, Asp113, and Glu115 in the bacterial enzyme and Glu449, Asp526, Asp528, and Asp530 in the yeast enzyme. Glu449 is part of the conserved EGDSA motif (12.Caron P.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 279-316PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are also part of the toprim motif identified by Aravindet al. (18.Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) on the basis of amino acid sequence comparisons. Toprim is a proposed conserved catalytic domain in type 1A and type II topoisomerases, DnaG-type primases, OLD family nucleases, and RecR proteins. It has been proposed that these acidic residues coordinate Mg2+ in bacterial topoisomerase I (17.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the existing structure of the yeast enzyme (14.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), these residues project away from the active-site Tyr (Fig. 9). Thus, Berger et al. (16.Berger J.M. Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) proposed that a rotation of the B′ domain about the linker to the A′ domain to bring these residues in close proximity to the active-site Tyr is effected in the conformation of the enzyme where DNA is bound across the DNA gate and is about to be cleaved. Our finding of amino acid substitutions in the B′ region of ParE that affect covalent complex formation by Topo IV is consistent with this proposal. In our analysis of the biochemical properties of ParE proteins encoded by dominant-negative alleles of parE, we found two groups of mutations (7.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). When reconstituted with ParC, the ParE G110S, ParE S123L, and ParE T201A Topo IVs were defective in ATP hydrolysis and exhibited hyper-DNA cleavage. The characterization of these proteins is described in the accompanying report (6.Nurse P. Bahng S. Mossessova E. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4104-4111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ParE E418K, ParE G419D, and ParE G442D Topo IVs were unaffected in their ability to either hydrolyze ATP or to close their ATP-dependent clamp; however, none of them could relax negatively supercoiled DNA. This inactivity could be attributed to a defect in the ability of these mutant enzymes to form the covalent intermediate. Although two of these proteins, the ParE G419D and ParE G442D Topo IVs, did show a modest decrease in DNA binding, this was unlikely to account for the defect in covalent complex formation. These experiments were performed at Topo IV concentrations of 60 nm. Thus, even in the case of the ParE G442D Topo IV, which binds linear DNA with aKD of 66 nm, about 5-fold that of the wild type, 50% of the DNA in the experiment will be bound at any time. Yet, covalent complex formation was undetectable. We therefore conclude that these amino acid substitutions interfere with covalent catalysis. Glu418 is part of the toprim (18.Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and EGDSA (12.Caron P.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 279-316PubMed Google Scholar) motifs and was predicted to be directly involved in covalent catalysis by coordinating Mg2+ (17.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). If this is in fact the case, the reversal of charge effected by the E418K substitution would clearly have a profound effect on covalent catalysis. An equivalent substitution, E449A, inactivates the DNA relaxation and covalent complex-forming activities of yeast topoisomerase II (19.Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Gly419 is also part of the EGDSA motif (12.Caron P.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 279-316PubMed Google Scholar). However, the lack of a functional group makes it unlikely that this residue participates directly in covalent catalysis. It seems likely that the G419D substitution imposes an effect on catalysis by interfering with the hydrogen-bonding network that would be required to coordinate Mg2+. In the yeast topoisomerase II structure (14.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) the equivalent residue, Gly450, lies very close to Glu449 (Glu418 in ParE), within 2–4 Å, is fairly close to Asp526, within 5–7 Å, and is farther from Asp528 and Asp530, from 7 to >10 Å (Fig. 9). These latter three Asp residues are part of the putative acidic tetrad necessary for Mg2+ coordination. Intrusion of an additional negative charge into this region could easily shift the pattern of hydrogen bonding between the Mg ion and the acidic tetrad. Consistent with this is that in topoisomerase II from Candida albicans, the Asp in the EGDSA motif is a Leu (12.Caron P.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 94: 279-316PubMed Google Scholar) and that substitution of the Ser with Ala in the yeast topoisomerase II does not inactivate the enzyme (19.Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Neither of these two amino acid replacements would be expected to interfere with a hydrogen-bonding network. Gly442 is part of the conserved PLRGKILN motif. In the yeast enzyme, substitutions of the Arg and Lys in this motif with Ala has no effect on the catalytic activities of the topoisomerase (20.Wasserman R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20943-20951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Ala substitution of the Asn does ablate the superhelical DNA relaxation activity and reduce covalent complex formation to about one-tenth the level of the wild type (19.Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests that residues in this motif may not be directly involved in catalysis. Consistent with this is the observation that the ParE G442D Topo IV retained some catalytic activity. This enzyme could decatenate kDNA at concentrations 100-fold greater than that required for the wild type enzyme. Clearly, this implies that this mutant enzyme retains some low level ability to form the covalent complex. Our inability to detect this presumably relates to an inability to approach the protein concentrations that would be required in the assay for covalent complex formation. Gly442 is considerably farther from the acidic tetrad than Gly419. In the yeast topoisomerase II structure (14.Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), the equivalent residue, Gly476, is 8–9 Å from Glu449 (Glu418 in ParE), 7–9 Å from Asp526 and Asp528, and greater than 12 Å from Asp530. Thus, whereas the G442D substitution could interfere with the hydrogen-bonding network involving the acidic tetrad, it is less likely. By making mixed heterodimers of yeast topoisomerase II where one protomer carried a mutation in this region of the B′ domain and the other protomer carried the Y782F mutation that inactivates covalent complex formation, Liu and Wang (19.Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have shown that amino acid residues in the B′ domain, such as the acidic tetrad, cooperate intrans with the A′ region of the other protomer in the dimer. The structural organization of this conformation is unknown. Thus, an explanation for the disruptive effect of the ParE G442D substitution may only become apparent when additional crystal structures are available. It is clear, however, that our data and that from other laboratories discussed above, point up another of the large conformational changes necessary for activity of the type II topoisomerases. The cooperation in trans between the B′ and A′ regions of the two halves of the enzyme presumably contributes to the stabilization of the protein as the DNA gate opens. This view is supported by the apparent instability of the ParE G419D Topo IV tetramer."

During topoisomerization, the ATP-binding and hydrolysis cycle must be coordinated with the cycle of DNA cleavage and religation. We have isolated three dominant-negative mutant alleles ofparE that encode ParE proteins that fail to hydrolyze ATP when reconstituted with ParC to form Topo IV. ParE G110S Topo IV and ParE S123L Topo IV failed to bind ATP at all, whereas ParE T201A could bind ATP. All three mutant Topo IV proteins exhibited an elevated level of spontaneous DNA cleavage that could be associated with a decreased rate of DNA resealing. In ParE T201A Topo IV, this defect appeared to result from an increased likelihood that the tetrameric enzyme would fall apart after DNA cleavage.

To do so, these enzymes must execute an ordered sequence of conformational changes and chemical reactions: trapping a segment of DNA, passage of the trapped segment through a transient double-strand break in another DNA segment, release of the passed DNA segment from the interior of the enzyme, and resetting of the enzyme for another round of catalysis. Thus, these enzymes have two catalytic activities: ATP binding and hydrolysis, and DNA cleavage and religation. Roca and Wang (4.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that one role for ATP binding and hydrolysis is the operation of a protein clamp on the enzyme to trap the segment of DNA (the T segment) to be transported through the transient double-strand break (the G segment). Use of such a clamp is probably not an absolute necessity for topoisomerase activity, but it clearly increases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by orders of magnitude. ATP binding is sufficient to close the clamp, whereas hydrolysis of ATP is presumed to reset it in the open position, although this has not been demonstrated directly. DNA cleavage and religation functions to open and close the DNA gate through which the T segment must be passed in order to effect changes in DNA topology (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

Both DNA cleavage and religation and ATP binding and hydrolysis are manifest in the absence of the other activity, although DNA binding appears to stimulate ATP hydrolysis (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

ATP hydrolysis without DNA transport would render the enzyme very inefficient, allowing the captured T segment to escape without alteration of DNA topology. Little is known about the manner in which these reactions are coordinated and the amino acid residues important for this crucial linking of enzymatic functions. As a result of a screen for dominant-negative mutations of parE (5.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we have isolated and characterized three mutant ParE proteins defective in either ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis when reconstituted with ParC to formEscherichia coli topoisomerase IV (Topo IV).1 All three of the mutant Topo IV proteins exhibit hyper-DNA cleavage in the absence of ATP, suggesting that the mutations have induced a conformation that disrupts communication between the DNA cleavage and ATP hydrolysis domains. In the case of ParE T201A Topo IV, which can bind but not hydrolyze ATP, hyper-DNA cleavage can be correlated with a decrease in the rate of resealing of the cleaved DNA and an increased chance that the tetrameric enzyme will fall apart after cleavage, leaving ParC linked covalently to the DNA. This suggests that, under normal circumstances, ATP hydrolysis is required for the DNA gate to close. Kinetoplast DNA fromCrithidia fasciculata (kDNA) was from TopoGEN, Inc. (Columbus, OH).

Fractions (100 μl) were collected from the time of injection. Aliquots (10 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE through 10% gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and photographed. In the first article in this series (5.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we described the isolation of dominant-negative parE mutants and the initial characterization of the superhelical DNA relaxation activity of Topo IVs reconstituted with the mutant ParEs and ParC. Three of these mutant proteins, ParE G110S, ParE S123L, and ParE T201A Topo IVs, exhibited hyper-DNA cleavage under conditions where the reaction was terminated in a manner designed to avoid trapping any topoisomerase on the DNA in the open complex. NaCl was first added to prevent any rebinding of Topo IV to DNA after it had dissociated. EDTA was then added and the incubation allowed to continue long enough to ensure that any Topo IV bound to the DNA in an open complex resealed the cleaved DNA and dissociated. Only then was SDS added to denature the protein. The observation of hyper-DNA cleavage under these conditions suggests a corruption of the normal cleavage-religation equilibrium. The three mutations under investigation were all in the ATP-binding subunit of Topo IV. Based on the crystal structure of a fragment of GyrB bound to ATP (9.Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), at least one of the targeted amino acid residues, Gly110, was known to be involved in ATP-binding. Therefore, DNA cleavage by the wild-type and mutant Topo IVs was compared in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig.1). In the presence of ATP, the wild-type enzyme catenated the DNA, as expected at this high concentration (1 μm). As noted in the accompanying article (5.Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), neither the ParE G110S, ParE S123L, nor ParE T201A mutant Topo IVs could catenate DNA, and they all produced a high level of cleaved DNA. The situation was similar in the absence of ATP. Under these conditions, a comparison could be made to the wild type. Densitometric analysis (Table I) showed that in the absence of ATP, the ParE G110S and ParE S123L mutant enzymes produced about 2- and 3-fold more cleaved DNA, respectively, than the wild type. The ParE T201A Topo IV produced at least 6-fold more cleaved DNA than the wild type. This is probably an underestimate, because all of the DNA was cleaved by this protein. Little modulation in either the presence or absence of ATP of the extent of cleavage by the mutant enzymes was evident (Table I). Cleavage was dependent on the presence of both subunits for all the enzymes (data not shown); thus, it was unlikely to be the result of nuclease contamination.Table IDNA cleavage by wild-type and ParE G110S, ParE S123L, and ParE T201A mutant Topo IVsTopo IVDNA as form II and form IIIWith ATPWithout ATP%aCorrected for background in the absence of any added enzyme.Wild type—bUnder these conditions, this enzyme catenates the DNA.16.8ParE G110S29.033.3ParE S123L46.945.2ParE T201A100100a Corrected for background in the absence of any added enzyme.b Under these conditions, this enzyme catenates the DNA. Open table in a new tab If the observed DNA cleavage was a result of corruption of the cleavage-religation equilibrium, then it was possible that the mutations could effect covalent complex formation. This was measured directly. Wild-type and mutant Topo IVs were bound to [32P]DNA at about a 25-fold molar excess of enzyme. Norfloxacin was added to shift the enzyme-DNA complex to the open form, where ParC is covalently bound to DNA and then the excess DNA was removed by digestion with DNase I. This results in transfer of the label to ParC as a result of a few nucleotides of DNA remaining covalently attached to the protein. The results were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). All the mutant Topo IVs were capable of forming covalent complex as well as the wild type. Thus, the underlying defect that caused the hyper-DNA cleavage had to be in another activity of the enzyme. It should be noted that, in the label transfer assay (Fig. 2), the ratio of Topo IV to DNA is much lower than it is in the experiment shown in Fig. 1. This different enzyme-to-substrate ratio accounts for the increased cleavage activity of ParE T201A Topo IV compared with the other two mutant enzymes in Fig. 1. ATP hydrolysis in the presence of DNA was measured for the wild-type and mutant Topo IVs as a function of enzyme concentration (Fig. 3). All three of the mutant proteins were defective in their ability to hydrolyze ATP. The extent of the defect was variable, with the specific activities of the ParE G110S, ParE S123L, and ParE T201A Topo IVs being reduced to one-fifteenth, one-fortieth, and one-twentieth, respectively, that of the wild-type enzyme. This defect could, of course, be the result of either the inability of the enzyme to bind ATP or a disruption of the chemical steps required for hydrolysis. To distinguish between these possibilities, the ability of the mutant and wild-type enzymes to bind ATP was evaluated. A nitrocellulose filter binding protocol was used to assess binding of [3H]AMP-P(NH)P to the various Topo IV proteins (TableII). The nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP was used so that stable binding could be observed without the complications of concomitant ATP hydrolysis. This analysis showed clearly that the mutant Topo IVs fell into one of two groups. Neither ParE G110S nor ParE S123L Topo IV could bind significant amounts of [3H]AMP-P(NH)P. This is consistent with their reduced ability to hydrolyze ATP. On the other hand, ParE T201A Topo IV bound [3H]AMP-P(NH)P as well as the wild-type enzyme. The reason for the failure of this enzyme to hydolyze ATP is not obvious at this time. Some possibilities are considered under “Discussion.”Table IIBinding of [ 3 H]AMP-P(NH)P to wild-type and mutant Topo IVsTopo IV[3H]AMP-P(NH)P boundpmolExperiment 1aReaction mixtures were 10 μl.

Open table in a new tab ATP binding is required to close the ATP-dependent clamp of type II topoisomerases that traps the T segment of DNA for transport to the interior of the enzyme. The results in the previous section suggested that ParE T201A Topo IV might be able to do so, whereas the other two mutants should be unable to do so. This can be examined conveniently by assessing, using protein-protein cross-linking, the ability of the mutant ParE proteins to dimerize in the presence of AMP-P(NH)P. Accordingly, the wild-type and mutant ParE proteins were treated with dimethyl suberimidate in either the presence or absence of AMP-P(NH)P and the results analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). After treatment with dimethyl suberimidate, both the wild-type and T201A ParE proteins produced a new AMP-P(NH)P-dependent species that migrated with variable mobility in polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. Mobility of this band was dependent on the duration of electrophoresis. When the gels were electrophoresed for only 1.5 h, the band migrated at 150 kDa (data not shown). In the gel shown, electrophoresis was for 3 h and the band migrated at about 220 kDa. A dimer of ParE is predicted to be 140.4 kDa. Thus, it is conceivable that the cross-linked material is a trimer. However, because it migrates at the expected position at shorter times of electrophoresis, it is most likely the dimer species. The aberrant migration at longer electrophoresis times is currently unexplained. Neither the G110S nor S123L ParE could be cross-linked to yield the slowly moving species (Fig. 4). In all cases, the monomer bands became broadened and a new species migrating somewhat more slowly than the monomer band became visible compared with untreated samples. We suspect that this is a result of internal cross-linking of the protein. Roca and Wang (4.Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) demonstrated that closing of the ATP-dependent clamp and capture of a T segment was sufficient to allow the yeast type II topoisomerase to catenate DNA rings. Thus, our observation that the T201A ParE could dimerize suggested that Topo IV reconstituted with this subunit should be capable of some aspect of topoisomerase activity. We presumably could not observe any activity in the superhelical DNA relaxation assay because of the extensive DNA cleavage at high levels of ParE T210A Topo IV. The ability of this enzyme to decatenate kDNA was therefore compared with that of the wild-type and the other two mutant enzymes. Wild-type Topo IV was, as has been noted before (10.Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11.Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31549-31555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), a very efficient decatenating enzyme. At a concentration of 40 μm ATP, which is the optimum for this reaction with the wild-type enzyme (12.Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 50% of the kDNA was decatenated in a 15 min reaction at a ratio of one Topo IV molecule to 20 monomers of kDNA minicircle (Fig. 5 A). Under identical conditions, none of the three mutant Topo IVs displayed any decatenation activity (data not shown). We could, however, detect decatenation activity when we increased the concentration of the mutant enzymes significantly and also increased the ATP concentration to 1 mm. Under conditions of increased ATP concentration, a roughly 1200-fold greater concentration of ParE T201A Topo IV was required to observe a similar extent of decatenation as catalyzed by the wild-type protein (Fig. 5 D). The ParE G110S and ParE S123L Topo IVs exhibited much less activity, although some decatenation could also be observed (Fig. 5, B and C). This suggests that at least the ParE T201A Topo IV is unlikely to have a defect in strand transport, per se. The requirement for much higher concentrations presumably reflects the fact that once the ATP-dependent clamp closes on this mutant enzyme, it cannot reopen. Thus, if a T segment has not been trapped upon closing, that particular molecule is rendered inactive. The data described thus far clearly associate the inactivity of the mutant Topo IVs to their inability to hydrolyze ATP. However, they do not reveal the underlying reason for the hyper-DNA cleavage that was observed. We therefore examined the cleavage reaction in more detail to determine whether cleavage was spontaneous and whether ParC remained bound to the cleaved DNA. Wild-type and mutant Topo IVs were incubated with superhelical DNA either in the presence or absence of ATP or in the presence of AMP-P(NH)P. The reactions were terminated three different ways, either by the addition of (i) only gel tracking dyes, (ii) SDS, or (iii) SDS and proteinase K. Samples terminated by methods (ii) and (iii) were incubated an additional 15 min after these final additions. Reaction products were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cleaved DNA evident in reactions terminated by method (i) presumably represents spontaneous DNA cleavage, i.e. DNA that has been released from the enzyme while it is in the open conformation without denaturation of the protein. The pattern evident with reactions terminated with SDS give an approximation of how much Topo IV is covalently bound to the DNA. Comparison of the DNA products of reactions terminated with only tracking dye to those terminated with SDS should give a clear indication of whether there is protein bound to the DNA under the former condition. Covalently bound protein will be evident by the appearance of a smear of DNA in the lane from the position of the linear to the gel origin. Finally, the extent of cleavage observed in reactions terminated with both SDS and proteinase K reflects the total amount of cleavage, the sum of both the spontaneous cleavage and cleavage resulting from denaturing enzyme in the open complex. The wild type did not exhibit any spontaneous cleavage (Fig.6, A, B, andC, lane 2). This indicates that normally the frequency of spontaneous cleavage is very low, as would be expected because generation of such cleaved DNA in the cell would be a lethal event. On the other hand, both the ParE G110S (Fig. 6,A, B, and C, lane 5) and ParE S123L (Fig. 6, A, B, andC, lane 8) Topo IVs exhibited spontaneous cleavage, with the ParE S123L enzyme showing a higher level. Neither of these mutant enzymes showed the expected smearing of DNA in the lane if there was protein covalently bound to the cleaved DNA. The type of smearing expected is evident in those reactions that were terminated with SDS (Fig. 6, A, B, andC, lane 6 for ParE G110S Topo IV andlane 9 for ParE S123L Topo IV). ParE T201A Topo IV exhibited a different behavior. It clearly cleaved DNA spontaneously (Fig. 6, A, B, andC, lane 11), but in this case, ParC apparently remained bound to the cleaved DNA as the patterns were similar to those observed for reactions terminated with SDS (Fig. 6, A,B, and C, lane 12). ATP appeared to inhibit total cleavage by both the ParE G110S (Fig. 6,A, B, and C, lane 7) and ParE S123L (Fig. 6, A, B, andC, lane 10) Topo IVs. On the other hand, AMP-P(NH)P appeared to stimulate total cleavage by the ParE T201A Topo IV. The effect of ATP on cleavage by the wild-type enzyme is more difficult to estimate because catenated DNA can also account for disappearance of the substrate (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). This issue of whether protein remained bound to DNA cleaved spontaneously by the ParE T201A Topo IV was examined in another manner. Topo IV can bind to a 50-nucleotide-long duplex oligonucleotide that is composed of a palindromic defined DNA-binding site (10.Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

If ParC was remaining covalently bound to DNA cleaved spontaneously by this mutant enzyme, binding to the 50-mer should be stimulated significantly compared with the wild-type and the other two mutant proteins. This proved to be the case (Fig. 7). The ParE G110S and ParE S123L Topo IVs bound the 50-mer to an extent similar to that for the wild-type protein, with about 20–30% of the DNA retained on the filters at a 2 μm concentration of enzyme. Binding by the ParE T201A Topo IV was significantly better, with nearly 80% of the DNA bound at one-eighth that concentration. This rough comparison suggests that the ParE T201A Topo IV binds the 50-mer with an efficiency at least 24-fold better than any of the other enzymes. This is consistent with ParC remaining bound to the DNA after spontaneous cleavage by this enzyme and not the others. The observation that the mutant Topo IVs exhibited spontaneous DNA cleavage suggested that they were defective in resealing the DNA after cleavage. To address this, we developed an assay to measure the rate of resealing. The enzymes were allowed to establish a cleavage-religation equilibrium with the DNA at 15 °C. The lowered temperature was used to slow the resealing reaction in order to make it easier to measure the rate of reaction. NaCl was then added to the reaction mixture to a concentration of 300 mm. This is sufficient to prevent rebinding to the DNA of any enzyme that dissociates. Resealing of the cleaved DNA (both form II and form III) was then followed kinetically (Fig.8). Even under the conditions of reduced temperature, the wild type resealed the DNA quickly, with a t 1/2 of about 1 min (Fig. 8, A and E). The ParE G110S (Fig.8 B) and ParE S123L (Fig. 8 C) Topo IVs both had rates of resealing that were reduced by one-half to one-quarter that of the wild type with t 1/2 values of about 3.9 and 2.8 min, respectively (Fig. 8 E). The ParE T201A Topo IV was extremely defective in resealing (Fig. 8, D andE). A t 1/2 could not be calculated for this data because of the difficulty in obtaining a good curve fit, but it is likely to be greater than 10-fold that of the wild type. Thus, all three mutant proteins exhibited a qualitatively similar defect in that they did not reseal cleaved DNA as fast as the wild type. However, the magnitude of this defect was significantly greater for the ParE T201A Topo IV than for the other two mutant proteins. Significantly, it also appeared that ParC remained covalently bound to the ends of the DNA cleaved by the ParE T201A enzyme, but that this was not the case for the other two mutant proteins. This suggested that the ParE T201A Topo IV tetramer was actually falling apart after DNA cleavage. If this were the case, one would expect that, in general, the stability of this tetramer would be low and that this would be apparent by gel filtration. This proved to be the case. The mutant and wild-type Topo IVs were reconstituted with a 10% excess of the ParE subunit and gel-filtered through a FPLC Superose 6 column. The distribution of ParE and ParC was followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.9). The patterns for the ParE G110S and ParE S123L Topo IVs were identical to that of the wild type. A clear shift in the distribution of both ParC and ParE was obs"

Both wild-type parC and mutagenized parE were expressed from a tightly-regulated lac promoter on a moderate-copy plasmid. Mutated parE alleles were rescued from those plasmids that caused IPTG-dependent cell death. The mutant ParE proteins could be divided into two groups when reconstituted with ParC to form topoisomerase IV, those that elicited hyper-DNA cleavage and those that affected covalent complex formation."
