https://openalex.org/W1573201350,"The glucose oxidase from molds has been st.udied by a number of workers (l-8). The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of n-glucose to n-glucono-b-lactone (7). Its substrate specificity has been examined, and it also attacks 2-deoxy-n-glucose, n-mannose, n-galactose, and n-xylose (5), although the turnover numbers for the last three sugars are very low. In this laboratory in recent years the formation of semiquinones in the oxidation and reduction of free flavins has been studied by spectrophotometry and electron spin resonance (9, lo), and attempts have been made to apply the results from model systems to flavin enzymes. No general relationship has been found between electron spin resonance signals and the appearance of absorption spectra corresponding to enzyme forms intermediate between fully oxidized and fully reduced flavin, nor do such oxidation-reduction intermediate forms necessarily play a part in catalysis (11). Each enzyme must therefore be examined separately, and the results of electron spin resonance and optical spectrophotometry correlated with rapid reaction studies, to establish whether or not intermediate forms of the enzyme react at rates sufficient to account for its catalytic activity. Electron spin resonance studies of glucose oxidase have already been reported by Beinert and Sands (12) and by Mason et al. (13), and while our own experiments on the glucose oxidase from AspergiZZus niger were in progress, Nakamura and Ogura (14) published an important paper on the kinetics of the oxidation of glucose by the enzyme from Penicillium arnagaskiense. Briefly, these papers indicate that semiquinoid intermediates play no part in the catalytic mechanism of glucose oxidase. This paper describes kinetic experiments by manometric and stopped flow methods with several substrates. Our experimental results confirm and extend those of Nakamura and Ogura (14), although our additional experiment.s suggest that a different interpretation is required to accommodate all the observations. Whereas Nakamura and Ogura identified a first order rate-limiting step with the conversion of enzyme-glucose complex to reduced enzyme and product, our results can be adequately explained without postulating the formation of an enzymeglucose complex, and we propose the dissociation of product from an enzyme-product complex as a first order rate-limiting step. With 2-deoxyglucose, however, there seems to be a typi-"

https://openalex.org/W1618573139,"From a general standpoint, the formation of molecular hydrogen can be considered a device for disposal of electrons released in metabolic oxidations. We presume that this means of performing anaerobic oxidations is of ancient origin and that the hydrogen-evolving system of strict anaerobes represents a primitive form of cytochrome oxidase, which in aerobes effects the terminal step of respiration, namely the disposal of electrons by combination with molecular oxygen. We further assume that the original pattern of reactions leading to H(2) production has become modified in various ways (with respect to both mechanisms and functions) during the course of biochemical evolution, and we believe that this point of view suggests profitable approaches for clarifying a number of problems in the intermediary metabolism of microorganisms which produce or utilize H(2). Of special general importance in this connection is the basic problem of defining more precisely the fundamental elements in the regulatory control of anaerobic energy metabolism. Among the more specific aspects awaiting further elucidation are: the relations between formation of H(2) and use of H(2) as a primary reductant for biosynthetic purposes; the various forms of direct and indirect interactions between hydrogenase and N(2) reduction systems; and the transitional stages between anaerobic and aerobic energy-metabolism patterns of facultative organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2042342200,"Auditory perceptions produced in a person deaf to acoustic stimulation were studied by electrically exciting the auditory nerve through permanently implanted electrodes. Pulsed current as small as 1 microampere peak-to-peak could be perceived. Pitch, as reported by the subject, varied with electrode selection, current amplitude, and pulse repetition rate from about 70 to at least 300 pulses per second. Loudness increased with amplitude and duration of pulse stimuli, and to a lesser extent with repetition rate. The total range in amplitude of the stimulus, from threshold to an uncomfortable loudness, was 15 to 20 decibels. Simultaneous stimulation in separate electrodes produced a number of complex effects."

https://openalex.org/W2024576761,"The major metabolite in rat bile of injected C(14)-retinoic acid was purified by ion-exchange and silicic acid chromatography; it has the spectrum of methyl retinoate, releases retinoic acid upon basic hydrolysis or by treatment with beta-glucuronidase, and contains glucuronic acid. The metabolite was characterized by treatment with diazomethane followed by hexamethyl-disilazane, or with periodate followed by semicarbazide, and the products were chromatographed. The metabolite has been tentatively identified as retinoyl beta-glucuronide."

We studied the properties of such revertant particles under conditions which did not favor the selection of resistant over sensitive virus particles. These particles exhibited a wide range of responses to 2-(alpha-hydroxybenzyl)-benzimidazole, from high sensitivity to high resistance. Subclones showed the same degree of sensitivity or resistance as the respective parent clones."

https://openalex.org/W1981060253,"Histone, when added at low concentrations to cultures of embryonic chick brain tissue, causes an inductive response in lactic dehydrogenase activity, whereas at higher concentrations of histone the response is repressive. This control is shown to operate by altering protein synthesis. Thus, histones exercise a primary regulatory function in the chick. Unlike lactic dehydrogenase, acetylcholine esterase is stable in this system and is not affected by histones or inhibitors of protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2414977824,"Hemophilus parainjuenzae possess a respiratory chain system with many characteristics similar to those of the mammalian system (1) and of a number of other bacteria (2): it is composed of typical flavoprotein dehydrogenases and six cytochrome pigments, three of which appear to be oxidases (3-5). These pigments are bound to particles which presumably are derived from the cytoplasmic membrane. Unusual aspects of the respiratory chain of H. parainjluenxae are the accumulation, under some conditions of growth, of large amounts of one cytochrome that is not reducible in the presence of substrates (4,6,7), and the variability of the proportions of the different pigments observed under different growth conditions and in different phases of growth (57). Further studies, reported here, show that bacteria having widely varying proportions of the different cytochromes can have respiration rates that are similar with a number of substrates. These bacteria are readily permeable to substrates and pyridine nucleotides (8). Thus it is possible to compare the reactions of the membrane-bound system in intact bacteria and in the small membrane fragments derived from it upon rupture of the cells. Such studies show little modification of the reactivity immediately after preparation of the membrane fragments, but upon standing some pigments become dissociated from the membrane. As long as the pigments are associated with the membrane in proper orientation, electron transport can proceed rapidly, and the cytochromes and flavoproteins can be seen to undergo oxidation and reduction during electron transport. In either intact cells or particles, the over-all rate of electron transport is always limited by the reaction of the membrane-bound flavoprotein dehydrogenases with the appropriate substrate. Pyridine nucleotide is reduced by dehydrogenases which are not membrane-bound, and the rates of reduction of diphosphopyridine nucleotide are low. Taken together, all of the studies on the respiratory chain system of H. parainj~nzae show that its properties resemble those of mammalian mitochondria in most aspects. However, there is compelling evidence that in these bacteria the system is not composed of fixed units of pigments with a definite “stoichiometry” of the components."

However, five cases of leukemia were identified among matched controls of the spouses. The incidence of leukemia in husbands and wives of individuals who die of leukemia is not significantly greater than that of a control group. This is consistent with the hypothesis that adult leukemia is not contagious in the usual sense."

This was somewhat unexpected, since chromosome aberrations in the liver cells were less frequent after irradiation at the low dose rate. Other types of tumors were not increased by irradiation with gamma-rays at the low dose rate. It is suggested that indirect hormonal mechanisms may contribute to the production of the hepatomas as well as of the ovarian adenomas."

Such hybrid molecules, however, block complement fixation by intact antibody to ovalbumin. Molecules of antibody reconstituted in the absence of other protein retain the capacity to fix complement. The data suggest that small complexes containing excess univalent antibody do not fix complement and that lattice formation is required for fixation."

This observation is not readily accounted for by classical lipid-pore membrane permeability models. Alternative models are considered, in which protein and nonelectrolyte transport are dissociated; the dissociation could be (i) topological, due to compartmentalization, or (ii) functional, for example, if protein loss were due to change of the state of intracellular protein or if urea transport were limited by diffusion in the cytoplasm."
