https://openalex.org/W2000723365,"The formation of a surface metal-metal bond can produce large perturbations in the electronic, chemical, and catalytic properties of a metal. Recent studies indicate that charge transfer is an important component in surface metal-metal bonds that involve dissimilar elements. The larger the charge transfer, the stronger the cohesive energy of the bimetallic bond. On a surface, the formation of a heteronuclear metal-metal bond induces a flow of electron density toward the element with the larger fraction of empty states in its valence band. This behavior is completely contrary to that observed in bulk alloys, indicating that the nature of a heteronuclear metal-metal bond depends strongly on the structural geometry of the bimetallic system."

A significant impediment to the synthesis of variants of commercially available amorphous fluoropolymers is their general insolubility in most solvents except chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The environmental concerns about CFCs can be circumvented by preparing these technologically important materials in supercritical fluids. The homogeneous solution polymerization of highly fluorinated acrylic monomers can be achieved in supercritical carbon dioxide by using free radical methods. In addition, detailed decomposition rates and efficiency factors were measured for azobisisobutyronitrile in supercritical carbon dioxide and were compared to those obtained with conventional liquid solvents."
https://openalex.org/W2145996193,"Fully rotationally resolved spectra of three isotopic species of 1:1 clusters of benzene with water (H2O, D2O, and HDO) were fit to yield moments of inertia that demonstrate unambiguously that water is positioned above the benzene plane in nearly free internal rotation with both hydrogen atoms pointing toward the π cloud. Ab initio calculations (MP2 level of electron correlation and 6-31 G** basis set with basis set superposition error corrections) predict a binding energy De ≳ 1.78 kilocalories per mole. In both the experimental and theoretical structures, water is situated nearly 1 angstrom within the van der Waals contacts of the monomers, a clear manifestation of hydrogen bond formation in this simple model of aqueous-π electron interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1963700381,"Fire scar and tree growth chronologies (1700 to 1905) and fire statistics (since 1905) from Arizona and New Mexico show that small areas burn after wet springs associated with the low phase of the Southern Oscillation (SO), whereas large areas burn after dry springs associated with the high phase of the SO. Through its synergistic influence on spring weather and fuel conditions, climatic variability in the tropical Pacific significantly influences vegetation dynamics in the southwestern United States. Synchrony of fire-free and severe fire years across diverse southwestern forests implies that climate forces fire regimes on a subcontinental scale; it also underscores the importance of exogenous factors in ecosystem dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2042537980,"The converse piezoelectric effect, in which an electric field applied across a piezoelectric material induces a stress in that material, has spurred many recent developments in mass measurement techniques. These methods commonly rely on the changes in the vibrational resonant frequency of piezoelectric quartz oscillators that result from changes in mass on the surface of the oscillator. The dependence of frequency on mass has been exploited extensively for mass measurements in vacuum or gas phase, for example, thickness monitors for thin-film preparation and sensors for chemical agents. Advances in piezoelectric methodology in the last decade now allow dynamic measurements of minute mass changes (< 10(-9) grams per square centimeter) at surfaces, thin films, and electrode interfaces in liquid media as well. Mass measurements associated with a diverse collection of interfacial processes can be readily performed, including chemical and biological sensors, reactions catalyzed by enzymes immobilized on surfaces, electron transfer at and ion exchange in thin polymer films, and doping reactions of conducting polymers."
https://openalex.org/W2087549641,"(40)Ar/(39)Ar dating of drill core samples of a glassy melt rock recovered from beneath a massive impact breccia contained within the 180-kilometer subsurface Chicxulub crater in Yucatán, Mexico, has yielded well-behaved incremental heating spectra with a mean plateau age of 64.98 +/- 0.05 million years ago (Ma). The glassy melt rock of andesitic composition was obtained from core 9 (1390 to 1393 meters) in the Chicxulub 1 well. The age of the melt rock is virtually indistinguishable from (40)Ar/(39)Ar ages obtained on tektite glass from Beloc, Haiti, and Arroyo el Mimbral, northeastern Mexico, of 65.01 +/- 0.08 Ma (mean plateau age for Beloc) and 65.07 +/- 0.10 Ma (mean total fusion age for both sites). The (40)Ar/(39)Ar ages, in conjunction with geochemical and petrological similarities, strengthen the recent suggestion that the Chicxulub structure is the source for the Haitian and Mexican tektites and is a viable candidate for the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact site."
https://openalex.org/W2019135263,The reversal and splitting of traveling concentration waves was observed in a one-dimensional Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction medium under the influence of low-intensity electric field gradients ( approximately 10 V per centimeter). The wave reversal and splitting were strongly correlated with a characteristic transformation of the shape of both the wave front and the refractory tail of a wave in the local field gradient. The secondary role of generated hydrodynamic flow on wave transformation was also investigated.
https://openalex.org/W2022389053,"A new locality of early Late Triassic age in the Richmond basin of east-central Virginia has yielded abundant remains of a diversified assemblage of small to medium-sized tetrapods that closely resembles Southern Hemisphere (Gondwanan) assemblages in the predominance of certain synapsids. Associated palynomorphs indicate an early middle Carnian age for the fossiliferous strata. The discovery suggests that previously recognized differences between tetrapod assemblages of early Late Triassic age from Gondwana and Laurasia at least in part reflect differences in stratigraphic age, rather than geographic separation."
https://openalex.org/W2084684745,"The mate-finding behavior of the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) includes both female- and male-produced sex pheromones used in distinct mate-finding strategies. Both sexes release multicomponent pheromones attractive to the opposite sex. Male pheromone is comprised of d-linalool, m-cresol, and p-cresol released from abdominal hair pencils. Males exposed to host plant odor or to the female sex pheromone (Z)-7-dodecen-1-ol acetate are more attractive to females, suggesting stimulation of male pheromone release."

https://openalex.org/W1979489349,"It is proposed that high-velocity pulsars are produced in extended galactic halos, and possibly in extragalactic space, from primordial (population III) stars. Such a population of neutron stars could provide an explanation for the gamma-ray bursters and would then accommodate the possibility that most bursters are not in the visible parts of galaxies."

https://openalex.org/W2022763806,"The x-ray source GX 5-1 in the galactic bulge has been observed with the position-sensitive proportional counter onboard the Röntgen satellite (ROSAT) during and after a lunar occultation. Extended emission around the source was unambiguously discovered while the central source was behind the lunar rim. This emission is interpreted as a dust-scattering halo around GX 5-1 that has a fractional intensity of 28 percent, implying a grain column density between GX 5-1 and Earth of approximately 3 x 10(10) per square centimeter. The halo derived from imaging during the ROSAT all-sky survey is identical to that obtained from the lunar occultation, thus demonstrating that the ROSAT x-ray mirror scattering has not changed as compared with the mirror properties as measured in preflight calibrations."
