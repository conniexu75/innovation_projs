https://openalex.org/W2025694904,"Neutrophils kill bacteria by ingesting them into phagosomes where superoxide and cytoplasmic granule constituents, including myeloperoxidase, are released. Myeloperoxidase converts chloride and hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is strongly microbicidal. However, the role of oxidants in killing and the species responsible are poorly understood and the subject of current debate. To assess what oxidative mechanisms are likely to operate in the narrow confines of the phagosome, we have used a kinetic model to examine the fate of superoxide and its interactions with myeloperoxidase. Known rate constants for reactions of myeloperoxidase have been used and substrate concentrations estimated from neutrophil morphology. In the model, superoxide is generated at several mm/s. Most react with myeloperoxidase, which is present at millimolar concentrations, and rapidly convert the enzyme to compound III. Compound III turnover by superoxide is essential to maintain enzyme activity. Superoxide stabilizes at ∼25 μm and hydrogen peroxide in the low micromolar range. HOCl production is efficient if there is adequate chloride supply, but further knowledge on chloride concentrations and transport mechanisms is needed to assess whether this is the case. Low myeloperoxidase concentrations also limit HOCl production by allowing more hydrogen peroxide to escape from the phagosome. In the absence of myeloperoxidase, superoxide increases to >100 μm but hydrogen peroxide to only ∼30 μm. Most of the HOCl reacts with released granule proteins before reaching the bacterium, and chloramine products may be effectors of its antimicrobial activity. Hydroxyl radicals should form only after all susceptible protein targets are consumed."
https://openalex.org/W2082083390,"Adenosine has been widely associated with hypoxia of many origins, including those associated with inflammation and tumorogenesis. A number of recent studies have implicated metabolic control of adenosine generation at sites of tissue hypoxia. Here, we examine adenosine receptor control and amplification of signaling through transcriptional regulation of endothelial and epithelial adenosine receptors. Initial studies confirmed previous findings indicating selective induction of human adenosine A2B receptor (A2BR) by hypoxia. Analysis of the cloned human A2BR promoter identified a functional hypoxia-responsive region, including a functional binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) within the A2BR promoter. Further studies examining HIF-1alpha DNA binding and HIF-1alpha gain and loss of function confirmed strong dependence of A2BR induction by HIF-1alpha in vitro and in vivo mouse models. Additional studies in endothelia overexpressing full-length A2BR revealed functional phenotypes of increased barrier function and enhanced angiogenesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate transcriptional coordination of A2BR by HIF-1alpha and amplified adenosine signaling during hypoxia. These findings may provide an important link between hypoxia and metabolic conditions associated with inflammation and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964190328,"Cells respond to the shift of intracellular environment toward pro-oxidant conditions by activating the transcription of numerous genes. This response is based on the activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor, which transactivates the genes containing in their promoters the antioxidant response cis-elements (AREs). If the oxidative stress provokes DNA damage, a second response of the cell takes place, based on the activation of p53, which induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Here we have explored the cross-talk between these two regulatory mechanisms. The results show that p53 counteracts the Nrf2-induced transcription of three ARE-containing promoters of the x-CT, NQO1, and GST-alpha1 genes. Endogenous transcripts of these antioxidant genes accumulate as a consequence of Nrf2 overexpression or exposure to electrophile diethylmaleate, but these effects are again blocked by p53 overexpression or endogenous p53 activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments support the hypothesis that this p53-dependent trans-repression is due to the direct interaction of p53 with the ARE-containing promoters. Considering that p53-induced apoptosis requires an accumulation of reactive oxygen species, this negative control on the Nrf2 transactivation appears to be aimed to prevent the generation of a strong anti-oxidant intracellular environment that could hinder the induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1996583908,"Recent studies suggest that moderate red wine consumption reduces the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical dementia. Using Tg2576 mice, which model AD-type amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) neuropathology, we tested whether moderate consumption of the red wine Cabernet Sauvignon modulates AD-type neuropathology and cognitive deterioration. The wine used in the study was generated using Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from Fresno, California, and was delivered to Tg2576 in a final concentration of approximately 6% ethanol. We found that Cabernet Sauvignon significantly attenuated AD-type deterioration of spatial memory function and Abeta neuropathology in Tg2576 mice relative to control Tg2576 mice that were treated with either a comparable amount of ethanol or water alone. Chemical analysis showed the Cabernet Sauvignon used in this study contains a very low content of resveratrol (0.2 mg/L), 10-fold lower than the minimal effective concentration shown to promote Abeta clearance in vitro. Our studies suggest Cabernet Sauvignon exerts a beneficial effect by promoting nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein, which ultimately prevents the generation of Abeta peptides. This study supports epidemiological evidence indicating that moderate wine consumption, within the range recommended by the FDA dietary guidelines of one drink per day for women and two for men, may help reduce the relative risk for AD clinical dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2015139547,"Recruitment of human CD34+ progenitor cells toward vascular lesions and differentiation into vascular cells has been regarded as a critical initial step in atherosclerosis. Previously we found that adherent platelets represent potential mediators of progenitor cell homing besides their role in thrombus formation. On the other hand, foam cell formation represents a key process in atherosclerotic plaque formation. To investigate whether platelets are involved in progenitor cell recruitment and differentiation into endothelial cells and foam cells, we examined the interactions of platelets and CD34+ progenitor cells. Cocultivation experiments showed that human platelets recruit CD34+ progenitor cells via the specific adhesion receptors P-selectin/PSGL-1 and beta1- and beta2-integrins. Furthermore, platelets were found to induce differentiation of CD34+ progenitor cells into mature foam cells and endothelial cells. Platelet-induced foam cell generation could be prevented partially by HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors via reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion. Finally, agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and -gamma attenuated platelet-induced foam cell generation and production of MMP-9. The present study describes a potentially important mechanism of platelet-induced foam cell formation and generation of endothelium in atherogenesis and atheroprogression. The understanding and modulation of these mechanisms may offer new treatment strategies for patients at high risk for atherosclerotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2040245802,"Eukaryote cells depend on membrane lipid trafficking from biogenic membranes, like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to other membranes in the cell. Two major routes for membrane lipid transport are recognized: vesicular trafficking and lipid transfer at zones of close contact between membranes. Specific ER regions involved in such membrane contact sites (MCSs) have been isolated, and lipid transfer at MCSs as well as protein-protein interactions between the partaking membranes have been demonstrated (reviewed by Holthuis, J. C. M., and Levine, T. P. (2005) Nat. Rev. 6, 209–220). Here we present the first demonstration of the physical association between membranes involved in MCSs: by using optical imaging and manipulation, strong attracting forces between ER and chloroplasts are revealed. We used Arabidopsis thaliana expressing green fluorescent protein in the ER lumen and observed leaf protoplasts by confocal microscopy. The ER network was evident, with ER branch end points apparently localized at chloroplast surfaces. After rupture of a protoplast using a laser scalpel, the cell content was released. ER fragments remained attached to the released chloroplasts and could be stretched out by optical tweezers. The applied force, 400 pN, could not drag a chloroplast free from its attached ER, which could reflect protein-protein interactions at the ER-chloroplast MCSs. As chloroplasts rely on import of ER-synthesized lipids, we propose that lipid transfer occurs at these MCSs. We suggest that lipid transfer at the MCSs also occurs in the opposite direction, for example to channel plastid-synthesized acyl groups to supply substrates for ER-localized synthesis of membrane and storage lipids.

These lipids are transported to their target membranes in bulk form as vesicle constituents or as monomers at membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the ER and the target membrane. With target membranes outside the secretory pathway, lipid trafficking occurs exclusively via MCSs (reviewed by Holthuis and Levine (1Holthuis J.C.M. Levine T.P. Nat. Rev. 2005; 6: 209-220Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar)). In plants, it is well established that a major lipid trafficking route is from the ER to the chloroplast, to supply substrates for the synthesis of the chloroplast galacto- and sulfolipids in the chloroplast envelope (2Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 3Moreau P. Bessoule J.J. Mongrand S. Testet E. Vincent P. Cassagne C. Prog.

Awai K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The molecular details of lipid transport from the ER to the chloroplast to date remain obscure, but earlier we reported biochemical evidence for ER-chloroplast associations: lipid synthesizing activities usually attributed to the ER remained associated with highly purified chloroplasts (6Kjellberg J.M. Trimborn M. Andersson M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and transfer of lipid precursor for chloroplast lipid synthesis could be reconstituted between isolated enriched ER and isolated chloroplasts (7Andersson M.X. Kjellberg J.M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1684: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is well established that in plants, as in other eukaryotes, the ER forms an extended network throughout the cytosol (8Staehelin L.A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Close associations between ER and non-green plastids have been visualized in several plant tissues by electron microscopy (9Wooding F.B.P. Northcote D.H. J. Botany. 1965; 52: 526-531Crossref Google Scholar, 10Whatley J.M. McLean B. Juniper P.E. New Phytol. 1991; 117: 209-217Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Kaneko Y. Keegstra K.

Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 51-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and associations between ER and chloroplasts have been visualized in cell cultures by laser scanning confocal microscopy (13Hansson M.R. Köhler R.H. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we took advantage of the development of lasers for micro-manipulation of biological samples to study MCSs between ER and chloroplasts. Using laser scalpels and optical tweezers (14Goksör M. Diez A. Enger J. Hanstorp D. Nyström T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we aimed to determine the force of attraction between chloroplasts and the attached ER. In addition, we isolated and characterized a chloroplast-associated ER fraction. Membrane Isolation and Characterization—Arabidopsis thaliana stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the ER lumen (15Matsushima R. Hayashi Y. Kondo M. Shimada T. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was grown for 4–5 weeks in a growth chamber at 60% relative humidity and an 8-h light (24 °C)/16-h dark (20 °C) regime. Protoplasts were isolated from the leaves (16Mathur J. Koncz C. Martinez-Zapater J. Salinas J. Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 82: Arabidopsis Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 35-42Google Scholar) and were used directly for optical manipulation or as starting material for chloroplast isolation (17Räntfors M. Evertsson I. Kjellberg J.M. Sandelius A.S. Physiol. Plant. 2000; 110: 262-270Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) after lysis by three strokes in a chilled hand homogenizer. Garden pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Kelvedon Wonder (Weibull, Sweden)) was grown for 7–8 days in a climate chamber (6Kjellberg J.M. Trimborn M. Andersson M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From harvest on, all steps in the membrane isolation procedures were carried out at 4 °C. To isolate chloroplast-associated membranes of ER origin, a procedure based on the isolation of mitochondria-associated ER from purified yeast mitochondria was used (18Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Intact chloroplasts were isolated from pea seedlings (17Räntfors M. Evertsson I. Kjellberg J.M. Sandelius A.S. Physiol. Plant. 2000; 110: 262-270Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The first chloroplast supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 10 000 × gmax, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × gmax. The resulting pellet is referred to as the micro-some (MS) fraction. The MS pellet and the pellet of intact chloroplasts were each suspended in 10 mm MES/KOH, pH 6.0, and 0.33 m sucrose. After 15-min incubation on ice, the suspensions were top-loaded onto continuous sucrose gradients (20–50% w/v sucrose) in the same buffer. The gradients were centrifuged for 60 min in a swing out rotor at 100,000 × gmax. From each gradient, the top band was collected, diluted in 30 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 and pelleted at 100 000 × gmax for 30 min. The membranes were re-suspended in the same buffer as used for pelleting, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until further analyses. Envelope membranes were isolated from chloroplasts isolated from 9- to 10-day-old pea seedlings as described (19Douce R. Joyard J. Edelman M. Hallick R. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier/North-Holland, Amsterdam1982: 139-256Google Scholar). Analyses of membrane components and marker enzyme activities were assayed as described previously (20Andersson M.X. Larsson K.E. Tjellström H. Liljenberg C. Sand-elius A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27578-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Optical Imaging and Manipulation—Specimens obtained from GFP-expressing A. thaliana were imaged with a Zeiss 510LSM confocal microscope. A plan apochromat 63 × oil 1.4 objective was used. Both GFP and chlorophyll were excited with a 488-nm laser; GFP emission was monitored at 505–530 and chlorophyll through a 650-nm long pass filter. The technical platform for simultaneous optical manipulation and confocal imaging is described elsewhere (14Goksör M. Diez A. Enger J. Hanstorp D. Nyström T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study the optical tweezers made use of a 1064-nm diode-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser, and the power in the optical trap typically ranged from 500 milliwatt to 2 watts. The nitrogen laser used as the optical scalpel had a wavelength of 337 nm, a pulse width less than 4 ns, and maximum pulse energy of 300 μJ. The pulse energy of the laser scalpel was optimized with respect to the rupture level of the outer boundary of the cell by two neutral density filters combined with crossed polarizers. Calibration of the linearity of the trapping potential was performed using the drag force method (21Ghislain L.P. Switz N.A. Webb W.W. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1994; 65: 2762-2768Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Imaging of Chloroplast-associated ER—To study the spatial relationship between the ER and the chloroplasts, we used transgenic A. thaliana expressing GFP in the ER lumen (15Matsushima R. Hayashi Y. Kondo M. Shimada T. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protoplasts isolated from leaves of 4- to 5-week-old plants were observed by confocal microscopy. The ER appeared as an extensive network enclosing the chloroplasts, with ER branch end points apparently localized at the chloroplast surfaces (Fig. 2A). This observation is in accordance with previous studies (8Staehelin L.A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Hansson M.R. Köhler R.H. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 529-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but neither these studies nor the present observation demonstrate actual physical connections between the ER and the chloroplast surface. We then proceeded to isolate chloroplasts from the GFP-expressing leaf protoplasts. The majority of the isolated chloroplasts were associated with GFP-fluorescing bodies (Fig. 2B). This observation suggests the occurrence of specific areas of association between the ER and the chloroplast strong enough to survive the chloroplast isolation procedure. The presence of the lumenal fluorescent ER protein also suggests that the attached ER had been part of the ER continuum of the cell. Optical Manipulation of Chloroplast-associated ER—To further study the association between ER and chloroplasts, we utilized optical manipulation. A confocal microscope equipped with optical tweezers and a laser scalpel was used for simultaneous imaging and optical manipulation (14Goksör M. Diez A. Enger J. Hanstorp D. Nyström T. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Leaf protoplasts were isolated from the GFP-expressing A. thaliana. One protoplast at a time was observed and subjected to a single pulse from the laser scalpel focused at its outer boundary (Fig. 3A). This treatment ruptured the cell and released its contents, which settled onto the coverslip (Fig. 3, B and C). The pulse energy needed to rupture the cell boundary ranged from 50 to 75 μJ, measured at the entrance aperture of the microscope objective. We were able to capture a single chloroplast with the optical tweezers just after the disruption of the cell (Fig. 3D). When this chloroplast was pulled free of the other chloroplasts and cellular constituents, a strand of GFP-fluorescent ER was stretched out between this chloroplast and other chloroplasts (Fig. 3, E and F). This course of events clearly demonstrates genuine physical connections between chloroplasts and the ER in A. thaliana (also see movies 1 and 2 in the supplemental material, from which the panels in Fig. 3 originate). We repeated this procedure several times, with independently isolated protoplasts, and obtained the same results each time. Our next step was to determine the extent of the associative forces between an isolated chloroplast and its associated ER. Here, it was evident that the MCS constituted a small distinct area of attachment. The fluorescent ER attached to a chloroplast could be captured in the optical trap (Fig. 4A). When the chloroplast attached to the ER was moved, the captured ER strand was stretched out (Fig. 4B). The ER strand did not separate from the chloroplast nor did it break. This was demonstrated by releasing the ER strand from the optical trap, which instantly resulted in that the ER relaxed back toward the chloroplast surface (Fig. 4, C and D; see movie 3 in the supplemental material). The experiment was repeated several times with independently isolated chloroplasts. We were always able to deform and stretch the ER to a significant degree. However, we were never able to pull the ER free of the chloroplast or to break it with the 400 pN optical force applied nor could we detect any deformation of chloroplasts during these experiments. We earlier proposed the concept of chloroplast-associated ER in pea, based on biochemical studies (6Kjellberg J.M. Trimborn M. Andersson M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Andersson M.X. Kjellberg J.M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1684: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate whether chloroplast-ER associations could also be visually demonstrated in pea, we incubated leaves with the fluorescent probe dihexaoxacarbocyanine (DiOC6), which labels the endo-membrane system (22Grabski S. de Feijter A.W. Schindler M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Isolated chloroplasts were observed by confocal microscopy and small fluorescent bodies were again observed associated with the chloroplasts. The chloroplast envelope also became labeled with DiOC6 but to a markedly lower extent. The putative ER-derived membranes on the pea chloroplasts could also be captured with the optical tweezers and stretched but not pulled free from the chloroplast when applying an optical force of ∼425 pN (Fig. 4, E and F). However, after treatment with 0.3 mg·ml-1 trypsin, the putative ER-derived membrane could be pulled free from a chloroplast using an optical force of 130 ± 7 pN. Isolation of an ER Fraction Associated to Intact Chloroplasts—We thus had evidence suggesting chloroplast-associated ER also in pea and, furthermore, that this putative ER could be separated from the chloroplasts. To isolate this fraction a method used to isolate an ER fraction associated with yeast mitochondria (18Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was adapted to pea chloroplasts (Fig. 1A). Chloroplasts were isolated and the associated putative ER was released from the chloroplasts by incubation at a lowered pH (18Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). After sucrose gradient centrifugation, a membrane fraction was collected from the top of the gradient. We denote this fraction plastid associated membranes (PLAMs), analogous to the ER associations reported for mitochondria, MAMs (mitochondria associated membranes) (18Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and plasma membrane, PAMs (pplasma membrane associated membranes) (24Pichler H. Gaigg B. Hrastnik C. Achleitner G. Kohlwein S.D. Zellnig G. Perktold A. Daum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Typically 150–300 μg of PLAM protein was obtained from intact chloroplasts corresponding to 3–5 mg of chlorophyll. Membrane composition and marker enzyme activities were measured in this fraction and, for comparison, also in a chloroplast envelope fraction and in a light microsome fraction (Light MS) obtained by treating a bulk leaf membrane fraction identically to the treatment of the intact chloroplasts (Fig. 1A). Analyses of polypeptide patterns (Fig. 1B), lipid compositions (Table 1) and enzyme activities (results not shown) clearly demonstrate that the pea PLAM fraction was neither of chloroplast envelope origin nor representative of a general light membrane fraction. It did not contain inner mitochondrial membrane nor was the thylakoid membrane present to any significant extent. The PLAM fraction contained the ER-associated activities NADH-dependent cytochrome c reductase and phosphatidylcholine synthase, whereas the chloroplast envelope-localized synthesis of the major thylakoid lipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) was about 15 times higher in an isolated envelope fraction than in the PLAM fraction. The lipid composition of the PLAM was compared with those of the Light MS and the published lipid composition of an outer envelope fraction isolated from pea chloroplasts (25Cline K. Andrews J. Mersey B. Newcomb E.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3595-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Phospholipids constituted more than 80% of the PLAM and Light MS lipids but less than 60% of the chloroplast outer envelope lipids. The phospholipid compositions of the three fractions differed markedly. The low proportion of glucosylceramides and the barely detectable proportion of free sterols in the PLAM fraction indicate that tonoplast and plasma membrane (20Andersson M.X. Larsson K.E. Tjellström H. Liljenberg C. Sand-elius A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27578-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were largely absent from this fraction. In the PLAM fraction, MGDG and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) together constituted 10% of the lipids, with approximately equal contributions by each lipid. The PLAM thus clearly differed from the outer chloroplast envelope, where galactolipids were far more abundant due to a high DGDG content. The polypeptide patterns of the PLAM fraction distinctly differed from those of isolated chloroplast envelope (Env) and the light MS (Light MS) fraction (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1The lipid composition of PLAM, light MS, and the outer chloroplast envelope For an outline of the isolation of PLAM and light MS, see Fig. 1A.

Membranes involved in the vesicular secretory pathway have been shown to receive lipids by both pathways (1Holthuis J.C.M. Levine T.P. Nat. Rev. 2005; 6: 209-220Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar), whereas lipid transfer between the ER and mitochondria both in yeast (18Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim.

In plants, a corresponding lipid trafficking route, between ER and plastids, is assumed to provide the plastids with membrane lipid precursors (4Kelly A.A. Dörmann P. Curr. Opin.

Acta. 2004; 1684: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the association at MCSs between ER and its various target membranes has not been demonstrated previously, neither with plant, animal, nor yeast cells. We here provide the first dynamic demonstration of strong attracting forces at MCS. The investigation used confocal microscopy in combination with a laser scalpel and optical tweezers to visualize and optically manipulate ER-chloroplast MCSs. When the laser scalpel disrupted a protoplast, the ER network broke up and ER fragments remained associated with the chloroplasts, thus demonstrating ER-chloroplast MCSs. The chloroplast-ER associations withstood a force exceeding 400 pN, as applied by optical tweezers. Rupture strengths between 160 and 300 pN of specific protein-protein interactions have been reported for the biotinstreptavidin interaction (26Florin E.L. Moy V.T. Gaub H.E. Science. 1994; 264: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). It is thus feasible that protein-protein interaction mediates the association at the ER-chloroplast MCSs. This conclusion is supported by that protease treatment allowed the separation of ER and chloroplasts when a much lower optical force was applied. The observation that ER fragments associated with chloroplasts remained attached during a chloroplast isolation procedure fits with our earlier findings that lipid metabolizing activities attributed to the ER co-isolated with chloroplasts (6Kjellberg J.M. Trimborn M. Andersson M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to visualize the association, we were able to isolate and biochemically characterize the associated ER, a putative PLAM fraction. Both its polypeptide pattern and membrane lipid composition differed substantially from the chloroplast envelope. The PLAM polypeptide composition also clearly differed from that of a light membrane fraction, which should rule out the possibility that the PLAM fraction represented membranes that randomly associated with the chloroplasts during the isolation procedure. The associated enzyme activities as well as the lipid composition of the PLAM fraction showed a resemblance to the ER, with a small degree of envelope membrane contamination. We suggest that the PLAM fraction largely represents the observed chloroplast-associated ER. There is a quite extensive list of different identified, and suggested, structural and/or functional domains of the plant ER (8Staehelin L.A. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Based on our findings, we propose that PLAMs should be added to the list of plant ER domains. Although the function(s) of this domain remains unidentified, by analogy with the MAMs, it appears reasonable to suggest that plant PLAMs are involved in the trafficking of chloroplast membrane lipid precursors from the ER to chloroplasts and other plastids. In addition to mediating transport of acyl lipids from the ER to plastids, PLAMs could also participate in lipid trafficking in the opposite direction. One instance could be during phosphate limitation, when significant proportions of phospholipids are replaced with the galactolipid DGDG (27Härtel H. Dörmann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) in the plasma membrane (20Andersson M.X. Larsson K.E. Tjellström H. Liljenberg C. Sand-elius A.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the tonoplast (20Andersson M.X. Larsson K.E. Tjellström H. Liljenberg C. Sand-elius A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27578-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This DGDG is most probably synthesized in the outer chloroplast envelope (30Kelly A.A. Froehlich J.E. Dörmann P. Plant Cell. 2001; 15: 2694-2706Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and we suggest the possibility that PLAMs could partake in lipid trafficking from the chloroplast envelope to the ER for further transport to the other membranes. For DGDG transfer to mitochondria, however, a direct transfer between the organelles was suggested (29Jouhet J. Maréchal E. Baldan B. Bligny R. Joyard J. Block M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The PLAM could also partake in the export of plastid-synthesized fatty acids to the ER. In a mutant of A. thaliana lacking ER-localized phospholipid acyl desaturases, non-plastid membrane acyl lipids nevertheless contained polyunsaturated acyl groups, indicating that the plastid-localized desaturases supplied the rest of the cell with polyunsaturated acyl chains (31Miquel M. Browse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1502-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yet another role for PLAMs would be an involvement in the trafficking of plastid-synthesized acyl chains to supply substrates for the ER-localized synthesis of triacylglycerols. A close connection between plastids and ER may be necessary for efficient channeling of acyl groups and is consistent with labeling kinetics observed during lipid metabolic studies of seed and leaf glycerolipid formation (32Cahoon E.B. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Koo A.J.K. Ohlrogge J.B. Pollard M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16101-16110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The recent report that α-carbonic anhydrase is imported to the chloroplast after glycosylation in compartments of the secre-tory pathway (34Villarejo A. Burén S. Larsson S. Déjardin A. Monné M. Rudhe C. Karlsson J. Jansson S. Lerouge P. Rolland N. von Heijne G. Grebe M. Bako L. Samuelsson G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) opens up speculation that PLAMs and PLAM-chloroplast MCSs also partake in protein trafficking. Clearly, the possible involvement of PLAMs and PLAM-chloroplast MCSs in bidirectional lipid trafficking, as well as their possible involvement in protein trafficking deserves further attention. To summarize, we have presented the first visual evidence for strong attracting forces between two separate membrane compartments of a cell. By using optical manipulation techniques, strong physical associations between ER and chloroplasts were evident and the force of attraction may suggest protein-protein interactions. We also isolated a fraction of chloroplast-associated ER, the PLAM fraction, and an initial biochemical characterization revealed its relationship with the ER. We propose that trafficking of membrane lipids and membrane lipid precursors between the ER and the chloroplast envelope occurs at MCSs between the envelope and a specific subdomain of the ER, the PLAM.

https://openalex.org/W2067493579,"Intracellular transduction pathways that are dependent on activation of the CaR by Ca(o)2+ have been studied extensively in parathyroid and other cell types, and include cytosolic calcium, phospholipases C, A2, and D, protein kinase C isoforms and the cAMP/protein kinase A system. In this study, using bone marrow cells isolated from CaR-/- mice as well as DN-CaR-transfected RAW 264.7 cells, we provide evidence that expression of the CaR plays an important role in osteoclast differentiation. We also establish that activation of the CaR and resultant stimulation of PLC are involved in high Ca(o)2+-induced apoptosis of mature rabbit osteoclasts. Similar to RANKL, Ca(o)2+ (20 mM) appeared to trigger rapid and significant nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in a CaR- and PLC-dependent manner. In summary, our data suggest that stimulation of the CaR may play a pivotal role in the control of both osteoclast differentiation and apoptosis in the systems studied here through a signaling pathway involving activation of the CaR, phospholipase C, and NF-kappaB."

Phosphorylation of PDC by the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK2 and PDK4) inhibits PDC activity. Expression of the PDK genes is elevated in diabetes, leading to the decreased oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In these studies we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the PDK4 gene by the estrogen-related receptors (ERRα and ERRγ). The ERRs are orphan nuclear receptors whose physiological roles include the induction of fatty acid oxidation in heart and muscle. Previously, we found that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC-1α) stimulates the expression of PDK4. Here we report that ERRα and ERRγ stimulate the PDK4 gene in hepatoma cells, suggesting a novel role for ERRs in controlling pyruvate metabolism. In addition, both ERR isoforms recruit PGC-1α to the PDK4 promoter. Insulin, which decreases the expression of the PDK4 gene, inhibits the induction of PDK4 by ERRα and ERRγ. The forkhead transcription factor (FoxO1) binds the PDK4 gene and contributes to the induction of PDK4 by ERRs and PGC-1α.

Bowker-Kinley M.M. Huang B. Wu P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2002; 42: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The expression patterns of the PDK isoforms are tissue-specific (8Bowker-Kinley M.M. Davis W.I. Wu P. Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Biochem.

PGC-1α belongs to a family of transcriptional coactivators that includes PGC-1β and the PGC-1-related coactivator (12Andersson U. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell.

PGC-1α was originally cloned from brown adipose tissue through its interactions with the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (14Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). PGC-1α plays a key role in various aspects of energy homeostasis including mitochondrial biogenesis, thermal regulation, and glucose metabolism (15Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr.

PGC-1α stimulates PEPCK gene expression through interactions with hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4), the glucocorticoid receptor, and forkhead transcription factor (FoxO1) (18Rhee J. Inoue Y.

Furthermore, PGC-1α regulates pyruvate metabolism in the mitochondria by inducing the PDK genes. We have shown that PGC-1α induces PDK2 and PDK4 gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PGC-1α stimulates expression of the liver isoform of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase-Iα gene, thereby increasing the hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (21Zhang Y. Ma K. Song S. Elam M.B.

Three ERRs isoforms have been identified, α, β, and γ, which are also called ERR1/NR3B1, ERR2/NR3B2, and ERR3/NR3B3, respectively (22Heard D.J. Norby P.L. Holloway J. Vissing H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 382-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptors, the ERRs contain a DNA binding domain and a ligand binding domain (23Horard B. Vanacker J.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The ligand binding domain is involved in dimerization, transcriptional activation, and interactions with coactivators. The ERRs share a homology with estrogen receptors, but ERRs do not bind to estrogen or other known physiological ligands (23Horard B. Vanacker J.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have suggested a role for ERRα and ERRγ in the control of metabolic genes. The ERRα and ERRγ subtypes are expressed in metabolically active tissues including skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and liver (22Heard D.J. Norby P.L. Holloway J. Vissing H. Mol.

Several recent reports have shown that the interactions of ERRα and PGC-1α induce oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis (29Schreiber S.N. Emter R. Hock M.B. Knutti D. Cardenas J.

The ERR isoforms bind to the PDK4 gene promoter, stimulating PDK4 gene expression and suggesting a new role for ERRs in the regulation of hepatic pyruvate metabolism. Finally, we demonstrate that insulin inhibits the induction of the PDK4 gene by both ERR isoforms and PGC-1α. Transient Transfection of Luciferase Vectors—PDK4-luciferase (PDK4-luc) constructs were transiently transfected into McA-RH7777 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (31Steffen M.L. Harrison W.R. Elder F.F. Cook G.A. Park E.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transfections included 2 μg of PDK4-luciferase along with TK-Renilla and mammalian expression vectors for HNF-4, ERRα, ERRγ, or PGC-1α (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum, 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no serum. After 24 h, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Both luciferase and Renilla activity were measured. Protein content in each lysate was determined by Bio-Rad Protein assay. Luciferase activity was corrected for both protein content and Renilla activity to account for cell density and transfection efficiency respectively. The serial deletions of the rat PDK4 promoter were created by PCR amplification (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All deletions and site-directed mutants were sequenced and confirmed by DNA sequencing facility at the University of Tennessee Molecular Resource Center. Adenoviral Infection of McA-RH7777 Cells—The adenoviruses expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), PGC-1α, ERRα, or ERRγ were purified by cesium chloride purification (17Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). McA-RH7777 cells were cultured in plain Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media containing 20 mm glucose before infection. The hepatocytes or McA-RH7777 cells were infected at an multiplicity of infection of 50 (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol.

Fortyeight hours after infection RNA was isolated from the McA-RH7777 cells. Construction of ERRα and -γ Adenovirus—The ERR adenovirus was generated using the ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length cDNAs for ERRα or -γ was cloned into the pENTR1A vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA was transferred into the pAd/CMV/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) using the Gateway LR Clonase II enzyme mix according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). The ligation reaction was transformed into One Shot TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was recovered from the TOP10 E. coli cells and transfected into 293A cells (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The 293A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Cell lysis was typically apparent in 5–7 days post-transfection. Cells and media were collected and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. The cell debris was pelleted at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Glycerol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10% and stored at –80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins from McA-RH7777 cells were harvested in PD buffer consisting of 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 6 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340). Cell membranes were removed by centrifugation for 25 min at 4 °C. An equal amount of protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a 0.45-μm pure nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, #170-6515). The primary antibodies were anti-PGC-1α (Santa Cruz, sc-13067), anti-ERRγ (Lifespan Biosciences, LS-A5960), anti-PDK2 (Abgent, #AP7039b) or anti-PDK4 (Abgent, #AP7041b). Protein bands were resolved using Super Signal West Pico or Femto chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, #34080 or 34094). Bio-Rad Quantity One Software was used to analyze individual bands. Actin (42 KDa) was used as loading control for each lane. The primary antibody was monoclonal mouse anti-actin IgM 1:1000 (Oncogene, #CP01). The goat anti-mouse IgM 1:2000 in the same kit (Oncogene, #CP01) was applied as secondary antibody. Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted from McA-RH7777 cells using RNA-Stat-60 (Tel-Test) as described previously (21Zhang Y. Ma K. Song S. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53963-53971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The RNA was initially treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37 °C for 1 h. The DNase I was stopped by the addition of DNase inactivation reagent to the sample. Equal amounts of DNA-free RNA were used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis. Up to 1 μg of RNA was mixed with 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix and 1 μl of random hexamers (50 ng/μl). Each sample was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and then placed on ice for at least 1 min. Next, 2 μl of 10× reverse transcriptase buffer, 4.5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor was added to each tube. After incubation at 25 °C for 2 min, each tube was loaded with 1 μl of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 1 h, and 70 °C for 15 min. RNase H was added to each to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The parameters for real time PCR were as follows: 95 °C for 11 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min and for the melt curve, 100 cycles of 10 s from 60 to 100 °C in 0.4 °C increments. The final concentration of primers in each well in the PCR plates was 0.1 μm. The oligonucleotide standards were diluted to 10–9, 10–8, 10–7, 10–6, 10–5 μm and used as a template for standard curve. The sequences of the target gene primers are provided in Ma et al. (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 1:500 dilution of each cDNA as template was used to measure 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and 1 μl of 1:10 or 1:20 dilution of each cDNA was used as a template to assess target genes. The 18 S rRNA normalized all PDK mRNA determinations. Gel Shift Mobility Assays—The probes for gel shift assays were created by labeling double-stranded oligonucleotides using Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP (32Song S. Zhang Y. Ma K. Jackson-Hayes L.

The labeled probe (30,000 cpm) was combined with in vitro translated ERRα and ERRγ (TNT T7 quick coupled transcription-translation system, Promega) in binding buffer containing 80 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (33Jansen M.S.

For the identification of FoxO1 binding sites, the oligomers were incubated with GST-FoxO1 (Upstate #14-343). The nonspecific competitor added to each binding reaction was 1 μg of a 1:1 ratio of poly(dI·C):poly(dA·dT). Binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and resolved on a 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gel (80:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in Tris borate running buffer (0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA) at 4 °C (33Jansen M.S.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Rat primary hepatocytes (3 × 106 in a 60-mm dish) were maintained for 48 h in RPMI 1640 media. These cells were treated with 100 nm insulin for 24 h before the harvest. McA-RH7777 cells (3 × 107 in a 150-mm dish) were maintained in plain Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media. The McA-RH7777 cells were infected with adenovirus expressing ERRγ or GFP for 3 days before cross-linking. Cross-linking was performed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min (21Zhang Y. Ma K. Song S. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53963-53971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cross-linked hepatocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped from the plate and collected by centrifuging for 5 min at 2000 × rpm. The DNA was sonicated as we have described previously (21Zhang Y. Ma K. Song S. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53963-53971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The samples were precleared by the addition of 80 μl of Salmon Sperm DNA, protein A-agarose, 50% slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, #16-157) for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. The antibodies used included anti-PGC-1α (Santa Cruz, sc-13067), anti-HNF-4 (Santa Cruz, sc-8987), anti-FoxO1 (Santa Cruz, sc-11350), or anti-ERRγ (Lifespan Biosciences, LS-A5960) at 4 °C overnight using rabbit IgG as the control. To collect the antibody-protein-DNA complex, 60 μl of protein A-agarose slurry was added for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose was washed multiple times as described previously (21Zhang Y. Ma K. Song S. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53963-53971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was precipitated with the addition of 30 μl of 5 m NaCl followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water, 4 μl of Tris, pH 6.8, 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K. After incubation at 45 °C for 1 h, genomic DNA fragments were purified using Qiaquick spin columns (Qiagen, #28104). The final eluted volume was 50 μl. A total of 2–5 μl of purified sample was used in 30–35 cycles of PCR. Primers for the rat PDK4 gene are listed in Ma et al. (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The PCR products were analyzed on 2% Nusieve 3:1 agarose (Cambrex, #50094) and visualized with MultiImage Light Cabinet with Quantity One software. PGC-1α Stimulates the PDK4 Gene—Previously, we reported that PGC-1α increases PDK4 mRNA levels in rat hepatocytes (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our first experiments examined whether PGC-1α altered the protein abundance of PDK4 in rat hepatocytes. PDK4 mRNA abundance was increased 6.0-fold after infection of hepatocytes with an adenoviral vector expressing PGC-1α (Ad-PGC-1α) (Fig. 1A). PDK4 protein abundance was assessed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figs. 1, B and C, PGC-1α increased PDK4 protein levels 2.1 ± 0.2-fold. ERR and PGC-1 Stimulate PDK4 Gene Expression—ERRα has been implicated in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal and cardiac muscle (28Huss J.M. Kopp R.P. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40265-40274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 30Mootha V.K. Handschin C. Arlow D. Xie X. St Pierre J. Sihag S. Yang W. Altshuler D. Puigserver P.

We tested whether the ERRα or ERRγ isoforms would induce the expression of the PDK2 and PDK4 genes in hepatoma cells. We infected the McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells with adenoviruses expressing ERRα (Ad-ERRα), ERRγ (Ad-ERRγ), or PGC-1α (Ad-PGC-1α). We measured the mRNA level by real-time PCR. Both ERRs induced the expression of PDK4 mRNA. ERRγ strongly stimulated expression of the PDK4 gene with a 7.7 ± 1.2-fold increase in PDK4 mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), whereas ERRα increased the PDK4 gene expression 2.8 ± 0.4-fold. ERRγ consistently induced PDK4 more strongly than ERRα. ERRα increased PDK2 mRNA levels 2.0-fold, whereas ERRγ had no effect on PDK2 mRNA abundance. PGC-1α induced PDK4 and PDK2 mRNA levels 7.9 ± 0.9- and 2.2 ± 0.2-fold, respectively. We measured the induction of PDK4 and PDK2 protein abundance by ERRγ. We infected the McA-RH7777 cells with Ad-ERRγ and harvested cell lysates. ERRγ increased the PDK4 protein abundance 1.9 ± 0.2-fold and had no effect on PDK2 protein levels (Fig. 2B). These observations are consistent with our RNA measurements. PGC-1α increased PDK4 levels 2.7 ± 0.45-fold, but PDK2 levels were not changed (Fig. 2C). The induction by PGC-1α is very similar to the induction of PDK4 by PGC-1α in primary rat hepatocytes (20Ma K. Zhang Y. Elam M.B. Cook G.A. Park E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29525-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Overall, these results show that the ERRs and PGC-1α induce PDK4 expression but have little effect on PDK2. The remainder of our studies focused on the regulation of the PDK4 gene. To determine whether ERRα or ERRγ directly stimulated the PDK4 promoter, we cotransfected the –2083/+87 rat PDK4-luciferase (PDK4-luc) vector with ERRα or ERRγ expression vectors into McA-RH7777 cells. ERRα and ERRγ increased the expression of PDK4-luciferase 3.9- and 6.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 3). PGC-1α induced the PDK4 luciferase reporter gene 2.0-fold. Cotransfection of PGC-1α and ERRs further enhanced the induction of PDK4-luciferase. As with the adenoviral infections, ERRα stimulated PDK4 less robustly than ERRγ. We created serial deletions from the 5′ end of the PDK4 promoter that were ligated to the luciferase reporter gene and transfected these reporter genes into McA-RH7777 cells. The ERR induction was lost with deletions through the –578 to –325 region of the promoter (Fig. 3). The –375/+87 PDK4-luc vector still responded to ERRγ or the combination of ERRα/PGC-1α, whereas the –325/+87 vector was not induced by ERR/PGC-1. It is possible that there is an accessory factor in the –423/–375 region that is required for ERRα action. These results suggest that the –578/–325 region mediates the ERR/PGC-1 response, and our experiments focused on this region of the promoter. Insulin Inhibits ERR-mediated Induction of the PDK4 Gene—Insulin inhibits the expression of the PDK4 and PDK2 genes (34Kwon H.S. Huang B. Unterman T.G. Harris R.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To investigate whether insulin suppressed the induction of the PDK genes by ERRs and PGC-1α, we infected McA-RH7777 cells with adenoviruses expressing ERRα and ERRγ and treated the cells with insulin. As shown in Fig. 4A, ERRα and ERRγ strongly stimulated PDK4 gene expression 3.1- and 6.6-fold, respectively. The addition of insulin reduced the ERRα and ERRγ induction of PDK4 mRNA by 48 and 44%, respectively. Insulin also decreased the PDK4 mRNA abundance in GFP-infected cells 36%. The induction by PGC-1α alone was blocked 30% by insulin. We co-infected McA cells with Ad-ERRs and Ad-PGC-1α.We observed that the ERRα/PGC-1α and ERRγ/PGC-1α increased PDK4 mRNA levels 23.8- and 18.2-fold, respectively, but that they did not induce PDK2. The synergism between ERRα/PGC-1α was stronger than ERRγ/PGC"
https://openalex.org/W1985036198,"Bacteria expressing type III secretion systems (T3SS) have been responsible for the deaths of millions worldwide, acting as key virulence elements in diseases ranging from plague to typhoid fever. The T3SS is composed of a basal body, which traverses both bacterial membranes, and an external needle through which effector proteins are secreted. We report multiple crystal structures of two proteins that sit at the tip of the needle and are essential for virulence: IpaD from Shigella flexneri and BipD from Burkholderia pseudomallei. The structures reveal that the N-terminal domains of the molecules are intramolecular chaperones that prevent premature oligomerization, as well as sharing structural homology with proteins involved in eukaryotic actin rearrangement. Crystal packing has allowed us to construct a model for the tip complex that is supported by mutations designed using the structure."
https://openalex.org/W2078689089,"Vinculin regulates cell adhesion by strengthening contacts between extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. Binding of the integrin ligand, talin, to the head domain of vinculin and F-actin to its tail domain is a potential mechanism for this function, but vinculin is autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions between its head and tail domain and must be activated to bind talin and actin. Because autoinhibition of vinculin occurs by synergism between two head and tail interfaces, one hypothesis is that activation could occur by two ligands that coordinately disrupt both interfaces. To test this idea we use a fluorescence resonance energy transfer probe that reports directly on activation of vinculin. Neither talin rod, VBS3 (a talin peptide that mimics a postulated activated state of talin), nor F-actin alone can activate vinculin. But in the presence of F-actin either talin rod or VBS3 induces dose-dependent activation of vinculin. The activation data are supported by solution phase binding studies, which show that talin rod or VBS3 fails to bind vinculin, whereas the same two ligands bind tightly to vinculin head domain (Kd ∼ 100 nm). These data strongly support a combinatorial mechanism of vinculin activation; moreover, they are inconsistent with a model in which talin or activated talin is sufficient to activate vinculin. Combinatorial activation implies that at cell adhesion sites vinculin is a coincidence detector awaiting simultaneous signals from talin and actin polymerization to unleash its scaffolding activity.

Cell. 1979; 18: 193-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion structures consist of three domains; a transmembrane receptor such as an integrin, cadherin, or IgCam, extracellular matrix proteins or cell surface proteins that bind to the extracellular portion of these receptors, and a cytoplasmic plaque containing signaling and cytoskeletal proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase, Src, vinculin, talin, and actin, that assemble on the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors and regulate adhesion site turnover and strength. Cell adhesion is essential for motility in embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and metastasis; therefore, it is important to discover the regulatory mechanisms. Previous work shows that vinculin both strengthens cell adhesions and regulates signaling. Nematodes that lack vinculin fail to develop connections between muscle myofibrils and the sarcolemma, arresting at the 2-fold stage of development with muscles that do not contract (6Barstead R.J.

Although vinculin is not required for viability of embryonic cells in culture or for formation of focal adhesions in tissue culture cells, it increases the size of focal adhesions and regulates cell spreading, motility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix (13Xu W.

Vinculin likely regulates cell adhesion by forming complexes with other proteins because no enzymatic activity for vinculin has been reported. Purified domains of vinculin bind talin, α-actinin, γ-catenin, F-actin, paxillin, VASP, Arp2/3, ponsin, vinexin, Cbl-associated protein, and acidic phospholipids with Kd values in the 10-5-10-7m range (26Ziegler W.H.

The established roles of these vinculin ligands in integrin function, actin dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell motility suggest that vinculin regulates these same processes by forming complexes with these ligands. Importantly, the protein-protein interactions required are not available to purified vinculin in solution because a high affinity (Kd< 10-9) intramolecular interaction between proteolytic head (1-851) and tail (852-1066) domains of vinculin (27Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inhibits binding of most of these ligands (16DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J.

Therefore, to understand how vinculin works to regulate adhesion, motility, and transduction of force across cell membranes, it is essential to learn how it is autoinhibited and how it is activated. Recent structural and biochemical studies of vinculin show how the protein is maintained in its autoinhibited state (33Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 34Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 109-117Google Scholar). Vinculin is maintained in its high affinity autoinhibited state by cooperation between two much lower affinity interfaces, Vd1/Vt and Vd4/Vt (34Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 36Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 109-117Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This inhibition is so strong that talin rod (Tn rod) cannot bind vinculin even when both proteins are present in solution at 14 μm (34Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that two ligands might cooperate to activate vinculin by simultaneously disrupting both low affinity interfaces (34Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 36Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 109-117Google Scholar). Indeed, whereas vinculin is autoinhibited and cannot bind talin, vinculin point mutants with 40-100-fold reduced affinity of head-tail interaction (HTI) bind talin in cell lysates (36Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 109-117Google Scholar), recruit talin to ectopic sites in living cells, and prolong the residence time of talin in focal adhesions (20Cohen D.M. Kutscher B. Chen H. Murphy D.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16006-16015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The HTI mutants are still autoinhibited with respect to binding F-actin when that is the only ligand presented, consistent with the much greater strength of the remaining HTI compared with the affinity of Vt for F-actin (36Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 109-117Google Scholar). These results are both predicted by and consistent with the combinatorial activation model but do not provide direct proof of that mechanism. In contrast to the combinatorial activation hypothesis for vinculin activation, crystal structures of Vd1 and VBS3 (33Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.

Vonrhein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27667-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this model activated talin is capable by itself of activating vinculin. A variety of biochemical evidence has also been obtained to support this model (33Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 40Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol.

In this paper we demonstrate activation of vinculin by talin and actin filaments, whereas neither ligand alone is competent. We then present measurements of the affinities of vinculin, Vd1, and Vh for Tn rod domain in solution and of VBS3 for vinculin, Vh, and Vd1, which support the conclusion that reduction of intramolecular head-tail interaction in vinculin is the rate-limiting structural change required for vinculin and talin interaction. We interpret the structures of vinculin (34Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C.

Next, we reconcile the two different models for vinculin activation by showing that whereas published data is not necessarily inconsistent with the combinatorial activation model, some evidence for the combinatorial model is inconsistent with the talin or α-actinin alone model. Finally, we present our view of the potential significance of combinatorial activation of vinculin in cells. Reagents and Proteins—Actin was extracted from chicken skeletal muscle acetone powder, processed through one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization, and gel-filtered through a Sephadex G-150 column according to Pardee and Spudich (44Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Recombinant His6-tagged chicken vinculin was purified by sequential affinity chromatography on His-Bind resin, DE52 anion exchange chromatography, and Mono S chromatography. Recombinant His6-tagged vinculin 1-258 and His6-tagged vinculin 1-851 were purified by affinity chromatography. Recombinant His6-taggged Tn rod was purified by sequential affinity chromatography, Mono Q chromatography, and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration. TAMRA 5 (6Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)-aminohexanoic acid-KELIESARKVSEKVSHVLAALQA-NH2 (TAMRA-VBS3) was synthesized at the PeptideSynthesis Facility at Johns Hopkins. Construction of FRET Probes—To generate the first version of vinculin head probe (HP), a 9-bp fragment encoding a NotI site was introduced by mutagenesis (45Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) into pEGFP-C1/vinculin cDNA (chicken) immediately after the codon for amino acid 883 (46Coutu M.D. Craig S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8535-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The cDNA of EYFP (Clontech) minus the stop codon and flanked by NotI was inserted into NotI-digested vinculin. An EcoRI-SalI fragment containing vinculin1-883-YFP-vinculin-884-1066 was subcloned into pECFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate vinculin head probe (pECFP-C1/SGLRSRAQASNSGPPCPAAA-V1-883-GGR-YFP-GGR-V884-1066). Subsequently, EYFP was replaced with monomeric citrine (47Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), and ECFP was replaced with monomeric cerulean (48Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) to generate HP3 as follows. First, monomeric citrine was amplified with 5′-GGCGGCCGCatggtgagcaagggcgag-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCCcttgtacagctcgtccatgcc-3′ to generate 5′-NotI and 3′-NotI sites flanking mCitrine. The product was subcloned into TOPO pCRII and sequenced. The mCitrine fragment flanked by NotI was inserted into NotI-digested vinculin head probe to generate the HP2 version of vinculin head probe (pECFP-C1/SGLRSRAQASNSGPPCPAAA-V1-883-GGR-mCitrine-GGR-V884-1066). Next, the S72A/Y145A/H148D mutations were sequentially introduced by PCR into the pmECFP-C1 vector to generate pmCerulean-C1 (48Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The EcoRI-SalI fragment containing vinculin 1-883-mCitrine-vinculin-(884-1066) was subcloned into pmCerulean-C1 to generate HP3 (pm-Cerulean-C1/SGLRSRAQASNSGPPCPAAA-V1-883-GGR-mCitrine-GGR-V884-1066). Vinculin-A50I head probe (HP3-A50I) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) to introduce the A50I mutation in HP3. Fluorescence Depletion Assay—TAMRA VBS3 at 100 nm was incubated with His-tagged vinculin 1-258, His-tagged vinculin 1-851, or His-tagged vinculin at concentrations from 0 to 800 nm (in 3.75 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 125 mm NaCl, 1.7 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.0375 mm EDTA, 0.0375 mm EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0075% NaN3, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. His tagged protein was captured using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) with inversion for 30 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The fluorescence of unbound TAMRA VBS3 in the supernatant was assayed with a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon) at 21 °C. TAMRA emission was recorded at 582 nm with excitation at 555 nm. The integration time was 0.2 s. The excitation and emission slit widths were 3 and 5 mm, respectively. The amount of unbound TAMRA-VBS3 was derived from its fluorescence intensity in the linear range. The dissociation constant (Kd) defined in Equation 1 was transformed to the quadratic form (Equation 2). Kd was obtained by curve-fitting the data to Equation 2 using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). In these equations, R and L denote total concentration, Rf and Lf denote concentration of unbound, and RL denotes the concentration of complex. Kd=Lf×Rf/LR(Eq. 1) RL=0.5×(L+R+Kd)-0.5×(Kd×Kd+2×Kd×(L+R)+(L-R)×(L-R))1/2(Eq. 2) Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in DMEM with high glucose and glutamine (Media Tech; catalog # 10-017-CV), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. HEK 293 cells were seeded on 0.1% gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes at 3 million per plate; transfection was performed the next day with 3 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine/Plus reagent (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were lysed 2 days after transfection. Vin-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts were seeded on 35-mm tissue culture dishes coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin at 300,000 cells; transfection was performed the next day with 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine/Plus reagent. Cell Spreading Assay—Vin-/- were transfected with GFP, GFP-vinculin, or GFP-vinculin-A50I. Twenty-four hours posttransfection ∼400,000 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MediaTech 10-017-CV) containing 10% fetal calf serum were seeded into 6-well plates containing coverslips coated with polylysine and then 250 μl of 20 μg/ml of human fibronectin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C. At 2 and 3 h after plating cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, and mounted on a slide with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Areas of transfected cells were measured using the segmentation and quantitation tools in IPLab (Scanalytics). Multinucleated cells and cells that had not spread at all were excluded from the analysis. FRET Assay of Cell Lysates—Cell lysate was prepared as described (49Chen H. Cohen D.M. Choudhury D.M. Kioka N. Craig S.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The emission spectrum of fluorescent proteins in the lysate was acquired with a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon) maintained at 21 °C. CFP and FRET emissions were traced from 460 to 600 nm with excitation at 440 nm. YFP fluorescence was measured at 525 nm with excitation at 490 nm. The increment was 1 nm, and the integration time was 0.2 s. The excitation and emission slit widths were 3 and 5 mm, respectively. The concentration of head probe in cell lysates was quantified from its YFP fluorescence using purified YFP for generating a standard curve (0-100 nm). Lysate of HEK 293 cells expressing HP3 was treated first with either 5 μm G-actin or G buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm ATP) and then with increasing concentrations of Tn rod or VBS3. A series of buffer controls was performed with lysates containing HP3 treated first with G buffer and then with the sequential addition of equivalent amounts of either Tn rod storage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.02% NaN3) or VBS3 storage solution (water). The emission ratio (fluorescence at 525 nm/fluorescence at 475 nm upon excitation at 440 nm) was obtained, and the raw change in emission ratio (raw ΔER) was calculated by subtracting the emission ratio after each treatment from the emission ratio without treatment. The series of buffer controls generates a slight apparent change in raw ΔER. The raw ΔER due to dilution was then subtracted from each raw ΔER obtained from the treatment with Tn rod or VBS3 to obtain the real change in emission ratio (ΔER). The real change in emission ratio was converted to the concentration of activated vinculin or ligand-bound vinculin assuming a linear relationship between the two; ΔER = m2 × RL, and m2 is a linear coefficiency factor. The maximum change in emission ratio can be extrapolated from curve-fitting the data by Equation 3, a transformed form of Equation 2 and ΔER = m2 × RL. The maximum change in emission ratio is the multiplication of m2 and total concentration of HP3 or R.m2is 0.00195, and HP3 is 100 nm in this study. ΔER=0.5×m2×(L+R+Kd)-0.5×m2×(Kd×Kd+2+Kd×(L+R)+(L-R)×(L-R))1/2(Eq. 3) Fig. 1 defines nomenclature of the proteins, their domains, and derivative peptides that are used in the following work and depicts the relationship of structure to the biochemical findings that we present. SDS gel analysis of the recombinant proteins used is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. To assay activation of vinculin, we developed a FRET probe (HP; Fig. 1) that reports on binding of the Shigella virulence protein, IpaA, to vinculin. The binding of IpaA to vinculin is a high affinity interaction that results in exposure of vinculin actin binding activity (50Bourdet-Sicard R. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. Nhieu G.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5853-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We characterized HP using spectrofluorimetry of lysates prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing HP. HP has a strong FRET signal that is unaffected by the addition of 5 μm actin filaments (Fig. 2a). The addition of a submaximally activating amount of IpaA to HP reduces the FRET, and the addition of actin filaments to this IpaA-treated vinculin further reduces the FRET (Fig. 2, a, c, and e), indicating a"
https://openalex.org/W2015650253,"As first defensive line, monocytes are a pivotal cell population of innate immunity. Monocyte activation can be relevant to a range of immune conditions and responses. Here we present new insights into the activation of monocytes by a series of phosphonic acid-terminated, phosphorus-containing dendrimers. Various dendritic or subdendritic structures were synthesized and tested, revealing the basic structural requirements for monocyte activation. We showed that multivalent character and phosphonic acid capping of dendrimers are crucial for monocyte targeting and activation. Confocal videomicroscopy showed that a fluorescein-tagged dendrimer binds to isolated monocytes and gets internalized within a few seconds. We also found that dendrimers follow the phagolysosomial route during internalization by monocytes. Finally, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments between a specifically designed fluorescent dendrimer and phycoerythrin-coupled antibodies. We showed that the typical innate Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 is clearly involved, but not alone, in the sensing of dendrimers by monocytes. In conclusion, phosphorus-containing dendrimers appear as precisely tunable nanobiotools able to target and activate human innate immunity and thus prove to be good candidates to develop new drugs for immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2081867103,"Ankyrins are a family of adapter proteins required for localization of membrane proteins to diverse specialized membrane domains including axon initial segments, specialized sites at the transverse tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiomyocytes, and lateral membrane domains of epithelial cells. Little is currently known regarding the molecular basis for specific roles of different ankyrin isoforms. In this study, we systematically generated alanine mutants of clusters of charged residues in the spectrin-binding domains of both ankyrin-B and -G. The corresponding mutants were evaluated for activity in either restoration of abnormal localization of the inositol trisphosphate receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in mutant mouse cardiomyocytes deficient in ankyrin-B or in prevention of loss of lateral membrane in human bronchial epithelial cells depleted of ankyrin-G by small interfering RNA. Interestingly, ankyrin-B and -G share two homologous sites that result in loss of function in both systems, suggesting that common molecular interactions underlie diverse roles of these isoforms. Ankyrins G and B also exhibit differences; mutations affecting spectrin binding had no effect on ankyrin-B function but did abolish activity of ankyrin-G in restoring lateral membrane biogenesis. Depletion of β2-spectrin by small interfering RNA phenocopied depletion of ankyrin-G and resulted in a failure to form new lateral membrane in interphase and mitotic cells. These results demonstrate that ankyrin-G and β2-spectrin are functional partners in biogenesis of the lateral membrane of epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986269606,"Our study aimed to identify new candidate genes, which might be involved in alcohol craving and relapse. To find changes in gene expression after long-term alcohol consumption, we studied gene expression profiles in the striatal dopamine system by using DNA microarrays of two different alcohol-preferring rat lines (HAD and P). Our data revealed an up-regulation of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) after 1 yr of voluntary alcohol consumption in the striatum of alcohol preferring rats that was confirmed by qRT-polymerase chain reaction. This finding was further supported by the finding of up-regulated striatal D3R mRNA in nonselected Wistar rats after long-term alcohol consumption when compared with age-matched control animals. We further examined the role of the D3R in mediating alcohol relapse behavior using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long-term alcohol drinking Wistar rats and the model of cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior using the selective D3R antagonist SB-277011-A (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) and the partial agonist BP 897 (0, 0.1, 1, and 3 mg/kg). Both treatments caused a dose-dependent reduction of relapse-like drinking in the ADE model as well as a decrease in cue-induced ethanol-seeking behavior. We conclude that long-term alcohol consumption leads to an up-regulation of the dopamine D3R that may contribute to alcohol-seeking and relapse. We therefore suggest that selective antagonists of this pharmacological target provide a specific treatment approach to reduce alcohol craving and relapse behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1985256275,"Many neurodegenerative diseases associated with functional Tau dysregulation, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, also show alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) pathology, a protein associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. Here we show that treatment of primary mesencephalic neurons (48 h) or subchronic treatment of wild-type (WT) mice with the Parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxin MPP+/MPTP, results in selective dose-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Tau at Ser396/404 (PHF-1-reactive Tau, p-Tau), with no changes in pSer202 but with nonspecific increases in pSer262 levels. The presence of alpha-Syn was absolutely mandatory to observe MPP+/MPTP-induced increases in p-Tau levels, since no alterations in p-Tau were seen in transfected cells not expressing alpha-Syn or in alpha-Syn-/- mice. MPP+/MPTP also induced a significant accumulation of alpha-Syn in both mesencephalic neurons and in WT mice striatum. MPTP/MPP+ lead to differential alterations in p-Tau and alpha-Syn levels in a cytoskeleton-bound, vs. a soluble, cytoskeleton-free fraction, inducing their coimmunoprecipitation in the cytoskeleton-free fraction and neuronal soma. Subchronic MPTP exposure increased sarkosyl-insoluble p-Tau in striatum of WT but not alpha-Syn-/- mice. These studies describe a novel mechanism for MPTP neurotoxicity, namely a MPTP-inducible, strictly alpha-Syn-dependent, increased formation of PHF-1-reactive Tau, suggesting convergent overlapping pathways in the genesis of clinically divergent diseases such as AD and PD."
https://openalex.org/W2093985186,"Relaxin is a 6 kDa protein hormone produced by the corpus luteum and secreted into the blood during pregnancy in rodents and humans. Growing evidence indicates that circulating relaxin causes vasodilatation and increases in arterial compliance, which may be among its most important actions during pregnancy. Here we investigated whether there is local expression and function of relaxin and relaxin receptor in arteries of nonpregnant females and males. Relaxin-1 and its major receptor, Lgr7, mRNA are expressed in thoracic aortas, small renal and mesenteric arteries from mice and rats of both sexes, as well as in small renal arteries from female tammar wallabies (an Australian marsupial). Using available antibodies for rat and mouse Lgr7 receptor and rat relaxin, we also identified protein expression in arteries. Small renal arteries isolated from relaxin-1 gene-deficient mice demonstrate enhanced myogenic reactivity and decreased passive compliance relative to wild-type (WT) and heterozygous mice. Taken together, these findings reveal an arterial-derived, relaxin ligand-receptor system that acts locally to regulate arterial function."
https://openalex.org/W2105744041,"Increasing evidence suggests that secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) play an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Among sPLA2s, the human group X (hGX) enzyme has the highest catalytic activity toward phosphatidylcholine, one of the major phospholipid species of cell membranes and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Our study examined the presence of hGX sPLA2 in human atherosclerotic lesions and investigated the ability of hGX modified LDL to alter human endothelial cell (HUVEC) function. Our results show that hGX sPLA2 is present in human atherosclerotic lesions and that the hydrolysis of LDL by hGX sPLA2 results in a modified particle that induces lipid accumulation in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Acting on endothelial cells, hGX-modified LDL activates the MAP kinase pathway, which leads to increased arachidonic acid release, increased expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of HUVEC, and increased adhesion of monocytes to HUVEC monolayers. Together, our data suggest that LDL modified by hGX, rather than hGX itself may have strong proinflammatory and proatherogenic properties, which could play an important role in the propagation of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2047220333,"Oxygen is an important component of the cellular microenvironment, mediating cell survival, differentiation, and function. Oxygen supply is a limiting factor during culture of highly metabolic cells such as hepatocytes. Here we present a simple formulation of a fluorocarbon-based oxygen carrier embedded in collagen gel that increases oxygen concentration in culture 6-fold. Rat hepatocytes cultured on oxygen carrier-collagen showed a significant increase in viability and function. Cytochrome P450IA1 activity was increased by 140% in serum-free cultures and by 820% in serum-containing cultures. The significantly higher hepatocellular function on oxygen carrier-collagen matrix persisted and increased during long-term culture. Long-term albumin secretion was increased by 350% in serum-free cultures and by 166% in serum-containing culture. Long-term urea secretion was increased by 79% in serum-free cultures and by 76% in serum-containing cultures. We conclude that oxygen supply may limit hepatocyte function in vitro. This limitation can be overcome by addition of an oxygen carrier to the extracellular matrix. Culture of hepatocytes on oxygen-carrying matrix mimics the oxygen-rich environment of the liver and provides a simple method for enhanced long-term function."
https://openalex.org/W2128825126,"Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection, imposes a high demand for bodily adaptation, with the cardiovascular response a key determinant of outcome. The homeostatic elements that secure cardiac tolerance in the setting of the sepsis syndrome are poorly understood. Here, in a model of acute septic shock induced by endotoxin challenge with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), knockout of the KCNJ8 gene encoding the vascular Kir6.1 K(ATP) channel pore predisposed to an early and profound survival disadvantage. The exaggerated susceptibility provoked by disruption of this stress-responsive sensor of cellular metabolism was linked to progressive deterioration in cardiac activity, ischemic myocardial damage, and contractile dysfunction. Deletion of KCNJ8 blunted the responsiveness of coronary vessels to cytokine- or metabolic-mediated vasodilation necessary to support myocardial perfusion in the wild-type (WT), creating a deficit in adaptive response in the Kir6.1 knockout. Application of a K(ATP) channel opener drug improved survival in the endotoxic WT but had no effect in the Kir6.1 knockout. Restoration of the dilatory capacity of coronary vessels was required to rescue the Kir6.1 knockout phenotype and reverse survival disadvantage in lethal endotoxemia. Thus, the Kir6.1-containing K(ATP) channel, by coupling vasoreactivity with metabolic demand, provides a vital feedback element for cardiovascular tolerance in endotoxic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2064900660,"The adipokine leptin signals energy status to the hypothalamus, which triggers a network of neuropeptide responses. Each hypothalamic cell type expresses a unique complement of neuropeptides, receptors, and second messengers; thus each likely responds specifically to peripheral hormones. We describe here the analysis of leptin signaling in a clonal population of mouse neurotensin (NT) -expressing hypothalamic neurons, N-39. Leptin induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and MAPK ERK1/2, but not the downstream effector of PI3K, Akt, and also induced c-Fos protein. We found activation of p38 MAPK by leptin, accompanied by phosphorylation of its downstream effector ATF-1. Phosphorylation of ATF-1 is blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580. We linked this signaling directly to NT transcription. Protein binding analysis indicates that both ATF-1 and c-Fos are capable of binding to the mouse NT/N gene predominantly at physiological or high concentrations of leptin. The evidence indicates activation of distinct leptin signal transduction pathways that directly result in changes in NT gene expression and links these specific neurons to the control of energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2083401978,"In this study we have characterized the anti-inflammatory profile of a selective melanocortin type 3 receptor (MC3-R) ligand [D-Trp8]-gamma-MSH, validating in vitro results with analyses in mice deficient for this receptor subtype. In wild-type (WT) macrophages, [D-Trp8]-gamma-MSH activated MC3-R (as tested by accumulation of cyclic AMP) and inhibited (approximately 50%) the release of interleukin (IL)-1 and the chemokine KC (CXCL1), but was ineffective in cells taken from MC3-R null mice. In vivo, administration of 3-30 microg [D-Trp8]-gamma-MSH significantly inhibited leukocyte influx and cytokine production in a model of crystal-induced peritonitis, and these effects were absent in MC3-R null mice or blocked by coadministration of an MC3-R antagonist. Finally, in a model of gouty arthritis, direct injection of urate crystals into the rat joint provoked a marked inflammatory reaction that was significantly inhibited (approximately 70%) by systemic or local administration of [D-Trp8]-gamma-MSH. In conclusion, using an integrated transgenic and pharmacological approach, we provide strong proof of concept for the development of selective MC3-R agonists as novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2066847890,"Two novel P450 heme iron ligand sets were generated by directed mutagenesis of the flavocytochrome P450 BM3 heme domain. The A264H and A264K variants produce Cys-Fe-His and Cys-Fe-Lys axial ligand sets, which were validated structurally and characterized by spectroscopic analysis. EPR and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) provided fingerprints defining these P450 ligand sets. Near IR MCD spectra identified ferric low spin charge-transfer bands diagnostic of the novel ligands. For the A264K mutant, this is the first report of a Cys-Fe-Lys near-IR MCD band. Crystal structure determination showed that substrate-free A264H and A264K proteins crystallize in distinct conformations, as observed previously in substrate-free and fatty acid-bound wild-type P450 forms, respectively. This, in turn, likely reflects the positioning of the I α helix section of the protein that is required for optimal configuration of the ligands to the heme iron. One of the monomers in the asymmetric unit of the A264H crystals was in a novel conformation with a more open substrate access route to the active site. The same species was isolated for the wildtype heme domain and represents a novel conformational state of BM3 (termed SF2). The “locking” of these distinct conformations is evident from the fact that the endogenous ligands cannot be displaced by substrate or exogenous ligands.

The cytochromes P450 (P450s) 4The abbreviations used are: P450s, cytochromes P450; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; WT, wild type; NIR, near-IR; CT, charge transfer; SF, substrate-free conformation; SB, substrate-bound conformation; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 4The abbreviations used are: P450s, cytochromes P450; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; WT, wild type; NIR, near-IR; CT, charge transfer; SF, substrate-free conformation; SB, substrate-bound conformation; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. are a superfamily of heme b-containing monooxygenase enzymes found in organisms from all domains of life (e.g. Refs. 1Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichtling I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar and 2Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). They catalyze the oxygenation (often hydroxylation) of a wide range of molecules in nature, exploiting a transient ferryl-oxo heme iron intermediate to facilitate addition of oxygen to the substrate (1Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichtling I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). They are intensively studied due to their integral roles in, e.g., mammalian drug metabolism, steroid and sterol synthesis, polyketide antibiotic manufacture, and prokaryotic breakdown of recalcitrant pollutants (e.g. Refs. 3Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar and 4McLean K.J. Sabri M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Lewis D.G. Clift D. Balding P.R. Dunford A.J. Warman A.J.

The Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 enzyme is one of the most intensively studied members of the superfamily. It is a rare example of a prokaryotic P450 that obtains electrons for reductive activation of dioxygen from a eukaryotic-type redox partner. The fatty acid hydroxylase P450 receives electrons from NADPH via a FAD- and FMN-containing diflavin reductase (NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase) that is also fused to the P450 in a single polypeptide chain (5Narhi L.O.

The fusion arrangement facilitates efficient electron transfer between the redox cofactors in P450 BM3 and affords the enzyme the highest oxygenase rate of any P450 reported to date (>15,000 min-1 with arachidonic acid) (8Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. MacKay A.C. Reid G.A. Hanzlik R.P. Munro A.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Substrate binding controls the reduction potential of the heme iron and accelerates FMN-to-heme electron transfer in the presence of fatty acids to ensure coupling of NADPH oxidation to fatty acid hydroxylation (9Daff S.N.

The enzyme was shown recently to be functional as a fatty acid hydroxylase in the dimeric form, as demonstrated previously for eukaryotic nitricoxide synthase enzymes (10Neeli R. Girvan H.M.

The P450s are the best characterized of the thiolate-ligated cytochromes, with a loosely associated water molecule generally located in the sixth (distal) position on the heme iron (1Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichtling I. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). This position is vacated in catalysis to allow binding of dioxygen to ferrous iron. Nitric-oxide synthase enzymes have the same heme ligand set and also activate oxygen, and chloroperoxidase (an enzyme involved in antibiotic synthesis in the fungus Caldariomyces fumago) is a further example of an enzyme with a cysteine-coordinated heme iron (12Stuehr D.J.

Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, relatively few other cysteinate-containing ligand sets are observed naturally. Cys-His coordination was seen in the Rhodovulum sulfidophilum SoxAX enzyme (heme 2) and in cystathionine β-synthase (14Cheesman M.R. Little P.J. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10562-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Meiyer M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Cys-Pro (terminal amine) coordination was also seen in the CO-sensing CooA (16Roberts G.P. Kerby R.L. Youn H. Conrad M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thiolate-ligated hemoproteins have strong spectroscopic signals recognizable by, e.g., UV-visible absorption and EPR spectroscopy (17Lawson R.J. Leys D. Sutcliffe M.J. Kemp C.A. Cheesman M.R. Smith S.J. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Haq I. Perkins J.B. Munro A.W. . 2004; 43: 12410-12426Google Scholar). However, identifying a ligand trans to thiolate, in absence of structural detail, can be difficult, and was the subject of detailed studies by Dawson and co-workers (18Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sono M. Hager L.P. Dawson J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) in the near-IR region of ferric hemoproteins is also a sensitive technique for identifying heme ligands, using the position of charge-transfer features of high (CT1) and low spin (CTLS) heme to assign ligation (20Cheesman M.R. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3994-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In recent work, we generated the A264E mutant of P450 BM3 and demonstrated that it coordinated the heme iron to form a novel Glu-Fe-Cys ligand set. In the substrate-free enzyme, Glu-264 coordination to the heme iron was partial, with the side chain of Glu-264 positioned close to the side chain of the active site residue Phe-87 in a proportion of molecules (21Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, binding of fatty acid to the mutant resulted in displacement of the Glu-264 side chain from the Phe-87 vicinity and the complete formation of the new Glu-Fe-Cys ligand set (21Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol.

In this study, we sought to capitalize on earlier work to use Ala-264 mutants of BM3 to create further novel heme iron ligand sets for structural and mechanistic investigations. We selected A264K/H variants on the basis of natural occurrence of Lys and His coordination in several other hemoproteins. In addition, the different sizes of the Lys/His amino acid side chains posed the interesting possibility that coordination might take place in different conformers of the P450. We present here structures and spectroscopic analysis of both novel P450 heme iron ligand sets. These data enable further development of a diagnostic spectroscopic method for thiolate-ligated hemes, whereby their characteristics can, in many cases, be defined (particularly using EPR and MCD) to facilitate recognition of such species as and when they occur elsewhere in nature. Importantly, structural analysis of these substrate-free A264K/H P450 enzymes indicates that they occupy distinct conformational states considered previously to be associated with the substrate-free (A264H) and fatty acidbound (A264K) forms of the wild-type (WT) P450 BM3. Moreover, we have obtained the structure of a novel substrate-free state for both WT and A264H in which there is reorganization of mobile (mainly helical) structural elements, revealing a more open active site cavity that may be primed for ingress of fatty acid substrates to the active site. Molecular Biology and Protein Production—A264K and A264H mutants were generated in both the heme domain and intact flavocytochrome P450 BM3 using the Stratagene QuikChange™ kit. Primers A264KF (CATTCTTAATTAAGGGTCATGAAACAACAAGTGG) and A264KR (CCACTTGTTGTTTCATGACCCTTAATTAAGAATG) were used to create the A264K mutant in both the heme domain (pBM20) and flavocytochrome plasmids (pBM25). A silent BspH1 site was created to allow verification of the mutant (indicated in bold), and the mutated codon is shown underlined. Primers A264HF (CATTCTTAATTCATGGACACGAAACAACAAGTGG) and A264HR (CCACTTGTTGTTTCGTGTCCATGAATTAAGAATG) were used to create the A264H mutant in plasmids pBM20 and pBM25 (6Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Rospendowski B.N. Smith W.E. McKnight J.E. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The mutated codon is underlined. The entire genes were sequenced to ensure that the desired mutation was present and that no spurious mutations occurred. Wild-type and A264K/H heme domains, and their intact flavocytochromes, were expressed in Escherichia coli strain TG1 and purified as described previously (21Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J.

Spectroscopy and Enzyme Analysis—UV-visible spectra were collected using a Cary UV-50 scanning spectrophotometer (Varian) with a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Spectra were recorded for oxidized, reduced (sodium dithionite), and substrate (fatty acid)-bound forms, as described in previous studies (e.g. Refs. 8Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A.

Reductasedependent cytochrome c reduction was also monitored for WT and mutants as described previously (8Noble M.A. Miles C.S. Chapman S.K. Lysek D.A. MacKay A.C. Reid G.A. Hanzlik R.P. Munro A.W.

Heme concentrations for WT and A26K/H mutants were determined by the pyridine hemochromagen method (24Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded using an EPR spectrometer comprising an ER200D electromagnet and microwave bridge interfaced to a EMX control system (Bruker Spectrospin), and fitted with a liquid helium flow cryostat (ESR-9, Oxford Instruments) and a dual-mode X-band cavity (Bruker type ER4116DM). Spectra were recorded for WT (400 μm), A264K (745 μm), and A264H (435 μm) heme domains in assay buffer at 10.8 K. MCD spectra were recorded using JASCO J/810 and J/730 dichrographs in the near UV-visible and near-IR regions, respectively, using an Oxford Instrument superconducting solenoid with a 25-mm ambient bore to generate a magnetic field of 6 Tesla. A 0.1-cm path length cuvette was used to record near-IR spectra with sample concentrations the same as those used for EPR spectral collection. UV spectra were recorded for WT (30 μm), A264K (64 μm), and A264H (60 μm) heme domains with 50 mm HEPES in deuterium oxide (pH*, 7.0) as buffer (where pH* is the apparent pH measured in D2O using a standard glass pH electrode). Crystallography and Data Collection—The WT, A264K, and A264H heme domains were crystallized by the sitting drop method at 4 °C. Drops were prepared by addition of 2 μl of the mother liquor to 2 μl of a 15 mg/ml protein solution in 10 mm Tris.HCl (pH 7.5). Wild-type and A264K crystals were obtained in 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.0) containing 160 mm MgCl2 and 16% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals of A264H were obtained in 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.0) containing 130 mm MgCl2 and 18% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after brief soaking in mother liquor supplemented with 10% polyethylene glycol 200. Data were collected on a single crystal at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble ID14.2 (for WT and A264K) and, in case of A264H, for a single crystal at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) Hamburg, beamline X11. Data were reduced and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-318Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The WT and A264H structures were solved using the molecular replacement program AMoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All proteins had full incorporation of heme cofactor, and the mutant flavocytochromes were replete with FAD and FMN. UV-visible Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra of the A264K and A264H heme domain mutants were recorded for the oxidized, ligand-free enzymes and compared directly with spectra for the WT P450 BM3 heme domain. The Soret maximum for WT heme domain was at 418 nm, whereas that for the mutants was shifted to 424 nm (A264K) and 427 nm (A264H). The shorter wavelength (δ) band was of greater intensity in the mutants and had a more distinct peak shifted to ∼362 nm from ∼360 nm in the WT heme domain (Fig. 1). Spectral changes were also observed in the visible region (reduced intensity of the α band and a red shift in the β band in both mutants) (Fig. 1, inset). The α/β bands for A264K(H) were at 571/542 nm (576/544 nm) compared with 569/535 nm for WT BM3. Heme band shifts were essentially identical for the A264K/H flavocytochromes (once changes in spectrum due to flavin contribution were accounted for), indicating that the reductase domain does not impact significantly on heme coordination in these enzymes. The shift of the Soret band to longer wavelengths (a type II P450 spectral shift) is consistent with the replacement of the distal water molecule (the sixth ligand to the heme iron) with a stronger field ligand. In light of preceding studies with the A264E enzyme, it appeared clear that the side chains of His-264 and Lys-264 coordinated to the heme iron in the A264H/K mutants, giving rise to distinctive perturbations of the optical spectrum (21Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the A264E mutant, Glu-264 partially occupies the distal coordination position on the heme iron in the substrate-free form, but complete occupancy was induced on binding of fatty acid substrates, as verified spectroscopically and by determination of atomic structures for substrate-free and palmitoleate-bound A264E heme domain (21Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol.

By contrast, addition of various fatty acid substrates (arachidonic acid, lauric acid, and palmitoleic acid) induced no significant spectral change in the A264K/H enzymes, suggesting that coordination of heme iron by the respective side chains was complete in the absence of fatty acids. In addition, negligible spectral perturbation was induced on addition of imidazole or substituted azoles. In parallel studies of steady-state kinetics of NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reduction and fatty acid oxygenation by the A264K/H flavocytochromes, there was no significant stimulation of NADPH oxidation induced by addition of fatty acids (and no hydroxylated products isolated), but levels of cytochrome c reductase activity were essentially identical to those of WT BM3. In addition, neither A264K/H was able to form any significant amount of ferrous-CO complex at either 450 nm or 420 nm on reduction with dithionite and bubbling with carbon monoxide. This suggests that the distal ligand remains firmly bound on reduction and that neither dioxygen (under turnover conditions) nor CO can displace the Lys/His-264 ligands. However, spectral changes observed on reduction suggest that there is some heterogeneity in the reduced species formed, with putative changes in both proximal and distal heme coordinations. The complex nature of these species is currently under investigation, but it is clear that the reduction potential of both mutants is more negative than the wild-type P450, due to incomplete reduction by dithionite. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra of both A264H/K ferric BM3 heme domains contain a single set of rhombic features and show shifts in g-values from the WT P450 (A264K: gz = 2.47, gy = 2.26, and gx = 1.91; A264H: 2.50, 2.26, and 1.89; and WT: 2.42, 2.26, and 1.92) (Fig. 2). The homogeneity of the EPR spectra of the A264K/H mutants contrasts with the heterogeneity observed in the EPR spectrum of substrate-free A264E heme domain, in which signals from both Cys-Fe-H2O and Cys-Fe-Glu components were present (21Girvan H.M. Marshall K.R. Lawson R.J. Leys D. Joyce M.G. Clarkson J. Smith W.E. Cheesman M.R. Munro A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23274-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, these data are consistent with the absence of UV-visible perturbations on fatty acid substrate binding to the oxidized A264K/H heme domains, and indicative that heme iron coordination by the Lys/His-264 ligands is complete for these mutants in both substrate-free and fatty acid-bound forms. The g-values determined indicate a change in heme environment that is consistent with coordination of nitrogenous side chains at the distal position, as was inferred from UV-visible studies. Imidazole complexes of P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) and P450 cam (CYP101A1) have EPR spectra with similar g-values (2.61, 2.25, and 1.83; 2.56, 2.27, and 1.85; respectively) to the A264K/H mutants, as do thiolate/His-coordinated species such as heme 2 in SoxAX (2.53, 2.30, and 1.87) and cytochrome c M60C (2.56, 2.27, and 1.85) (14Cheesman M.R. Little P.J. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10562-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Wuttke D.S. Preparation, Characterization and Intramolecular Electron-transfer Studies of Ruthenium-modified Cytochromes c. Ph.D. thesis. California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA1994Google Scholar). Closer to the g-values observed for A264K are those of ferric CooA (Pro/Cys-) at 2.46, 2.26, and 1.91 (29Dhawan I.K. Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Roberts G.P. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12805-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MCD—Near IR (NIR) and UV-visible room temperature MCD spectra of A264K and A264H are shown in Fig. 3. In the NIR region, the position of a charge-transfer (CT) band can be diagnostic for the nature of heme iron ligand sets (20Cheesman M.R. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3994-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The NIR MCD spectra are characteristic of ferric low spin heme iron in both heme domain mutants (Fig. 3A). Thiolate coordination is indicated by band position and characteristic low intensities by comparison with other low spin hemes (for example histidineligated heme proteins). For A264H, the NIR low spin chargetransfer (CTLS) peak is at 1155 nm, shifted by >70 nm with respect to that for the WT enzyme. This peak suggests heme thiolate and nitrogenous ligation and is comparable to published examples (e.g. myoglobin plus HS-, 1200 nm; WT BM3 plus imidazole (at 4.2 K), 1180 nm; SoxAX heme 2, 1150 nm; ferric CooA (Pro/Cys-), 1190 nm) (14Cheesman M.R.

Cheesman M.R. Thomson A.J. Miles J.S. Munro A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For A264K, the NIR CTLS band is at 1100 nm, shifted 20 nm from the WT value. This shift represents coordination of the K264 side chain to the thiolate-ligated heme iron. This, to our knowledge, is the first report of a cysteine/lysine MCD CTLS band (although a cysteine/amine ligation was observed for CooA (16Roberts G.P. Kerby R.L. Youn H. Conrad M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 280-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)). MCD spectra for the A264K/H heme domains were recorded in the near-UV-visible region and are shown in Fig. 3B, alongside the WT heme domain spectrum. The A264K and A264H mutants show clear shifts in band positions and relative intensity with respect to WT. The general spectral pattern for each mutant is again indicative of low spin ferric heme, consistent with UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy. The CT2 band has shifted from 575 nm in WT heme domain to 583 nm and 587 nm, respectively, for the A264K and A264H mutants. In studies of ligand complexes of P450 cam (CYP101A1), the CT2 band for unligated P450 was at 575 nm, for the 1-octylamine complex at 580 nm, and for the imidazole complex at 585 nm, similar to our values for the BM3 WT and A264K/H mutants (18Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The general spectral patterns of both A264K/H mutants reveal the Soret derivative crossover at 425 nm, compared with 419 nm for WT BM3. The 425 nm crossover is indicative of nitrogen coordination to the heme iron. This is similar to the value (426 nm) for the imidazole complex of CYP101A1, with its octylamine complex at 421 nm, and that for unligated P450 at 416 nm (14Cheesman M.R. Little P.J. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10562-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The feature is of greater intensity in A264K/H than in WT, with a peak-to-trough intensity of ∼90 mm-1 cm-1. Elsewhere in the visible MCD spectra, peaks for the WT BM3 (CYP101A1), A264K (CYP101A1-octylamine), and A264H (CYP101A1-imidazole) are located at 521 nm (518), 526 nm (526), and 533 nm (530), respectively (18Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, UV-visible MCD spectral features of CYP101A1 imidazole/amine complexes are consistent with distal coordination of BM3 heme iron by Lys-264/His-264 side chains. In general, the shifts in the MCD spectra of the mutants with respect to those of the WT P450 are greater in the His-264 mutant than the Lys-264 mutant, but show the same overall trend. Spectroscopic analysis thus indicate"
https://openalex.org/W2163985808,"Prebilaterian animals perceived ambient light through nonvisual rhabdomeric photoreceptors (RPs), which evolved as support of the chordate visual system. In vertebrates, the identity of nonvisual photoreceptors and the phototransduction cascade involved in nonimage forming tasks remain uncertain. We investigated whether chicken retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) could be nonvisual photoreceptors and the nature of the photocascade involved. We found that primary cultures of chicken embryonic RGCs express such RP markers as transcription factors Pax6 and Brn3, photopigment melanopsin, and G-protein q but not markers for ciliary photoreceptors (alpha-transducin and Crx). To investigate the photoreceptive capability of RGCs, we assessed the direct effect of light on 3H-melatonin synthesis in RGC cultures synchronized to 12:12 h light-dark cycles. In constant dark, RGCs displayed a daily variation in 3H-melatonin levels peaking at subjective day, which was significantly inhibited by light. This light effect was further increased by the chromophore all-trans-retinal and suppressed by specific inhibitors of the invertebrate photocascade involving phosphoinositide hydrolysis (100 microM neomycin; 5 microM U73122) and Ca2+ mobilization (10 mM BAPTA; 1 mM lanthanum). The results demonstrate that chicken RGCs are intrinsically photosensitive RPs operating via an invertebrate-like phototransduction cascade, which may be responsible for early detection of light before vision occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2155094055,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) specifically induce apoptosis in malignant lymphoblasts and are thus pivotal in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, GC-resistance is a therapeutic problem with an unclear molecular mechanism. We generated approximately 70 GC-resistant sublines from a GC-sensitive B- and a T-ALL cell line and investigated their mechanisms of resistance. In response to GCs, all GC-resistant subclones analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed a deficient up-regulation of the GC-receptor (GR) and its downstream target, GC-induced leucine zipper. This deficiency in GR up-regulation was confirmed by Western blotting and on retroviral overexpression of GR in resistant subclones GC-sensitivity was restored. All GC-resistant subclones were screened for GR mutations using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC), DNA-fingerprinting, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Among the identified mutations were some previously not associated with GC resistance: A484D, P515H, L756N, Y663H, L680P, and R714W. This approach revealed three genotypes, complete loss of functional GR in the mismatch repair deficient T-ALL model, apparently normal GR genes in B-ALLs, and heterozygosity in both. In the first genotype, deficiency in GR up-regulation was fully explained by mutational events, in the second by a putative regulatory defect, and in the third by a combination thereof. In all instances, GC-resistance occurred at the level of the GR in both models."
https://openalex.org/W1979831993,"Overexpression of T-cadherin (T-cad) transcripts occurs in approximately 50% of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). To elucidate T-cad functions in HCC, we examined T-cad protein expression in normal and tumoral human livers and hepatoma cell lines and investigated its influence on invasive potential of HCC using RNA interference silencing of T-cad expression in Mahlavu cells. Whereas T-cad expression was restricted to endothelial cells (EC) from large blood vessels in normal livers, it was up-regulated in sinusoidal EC from 8/15 invasive HCCs. Importantly, in three of them (38%) T-cad was detected in tumor cells within regions in which E-cadherin expression was absent. Among six hepatoma cell lines, only Mahlavu expressed T-cad but not E-cadherin. T-cad exhibited a globally punctuate distribution in quiescent Mahlavu and additionally it concentrated at the leading edge of migrating cells. Matrigel invasion assay revealed that Mahlavu possess a high invasive potential that was significantly inhibited by T-cad silencing. Wound healing and random motility assays demonstrated that inhibition of T-cad expression in Mahlavu significantly reduced their motility. We propose that T-cad expression in tumor cells might occur by cadherin-switching during epithelial-mesenchymal transition and may represent an additional mechanism contributing to HCC metastasis."

GST-CHK2(N) comprised amino acids (aa) 2–225 of CHK2, and GST-Cdc25C comprised aa 200–256 of Cdc25C. Plasmid constructs for in vitro translation of EDD fragments 1–889, 889–1877, and 889–2799 have been previously described (2Henderson M.J. Russell A.J. Hird S. Munoz M. Clancy J.L. Lehrbach G.M.

Beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation, 0.5–1 mg of nuclear or total cellular protein was incubated with 4 μg of N17 CHK2 antibody or goat IgG at 4 °C for 2 h, and antibody conjugates were captured on protein G-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.).Recombinant Protein Binding Assays—EDD protein fragments were synthesized with Promega T3 TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate or T7 TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation systems using 35S-labeled cysteine/methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Synthesized protein (15 μl) was diluted to 100 μl with lysis buffer and incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST-CHK2(N) at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and bound proteins were visualized following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For peptide inhibition assays, peptide was incubated with the reaction mixture on ice for 5 min prior to the addition of in vitro translated protein. In vitro translated EDD or cell extracts were dephosphorylated with 15 units/μl λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and phosphatase was inactivated by the addition of 50 mm EDTA prior to the addition to other assay components.Cell Culture, Transfection, and DNA Damage—HEK293 and MCF-7 lines were maintained as previously described (1Callaghan M.J.

HeLa and MCF-7 cells were treated with 65 μm phleomycin (InvivoGen) in serum-free medium for 1–4 h. Cells were harvested immediately, or medium was replaced as indicated. Total cellular protein was extracted in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described (1Callaghan M.J. Russell A.J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Sutherland R.L. Watts C.K.W.

Mawson A. Baker R.T. Sutherland R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).CHK2 Kinase Assay—CHK2 was immunoprecipitated from 0.5–1 mg of MCF-7 protein extract using 1 μg of N17 CHK2 antibody (or 1 μg of goat IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for control). Antibody conjugates on protein G-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA) and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer with 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 4 μg of GST-Cdc25C substrate for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Following SDS-PAGE, samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, New South Wales, Australia) and subjected to autoradiography, followed by immunoblotting for phospho-CHK2 and total CHK2.Cell Viability Assay, G2/M Checkpoint Analysis, and Microscopy—For the colony-forming assay, at 72 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 13 μm (HeLa) or 32.5 μm (MCF7) phleomycin for 1 h. Following replacement of medium, colonies were allowed to grow for 10 days (HeLa) or 14 days (MCF7). Following fixing and staining with the Diff Quik Stain kit (Lab Aids), colonies were quantitated with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).For the mitotic entry assay, cells were treated with phleomycin at 72 h post-transfection and harvested 24 h later. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and fixed in cold 80% ethanol for at least 1 h at –20 °C. Fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Following further centrifugation, cells were incubated with anti-phosphohistone-3 antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody, catalog number 06-570; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with secondary antibody linked to Cy2 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 h in the dark; washed again in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin; simultaneously treated with RNase A (0.5 mg ml–1); and stained with propidium iodide (10 μg ml–1 in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 45 min at 37 °C. The labeled cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur.Transfected HeLa cells were seeded on chamber slides ∼24 h before phleomycin exposure at a cell density of 2.4 × 104 cells cm–2. Cells were treated with 65 μm phleomycin for 1 h; fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS at various times after treatment; and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS. By staining nuclei with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and counterstaining the cytoplasm for actin with phalloidin, it was possible to visualize a subpopulation of enlarged cells containing between two and four aberrant nuclei.RESULTSEDD Is a Novel Binding Partner of CHK2—CHK2 has three well defined domains: the (S/T)Q-rich regulatory domain containing multiple sites for ATM/ATR phosphorylation, the FHA phosphopeptide-binding domain, and the kinase domain (Fig. 1A) (16Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 31Durocher D. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Jackson S.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

In experiments aimed at identifying CHK2 binding partners, GST-CHK2(N) (aa 2–225) (Fig. 1A), which contains the (S/T)Q-rich and FHA domains of CHK2 fused to GST, was incubated with HeLa cell nuclear extract in the presence or absence of an optimal CHK2 FHA domain-binding phosphopeptide, RWFDpTYLIRR (32Li J. Williams B. Haire L. Goldberg M. Wilker E. Durocher D. Yaffe M. Jackson S. Smerdon S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1045-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Several co-purifying proteins bound only in the absence of competing peptide, and one of these was identified by mass spectrometry as EDD (Fig. 1A). This interaction was confirmed by GST-CHK2(N) pull-downs from MCF-7 lysates, followed by immunoblotting to detect EDD protein (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous CHK2 from whole cell extracts prepared from either HEK293 or MCF-7 cells followed by immunoblotting for EDD demonstrated an in vivo association between EDD and CHK2 (Fig. 1C). No association was seen when CHK2 immunoprecipitation was inhibited by preincubation of CHK2 antibody with the antigenic peptide. We were unable to detect CHK2 protein in EDD immunoprecipitates. This may be due to the location of the peptide epitope recognized by the EDD antibody, preventing antibody access when CHK2 is bound to EDD, since antibody and CHK2 require nearby regions of EDD for binding (see below). Thus, under normal physiological conditions, CHK2 and EDD appear to occur in the same protein complex, most likely through a direct interaction with the NH2-terminal region of CHK2.EDD Interacts with the FHA Domain of CHK2—The region of CHK2 that binds EDD spans both the (S/T)Q and FHA domains. Inhibition of binding by a CHK2 FHA-binding phosphopeptide (Fig. 1A) supports an FHA-mediated interaction. The CHK2 FHA domain has a preference for binding phosphothreonine (32Li J. Williams B.

If the EDD-CHK2 interaction is mediated through the FHA domain, prior dephosphorylation of EDD should also inhibit association between EDD and CHK2. Indeed, λ protein phosphatase treatment of either in vitro translated EDD or whole cell extracts prior to incubation with GST-CHK2(N) or immunoprecipitation of CHK2, respectively, greatly impaired binding (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2The phosphopeptide-binding interface of the CHK2 FHA domain is required for EDD binding. A, dephosphorylation of EDD inhibits CHK2 binding. In vitro synthesized 35S-labeled EDD (top) or HeLa whole cell extracts (middle) were preincubated with λ protein phosphatase (PPase +) and then incubated with Sepharose-bound GST-CHK2(N). Bottom, MCF-7 cell extracts were incubated with protein phosphatase prior to CHK2 immunoprecipitation. A phospho-specific antibody (Phospho-Ab) was used to confirm dephosphorylation of extract. Bound EDD was detected by autoradiography (top) or immunoblotting. B, CHK2 FHA domain binds EDD. In vitro synthesized 35S-labeled EDD (top) or MCF-7 whole cell extracts (bottom) were incubated with Sepharose-bound GST-CHK2(N) derivatives containing R117A or I157T substitutions. Bound EDD was detected by autoradiography (top) or immunoblotting (bottom), and fusion proteins were detected by Coomassie staining. C, an FHA-binding phosphopeptide inhibits the EDD-CHK2 interaction. Left, MCF-7 protein extracts were incubated with Sepharose-bound GST-CHK2(N) in the presence of FHA-binding phosphopeptide at the indicated concentrations, and bound EDD was detected by immunoblotting. Right, in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled EDD was incubated with Sepharose-bound GST-CHK2(N) (WT) or GST-CHK2(N) (I157T) in the presence of FHA-binding phosphopeptide at 50 μm or with nonphosphorylated peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2162713173,"Neural precursor cells provide an expandable source of neurons and glia for basic and translational applications. However, little progress has been made in directing naive neural precursors toward specific neuronal fates such as midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. We have recently demonstrated that transgenic expression of the nuclear orphan receptor Nurr1 is sufficient to drive dopaminergic differentiation of forebrain embryonic rat neural precursors in vitro. However, Nurr1-induced DA neurons exhibit immature neuronal morphologies and functional properties and are unable to induce behavioral recovery in rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report on the identification of key genetic factors that drive morphological and functional differentiation of Nurr1-derived DA neurons. We show that coexpression of Nurr1, Bcl-XL, and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) or Nurr1 and the proneural bHLH factor Mash1 is sufficient to drive naive rat forebrain precursors into neurons exhibiting the biochemical, electrophysiological, and functional properties of DA neuron in vitro. On transplantation into the striatum of Parkinsonian rats, precursor cells engineered with Nurr1/SHH/Bcl-XL or Nurr1/Mash1 survived in vivo and differentiated into mature DA neurons that can reverse the behavioral deficits in the grafted animals."
https://openalex.org/W2086869292,"The Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) -based retrovirus vector system has been used most often in gene transfer work, but has been known to cause silencing of the imported gene in transgenic animals. In the present study, using a MoMLV-based retrovirus vector, we successfully generated a new transgenic chicken line expressing high levels of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The level of eGFP expression was conserved after germline transmission and as much as 100 microg of eGFP could be detected per 1 mg of tissue protein. DNA sequencing showed that the transgene had been integrated at chromosome 26 of the G1 and G2 generation transgenic chickens. Owing to the stable integration of the transgene, it is now feasible to produce G3 generation of homozygous eGFP transgenic chickens that will provide 100% transgenic eggs. These results will help establish a useful transgenic chicken model system for studies of embryonic development and for efficient production of transgenic chickens as bioreactors."

However, little is known about the relationship between TSC2 and FoxO1. Here we identified TSC2 as a FoxO1-binding protein by using a yeast two-hybrid screening with a murine islet cDNA library. Among FoxOs, only FoxO1 can be associated with TSC2. The physical association between the C terminus of TSC2 (amino acids 1280-1499) and FoxO1 degrades the TSC1-TSC2 complex and inhibits GTPase-activating protein activity of TSC2 toward Rheb. Overexpression of wild type FoxO1 enhances p70 S6K phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of TSC2 can reverse these effects. Knockdown of endogenous FOXO1 in human vascular endothelial cells decreased phosphorylation of p70 S6K.

Forkhead transcription factors of the FoxO (Forkhead box-containing protein, O subfamily) family are conserved across many species. In Caenorhabditis elegans, DAF-16, the FoxO orthologue, is downstream of the DAF-2/AGE-1/AKT signaling pathway (1Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G.

In Drosophila, the life span is extended over 50% by ablation of insulin-producing cells or mutations of genes encoding the insulin-like receptor (dInR) or its receptor substrate (chico) (4Stocker H. Hafen E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Similarly, dInR phosphorylates and inactivates dFOXO, the Drosophila homologue of DAF-16/FOXO (5Puig O.

These proteins possess a fork-head DNA binding domain consisting of around 110 amino acids and a transactivation domain in the C terminus. FoxOs bind to consensus FoxO-binding sites (GTAAA(C/T)A, T(G/A)TTTAC) in the promoter region of their target genes and activate gene expression (7Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem.

It has been reported that FoxOs cause cell cycle arrest through induction of p27, p21, cyclin B, polo-like kinase, the retinoblastoma family-related protein p130 and cyclin G2, apoptosis through induction of Fas ligand and Bim, DNA repair through GADD45, stress resistance through MnSOD, and regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism through G6pase, apoC-III, and Igfbp-1 (8Greer E.L.

Akt-phosphorylation of TSC2 leads to the functional inactivation of the TSC1-TSC2 complex and results in mTOR activation leading to phosphorylation of two main mTOR substrates, ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), and elevated mRNA translation (18Inoki K.

An inhibitory target of TSC1-TSC2 has been identified as Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), a small GTPase. GTP-bound Rheb is bound to and activates mTOR (21Manning B.D. Cantley L.C.

Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). There have been several reports about molecules, which regulate TSC2 function. Energy depletion inhibits mTOR signaling through AMP-activated kinase phosphorylation of TSC2, although it is not know how AMP-activated kinase phosphorylation of TSC2 enhances the ability of TSC1-TSC2 to inhibit downstream signaling to Rheb (23Corradetti M.N.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The hypoxia-inducible gene, regulated in development and damage responses (REDD1), is also induced by energy depletion, and this leads to inhibition of mTOR complex 1 signaling to p70 S6K in a TSC2-dependent manner (26Sofer A. Lei K. Johannessen C.M. Ellisen L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5834-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It is important to identify molecules that regulate TSC2 function because these molecules may affect the activity of mTOR/p70 S6K signaling and finally determine the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway through a negative feedback loop (27Um S.H. D'Alessio D. Thomas G. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified TSC2 as a novel FoxO1-binding protein by a yeast two-hybrid screening using a murine islet cDNA library. Binding of FoxO1 to TSC2 in cytoplasm inhibits TSC2 function and results in activation mTOR/p70 S6K and inhibition of Akt activity through negative feedback on IRS protein, leading eventually to feedback activation of FoxO1. Here we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which FoxO1 regulates activity of mTOR/p70 S6K signaling pathway and of FoxO1 itself through association with TSC2.

The pCAG/FLAG-rTSC2DEE was constructed by ligation of N-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length cDNA of rTSC2 with pCAG-GS vector (33Tsuchiya H. Orimoto K. Kobayashi K. Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 429-433PubMed Google Scholar, 34Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4562) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vectors—For mutagenesis of FoxO1, we performed overlap extension PCR using pCMV5/cMyc/ADA FoxO1 as a template as described previously (35Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). For construction of pCMV5/cMyc/T24A/S253A/S316A (3A), the following mutagenic primers were used: primer 1, 5′-AGA GCT GCG GCC ATG GAC AAC-3′, corresponding to nucleotide 844-864, and primer 2, 5′-GTT GTC CAT GGC CGC AGC TCT-3′, corresponding to nucleotide 864-844. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Amino acids 424-550 of the murine FoxO1 were cloned in-frame into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain plasmid pGBKT7 (Clontech). The GAL4 activation domain cDNA library of murine islets was constructed as described previously (36Nishimura M. Yokoi N. Miki T. Horikawa Y. Yoshioka H. Takeda J. Ohara O. Seino S. DNA Res. 2004; 11: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). AH109 yeast strain was used for the library search. The transformation was performed as described in the Clontech Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 protocol. The transformants were plated on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Tyr plates in the presence of galactose and then were incubated at 30 °C for 3-4 days. Positive interaction was identified by strong β-galactosidase activity. Individual positive clones were isolated by YEASTMAKER™ yeast plasmid isolation kit (BD Biosciences) and were sequenced by ABI310 automated DNA sequencer and analyzed for homology with sequences in the GenBank™ data base using the BLAST algorithm. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Viral Transduction— HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. SV40-transformed hepatocytes used in these studies have been described in previous publication (29Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in HuMedia-EB2 (KURABO) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 ng/ml human recombinant fibroblast growth factor, and 10 μg/ml heparin. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Adenoviral infection was described in a previous publication (30Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We transduced SV40-transformed hepatocytes by incubating them with adenoviral preparations at 10-50 multiplicities of infection for 2 h. Cell Isolation and Culture—Brown adipocytes and their precursor cells were isolated from newborn wild type mice by collagenase digestion as described previously (37Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34795-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Preadipocytes were immortalized by infection with the retroviral vector pGCDNsamIRES-Puro, encoding SV40T antigen (38Nabekura T. Otsu M. Nagasawa T. Nakauchi H. Onodera M. Mol. Ther. 2006; 13: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Preadipocytes were grown to confluence in culture medium supplemented with 50 nm insulin and 50 nm triiodothyronine (differentiation medium) (day 0). Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating confluent cells for 24 h in differentiation medium further supplemented with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.5 μm dexamethasone, and 0.125 mm indomethacin. After induction, cells were changed back to differentiation medium, which was then changed every day. At day 5, cells were harvested and used for experiments. Western Blot Analysis—We lysed cells in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation to remove insoluble material, each 30 μg of sample was electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were diluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. In Vitro Translation and Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Protein Pulldown Assay—The TSC2 deletions were generated by PCR using specific primers, and they were cloned in-frame into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T-1. These fusion proteins were expressed in 20 μl of 50% slurry beads containing ∼2 μg of protein (either GST or alone, or fused to deleted TSC2 mutants), resuspended in 350 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). This was mixed with 10 μlof in vitro translated wild type FoxO1 (Promega TnT reticulocyte lysate system kit). Binding was performed for 6 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with the binding buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane; the blot was incubated with anti-FOXO1 antibody and developed with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence using SV40-transformed hepatocytes was performed as described previously (35Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). After transient transfection with pCAG/FLAG-TSC2 using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), SV40-transformed hepatocytes were transduced with adenovirus encoding HA-tagged wild type or ADA-FoxO1. HA-tagged FoxO1 was visualized with anti-HA monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and TSC2 was visualized with anti-TSC2 polyclonal antibody and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Measurement of GTP- and GDP-bound Rheb—SV40-transformed hepatocytes were cultured in 6-well plates and co-transfected with pCAG/FLAG-rTSC2DEE and pCA-EGFP-Rheb using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and subsequently transduced with an adenovirus encoding WT FoxO1. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-free DMEM (DMEM without sodium phosphate and sodium pyruvate; Invitrogen) and incubated with 1 ml of phosphate-free DMEM for 90 min. Cells were then incubated with 25 μCi of [32P]phosphate/ml (GE healthcare) for 4 h. After the labeling, cells were lysed with prechilled lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml; 600 μl per well of a 6-well plate). To avoid lysing the nuclei, the cells were incubated with lysis buffer for just 30 s with gentle shaking. The lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (500 μl) was transferred to a fresh tube. Sixteen microliters of NaCl (500 mm) was added to 160 μl of supernatant to inhibit GAP activity in the lysates. To immunoprecipitate pCA-EGFP-Rheb, anti-green fluorescent protein and protein A-agarose (GE Healthcare) were added to the supernatant and incubated for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer two times and with wash buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2) one time at 4 °C. The Rheb-bound nucleotides were eluted with 15 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS) at 68 °C for 10 min. Ten microliters of eluted nucleotides was then applied onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates. Before applying sample, the plate was soaked in methanol and dried with a hair dryer. The bottom portion of the plate was immersed in methanol again, and the plate was placed in a sealed chromatography chamber that was filled with 0.75 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) to a depth of 1 cm. The chamber was closed, and the solvent was allowed to ascend to the top of the plate. The plate was then removed and air-dried. GTP and GDP resolved by thin layer chromatography were visualized and quantified by a BAS-5000 (Fuji Film). Design and Transfection of siRNAs—We used BLOCK iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen) to identify target siRNAs and used Stealth RNAi (Invitrogen). The FOXO1-specific sequence was 5′-AACUGCAGAUGUCUGCUGAGCAUGU-3′. HUVECs were transfected with Stealth RNAi using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and used for Western blotting. Statistics—We calculated descriptive statistics and ANOVA followed by Fisher's test using the Statview software (SAS Institute Inc.). Identification of TSC2 as a FoxO1-binding Protein—To identify proteins that bind to FoxO1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using GAL4-FoxO1 fragment (amino acids 424-550) as bait and a murine islet cDNA library as prey. About 2 × 106 transformants were tested. The strongest colony was isolated and was found to encode the C-terminal fragment of murine TSC2 (amino acids 1280-1815). To confirm the interaction between TSC2 and FoxO1, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with pCAG/FLAG-rTSC2DEE and pCMV5/cMyc-WT FoxO1, and we immunoprecipitated cell lysates using normal mouse IgG or anti-c-Myc mouse antibody and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting using anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myc antibodies showed that the exogenously expressed FoxO1 could interact with FLAG-tagged full-length-TSC2 (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, to investigate whether endogenous FoxO1 is physically associated with TSC2 or not, cell lysates from brown adipocytes immortalized by SV40-T antigen were immunoprecipitated with anti-FOXO1 (Fig. 1b, lane 2) or anti-TSC2 (Fig. 1b, lane 5) and followed by an immunoblotting with using antibodies against TSC2 (Fig. 1b, lanes 1-3, top panel) or FOXO1 (Fig. 1b, lanes 4-6, top panel). In this cell line, both FoxO1 and TSC2 are expressed abundantly. Our results showed that endogenous FoxO1 was associated with endogenous TSC2 (Fig. 1b). These results suggest that FoxO1 interacts physically with TSC2 in vivo. TSC2 Binds to Only FoxO1 among FoxO Family Members— FoxOs consist of FoxO1, FoxO3a, and FoxO4. These molecules have highly conserved motifs, which include forkhead DNA binding domain, three Akt phosphorylation sites, and several acetylation sites. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether TSC2 is associated with other FoxOs or not. To examine whether all three FoxOs can interact with TSC2 equally, we transfected SV40-transformed hepatocytes with cMyc-FoxO1, -FoxO3a, or FLAG-FOXO4 and immunoprecipitated lysates with antibody against TSC2 or normal rabbit serum and immunoblotted with antibody against c-Myc or FLAG. This co-immunoprecipitation study demonstrated that only FoxO1 could interact with endogenous TSC2 (Fig. 2, lane 3, top panel). These data suggest that FoxO1 interacts with TSC2 among FoxOs specifically. Identification of FoxO1-binding Site in TSC2 Protein—To examine whether FoxO1 interacts with TSC2 directly, we constructed several glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion TSC2 fragments. Because the yeast two-hybrid screening identified the C-terminal fragment of TSC2 (amino acids 1280-1815), we constructed several deleted Tsc2 mutants in this region (Fig. 3a). Using in vitro translated wild type FoxO1, pulldown assays with GST-deleted TSC2 fusion proteins were performed and showed that FoxO1 interacted with the C-terminal TSC2 fragment (amino acids 1280-1686) directly. The FoxO1-binding site on TSC2 protein encompasses amino acids 1280-1499 (Fig. 3b, lane 3), located near the GAP domain of TSC2. These data suggest that FoxO1 binds to TSC2 directly. FoxO1 Co-localizes with TSC2 in Cytoplasm—To examine subcellular localization of the FoxO1/TSC2 interaction, we transfected SV40-transformed hepatocytes with pCAG/FLAG-rTSC2DEE, transduced them with adenovirus encoding with HA-WT or ADA FoxO1 (30Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and performed immunofluorescence using anti-TSC2 polyclonal and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. In this cell line, even in the absence of serum, 70-80% of wild type FoxO1 was located in cytoplasm until 48 h after transduction (data not shown), where it co-localized with TSC2. In contrast, FLAG-TSC2 failed to co-localize with constitutively nuclear HA-tagged ADA FoxO1 (Fig. 4a). These data demonstrate that FoxO1 co-localizes with TSC2 in cytoplasm. Furthermore, to examine whether FoxO1 interacts with TSC2 in cytoplasm, we used a constitutively active mutant FoxO1 (3A FoxO1) in which all three Akt phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine (T24A/S253A/S316A; 3A FoxO1) and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in the same cell line. Although exogenous WT FoxO1 interacted with TSC2 as well as in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1a), the 3A FoxO1 interacted with TSC2 weakly compared with wild type FoxO1 (Fig. 4b, lanes 2 and 3). These data suggest the possibility that FoxO1 may associate with TSC2 in cytoplasm. FoxO1 Inhibits TSC2 and Enhances p70 S6K Phosphorylation— TSC2 regulates cellular function mainly by their inhibitory effects on mTOR and its targets p70 S6K and 4E-BP1. It is important to elucidate whether binding of FoxO1 to TSC2 affects the activity of the mTOR/p70 S6K pathway. To investigate the effects of the FoxO1/TSC2 interaction on the mTOR pathway, we transfected SV40-transformed hepatocytes with FLAG-p70 S6K followed by transduction with adenovirus encoding HA-WT FoxO1 or -ADA FoxO1, which is localized in the nucleus and active constitutively and is immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and blotted with anti-phospho-p70 S6K (Thr(P)-389) antibody. After serum deprivation for 24 h, p70 S6K is dephosphorylated, and insulin increases phosphorylation of p70 S6K (Fig. 5a, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 6 and 7). However, even in the absence of insulin, p70 S6K was phosphorylated in a dose-dependent manner of transduced WT FoxO1 (Fig. 5, a, lanes 3-5, and b, left panel). As described above, in this cell line, even after serum deprivation for 24 h, around 70-80% of transduced wild type FoxO1 is located in the cytoplasm (data not shown) and is phosphorylated (Fig. 5a, lanes 3-5). These data indicate that FoxO1 is constantly phosphorylated in this cell line even in the absence of serum and insulin. In contrast, p70 S6K was dephosphorylated in cells transduced with the ADA-FoxO1 (Fig. 5, a, lanes 8-10, and b, right panel). These data suggest that FoxO1 in cytosol enhances p70 S6K phosphorylation. To confirm whether enhanced phosphorylation of p70 S6K by FoxO1 is mediated through binding to TSC2, we overexpressed FLAG-TSC2 in SV40-transformed hepatocytes transduced with adenovirus encoding HA-WT FoxO1, and we investigated the effects on phosphorylation of p70 S6K. Overexpression of TSC2 decreased phosphorylation of p70 S6K (Fig. 5c, lanes 1 and 2). Overexpression of WT FoxO1 enhanced phosphorylation of p70 S6K (Fig. 5c, lanes 1 and 3). Even in the presence of WT FoxO1, overexpression of TSC2 decreased phosphorylation of p70 S6K (Fig. 5c, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that cytoplasmic FoxO1 enhances phosphorylation of p70 S6K through association with endogenous TSC2. These data also suggest the possibility that cytoplasmic FoxO1 may affect an inhibitory action of TSC2 onto mTOR and activate mTOR. FoxO1 Functions Upstream of mTOR for Activation of p70 S6K—To investigate whether enhanced phosphorylation of p70 S6K by overexpression of WT FoxO1 is mediated through mTOR activation, we treated cells with rapamycin (25 nm) and examined effects on p70 S6K phosphorylation. Overexpression of WT FoxO1 enhanced phosphorylation of p70 S6K (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, treatment with rapamycin abolished p70 S6K phosphorylation induced by overexpression of FoxO1 (Fig. 6, lane 4). These data suggest that FoxO1 enhances phosphorylation of p70 S6K through activation of mTOR and mTOR functions downstream of FoxO1 for p70 S6K phosphorylation. FoxO1 Reduces the Association between TSC1 and TSC2— Dimerization of TSC2 with TSC1 is important for functional inhibition on the mTOR/p70 S6K pathway. To elucidate the mechanism of how FoxO1 inhibits TSC2, we transduced HUVEC with adenovirus encoding WT FoxO1 and immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-TSC2 (Fig. 7a, lanes 3-5), anti-TSC1 (Fig. 7a, lanes 8-10), or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 7a, lanes 13-15) and immunoblotted with anti-TSC1, anti-TSC2, or anti-HA antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2038152220,"Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation, play an important role in regulation of the stability and the transcriptional activity of c-Myb. Conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier type 1 (SUMO-1) to lysines in the negative regulatory domain strongly suppresses its transcriptional activity. Here we report conjugation of two other members of the SUMO protein family, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, and provide evidence that this post-translational modification negatively affects transcriptional activity of c-Myb. Conjugation of SUMO-2/3 proteins is strongly enhanced by several different cellular stresses and occurs primarily on two lysines, Lys523 and Lys499. These lysines are in the negative regulatory domain of c-Myb and also serve as acceptor sites for SUMO-1. Stress-induced SUMO-2/3 conjugation is very rapid and independent of activation of stress-activated protein kinases of the SAPK and JNK families. PIAS-3 protein was identified as a new c-Myb-specific SUMO-E3 ligase that both catalyzes conjugation of SUMO-2/3 proteins to c-Myb and exerts a negative effect on c-Myb-induced reporter gene activation. Interestingly, co-expression of a SPRING finger mutant of PIAS-3 significantly suppresses SUMOylation of c-Myb under stress. These results argue that PIAS-3 SUMO-E3 ligase plays a critical role in stress-induced conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to c-Myb. We also detected stress-induced conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to c-Myb in hematopoietic cells at the levels of endogenously expressed proteins. Furthermore, according to the negative role of SUMO conjugation on c-Myb capacity, we have observed rapid stress-induced down-regulation of the targets genes c-myc and bcl-2 of c-Myb. Our findings demonstrate that SUMO-2/3 proteins conjugate to c-Myb and negatively regulate its activity in cells under stress. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation, play an important role in regulation of the stability and the transcriptional activity of c-Myb. Conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier type 1 (SUMO-1) to lysines in the negative regulatory domain strongly suppresses its transcriptional activity.

These results argue that PIAS-3 SUMO-E3 ligase plays a critical role in stress-induced conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to c-Myb. We also detected stress-induced conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to c-Myb in hematopoietic cells at the levels of endogenously expressed proteins. Furthermore, according to the negative role of SUMO conjugation on c-Myb capacity, we have observed rapid stress-induced down-regulation of the targets genes c-myc and bcl-2 of c-Myb. Our findings demonstrate that SUMO-2/3 proteins conjugate to c-Myb and negatively regulate its activity in cells under stress. c-Myb is a DNA-binding transcription factor that plays a major role in the development of erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid lineages of definitive hematopoiesis. The c-myb gene is abundantly expressed in immature proliferating hematopoietic progenitor cells but not in mature non-proliferating cells (1Gonda T.J. Metcalf D. Nature. 1984; 310: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2273-2279PubMed Google Scholar). The function of c-Myb as a regulator of hematopoiesis is achieved through transcriptional regulation of genes intimately involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (3Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 4Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Its critical role in establishment of the definitive hematopoietic system has been demonstrated in experiments with targeted disruption of the c-myb gene, where c-myb null mutant mouse embryos die around day 15 in utero due to severe anemia (5Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schreiner C.M. Miller T.A. Pietryga D.W. Scott Jr., W.J. Potter S.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Originally, c-myb was identified as a transforming gene of two avian viruses, avian myeloblastosis virus and avian erythroleukemia virus E26 (6Lipsick J.S. Wang D.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). c-myb can also be oncogenically activated following integration of replication-competent retroviruses into the c-myb locus in animal models (4Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Oncogenic forms of c-Myb protein are almost invariably accompanied with truncations of the amino and carboxyl termini resulting in removal of structural regions that negatively regulate c-Myb activity (4Wolff L. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The c-Myb protein is composed of three functional domains: an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central transactivation domain, and a carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory domain. The DNA-binding domain in the NH2-terminal region of c-Myb consists of three imperfect tandem repeats and binds to DNA through the consensus sequence 5′-PyAAC(G/T)G-3′ (7Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-13348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) are crucial for modulation of the transactivation activity of c-Myb.SUMOylation is a reversible process that regulates the function of target proteins in a manner akin to phosphorylation (26Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 27Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of SUMOylation are not completely understood but this modification (unlike ubiquitination) does not directly involve targeting for proteasomal degradation. Rather it causes changes in protein-protein interactions, subnuclear localization, and conformational changes (26Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 27Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Three different isoforms of SUMO (SUMO-1, -2, -3) are present in mammals. SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are 97% identical to each other and about 66% homologous to SUMO-1 (28Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). At present, it is not entirely clear whether SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 play similar roles within cells. It was shown that oxidative stress, mild heat stress, or genotoxic stress (UV irradiation) cause a dramatic increase in the amount of SUMO-2/3 incorporated into high molecular weight complexes within cells (28Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). However, the identity of these target proteins that are modified by conjugation of SUMO-2/3 in response to different stresses largely remains to be identified. Whereas there is a growing list of proteins modified with SUMO-1, only a few substrates for SUMO-2/3 modifications are validated in vivo.Here we show that Lys523 and Lys499, located in NRD of c-Myb, are modified with SUMO-2/3 in vivo. This modification is greatly enhanced by several different stresses such as heat stress, osmotic stress, and metabolic stress and to a lesser extent by genotoxic stress. Two SUMO-E3 ligases, PIASy and PIAS3, enhance conjugation of SUMO-2/3 proteins to c-Myb in a qualitatively different way. In hematopoietic cells under stress, SUMO-2/3 conjugation to c-Myb at the endogenous protein levels demonstrates the physiological relevance of this post-translational modification in regulation of c-Myb activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—Constructs encoding wild-type c-Myb (c-MybWT) and mutant forms (c-MybK499R, c-MybK523R, and c-Myb2K/R) were described previously (24Bies J.

Plasmid pEGFP-PML was kindly provided by H. Katano (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan).Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells (COS-7; American Type Culture Collection) and murine erythroleukemia cells (DS19; a kind gift from S. Ruscetti, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml each) (Invitrogen).Transient Transfections—For transient transfections, COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish 1 day prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out with 2 μg of plasmid DNA/dish using the Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of the transfected gene was analyzed 36 h post-transfection by Western immunoblotting.Western Immunoblotting—Cells were disrupted in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm, Sigma) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were sonicated for 20 s and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The c-Myb protein was immunoprecipitated with rabbit antiserum (24Bies J. Markus J. Wolff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8999-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and SUMO-2/3 proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SUMO-2/3 antibody (33Azuma Y. Amaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Y. Azuma (NICHD, National Institutes of Health). Immunoprecipitated proteins or whole cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Primary antibodies were anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibody (a kind gift of Eric Westin), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), and anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance), and anti-T7 monoclonal antibodies (Novagen).Confocal Laser Microscopy—COS-7 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and cotransfected with constructs encoding green (pEGFP-SUMO-2 or pEGFP-PML) and red (pDsRed2-cMyb) fluorescent fusion proteins. Thirty-six hours after transfection coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted on microscopic slides using Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology). Confocal images were acquired with a Leica DMIRBE inverted microscope (Leica) equipped with a digital scanning head (Leica SP2 Confocal Microscope) using excitation wavelengths of 488 nm for GFP and 594 nm for Red2. The channels were recorded independently and pseudocolor images were generated and superimposed using Imaris version 5.0.3 software (Bitplane). The acquired digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software.Transactivation Assay—COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates and grown overnight prior to transfections. Transfections were carried out using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche). Cells were cotransfected with 100 ng of the c-Myb-responsive reporter plasmid p5xMRE-A-luc (containing five copies of the mim-1A, Myb-responsive element (MRE) upstream of minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and the firefly luciferase gene), 50 ng of pRL-tk-Renilla luciferase vector (Promega), and expression vectors encoding wild-type (cMybWT) or a mutant form of cMyb (cMyb2K/R) (100 ng of each). To assess the effect of PIAS3 expression on the transcriptional activity of c-Myb, increasing concentrations (1, 10, and 50 ng) of plasmid encoding murine PIAS3 was also transfected as indicated. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 500 ng with empty vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were processed for both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) and Turner TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs). Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated two times.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples containing 10 μg of total RNA were resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.25 m formaldehyde in MOPS buffer system. Separated RNAs were capillary transferred onto nylon membrane (Nytran SuperCharge, Schleicher & Schuell) and UV cross-linked using a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). Blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled by the random priming method using Ready-to-Go DNA Labeling Beads (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative analysis was performed with a Storm 840 phosphorimager using ImageQuant 5.1 software (GE Healthcare).RESULTSPost-translational Modification of c-Myb by Covalent Attachment of SUMO-2/3—It has been demonstrated that the negative regulatory domain of c-Myb can be modified by SUMO-1 (24Bies J. Markus J. Wolff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8999-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielson O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-13348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) within its so-called PEST/EVES motif, and this modification is important for the inhibitory function of this domain. Whereas many targets have no preferences for SUMO isoforms, others are preferentially modified by one isoform, for example, RanGAP1 with SUMO-1 (28Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) or topoisomerase-II by SUMO-2/3 (34Azuma Y. Amaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine whether, in addition to SUMO-1, c-Myb is modified in vivo by SUMO-2/3, we analyzed transiently transfected COS-7 cells with plasmids encoding either wild-type c-Myb (c-MybWT), HA-tagged SUMO-2 (HA-SUMO-2), or both. Thirty-six hours post-transfection the cells were lysed, c-Myb was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, anti-HA antibody recognized two HA-immunoreactive bands in the immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with both c-MybWT and HA-SUMO-2-encoding constructs, but not in cells transfected with either construct alone. Anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies were used to confirm that similar levels of c-Myb were expressed and immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with c-MybWT. Anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies also detected a SUMO-2-modified form migrating ∼20 kDa above the nonmodified form of c-MybWT (Fig. 1A). Transfection efficiency was evaluated by Western immunoblotting of total cellular proteins. Anti-HA antibody detected a ladder of bands representing the HA-SUMO-2-conjugated cellular proteins only in cells transfected with HA-SUMO-2 (Fig. 1B). Anti-c-Myb monoclonal antibodies detected the c-MybWT protein (75-kDa form) only in cells transfected with the c-MybWT construct (Fig. 1B). Identical results were obtained with HA-tagged SUMO-3 constructs (data not shown). Both proteins SUMO-2 and-3 are virtually identical (in the processed form they differ only in 3 amino acids) and presently no antibodies are available that would distinguish between these two isoforms. All the figures show representative results that were obtained with the HA-SUMO-2 construct, even though all experiments in COS-7 cells were performed with both SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 with virtually identical results. These experiments clearly show that SUMO-2/3 proteins efficiently modify c-Myb. We also observed that, at least in COS-7 cells, SUMO-2/3 have a higher affinity toward c-Myb than SUMO-1. Transfection of c-MybWT and equimolar amounts of either HA-SUMO-2 or HA-SUMO-3 leads to conjugation of SUMO-2/3, where 20-40% of c-Myb is detected in the SUMOylated form, whereas transfected c-MybWT and SUMO-1 leads to only 5-10% of SUMOylated c-Myb (Refs. 24Bies J. Markus J. Wolff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8999-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar and 25Dahle O. Andersen T.O. Nordgard O. Matre V. Del Sal G. Gabrielson O.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1338-13348Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and data not shown). Previously we have shown that SUMO-1 protein conjugates to two lysines, Lys499 and Lys523, located in the negative regulatory domain of c-Myb. Sequences around both Lys499 and Lys523 conform perfectly to the minimal SUMO modification consensus sequence ΨKXE (where Ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid and X any amino acid). Interestingly, we also observed that the single mutation K523R completely abolished modification of c-Myb with SUMO-1, suggesting that SUMOylation of c-Myb is an interdependent process, where modification of Lys523 is required for modification of the second Lys499 to occur. To determine whether the same lysines are sites of SUMO-2/3 conjugation, we cotransfected COS-7 cells with HA-SUMO-2/3 and wild-type c-Myb, as well as c-Myb constructs in which Lys499 (cMybK499R), Lys523 (cMybK523R), or both (cMyb2K/R) were changed to arginines. Lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myb polyclonal antiserum and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA and anti-c-Myb antibodies (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that Lys499 and Lys523 are major modification sites for SUMO-2/3 proteins, with an obvious preference for modification of Lys523 with SUMO-2/3. The single mutation K523R strongly inhibited modification of c-Myb with SUMO-2/3 at both sites. Thus, conjugation of SUMO-2/3 is ordered, where the first modification of c-Myb with SUMO-2/3 takes place almost exclusively at Lys523, and is necessary for the attachment of the second molecule to Lys499. As expected, mutation of both sites completely abolished modification of c-Myb with SUMO-2/3. Thus, Lys499 and Lys523 are the two major sites in the NRD of c-Myb modified with SUMO-2/3.Subnuclear Co-localization of c-Myb with SUMO-2—Next, we examined the co-localizations of c-Myb with SUMO-2/3 in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with constructs encoding the fusion fluorescent proteins EGFP-SUMO2 and DsRed2-cMyb, and analyzed the cells by confocal microscopy. DsRed2-cMyb was detected in the nucleus in the form of bright nuclear speckles, as well as in a fine granular form. GFP-SUMO-2 protein had a more homogenous distribution in the nucleus than c-Myb, but overall there was a strong co-localization of DsRed2-cMyb and EGFP-SUMO-2 (Fig. 2A; superimposition of confocal images). It was shown previously that c-Myb associates with PML in vivo in very bright dot-like structures that represent PML (ND10) nuclear bodies (35Dahle O. Bakke O. Gabrielson O.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We also observed co-localization of c-Myb and PML in COS-7 cells when these cells were cotransfected with HA-SUMO-2, and fluorescent fusion proteins encoding DsRed2-cMyb and EGFP-PML (Fig. 2B). However, the majority of DsRed2-cMyb protein was localized outside of GFP-PML-positive nuclear bodies. Thus, modification of c-Myb with SUMO-2/3 proteins seems to occur in subnuclear compartments that may differ from PML (ND10) nuclear bodies.FIGURE 2Co-localization of c-Myb with SUMO-2 and PML in the nucleus. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids containing pDsRed2-cMyb and pEGFP-SUMO2 (A), or pDsRed2-cMyb, pEGFP-PML, and HA-SUMO-2 (B). Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells were fixed and mounted on slides and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Images are representative examples of the subnuclear distribution patterns of pEGFP-SUMO2 or pEGFP-PML (green) and pDsRed2-cMyb (red) in the same cells. The two images were digitally merged and the co-localization of two proteins is indicated by the yellow color in the right panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stress Induces Conjugation of SUMO-2/3 Proteins to c-Myb— It was shown previously that SUMO-2/3 proteins are more abundant in their free form than SUMO-1 in COS-7 cells. Additionally, Saitoh and Hinchey (28Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) reported that pools of free SUMO-2/3 decrease rapidly when cells are exposed to heat, ethanol, or hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, SUMO-2/-3 modification of cellular proteins may be involved in the cellular response to environmental stresses. To investigate whether conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to c-Myb is modulated by stress, COS-7 cells transfected with HA-SUMO-2/3 and wild-type c-Myb were subjected to different forms of stress and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of SUMO-2/3 conjugated to c-Myb dramatically increased after exposure of cells to heat stress (43 °C for 30 min), osmotic stress (0.7 m NaCl for 30 min), and also metabolic stress (ethanol 7% for 30 min). In contrast, genotoxic stress (UV irradiation) increased conjugation only mildly (Fig. 3B). With the environmental stress, we observed, not only was there a dramatic increase in modification of two major SUMOylation sites Lys523 and Lys499, but also several slower migrating species that correspond to c-Myb modified with more than two molecules of SUMO-2/3 (Fig. 3A). SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 contain the consensus SUMO modification site (ΨKXE) in their N-terminal reg"
https://openalex.org/W2106685730,"Earlier we suggested that atheroma lesions constitute a ""death zone"" containing toxic materials that may cause dysfunction and demise of invading macrophages to prevent the removal of plaque materials. Here we have assessed the cytotoxic effects of nonfractionated gruel and insoluble (ceroid-like) material derived from advanced human atheroma.The insoluble material within advanced atherosclerotic plaque was isolated following protease K digestion and extensive extraction with aqueous and organic solvents. FTIR, Raman, and atomic absorption spectroscopy suggested that, despite its fluorescent nature, this material closely resembled hydroxyapatite and dentin, but also contained a significant amount of iron and calcium. When added to J774 cells and human macrophages in culture, this insoluble substance was phagocytosed, and progressive cell death followed. However, an even more cytotoxic activity was found in the atheromatous ""gruel"" that contains abundant carbonyls/aldehydes. Cell death caused by both crude gruel and ceroid could be blocked by preincubating cells with the lipophilic iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone, apoferritin, BAPTA/AM, or sodium borohydride, indicating that cellular iron, calcium, and reactive aldehyde(s) are responsible for the observed cytotoxicity.Toxic materials within atheromatous lesions include both ceroid and even more cytotoxic lipidaceous materials. The cytotoxic effects of these plaque components may help explain the persistence of atherosclerotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2044919636,"The remarkable regenerative potential of the liver is well known. Recent investigations have shown that this regenerative response is impaired in mouse models of fatty liver disease. Other studies demonstrate that mice engineered for liver-specific overexpression of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) develop significant hepatic steatosis. These observations suggest that precise regulation of hepatic PPARgamma activity may be essential for normal liver regeneration. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of PPARgamma-activating thiazolidinediones on liver regeneration in the rodent partial hepatectomy model. Thiazolidinediones with different PPARgamma-activating potencies were administered to mice, and those mice were subjected to partial hepatectomy and analyzed for resulting effects on hepatocellular proliferation and signaling pathways important during normal liver regeneration. The results showed that thiazolidinediones suppress liver regeneration with efficacies that correlate with their relative PPARgamma-activating potencies. These studies provide the first evidence linking regulation of PPARgamma activity and the hepatic regenerative response."
https://openalex.org/W2134300090,"To investigate how angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enhance the actions of bradykinin (BK) on B2 receptors independent of blocking BK inactivation, we expressed human somatic ACE and B2 receptors in CHO cells. Bradykinin and its ACE-resistant analog were the receptor agonists. B2 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and ACE were coprecipitated with antisera to GFP or ACE shown in Western blots. Immunohistochemistry of fixed cells localized ACE by red color and B2-GFP by green. Yellow on plasma membranes of coexpressing cells also indicated enzyme-receptor complex formation. Using ACE-fused cyan fluorescent protein donor and B2-fused yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) acceptor, we registered fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) by the enhanced fluorescence of donor on acceptor photobleaching, establishing close (within 10 nm) positions of B2 receptors and ACE. Bradykinin stimulation cointernalized ACE and B2 receptors. We expressed ACE fused to N terminus of B2 receptors, anchoring only receptors to plasma membranes. Here, in contrast to cells, where both ACE and B2 receptors are separately anchored, ACE inhibitors neither enhance activation of chimeric B2 nor resensitize desensitized B2 receptors. Heterodimer formation between ACE and B2 receptors can be a mechanism for ACE inhibitors to augment kinin activity at cellular level."
https://openalex.org/W1984540130,"Myosin IIIA is specifically expressed in photoreceptors and cochlea and is important for the phototransduction and hearing processes. In addition, myosin IIIA contains a unique N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal tail actin-binding motif. We examined the kinetic properties of baculovirus expressed human myosin IIIA containing the kinase, motor, and two IQ domains. The maximum actin-activated ATPase rate is relatively slow (kcat = 0.77 ± 0.08 s–1), and high actin concentrations are required to fully activate the ATPase rate (KATPase = 34 ± 11 μm). However, actin co-sedimentation assays suggest that myosin III has a relatively high steady-state affinity for actin in the presence of ATP (Kactin ∼ 7 μm). The rate of ATP binding to the motor domain is quite slow both in the presence and absence of actin (K1k+2 = 0.020 and 0.001 μm–1·s–1, respectively). The rate of actin-activated phosphate release is more than 100-fold faster (85 s–1) than the kcat, whereas ADP release in the presence of actin follows a two-step mechanism (7.0 and 0.6 s–1). Thus, our data suggest a transition between two actomyosin-ADP states is the rate-limiting step in the actomyosin III ATPase cycle. Our data also suggest the myosin III motor spends a large fraction of its cycle in an actomyosin ADP state that has an intermediate affinity for actin (Kd ∼ 5 μm). The long lived actomyosin-ADP state may be important for the ability of myosin III to function as a cellular transporter and actin cross-linker in the actin bundles of sensory cells.

The long lived actomyosin-ADP state may be important for the ability of myosin III to function as a cellular transporter and actin cross-linker in the actin bundles of sensory cells. Molecular motor proteins of the myosin superfamily are capable of converting the energy from ATP hydrolysis into force and motion through a cyclic interaction with actin filaments. Myosins are involved in many different types of cell motility, including muscle contraction, cell division, and intracellular transport (1Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 2Holmes K.C. Geeves M.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Several myosin proteins, including myosins I, III, VI, VIIA, X, and XV, have been found to be involved in sensory processes (3Brown M.E. Bridgman P.C. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 58: 118-130Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A common theme emerging from the recent work on the structural and functional properties of myosin motors is that they have a common structural core (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K.

Nature. 2003; 425: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas small differences in specific regions alter their kinetic properties, tuning each myosin for its functional role in the cell (7Sweeney H.L. Houdusse A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 1829-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the kinetic properties of an uncharacterized myosin protein can provide important insights into its biological function. Class III myosins were originally discovered in Drosophila eyes and designated as the NINAC protein. The electrophysiological response in Drosophila eyes lacking the myosin III gene exhibits neither inactivation nor activation following a light stimulus (9Montell C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 757-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The ninaC gene contains an N-terminal kinase domain, a central myosin homology domain, and a C-terminal tail. In addition, localization studies demonstrated that the myosin domain is necessary to concentrate NINAC in the rhabdomere, the microvillus structure that is the site of many steps in phototransduction and contains a filamentous actin core (10Porter J.A. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The kinase domain was not required for localization (10Porter J.A. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). NINAC binds to calmodulin and has the ability to concentrate calmodulin in the rhabdomeres (11Porter J.A. Yu M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. Montell C. Science. 1993; 262: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because calmodulin is thought to be involved in the phototransduction process, concentrating calmodulin may be a major role for myosin III in fly photoreceptors. Other studies have implicated NINAC in the transport of phototransduction signaling proteins such as Gqα (12Lee S.J. Montell C. Neuron. 2004; 43: 95-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and arrestin (13Cronin M.A. Diao F. Tsunada S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4797-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in a light-dependent manner. Thus myosin III may alter the phototransduction process by modulating the concentration of these important signaling proteins at the site of phototransduction. Two isoforms of myosin III, myosin IIIA and IIIB, have been identified in humans (14Dosé A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2000; 67: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Dosé A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2002; 79: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Myosin IIIA is expressed primarily in the retina and cochlea (14Dosé A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2000; 67: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Dosé A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2002; 79: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Myosin IIIA expression has also been found in the retina of striped bass and limulus (16Dosé A.C. Hillman D.W. Wong C. Sohlberg L. Lin-Jones J. Burnside B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Battelle B.-A. Andrews A.W. Calman B.G. Sellers J.R. Greenberg R.M. Smith W.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4548-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the human myosin IIIA gene have been linked to nonsyndromic deafness (18Walsh T. Walsh V. Vreugde S. Hertzano R. Shahin H. Haika S. Lee M.K. Kanaan M. King M. Avraham K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7518-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role as a cellular transporter, human myosin IIIA containing two IQ domains was found to have ATPase activity, kinase activity, and the ability to move actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay (19Komaba S. Inoue A. Maruta S. Hosoya H. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21352-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To understand how the myosin III motor functions and is regulated in the cell, it is necessary to determine the kinetic mechanism of its ATPase cycle. The kinetic mechanism provides information about the predominant steady-state intermediates and the duty ratio, the fraction of the ATPase cycle during which myosin is bound to actin. Understanding these kinetic features of myosin III will provide important insights into the mechanism by which this myosin can perform its cellular functions such as intracellular transport or cytoskeletal dynamics. For example, myosin V is a high duty ratio motor and functions as an intracellular transporter by moving processively along actin, taking multiple steps along actin without diffusing away (20De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 21Mehta A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1981-1998PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it can function and is likely regulated as a single molecule (22Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Other myosin motors that have a low duty ratio function as a group or as an ensemble of motors, such as in muscle contraction and receptor-mediated endocytosis (8De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of class III myosins is the N-terminal kinase domain that is capable of autophosphorylating sites on the myosin motor domain (9Montell C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 757-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19Komaba S. Inoue A. Maruta S. Hosoya H. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21352-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is unclear how this kinase domain plays a role in the phototransduction process or what are its cellular substrates, if there are any. The kinase domain is most similar in sequence to PAK1 kinases (16Dosé A.C. Hillman D.W. Wong C. Sohlberg L. Lin-Jones J. Burnside B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1058-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which interestingly have been implicated in regulating actin polymerization and myosin activation (23Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the kinase domain of myosin III were shown to be quite slow based on the rate of autophosphorylation of sites on the myosin III motor domain (19Komaba S. Inoue A. Maruta S. Hosoya H. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21352-21360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the kinetics of PAK1 kinases were found to be quite rapid (20–30 s–1) (24Wu H. Zheng Y. Wang Z.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the kinetics of the myosin III kinase domain may lead to insights into its biological function. In this study we have expressed and purified human myosin IIIA containing the kinase, motor, and two IQ domains, and we have determined the key individual rate and equilibrium constants in the myosin III motor ATPase cycle. Our results provide important insights into the potential function of myosin III in sensory organs. In addition, our work provides a framework for future studies that will examine the kinetic and biophysical mechanism of myosin III regulation. Reagents—All reagents were the highest purity commercially available. ATP and ADP were prepared fresh from powder. N-Methylanthraniloyl (mant) 2The abbreviations used are: mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; MDCC-PBP, N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide. -labeled 2′-deoxy-ADP and 2′-deoxy-ATP were prepared as described (25Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 26Woodward S.K. Eccleston J.F. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or purchased from Jena Biosciences. The mant-ATP and mant-ADP concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements at 255 nm using ϵ255 of 23,300 m–1·cm–1. ATP and ADP concentrations were determined by absorbance at 259 nm using ϵ259 of 15,400 m–1·cm–1. Nucleotides were prepared prior to use in the presence of equimolar MgCl2. Myosin cDNA Construction and Protein Expression and Purification—We generated a construct of human myosin IIIA truncated after the second IQ domain (residues 1–1143) (MIII), and containing a C-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) for purification purposes (27Sweeney H.L.

Recombinant baculoviruses of myosin III and calmodulin generated with the FastBac system (Invitrogen) were co-expressed in Sf9 cells. The purity was assessed with Coomassie-stained SDS gels. Myosin concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad microplate assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (29Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2605-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Sun M. Oakes J.L. Ananthanarayanan S.K. Hawley K.H. Tsien R.Y. Adams S.R. Yengo C.M. J. Biol.

Absorbance measurements were also performed, and a predicted extinction coefficient of 129,500 m–1·cm–1 was used to calculate the concentration with similar results. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle using an acetone powder method (31Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Pyrene actin was generated by labeling actin with pyrene iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) as described (32Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in KMg50 buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 °C). Steady-state ATPase Activity of MIII—Steady-state ATP hydrolysis by MIII (50–100 nm) in the absence and presence of actin (0–70 μm) was examined using the NADH-linked assay (28De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Yengo C.M. Sweeney H.L.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5711-5717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with a final MgATP concentration of 1 mm. Kinase Activity—Autophosphorylation of the MIII was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. MIII (0.5 μm) was allowed to react with ATP for specific time periods ranging from 10 s to 60 min. The reaction was stopped at each time point by the addition of SDS loading buffer. A series of time course experiments was conducted at various ATP concentrations (0–1000 μm). Samples from sequential time points for each specific ATP concentration were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and probed with anti-phosphothreonine primary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) was applied as the secondary antibody, followed by treatment with Lumiglo chemiluminescence reagent (Cell Signaling Technology) to detect the bands of phosphorylated protein with x-ray film. Densitometry analysis using NIH image software was used to determine the band intensities. The membrane was subsequently stripped and reprobed with an anti-FLAG antibody to detect total protein and verify even loading of samples. Kinase activity was also examined by performing time courses as described above using [γ-32P]ATP as a substrate. The number of moles of 32P incorporated into each mole of MIII was determined by subjecting each sample of the time course to SDS-PAGE, excising each band, and dissolving the bands in 30% H2O2. The dissolved bands were examined by scintillation counting and compared with a standard curve to determine the moles of 32P incorporated per mol of MIII. Actin Co-sedimentation Assay—MIII was equilibrated with actin (0–60 μm) and the ATP-regeneration system (2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase). 2 mm ATP was added just prior to ultracentrifugation in a TLA 100.2 Beckman centrifuge at 320,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. The ADP concentration in the supernatant was determined by mixing a specified amount of the supernatant with the NADH mix and measuring the change in NADH absorbance as described under “Steady-state ATPase Activity.” Equal amounts of the supernatant and pellet were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the fraction of MIII bound to actin was determined by quantifying the amount of MIII in the supernatant and pellet with densitometry using NIH image software. The fraction bound was plotted as a function of actin concentration to determine the affinity of myosin III for actin in the presence of ATP. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A Quantamaster fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ) equipped with a 75-watt xenon arc lamp as an excitation source and excitation/emission monochromators was used to measure steady-state fluorescence of pyrene actin. Pyrene actin was excited at 365 nm, and the emission spectra was measured from 380 to 550 nm. Slit widths were set at a resolution of 1 nm. All fluorescence spectra were corrected for variations in the wavelength sensitivity of the detector system, the presence of Raman scatter, and background fluorescence in the appropriate buffer solution. Acid Quench—To determine the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis, 0.9 μm myosin III was mixed with 25 μm ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP, allowed to react at 25 °C for 1–20 s, and quenched with quench solution (2 n HCl, 0.35 m KH2PO4). The hydrolyzed [γ-32P]ATP was separated from unhydrolyzed [γ-32P]ATP using activated charcoal, and scintillation counting was used to determine [γ-32P]ATP concentrations (33White H.D. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9859-9865Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Yengo C.M. De La Cruz E.M. Safer D. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8508-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The number of moles of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolyzed per mol of myosin was used to calculate the phosphate burst and the equilibrium constant for hydrolysis. Stopped-flow Measurements and Kinetic Modeling—Transient kinetic experiments were performed in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow with a dead time of 1.2 ms. A monochromator with a 2 nm band pass was used for fluorescence excitation, and cut-off filters were used to measure the emission. All optical filters were provided with the stopped-flow instrument. Light scatter was measured at 320 nm at 90° with a 305 nm long pass filter. Pyrene actin was excited at 365 nm, and the emission was measured using a 400 nm long pass filter. Mant-labeled nucleotides were excited by energy transfer from tryptophans by exciting at 295 nm or by direct excitation at 355 nm, and the emission was measured through a 400 nm long pass filter. Both methods of exciting mant-ATP and mant-ADP gave similar results. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data were done with software provided with the instrument or Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Uncertainties reported are standard error of the fits unless stated otherwise. The kinetics of phosphate release were measured using phosphate-binding protein covalently labeled with N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC-PBP) (generously provided by Howard White, Eastern Virginia University School of Medicine) (35Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of MDCC-PBP, which increases severalfold in the presence of inorganic phosphate (35Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), was excited at 400 nm, and the emission was measured through a 425 nm long pass filter. Phosphate release was measured with a sequential mix experiment in which 2 μm myosin III was mixed with 1.75 μm ATP and aged for 5 s to allow myosin III to bind and hydrolyze the ATP, and then the MIII·ADP·Pi complex was mixed with actin (0–40 μm) (29Yengo C.M.

All solutions were preincubated with 7-methylguanosine (0.2 mm) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (0.2 units·ml–1) to remove background phosphate. Kinetic modeling and simulations were performed with Pro-K software (Applied Photophysics) using the reaction scheme, which has recently been used in kinetics studies of myosin V, VI, and VII (20De La Cruz E.M.

The rate and equilibrium constants are labeled on the basis of the reaction proceeding from left to right and those between the actin-associated and-dissociated steps proceeding in the dissociated direction. The main flux of the reaction pathway is shown in boldface. All concentrations mentioned in the stopped-flow experiments are final concentrations unless stated otherwise. Protein Expression and Purification—The expression yields of human myosin IIIA 2IQ co-expressed with calmodulin (MIII) in the baculovirus insect cell (Sf9) system were ∼0.5–1 mg/liter of Sf9 cells at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml. The purity of MIII following anti-FLAG affinity chromatography was ∼95% based on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1). The stoichiometry of calmodulin to MIII in the final purified product was determined to be two calmodulins per myosin with densitometry analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). All experiments were performed in KMg50 and in the presence of 10 μm calmodulin to ensure the IQ domains of MIII had bound calmodulin. Steady-state ATPase Activity—We examined the actin-activated ATPase activity of MIII using the NADH-coupled assay in KMg50 buffer at 25 °C (Fig. 2A). The rate of ATPase activity was plotted as a function of actin concentration and the data fit to the Michaelis-Menten relationship. The maximum rate of ATPase activity (kcat) was found to be 0.77 ± 0.06 s–1, and the actin concentration at which one-half-maximal activity was achieved (KATPase) was found to be 34 ± 11 μm. Single turnover experiments were performed with mant-ATP, which enhances its fluorescence when bound to myosin, to monitor the turnover rate of MIII in the presence and absence of actin (data not shown). MIII (1.0 μm) was mixed with 25 μm mant-ATP, aged for 10 s, and then mixed with 0.5 mm unlabeled ADP in the presence and absence of 20 μm actin (final reaction conditions: 0.5 μm MIII, 12.5 μm mant-ATP, 0.5 mm ADP, with and without 20 μm actin). The decrease in mant fluorescence was monitored as a function of time. The fluorescence transients were biexponential with a fast phase of 16 ± 1s–1 and a slow phase of 0.11 ± 0.01 s–1 (relative amplitudes = 0.62 and 0.38, respectively) in the absence of actin, and a fast phase of 18 ± 1 s–1 and slow phase of 0.78 ± 0.15 s–1 (relative amplitudes = 0.57 and 0.43, respectively) in the presence of actin. The fast phase was modeled to be mant-ATP dissociation from the kinase domain, determined from the direct binding experiments described below (Fig. 4), whereas the slow phase was modeled to be the rate of ATP turnover by the motor domain. The slow phase of the fluorescence transient is in relatively good agreement with the steady-state ATPase rate in the absence of actin and the kcat in the presence of actin (Table 1).TABLE 1Steady-state parameters of the MIII motor ATPase cycleSteady-state parametersValuev0 (s)-1aSteady-state ATPase activity in the absence of actin measured with the NADH-coupled assay.0.07 ± 0.03v0 (s)-1bSingle turnover measurement with mant-ATP.0.11 ± 0.01kcat (s)-1cMaximum rate of actin-activated ATPase measured with the NADH-coupled assay.

The ADP concentration was determined to be less than 10% of the total nucleotide concentration. Fig. 2B demonstrates the fraction of MIII bound to actin as a function of actin concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2044067797,"Brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion that precede sustained ischemia lead to a reduction in myocardial infarct size. This phenomenon, known as ischemic preconditioning, is mediated by signaling pathway(s) that are yet to be fully defined. 3'-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) has been implicated in numerous cellular processes. However, the involvement of PDK1 in preconditioning has yet to be elucidated. Studying PDK1 is not as straightforward as it is for the majority of kinases, due to the lack of a specific inhibitor of PDK1. Therefore, we have taken advantage of PDK1 hypomorphic mutant mice with reduced expression of PDK1 to study the role of PDK1 in preconditioning. Whole heart and single cell models of preconditioning demonstrated that the hearts and cardiac cells from PDK1 hypomorphic mice could not be preconditioned. The cardioprotective effect of PDK1 was not related to the effect that preconditioning has on sarcolemmal membrane action potential as revealed by di-8-ANEPPS, a sarcolemmal-potential sensitive dye, and laser confocal microscopy. In contrast, experiments with JC-1, a mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye, has demonstrated that intact PDK1 levels were required for preconditioning-mediated regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blotting combined with functional experiments have shown that intact PDK1 levels were required for preconditioning-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), and cardioprotection. We conclude that PDK1 mediates preconditioning in the heart by regulating activating PKB-GSK-3beta to regulate mitochondrial but not sarcolemmal membrane potential. 3'Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is essential for ischemic preconditioning of the myocardium."
https://openalex.org/W2026045809,"In insulin-secreting β-cells, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH-kinase with resulting formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) has been implicated in the regulation of ion channels, insulin secretion, and gene transcription as well as in cell growth and survival, but the kinetics of PIP3 signals following physiological stimulation of insulin secretion is unknown. Using evanescent wave microscopy and a green fluorescent protein-tagged PIP3-binding protein domain for real-time monitoring of plasma membrane PIP3 concentration in single MIN6 β-cells, we now demonstrate that glucose stimulation of insulin secretion results in pronounced PIP3 oscillations via autocrine stimulation of insulin receptors. Glucose lacked effect when insulin secretion was prevented with the hyperpolarizing agent diazoxide, but the sugar dose dependently enhanced the PIP3 response to maximal insulin stimulation without affecting the rate of PIP3 degradation. We conclude that glucose is an important co-activator of phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH-kinase and that the plasma membrane PIP3 concentration in β-cells undergoes oscillations due to pulsatile release of insulin.

We conclude that glucose is an important co-activator of phosphatidylinositol-3′-OH-kinase and that the plasma membrane PIP3 concentration in β-cells undergoes oscillations due to pulsatile release of insulin. Insulin is secreted from pancreatic β-cells in response to an elevation of the plasma glucose concentration. The rapid uptake and metabolism of the sugar leads to an increase of the ATP/ADP ratio and closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma membrane. The resulting depolarization activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, which triggers exocytosis of the insulin secretory granules (1Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Because some of the discordant observations may depend on different times allowed for insulin action, it is important to characterize the kinetics of insulin receptor-induced signaling events. Binding of insulin to its receptor is associated with receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and other adapter molecules (13Rothenberg P.L.

Glucose is known to activate PI3-kinase in β-cells, an effect that has been attributed to autocrine activation of insulin receptors by secreted insulin (13Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Velloso L.A. Carneiro E.M. Crepaldi S.C. Boschero A.C. Saad M.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the kinetics of this process, and it is unknown whether the pulsatile pattern of insulin release is reflected in the time course of PI3-kinase activation. In the present study, we used a PIP3-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain tagged with GFP in combination with evanescent wave microscopy for real-time monitoring of the plasma membrane PIP3 concentration in individual MIN6 β-cells. It is demonstrated that glucose directly potentiates PI3-kinase activity in the presence of insulin and that this synergism, together with pulsatile release of insulin, results in pronounced oscillations of the plasma membrane PIP3 concentration in glucose-stimulated β-cells. Materials—The PH domain from protein kinase B/Akt fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP-PHAkt) was used as a translocation biosensor for membrane PIP3 concentration (21Tengholm A. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1871-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This PH domain has a well documented binding preference for PIP3 and phophatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI3,4P2) over other phosphoinositides and inositolpolyphosphates (22Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and it was verified that receptor-induced changes in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate did not induce GFP-PHAkt translocation. To confirm that the GFP-PHAkt responses reflected changes of PIP3 rather than PI3,4P2, experiments were also performed with GFP-tagged GRP1 (general receptor for phosphoinositides-isoform 1), the PH domain of which only binds PIP3 (22Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Because of its strong nuclear localization, however, GRP1-GFP was used only in the experiments shown in Fig. 5B. The plasmids encoding the biosensor constructs as well as GFP targeted to the membrane via covalent lipid modification (GFP-CAAX) was generously provided by Professor Tobias Meyer, Stanford University. Diazoxide was a kind gift from Schering-Plough Int. (Kenilworth, NJ). Adrenaline, insulin, and LY294002 were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Lipofectamine 2000 were obtained from Invitrogen, and Fura Red was provided by Molecular Probes Invitrogen (Portland, OR). Cell Culture and Transfection—MIN6 cells (passage 17–30) (23Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4500 mg/liter glucose and supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a5%CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated 25-mm glass coverslips to achieve 50% confluency on the day of transfection. Transient transfection was performed with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 in a ratio of 1:2.5 in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium during 4 h followed by repeated washing and further culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12–24 h. Prior to experiments, the cells were transferred to a buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.28 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. In experiments with [Ca2+]i measurements, the cells were preincubated in the presence of 10 μm acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura Red. Fluorescence Microscopy—The subcellular localization of GFP-PHAkt was analyzed using a confocal system (Yokogawa CSU-10 spinning disk scanhead; Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland) attached to a Diaphot 200 microscope (Nikon, Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a 60× 1.40-NA objective. The 488-nm beam from an argon ion laser (Melles-Griot, Didam, The Netherlands) was coupled to the scanhead through an optical fiber (Point-Source, Southampton, UK). Fluorescence was detected at 520/35 nm using an Orca-AG camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) under MetaFluor software control (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). The plasma membrane concentration of GFP-PHAkt was recorded with an evanescent wave microscopy setup built around an Eclipse TE2000 microscope (Nikon) with a 60× 1.45-NA objective as previously described (24Thore S. Dyachok O. Tengholm A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19396-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Selection of excitation and emission wavelengths was made with the following filters (center wavelength/half-bandwidth nm): GFP exc 488/10 nm, em 525/25 nm; Fura Red exc 488/10 nm and em 630 nm long pass. The fluorescence was registered by an Orca-ER camera (Hamamatsu) under MetaFluor software control (Molecular Devices). If not otherwise stated, images were acquired by 50–100-ms exposure every 5 s. To avoid the potentially harmful laser light, the beam was blocked by an electronic shutter (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) between image captures. Measurements of Insulin Secretion—MIN6 cells were seeded into 24-well plates and grown to ∼70% confluency. Before measurements of insulin secretion the cells were preincubated for 90 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate Hepes (KRBH) buffer (130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm NaHCO3) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 3 mm glucose and with pH adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH. Insulin secretion was then determined by further incubation for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in KRBH buffer supplemented with various combinations of secretagogues and test substances. Insulin concentrations in the medium were determined using a mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Total DNA was extracted from the cells and the concentration determined by spectrophotometry. Insulin release was normalized for total cellular DNA content and expressed in relation to the secretion obtained with 3 mm glucose. Data and Statistical Analysis—Image analysis was performed using MetaFluor, MetaMorph (Universal Imaging), and ImageJ (W. S. Rasband, National Institutes of Health) software. Fluorescence intensities are expressed as changes relative to initial fluorescence after subtraction of background (ΔF/F0). The Fura Red traces have been inverted to show increases of [Ca2+]i as upward deflections. The SigmaStat software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for regression analysis and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., San José, CA) software for curve fitting and illustrations. All data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Differences were statistically evaluated by two-tailed Student's t test. Insulin Stimulates Dose-dependent PIP3 Formation in Insulin-secreting MIN6 β-Cells via Activation of PI3-Kinase—Confocal microscopy imaging of GFP-PHAkt-expressing MIN6 β-cells maintained in basal medium containing 3 mm glucose demonstrated that the fluorescence was homogenously distributed in the cytoplasm with a slight enrichment in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of the cells with 100 nm insulin resulted in a pronounced translocation of the biosensor to the plasma membrane accompanied by a reduction of fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm. To selectively image plasma membrane fluorescence we applied evanescent wave microscopy, which provides excitation restricted to a volume within ∼100 nm of the plasma membrane. With this technique the insulin-induced GFP-PHAkt translocation is detected as an increase of fluorescence throughout the membrane adhering to the coverslip (Fig. 1B). The membrane fluorescence increased by 30 ± 3% with half-maximal translocation at 45 ± 5 s (n = 43). After removal of the stimulus the fluorescence returned to base line with t½ = 90 ± 7 s (n = 23; Fig. 1B). Consistent with the GFP-PHAkt translocation reflecting PI3-kinase-mediated formation of PIP3, there was no response when insulin was added in the presence of 100 μm PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 but pronounced GFP-PHAkt translocation when the inhibitor was removed (Fig. 1C). The insulin-induced GFP-PHAkt translocation was dose dependent with half-maximal and maximal effects obtained at 454 pm and ∼10 nm insulin, respectively (Fig. 1D). No further effect was observed with insulin concentrations as high as 10 μm (data not shown). Insulin failed to alter the fluorescence recorded from cells expressing GFP alone in the cytoplasm (n = 9, data not shown) or targeted to the plasma membrane (n = 11, Fig. 1D), providing further support for the specificity of the GFP-PHAkt response. Together, these data demonstrate that MIN6 cells respond to insulin with dose-dependent activation of PI3-kinase and formation of PIP3 in the plasma membrane. PIP3 Formation Triggered by Endogenous Insulin Secretion in MIN6 β-Cells—It was next tested whether stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion resulted in activation of PI3-kinase. MIN6 cells expressing GFP-PHAkt and loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura Red were stimulated by raising the extracellular KCl concentration to 30 mm. The resulting depolarization triggered an almost instantaneous rise of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) due to influx of the ion through voltage-dependent channels (Fig. 2A), followed by a pronounced increase of GFP-PHAkt fluorescence. The time course of the GFP-PHAkt translocation was biphasic with an initial peak reaching 28 ± 3% above base line (t½ = 27 ± 2 s, n = 21), followed within 2 min by a sustained plateau 20 ± 2% above the initial intensity (n = 13; Fig. 2A). Both [Ca2+]i and GFP-PHAkt fluorescence returned to the prestimulatory levels after normalization of the KCl concentration (t½ = 47 ± 5 s for GFP-PHAkt, n = 8). There was no effect of KCl depolarization in control cells expressing cytoplasmic (n = 9) or membrane-targeted GFP (n = 7; data not shown). When GFP-PHAkt-expressing cells were depolarized with 30 mm KCl in a Ca2+-deficient medium containing 2 mm EGTA, there was neither rise of [Ca2+]i nor translocation of GFP-PHAkt (Fig. 2B). However, reintroduction of 1.3 mm Ca2+ immediately induced elevation of [Ca2+]i and GFP-PHAkt translocation (peak 28 ± 5%; plateau 18 ± 4%, n = 9), supporting the conclusion that Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of insulin secretory granules results in pronounced autocrine activation of PI3-kinase. The lack of GFP-PHAkt response in cells stimulated in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2+ was not due to an inhibition of the GFP-PHAkt translocation per se, because the cells readily responded to 100 nm exogenous insulin (18 ± 2%, n = 14; Fig. 2C). The secretory responses of the cells were verified by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of insulin release. Elevation of KCl to 30 mm induced an ∼3.5-fold stimulation of insulin secretion, which was abolished (n = 3; p < 0.001) by removal of Ca2+ from the external medium (Fig. 2G). Adrenaline Inhibits the Insulin Response Independent of [Ca2+]i—To verify that the depolarization-induced PIP3 formation was due to secreted insulin and not a direct effect of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, we stimulated the cells with 30 mm KCl in the presence of 10 μm adrenaline, a known inhibitor of insulin secretion (25Renström E. Ding W.G. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Neuron. 1996; 17: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Addition of 10 μm adrenaline caused a small (6 ± 1%, n = 17) increase of plasma membrane GFP-PHAkt fluorescence, which probably did not reflect activation of PI3-kinase, as a similar increase was observed with membrane-targeted GFP (data not shown). The presence of adrenaline prevented the KCl-induced translocation of GFP-PHAkt (Fig. 2, D and E). In contrast, adrenaline had no effect on the depolarization-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. Thus, KCl induced a 20 ± 1% (n = 6) change in Fura Red fluorescence compared with 19 ± 3% (n = 6) in the absence of adrenaline (Fig. 2, D and F). Moreover, adrenaline did not prevent the GFP-PHAkt response to 100 nm exogenous insulin (22 ± 2% fluorescence increase, n = 13, Fig. 2E). Conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements of insulin secretion verified that 10 μm adrenaline completely inhibited KCl-stimulated insulin release without effect on basal secretion (Fig. 2G). These data support the conclusion that the depolarization- and Ca2+-induced PIP3 formation in insulin-secreting cells is due to secreted insulin. Glucose Stimulates PIP3 Formation in Insulin-secreting Cells—It was next determined how the plasma membrane PIP3 concentration was affected by glucose. Elevation of the glucose concentration from 3 to 20 mm resulted in an initial lowering of [Ca2+]i, known to reflect fueling of β-cell Ca2+-ATPases responsible for sequestration of the ion into the endoplasmic reticulum (26Gylfe E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5044-5048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed after 2–3 min by a pronounced increase reflecting voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx. The rise of [Ca2+]i was followed after 23 ± 2 s (n = 18) by a pronounced increase of plasma membrane GFP-PHAkt fluorescence (Fig. 3A). The glucose-induced GFP-PHAkt translocation was biphasic with an initial peak reaching 48 ± 3% (n = 59) above base line, followed by a sustained increase at 31 ± 2% (n = 35) above initial fluorescence (Fig. 3A). After lowering of the glucose concentration to 3 mm the GFP-PHAkt fluorescence returned to base line with t½ = 102 ± 12 s (n = 18). Synergistic Effect of Glucose and Insulin on PIP3 Formation—We also examined whether the glucose-induced formation of PIP3 was entirely due to secreted insulin or whether glucose had an independent stimulatory effect. To this end MIN6 cells were stimulated with glucose in the presence of 250 μm of the hyperpolarizing agent diazoxide, which prevents elevation of [Ca2+]i by clamping the β-cell membrane potential close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Elevation of the glucose concentration to 20 mm resulted in a small rise of GFP-PHAkt (Fig. 3B) with a magnitude equal to that seen in control cells expressing membrane-targeted GFP (7 ± 1%, n = 14). Removal of diazoxide resulted in additional (38 ± 4%, n = 40) increase of GFP-PHAkt fluorescence (Fig. 3B), not seen with membrane-GFP. The effects of glucose and diazoxide on plasma membrane PIP3 concentration correlated well with their effects on insulin release (Fig. 3C). These experiments indicate that glucose has little effect on PIP3 formation in the absence of secreted insulin. To test whether glucose affected insulin-induced GFP-PHAkt translocation, MIN6 cells were stimulated with a maximally activating concentration of insulin (100 nm) in the presence of 250 μm diazoxide. This resulted in a 32 ± 1% (n = 44) increase of GFP-PHAkt fluorescence (Fig. 4, A and B). Under these conditions the response to exogenous insulin is saturated and diazoxide should prevent depolarization and endogenous release of insulin. Nevertheless, elevation of the glucose concentration from 3 to 20 mm induced a rapid and sustained increase in GFP-PHAkt fluorescence reaching 70 ± 6% (n = 48) above the level observed with insulin alone (p < 0.001; Fig. 4, A and B). Under the same conditions, glucose had no effect on the fluorescence from membrane-targeted GFP (Fig. 4C). The amplifying effect of glucose showed a hyperbolic concentration dependence with half-maximal enhancement at 16 mm of the sugar (Fig. 4D). At 8 mm glucose there was a delay between increase of the sugar concentration and the rise of GFP-PHAkt fluorescence of approximately 1 min (Fig. 4E), but this lag decreased exponentially with increasing glucose concentration, being only 10 s at 30 mm of the sugar (Fig. 4E). The amplifying effect of glucose on PIP3 formation was not associated with a change of [Ca2+]i (data not shown) and could not be reproduced by the cAMP-elevating phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (not shown). Moreover, the rate of PIP3 degradation after inhibition of PI3-kinase with 100 μm LY294002 was unaffected by glucose (t½ = 42 ± 4 s, n = 15 at 3 mm versus 40 ± 5 s, n = 18 at 20 mm, Fig. 4F), indicating that glucose acts synergistically with insulin to accelerate PI3-kinase-dependent PIP3 formation. Glucose-induced Oscillations of PIP3—When the MIN6 cells were exposed to elevated glucose concentrations during extended periods of time (>10 min), it became apparent that the initial peak of GFP-PHAkt translocation was followed by oscillations from an elevated level (Fig. 5A) with amplitudes and frequencies averaging 20 ± 1% change of membrane fluorescence and 0.224 ± 0.015 min–1 (n = 69), respectively. A similar response pattern was seen with GRP1-GFP as PIP3 biosensor (Fig. 5B). Simultaneous recording of [Ca2+]i and GFP-PHAkt demonstrated that each rise of PIP3 was preceded by an increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5C). Occasionally, rapid transients of [Ca2+]i were observed in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations, and these were also associated with transient increases of GFP-PHAkt fluorescence (Fig. 5D). More consistent rapid oscillations of both [Ca2+]i and GFP-PHAkt were observed after stimulation of the cells with 20 mm of the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium+ (Fig. 5E). The delay observed between the peak of [Ca2+]i and that of GFP-PHAkt translocation (20 ± 2 s, n = 18) reflects, at least in part, the time required for insulin receptor signal transduction. The lag between application of insulin and the first detectable GFP-PHAkt translocation averaged 14 ± 2 s (n = 34) (Fig. 5F). These data show that glucose stimulation of β-cells is associated with oscillations of PIP3 in the plasma membrane. Two important conclusions can be inferred from the present data. First, the autocrine activation of insulin receptors in β-cells with PI3-kinase-dependent formation of PIP3 is markedly amplified by glucose. Direct control of PI3-kinase by a nutrient stimulus constitutes a novel regulatory principle for this ubiquitous signaling enzyme. The synergism between glucose and insulin enables PI3-kinase to serve as a coincidence detector, which adds a layer of complexity to the regulation of β-cell function by nutrients and receptor agonists. Second, our study provides the first demonstration that the plasma membrane PIP3 concentration can undergo oscillations in response to physiological cell stimulation. The PIP3 oscillations reflect pulsatile release of insulin from individual β-cells combined with the glucose-induced amplification of PI3-kinase activity and rely on a short half-life of the lipid messenger. Oscillations should expand the information content of the PIP3 signal and contribute to the specificity and diversity of signaling downstream of PI3-kinase. In particular, the PIP3 oscillations may partake in the generation of oscillatory electrical activity and pulsatile insulin release. Glucose and Insulin Synergistically Activate PI3-Kinase—Insulin receptors were first demonstrated in β-cells in the early 1980s (27Verspohl E.J. Ammon H.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1980; 65: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Patel Y.C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Science. 1982; 217: 1155-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Glucose-induced insulin secretion was later shown to activate insulin receptors as well as the downstream signaling proteins IRS-1 and PI3-kinase (13Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Velloso L.A. Carneiro E.M. Crepaldi S.C. Boschero A.C. Saad M.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with PI3-kinase being activated via secreted insulin, knock down of insulin receptors with small interfering RNA prevented glucose activation of PI3-kinase (3Da Silva Xavier G. Qian Q. Cullen P.J. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that glucose has a direct effect on PI3-kinase activity in the presence of insulin. Although insulin stimulation alone resulted in pronounced activation of the enzyme, PIP3 formation was markedly enhanced after elevation of the glucose concentration. The larger effect by glucose cannot be explained by the insulin receptors being exposed to higher concentrations of the ligand, because the sugar also amplified the response to maximally activating concentrations of exogenous insulin and when insulin secretion was prevented with the ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener diazoxide. The effect of glucose is apparently due to accelerated PIP3 production, because the sugar was without significant effect on PIP3 degradation. Glucose stimulation of PI3-kinase activity required that the enzyme was already activated, because there was no significant stimulation of PIP3 formation in the absence of exogenous insulin under conditions when endogenous secretion was prevented with diazoxide. Earlier studies have demonstrated that glucose is necessary for insulin-like growth factor I-mediated β-cell growth (29Hugl S.R. White M.F. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17771-17779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), although it is not excluded that the amplifying effect of glucose was mediated via glucose-induced insulin secretion. Control of PI3-kinase activity by glucose may be an important regulatory mechanism, particularly in the β-cells. With the high sensitivity of β-cells to insulin, the concentration of insulin reached even at low glucose concentrations in the narrow intercellular space within the islet should result in significant constitutive PI3-kinase activity. Glucose regulation of PI3-kinase would thus extend the dynamic range of enzyme activity beyond that achieved by receptor stimulation alone. A similar mechanism may be important for enhancing the response to growth factors and other PI3-kinase activators selectively under glucose-stimulated conditions. Further studies are warranted to clarify the mechanisms underlying direct glucose activation of PI3-kinase. It is possible that ATP generated by glucose metabolism directly stimulates PI3-kinase activity. Another possibility is that glucose-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (30Sakai K. Matsumoto K. Nishikawa T. Suefuji M. Nakamaru K. Hirashima Y. Kawashima J. Shirotani T. Ichinose K. Brownlee M. Araki E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) leads to PI3-kinase activation via receptor tyrosine kinases (31Esposito F. Chirico G. Montesano Gesualdi N. Posadas I. Ammendola R. Russo T. Cirino G. Cimino F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20828-20834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). Glucose-induced PIP3 Oscillations—The glucose-induced oscillations of PIP3 concentration in the plasma membrane are probably the result of pulsatile insulin release combined with glucose amplification of PI3-kinase activity and the observed short half-life (∼40 s) of the lipid in the membrane. Insulin released from the pancreas (33Pørksen N. Munn S. Steers J. Vore S. Veldhuis J. Butler P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E478-E488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from individual islets is pulsatile (2Gylfe E. Ahmed M. Bergsten P. Dansk H. Dyachok O. Eberhardson M. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Lin J.M. Sundsten T. Tengholm A. Vieira E. Westerlund J. Upsala J. Med. Sci. 2000; 105: 35-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of [Ca2+]i (34Dryselius S. Grapengiesser E. Hellman B. Gylfe E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E512-E518PubMed Google Scholar) and of Zn2+ co-released from the insulin secretory granules (35Qian W.J. Peters J.L. Dahlgren G.M. Gee K.R. Kennedy R.T. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 922-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that isolated β-cells also show pulsatile secretory activity. The present observations provide further evidence that insulin is released in pulses from individual cells. Pulsatile insulin secretion is considered important to prevent desensitization or down-regulation of the receptors in the target tissues (36Goodner C.J. Sweet I.R. Harrison Jr., H.C. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1316-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and deterioration of the regular plasma insulin oscillations is observed in patients with type-2 diabetes (37Lang D.A. Matthews D.R. Burnett M. Turner R.C. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) as well as in their close relatives (38O'Rahilly S. Turner R.C. Matthews D.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The significance of the PIP3 oscillations is unclear. However, the lipid is a putative mediator of PI3-kinase activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (10Khan F.A. Goforth P.B. Zhang M. Satin L.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Vanoye C.G. Tang L. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2726-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Oscillations of PIP3 may therefore not only be a consequence of pulsatile insulin secretion but via feedback effects on glucose-induced oscillations of the membrane potential and [Ca2+]i also take part in the generation of pulsatile hormone release (10Khan F.A. Goforth P.B. Zhang M. Satin L.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The time course of PIP3 oscillations with the rise of PIP3 coinciding with decrease of [Ca2+]i is consistent with PIP3 being involved in such a regulatory circuit. It is well established that different time courses of messenger signals, including PIP3, may induce different downstream cellular responses. For example, in adipose cells the efficiency of insulin and platelet-derived growth factor to induce membrane insertion of the GLUT4 glucose transporter depends on the amplitude and duration of the PIP3 signals induced by the different receptors (21Tengholm A. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1871-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Oscillatory signaling has not previously been described for PIP3 but is well established for Ca2+ and cAMP. Recent observations in our laboratory have shown that cAMP oscillations restrict the activity of protein kinase A to the cytoplasm (39Dyachok O. Isakov Y. Sågetorp J. Tengholm A. Nature. 2006; 439: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate that the frequency and amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations affect the specificity and efficiency of gene transcription (40Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). Future studies will clarify whether PIP3 oscillations contribute to selective activation of downstream processes in an analogous manner. In conclusion, the present study provides new insights into the signaling downstream of the insulin receptor. Glucose is identified as an important co-activator of PI3-kinase, and glucose-induced insulin secretion is found to be associated with PIP3 oscillations in individual insulin-secreting cells. Dysregulation of the delicate balance between PIP3 production and degradation may contribute to the disturbed insulin secretory pattern in type-2 diabetes."

Despite their importance as molecular gateways for the recognition and uptake of several frontline purine-related drugs, NAT/NCS2 members have not been studied systematically at the molecular level, and high resolution structures or mechanistic models are missing. More than 500 sequence entries are known, but few are functionally characterized in detail. The first NAT to be sequenced and most extensively studied thus far is UapA, a high affinity uric acid/xanthine:H+ symporter from the ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans (4Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A. nidulans genome encodes two well characterized NAT proteins, UapA and UapC, which are uric acid-xanthine (purine) transporters, with similar but distinct kinetic and physiological characteristics.

This conserved sequence region is located between putative transmembrane helices (TMHs) 8 and 9 and immediately downstream of a putative α-helical amphipathic region of ambiguous topology. It includes the consensus sequence (Q/E/P)NXGXXXXT(R/K/G) that was designated as the NAT signature motif (5Diallinas G. Valdez J. Sophianopoulou V. Rosa A. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3827-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Further molecular genetic and biochemical evidence led the authors to propose that at least one residue of the NAT motif, Gln-408, is implicated in binding with the imidazole ring of purines (8Koukaki M.

In addition, based on second-site suppressor and mutational analysis, a residue at the middle of putative TMH12 (Phe-528) was proposed to act as a substrate-selectivity filter to determine stringency of the purine translocation pathway (7Amillis S.

Recently, we have cloned and characterized the first purine-specific members of the NAT/NCS2 family from a Gram-negative bacterium, namely YgfO and YicE of Escherichia coli K-12 (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both proteins were shown to function as specific, high affinity xanthine:H+ symporters that cannot use uric acid, hypoxanthine, uracil, or other nucleobases as a substrate and cannot recognize analogues substituted at positions 7 or 8 of the imidazole ring (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Goudela S. Karatza P. Koukaki M. Frillingos S. Diallinas G. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have shown that YgfO in particular can be expressed at high levels in the inner membrane of E. coli K-12 under control of a plasmid-borne, IPTG-inducible promoter system (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). YgfO can also be tagged at its C terminus with a number of different immunodetection and affinity-purification epitopes without affecting the xanthine uptake activity (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because analytical evidence on the topology, tertiary structure, binding site, or mechanism of the nucleobase:cation symport is still missing for any NAT, we have taken advantage of the E. coli system to employ Cys-scanning mutagenesis, a strategy that has addressed these problems in many other transport proteins (12Frillingos S.

A fully functional version, equivalent to wild-type YgfO, has been constructed, in which all five native Cys residues have been replaced with Ser (Cys-less YgfO). 3P. Karatza, E. Georgopoulou, and S. Frillingos, manuscript in preparation. 3P. Karatza, E. Georgopoulou, and S. Frillingos, manuscript in preparation. On the basis of the Cys-less background, we have initiated an ongoing, systematic series of Cys-scanning and site-directed mutagenesis studies to elucidate structure-function relationships in a bacterial NAT. One of the first issues to be addressed is to analyze the NAT-signature motif and define whether it contains side chain determinants that consent and/or differentiate between a bacterial and a fungal homolog (Fig. 1). In this vein, we have performed a systematic Cys-scanning and site-directed mutagenesis study of sequence 315–340 that includes the NAT-signature motif (residues 324–333) and flanking regions of the transporter. Our combined biochemical evidence from transport, immunoblotting, sulfhydryl alkylation, and ligand-inhibition assays of a set of 50 site-directed permease mutants has led to an initial model of the secondary structure and topology in this region and indicated few residues that are critical for the operation of a functional YgfO transporter. The significance of our findings with respect to comparison with the major fungal NAT homolog (UapA) is discussed. Materials—[8-3H]Xanthine (27.6 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. Nonradioactive nucleobases and analogues were from Sigma. Oregon green 488 maleimide (OGM) was from Molecular Probes. Pro-Bond resin was from Invitrogen. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized from BioSpring GmbH. High fidelity Taq polymerase (Expand High Fidelity PCR system) was from Roche Applied Science.

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated penta-His antibody was from Qiagen, and polyclonal anti-OGM antibody was from Molecular Probes. Avidin-HRP and protein A-HRP conjugates were from Amersham Biosciences. All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli K-12 was transformed according to Inoue (19Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene. 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). TOP10F′ (Invitrogen) was used for initial propagation of recombinant plasmids. T184 (20Teather R.M. Bramhill J. Riede I. Wright J.K. Furst M. Aichele G. Wilhelm V. Overath P. Eur. J.

Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with given replacements was used for IPTG-inducible expression from the lacZ promoter/operator (p/o). DNA Manipulations—Construction of expression plasmids and BAD-tagged versions of YgfO containing a C-terminal tail with the biotin-acceptor (BAD) domain of Klebsiella pneumoniae oxaloacetate decarboxylase and the C-terminal 12 peptides of E. coli LacY has been described (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For construction of His10-tagged versions, the coding sequence of ygfO was PCR-amplified from pT7-5/ygfO using antisense primers with non-annealing 5′ overhangs containing an ApaI site and transferred in pT7-5/lacY(C154G)-His10 (21Smirnova I. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3025-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by BamHI-ApaI restriction fragment replacement; the resulting constructs contain the C-terminal 12 peptides of E. coli LacY followed in-frame by 10 His residues and a stop codon. For construction of Cys-less YgfO, the five native-Cys codons were replaced simultaneously with Ser codons using two-stage (multiple overlap/extension) PCR on the template of wild-type YgfO tagged at C terminus with the BAD tag. Details of this procedure will be published separately.3 Cys-less YgfO was also transferred to the His10-tagged background by BamHI-HpaI restriction fragment replacement. For construction of Cys replacement mutants, two-stage (overlap/extension) PCR (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) was performed on the template of Cys-less YgfO tagged at the C terminus with either BAD or His10 as indicated. The entire coding sequence of all engineered constructs was verified by double-strand DNA sequencing in an automated DNA sequencer (MWG-Biotech). Growth of Bacteria—E. coli, harboring given plasmids, was grown aerobically at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing streptomycin (0.01 mg/ml) and ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). Fully grown cultures were diluted 10-fold, allowed to grow to mid-logarithmic phase, induced with IPTG (0.5 mm) for an addition a l2 h at 37 °C, harvested, and washed with the appropriate buffers. Transport Assays and Kinetic Analysis—E. coli T184 were assayed for active transport of [3H]xanthine (1 μm) by rapid filtration at both 25 °C and 37 °C as described (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For assaying the effect of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), T184 cells were preincubated with NEM at the indicated conditions, reactions were stopped by the addition of a 20-fold excess of dithiothreitol, and transport assays were performed in the presence of phenazine methosulfate (0.2 mm), and potassium ascorbate (20 mm) (23Frillingos S. Sahin-Tóth M. Persson B. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8074-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For ligand competition experiments, uptake of [3H]xanthine (1 μm) was first assayed in the absence or presence of unlabeled analogues (1 mm) that had been pre-equilibrated in the assay mixture for 5 min. For kinetic analysis, putative inhibitors were used in the concentration range of 0.1 μm to 1.5 mm, and data were fitted to the appropriate equations using Prism4. IC50 values were determined from full dose-response curves with a minimum of eight points spread over the relevant range. In all cases the Hill coefficient was close to –1, consistent with presence of one binding site. In addition, we have examined the effect of two analogues (1-methyl and 8-methylxanthine) on Km and Vmax for wild-type and selected mutants and showed that Vmax remains unaltered, consistent with competitive inhibition (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S2). This evidence suggests that a simple model of competition with the binding site of the transporter is applicable, satisfying the criteria for use of the Cheng and Prusoff equation Ki = IC50/(1 + (L/Km)) (where L is the permeant concentration, and Km is the value obtained for this permeant) (11Goudela S. Karatza P. Koukaki M. Frillingos S. Diallinas G. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the Ki value is an affinity constant implying binding to the transporter but does not indicate whether the ligand is being transported across the membrane. Immunoblot Analysis—Membrane fractions of E. coli T184 harboring given plasmids were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) as described (10Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-PVDF; Pall Corp.). YgfO-BAD was probed with avidin-HRP or with a polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of E. coli LacY (24Carrasco N. Herzlinger D. Mitchell R. DeChiara S. Danho W. Gabriel T.F. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4672-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) followed by protein A-HRP. YgfO-His10 was probed with penta-His antibody-HRP. Signals were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Sulfhydryl Alkylation Assay—E. coli T184 expressing His10-tagged versions of the indicated permeases were harvested, washed twice in Tris-NaCl buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl), normalized to an A420 of 3.0 (0.2 mg of total protein/ml), and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in the absence or presence of NEM (1 mm) followed by washing in Tris-NaCl buffer containing 1 mm Pefabloc (Sigma), preparation of membrane fractions, resuspension in Tris-NaCl buffer (100 μl), and extraction of the membrane proteins with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (0.8% w/v) for 15 min at room temperature. The protein extract was then diluted to 400 μl and mixed with Ni2+-IDA beads (ProBond resin) (50 μl) that had been pre-equilibrated in Tris-NaCl buffer containing 0.08% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and 30 mm imidazole and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. After incubation, the beads were washed with 40 volumes of denaturation buffer (Tris-NaCl buffer containing 6 m urea and 0.5%, w/v, SDS), resuspended in 0.1 ml of the same buffer containing OGM (0.2 mm), and incubated for 20 min with rotation at room temperature. The OGM reaction was stopped with the addition of dithiothreitol (5 mm), and the Ni2+-IDA beads were pelleted and resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 0.07 m Na2EDTA at 30 °C for 10 min before SDS-PAGE (12%) and immunoblotting. Protein concentrations were determined with the micro-BCA method (Pierce). In Silico Analysis—Comparative sequence analysis of NAT/NCS2 homologs was based on BLAST-p search and ClustalW alignment; the most recent genome annotations were used for retrieving sequence data. Analysis of transmembrane topology was performed using program TMHMM (25Granseth E. Daley D.O. Rapp M. Melen K. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Active Xanthine Transport—Using a functional YgfO devoid of Cys residues (C-less), each amino acid residue in sequence 315GSIPITTFAQNNGVIQMTGVASRYVG340 including the NAT motif (in underlined boldface) was replaced individually with Cys. After verification of the sequence, each single-Cys mutant was transformed into E. coli T184 and assayed for its ability to catalyze active xanthine transport. As shown in Fig. 2A, of the 26 single-Cys mutants, 10 transport xanthine at rates that are between 75 and 100% or more of C-less permease, and an additional 5 mutants transport at rates that are between 40 and 60% of C-less. Five mutants (L317C, T320C, T321C, I329C, and T332C) display low but significant uptake rates (10–25% of C-less). Finally, mutants P318C, F322C, Q324C, N325C, N326C, and G340C display rates that approximate cells transformed with vector containing no ygfO insert. Steady state levels of xanthine accumulation also show the same general picture (Fig. 2B); of the 26 single-Cys mutants, 14 accumulate xanthine to >60% of the steady state observed with C-less YgfO, and an additional 2 exhibit levels of 40–50%. Of the remaining 10 mutants, T320C, T321C, I329C, and T332C exhibit low levels of accumulation (10–25% of C-less), F322C, N325C, and N326C accumulate marginally (5–8% of C-less), whereas P318C, Q324C, and G340C are completely inactive. Similar findings were obtained with the single-Cys mutants in either the BAD-tagged or the His10-tagged permease background (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Expression in the Membrane—Immunoblot analysis of BAD-tagged single-Cys permeases shows that negligible activity of mutants P318C and G340C is because of negligible expression in the membrane. All other mutants are expressed to high or moderate levels (Fig. 3). The compromised expression (∼50% of C-less) displayed by mutants L317C, I329C, and T332C reflects their low transport rates (23, 11, and 9% of C-less) that are disproportional to their much higher levels of accumulation (46, 18, and 15% of C-less, respectively) (Fig. 2). Qualitatively similar data were obtained with the set of single-Cys mutants in the His10-tagged permease background (not shown). Expression and Transport Analysis of Mutants in Wild-type Background—From the Cys-scanning transport analysis described above, few positions of inactive or marginally active mutants were delineated. We analyzed these positions further by (a) transferring single-Cys mutations to the wild-type YgfO background and/or (b) engineering the most conservative site-directed replacement mutant to introduce an amino acid other than Cys. Thus, we constructed and assayed mutants (a) F322C(wt), Q324C(wt), N325C(wt), N326C(wt), and G340C(wt) and (b) P318G(wt), Q324N(wt), N325Q(wt), N326Q(wt), and G340A(wt) (Fig. 4). We found that F322C(wt), N326C(wt), and N326Q(wt) were highly active, G340A(wt) accumulated to 50% of wild type, Q324N(wt), N325C(wt), and N325Q(wt) accumulated to very low levels (10–25% of wild type), whereas P318G(wt), Q324C(wt), and G340C(wt) were completely inactive (Fig. 4, B and C). Negligible activity of P318G(wt) or G340C(wt) is corroborated by low or negligible expression in the membrane, and the relatively low activity of G340A(wt) is also linked to low expression; all other mutants of this set express normally (Fig. 4A). Transport Analysis of Site-directed Mutants at Conserved Positions of the NAT Motif—The conserved NAT-motif positions Gln-324, Asn-325, and Thr-332, where mutants with negligible or strikingly low activity had been detected (Figs. 2 and 4) as well as the remaining two positions of conserved NAT-motif residues (Gly-327 and Gly-333) were further subjected to extensive site-directed mutagenesis in the wild-type YgfO background. Site-directed mutants were initially analyzed for active xanthine transport (Fig. 5) and kinetics of xanthine uptake (Table 1). Our data show that replacement of Gln-324 with Asn or Glu results in very low levels of accumulation; kinetic analysis reveals that these mutants transport xanthine with high Vmax but a very low affinity, as reflected by a 15-fold increase in Km relative to wild-type. Replacement of Gln-324 with Pro, Ala, or Cys results in negligible uptake activity in any of the xanthine concentrations tested. Replacement of Asn-325 with Asp, Gln, Ser, Thr, Cys, or Ala was also found to result in negligible xanthine uptake activity in any of the concentrations tested. In contrast, replacement of Gly-327 with Ala, Pro, or Cys resulted in very high xanthine uptake; that is, 200, 150, or 100% relative to wild type, respectively, and a 2–5-fold increase in Vmax with a slightly lower Km. Replacement of Thr-332 with Asn resulted in higher activity than wild type, with a 2-fold lower Km and an 1.6-fold increased Vmax but replacement with Asp, Ala, or Cys yielded low activity (Table 1). Finally, although replacement of Gly-333 with Cys resulted in a transport rate and level that was comparable with the ones of wild-type YgfO, replacement with Arg or Lys resulted in low but significant activity; that is, 40–50% that of wild-type for G333R or 10–20% for G333K. In addition, these mutants display Vmax values that are 2.5- or 5.5-fold lower relative to wild type (Table 1).TABLE 1Km and Vmax values of YgfO mutants for xanthine uptakePermeaseKmVmaxVmax/Kmμmnmol min-1 mg-1 proteinμl min-1 mg-1YgfO(wt)4.6 ± 0.36.4 ± 0.51391YgfO(Cys-less)5.5 ± 0.510.2 ± 0.81854Q324N(wt)76.0 ± 19.144.5 ± 4.7586Q324E(wt)71.2 ± 12.212.6 ± 0.4177N325Q(wt)NDNDN325CNDNDG327A(wt)3.4 ± 0.328.9 ± 6.68500G327P(wt)3.9 ± 0.128.1 ± 4.07205G327C3.2 ± 0.220.1 ± 5.16281T332N(wt)2.2 ± 0.310.5 ± 2.24772T332D(wt)1.7 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.1529T332A(wt)4.8 ± 1.21.9 ± 0.4396T332C3.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1333G333R(wt)2.8 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.2857G333K(wt)5.2 ± 1.21.1 ± 0.1211 Open table in a new tab Ligand Recognition Profiles of Site-directed Mutants at the NAT Motif—To understand the contribution of selected residues of the NAT motif to the substrate and ligand recognition profile of YgfO, we assayed mutants at positions 324, 327, 332, and 333 for inhibition of [3H]xanthine uptake in the presence or absence of a series of purines and synthetic analogues (Table 2). Mutants Q324N(wt) and Q324E(wt) display an impaired ability for recognition of any of the analogues tested, consistent with their very low affinity for xanthine, as revealed from the kinetics experiments (Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, N325Q(wt) or other mutants at position 325 could not be tested because of negligible activity (Table 1). No major differences in ligand profile were evident for mutants G327A(wt) or G327P(wt), whereas significant changes were observed with both T332N(wt) and T332A(wt) (Table 2). T332N(wt), in particular, displays higher affinity (lower Ki) for 2-thioxanthine (>2-fold), 3-methylxanthine (12-fold), and 8-methylxanthine (>7-fold) and lower affinity (higher Ki) for 1-methylxanthine (13-fold) and 6-thioxanthine (3-fold) (Table 3). Strikingly, important but distinct changes in specificity were observed with mutant G333R(wt). Kinetic analysis of the transport inhibition data for this mutant showed a marginally detectable ability for recognizing uric acid, a 3-fold increase in Ki for 6-thioxanthine, and highly significant decreases in Ki for 8-methylxanthine (4-fold), 3-methylxanthine (5-fold), and 7-methylxanthine (>15-fold) (Table 3). In summary, of the five key conserved residues of the NAT motif, 324QNNGVIQMTG333, it appears that Gln-324 is critical for high affinity uptake and ligand recognition, Asn-325 is fully irreplaceable with respect to active xanthine transport, and Gly-327 is not mandatory for either active xanthine transport or specificity, whereas Thr-332 and Gly-333 are important determinants of the ligand specificity profile.TABLE 2Specificity profile of YgfO mutants at conserved residues of the NAT motifCompetitor[3H]xanthine uptake rate retainedwtQ324NQ324EG327AG327PT332NT332AG333R%—100100100100100100100100Xanthine10011212Uric acid971431228287736854Hypoxanthine961259010693858071Adenine969012411310011013278Guanine9497807792687897Uracil101128981049281751011-Methylxanthine19909323335952-Thioxanthine1312311381031103-Methylxanthine25798518282306-Thioxanthine2061501111107-Methylxanthine1056911272896576218-Methylxanthine96707542523330189-Methylxanthine131179267217Allopurinol1061051248399657061Oxypurinol316962894110 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Kinetics and specificity profile of YgfO mutants G333R(wt) and T332N(wt)Unlabeled competitor (1 mm)[3H]xanthine uptake rate retainedYgfO(wt)G333R(wt)T332N(wt)%—100 ± 4100 ± 2100 ± 2Xanthine1 ± 20 ± 12 ± 1Uric acid92 ± 249 ± 273 ± 10Hypoxanthine91 ± 194 ± 285 ± 5Adenine88 ± 2108 ± 8110 ± 6Guanine63 ± 572 ± 568 ± 9Uracil97 ± 372 ± 181 ± 101-Methylxanthine6 ± 16 ± 25 ± 12-Thioxanthine14 ± 116 ± 33 ± 12-Thiouric acid18 ± 29 ± 1ND3-Methylxanthine16 ± 30 ± 12 ± 16-Thioxanthine11 + 116 ± 31 ± 07-Methylxanthine116 ± 218 ± 165 ± 118-Methylxanthine110 ± 813 ± 336 ± 68-Thiouric acid7 ± 29 ± 2ND8-Azaxanthine72 ± 259 ± 6ND9-Methylxanthine6 ± 112 ± 42 ± 1KiμmUric acid>1500737>15001-Methylxanthine36464892-Thioxanthine9180403-Methylxanthine721466-Thioxanthine411211127-Methylxanthine>1500107>15008-Methylxanthine>15004091968-Thiouric acid5757ND9-Methylxanthine535436 Open table in a new tab Effect of N-Ethylmaleimide on Transport Activity—The effect of NEM, a membrane-permeable sulfhydryl reagen"
https://openalex.org/W1991270025,"Orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an atypical member of the nuclear receptor superfamily; SHP regulates the nuclear receptor-mediated transcription of target genes but lacks a conventional DNA binding domain. In this study, we demonstrate that SHP represses transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced gene expression through a direct interaction with Smad, a transducer of TGF-β signaling. Transient transfection studies demonstrate that SHP represses Smad3-induced transcription. <i>In vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> protein interaction assays revealed that SHP directly interacts with Smad2 and Smad3 but not with Smad4. Mapping of domains mediating the interaction between SHP and Smad3 showed that the entire N-terminal domain (1–159 amino acids) of SHP and the linker domain of Smad3 are involved in this interaction. <i>In vitro</i> glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase pulldown competition experiments revealed the SHP-mediated repression of Smad3 transactivation through competition with its co-activator p300. SHP also inhibits the activation of endogenous TGF-β-responsive gene promoters, the p21, Smad7, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoters. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SHP decreases PAI-1 mRNA levels, and down-regulation of SHP by a small interfering RNA increases both the transactivation of Smad3 and the PAI-1 mRNA levels. Finally, the <i>PAI-1</i> gene is expressed in SHP<sup>–/–</sup> mouse hepatocytes at a higher level than in normal hepatocytes. Taken together, these data indicate that SHP is a novel co-regulator of Smad3, and this study provides new insights into regulation of TGF-β signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1989759634,"The phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 activates the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase isoforms SGK1, SGK2, and SGK3 and protein kinase B, which in turn are known to up-regulate a variety of sodium-coupled transporters. The present study was performed to explore the role of PDK1 in amino acid transport. As mice completely lacking functional PDK1 are not viable, mice expressing 10-25% of PDK1 (pdk1(hm)) were compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates (pdk1(wt)). Body weight was significantly less in pdk1(hm) than in pdk1(wt) mice. Despite lower body weight of pdk1(hm) mice, food and water intake were similar in pdk1(hm) and pdk1(wt) mice. According to Ussing chamber experiments, electrogenic transport of phenylalanine, cysteine, glutamine, proline, leucine, and tryptophan was significantly smaller in jejunum of pdk1(hm) mice than in pdk1(wt) mice. Similarly, electrogenic transport of phenylalanine, glutamine, and proline was significantly decreased in isolated perfused proximal tubules of pdk1(hm) mice. The urinary excretion of proline, valine, guanidinoacetate, methionine, phenylalanine, citrulline, glutamine/glutamate, and tryptophan was significantly larger in pdk1(hm) than in pdk1(wt) mice. According to immunoblotting of brush border membrane proteins prepared from kidney, expression of the Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporter B(0)AT1 (SLC6A19), the glutamate transporter EAAC1/EAAT3 (SLC1A1), and the transporter for cationic amino acids and cystine b(0,+)AT (SLC7A9) was decreased but the Na+/proline cotransporter SIT (SLC6A20) was increased in pdk1(hm) mice. In conclusion, reduction of functional PDK1 leads to impairment of intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption of amino acids. The combined intestinal and renal loss of amino acids may contribute to the growth defect of PDK1-deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W1984607094,"Rho family GTPases are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of these proteins can be promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors containing Dbl and Pleckstrin homology domains resulting in membrane insertion of a Rho family member, whereas the inactive GDP-bound form is sequestered primarily in the cytoplasm, bound to the guanosine dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI. Dominant interfering variants of Rac1, but not Cdc42, inhibit β1 integrin-promoted uptake of Yersinia pseudo tuberculosis. Unexpectedly, we found that the Rac1(W56F) guanine nucleotide exchange factors specificity switch mutant blocked invasin-promoted uptake as well as Cdc42-dependent uptake of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments demonstrated that Rac1(W56F) retained the ability to be loaded with GTP, bind a downstream effector, and interact with RhoGDI. Mutational analyses of intragenic suppressors and coexpression studies demonstrated that binding of the Rac1(W56F) mutant to RhoGDI appeared to play a role in the inhibition of uptake. As RhoGDI inhibits RhoA, overactivation of RhoA may account for the uptake interference caused by Rac1(W56F). Consistent with this model, a dominant interfering form of RhoA restored significant uptake in the presence of the Rac1(W56F) mutant but had no effect on another interfering Rac1 form. Furthermore, the cellular GTP-RhoA level was elevated by the presence of Rac1(W56F) mutant protein. These data are consistent with the proposition that Rac1(W56F) blocks invasin-promoted uptake by preventing RhoGDI from inactivating RhoA. We conclude that RhoGDI allows cross-talk between Rho family members that promote potentially antagonistic processes, and disruption of this cross-talk can interfere with invasin-promoted uptake. Rho family GTPases are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of these proteins can be promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors containing Dbl and Pleckstrin homology domains resulting in membrane insertion of a Rho family member, whereas the inactive GDP-bound form is sequestered primarily in the cytoplasm, bound to the guanosine dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI.

These data are consistent with the proposition that Rac1(W56F) blocks invasin-promoted uptake by preventing RhoGDI from inactivating RhoA. We conclude that RhoGDI allows cross-talk between Rho family members that promote potentially antagonistic processes, and disruption of this cross-talk can interfere with invasin-promoted uptake. Successful pathogens often associate with host cells prior to initiating disease. This association results in either adhesion to the extracellular surface of target cells or internalization of the pathogen into the host cell (1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). In the case of the Gram-negative enteropathogenic Yersinia species, disease is initiated by internalization of the bacteria into M cells located on the surface of the patches of the Peyer within the small intestine, eventually leading to microbial growth within lymph nodes in an extracellular locale (2Handley S.A. Newberry R.D. Miller V.L. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 8453-8455Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 3Pepe J.C. Miller V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

APMIS. 1993; 101: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, uptake of the bacterium into cultured cells is the result of binding by the outer membrane protein invasin to multiple host β1 chain integrin receptors (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Isberg R.R. Hamburger Z. Dersch P. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The engagement of integrins by invasin in many ways mimics the binding of natural substrates to this receptor, including the recognition of a site on the integrin that appears to overlap with that recognized by fibronectin (8Van Nhieu G.T. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one distinguishing feature of invasin is that it binds integrins with a unique high affinity, and this characteristic appears key to ensuring successful uptake of the bacterium (8Van Nhieu G.T. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Among the properties shared with other integrin substrates is the ability of invasin to promote localized activation of the small GTPase Rac1 after integrin engagement at the site of bacterial adhesion (10Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PloS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Rac1 belongs to the large family of Rho GTPases that regulates most known actin rearrangements in host cells and includes the members Cdc42 and RhoA (12Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar). As is true of many Rho family members, most of the Rac1 in resting cells is in an inactive state, associated with RhoGDI in a soluble cytoplasmic complex (13Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Upon cell stimulation by either growth factors or adhesion receptor engagement, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; EPEC, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PBD, p21 binding domain; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; EPEC, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PBD, p21 binding domain; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. become activated and associate with the membrane, whereas the Rac1·RhoGDI complex translocates to the plasma membrane and dissociates (14Dransart E. Morin A. Cherfils J. Olofsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4674-4683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The GDI-free Rac1, in turn, assumes the active GTP-bound state, and the membrane-inserted GTPase drives actin rearrangements. Inactivation of Rac1 occurs by GTP hydrolysis stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), returning inactive Rac1 to its cytoplasmic complex with RhoGDI (16Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). It is not well understood how β1 integrin receptor engagement by invasin leads to Rac1 activation or which GEFs transmit signals to Rho family members after integrin clustering. One model posits that receptor engagement leads to a phosphotyrosine signal that in turn may activate GEFs (17DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 18Albert M.L. Kim J.I. Birge R.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 19Obergfell A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In support of this model, proteins involved in phosphotyrosine cascades downstream from integrin engagement, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and CrK-associated substrate, are required for invasin-mediated uptake of bacteria (21Hudson K.J. Bliska J.B. Bouton A.H. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1474-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Alrutz M.A. Isberg R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although a specific GEF that responds to such a cell surface generated signal by invasin has not been identified, the GEF that is functionally important for invasin-promoted uptake is likely to show specificity toward Rac1. The dominant negative Rac1(N17) mutant blocks invasin-mediated bacterial uptake, whereas the dominant negative Cdc42(N17) does not (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24McGee K. Zettl M. Way M. Fallman M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, after Y. pseudotuberculosis adhesion, Cdc42 is not activated as efficiently as a Cdc42 mutant that responds to Rac1-specific GEFs. Therefore, manipulation of Rac1 function appears central to invasin-promoted uptake. Although RhoGDI is normally thought to be an inhibitor of Rho family function by maintaining its binding partners in an inactive state within a cytoplasmic locale, there is potential for it playing a role in positively promoting specific cytoskeletal rearrangements (14Dransart E. Morin A. Cherfils J. Olofsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4674-4683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26DerMardirossian C. Schnelzer A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Regulated GTPase function requires that the Rho family member be recruited to the appropriate site and that activation be limited to this region in the cell. RhoGDI maintains a readily available pool of the GTPase that can respond to such signals rapidly, perhaps shuttling Rho family members directly to this site (25Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some Rho family members can have antagonistic effects on specific cytoskeletal rearrangements, and RhoGDI may dampen the activity of these proteins. For instance, activated RhoA has been demonstrated to inhibit neural cell migration as well as interfere with invasin-promoted bacterial uptake and phagocytosis of charged beads (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Black D.S. Bliska J.B. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49911-49919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In these cases, it is thought that stimulation of actin stress fiber formation by RhoA interferes with localized membrane movement promoted by cytoskeletal rearrangements. The fact that only a subset of Rho family members can play a positive role in promoting specific cytoskeletal events means that upstream signals must discriminate between different GTPases. Much of this discrimination appears to be provided by the RhoGEFs, which activate only a subset of GTPases (15Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Many but not all of these GEFs have Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains (30Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of side chain contacts between one of these Dbl and pleckstrin homology-GEFs, Tiam1, and its target Rac1 protein has identified potential residues important for substrate specificity (31Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a single side chain difference in Cdc42 and Rac1 appears sufficient to confer substrate specificity (32Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

In this report we studied the consequences of a Rac1 specificity switch mutant on integrin-mediated bacterial uptake. Surprisingly, the mutant was shown to be a potent inhibitor of invasin-mediated uptake that behaved very differently from classic Rac1 dominant interfering mutants. The results of this analysis indicate that the activity of RhoA needs to be tightly regulated to prevent it from interfering with invasin-mediated uptake. Cell Culture, DNA Constructs, and Transfections—COS-1 and HeLa cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with low glucose (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Transfection of cell lines was performed using Lipofectamine PLUS or Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocols on coverslips placed in 24-well dishes. DNA for transient transfection was prepared by using the Endofree Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). pCGT-Rac1(WT), pCGT-Rac1(G12V), and pCGT-Rac1(T17N) were kind gifts of Dr. Jim Bliska (The State University of New York (SUNY), Stony Brook, NY). Monomeric fluorescence protein-tagged expression plasmids pmCFP-Rac1 and pmYFP-PBD are described elsewhere (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B.

The mammalian expression vectors that express N-terminal Myc-tagged RhoA and Myc-tagged Cdc42 were provided by Dr. Kit Wong (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and Rac1(6Q) by Ulla Knaus (Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). The vector expressing RhoGDI-mYFP was generated by cloning the open reading frame from the cDNA of the RhoGDIα isoform (Guthrie Research Institute, Sayre, PA) into pmYFP-N1 to obtain pRhoGDI-mYFP. The Rac1(T35L), (Y40C), (W56F), (R66A), (C189S) mutations and the RhoGDI(D185A) mutation were introduced into pCGT-Rac1 or pRhoGDI-mYFP, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

Open table in a new tab Bacterial Strains and Assay for Bacterial Uptake into Cultured Cells—The Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII(P-) strain is cured of the virulence plasmid, lacks the YadA adhesin, and expresses no antiphagocytic proteins (35Gemski P. Lazere J.R. Casey T. Wohlhieter J.A. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 1044-1047PubMed Google Scholar). The enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strain E2348/69 was provided by John Leong (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA) (36Campellone K.G. Robbins D. Leong J.M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII(P-) was grown on LB plates at 26 °C for 48 h. To perform uptake assays, a single colony was inoculated into Luria-Bertani broth and allowed to grow with shaking at 26 °C overnight. Bacteria were then subcultured into fresh medium and grown for ∼3 h until A600 = 0.7, as described (10Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PloS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The EPEC strain was grown as described (37Jepson M.A. Pellegrin S. Peto L. Banbury D.N. Leard A.D. Mellor H. Kenny B. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transfected COS-1 cells adherent to coverslips were typically incubated with Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII(P-) for 20 min at a multiplicity of infection = 50 at 37 °C, whereas transfected HeLa cells were challenged with EPEC for 3 h according to Jepson et al. (37Jepson M.A. Pellegrin S. Peto L. Banbury D.N. Leard A.D. Mellor H. Kenny B. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After the incubation with bacteria, the adherent cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining to visualize epitope-tagged Rac1 or RhoA and to distinguish extracellular or internalized bacteria exactly according to the procedure we described previously (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the monolayers were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and probed with primary antibody directed against either Y. pseudotuberculosis or EPEC followed by a fluorescent secondary antibody (anti-IgG conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 594 or Cascade Blue) to detect extracellular bacteria. The cells were then permeabilized (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and probed with a combination of antibodies directed against the bacteria and Rho family member to allow detection of both intracellular and extracellular bacteria. The coverslips were then probed with appropriate secondary antibodies. Secondary antibodies used to detect the Rho family members were conjugated to either Cascade Blue or Alexa Fluor 488. All secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Analysis of Rac1-RhoGDI Interaction in Single Cells—Localized activation of Rac1 derivatives was determined using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay described previously, measuring the interaction of mCFP-Rac1 with mYFP-PBD (10Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PloS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this assay, a FRET signal occurred when mCFP-Rac1 was loaded with GTP, allowing binding of the fluorescent protein to the p21 binding domain (PBD) moiety. A similar strategy was used to quantitate interaction of RhoGDI with Rac1 in which binding of mCFP-Rac1 to mYFP-RhoGDI was measured by FRET (10Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PloS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The set up of the microscope and the filters used for FRET excitation and emission were identical to those used previously (10Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PloS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure FRET, images from filter sets dedicated for YFP, CFP, and FRET fluors were first captured, and then two random regions of interest, each about 10% of the area of a whole cell located within the cytoplasmic region, were chosen for analysis. FRET from these regions was calculated as sensitized FRET by subtracting the bleed through signal of CFP into the YFP channel and cross-excitation of YFP by the CFP channel, using exactly the same procedure as described previously (10Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PloS Pathog. 2005; 1: 125-136Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Measurement of RhoA Activation—HeLa cells were transfected in 6-well dishes with pCGT-Rac1(WT), pCGT-Rac1(W56F), or mYFP-RhoGDIα(D185A). To determine the quantity of GTP-loaded RhoA 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). Lysates were incubated at 4 °C with agitation for 5 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. 250 μl of cleared lysates were then incubated with 20 μl of Rhotekin-RBD GST beads (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were pelleted in a microfuge, then washed four times (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) by successive centrifugation. Bound Rho proteins and 30 μl of the input lysate were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by densitometry analysis using Kodak Image Station 440CF (Kodak). Rac1(W56F) Variant Having Altered GEF Specificity Does Not Reverse the Effects of Rac1(T17N)—Invasin-promoted uptake of Y. pseudotuberculosis into nonphagocytic cells is dependent on the function of Rac1 and occurs in the absence of Cdc42 signaling, based on the fact that bacterial uptake is inhibited by the dominant negative Rac1(T17N) mutant but not by Cdc42(T17N) (6Alrutz M.A. Srivastava A. Wong K.W. D'Souza-Schorey C. Tang M. Ch'Ng L.E. Snapper S.B. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 689-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Rac1(T17N) mutation is thought to be dominant negative because it forms a tight complex with a GEF specific for Rac1, preventing the GEF from activating endogenous Rac1 protein (Table 1). To test the model that titration of Rac1-specific GEF causes uptake inhibition, whereas titration of a Cdc42-specific GEF has no effect, we analyzed a Rac1 mutation that switches the specificity of GEF recognition to see whether this suppresses the dominant inhibitory properties of Rac1(T17N). The tryptophan side chain at position 56 (Trp-56) in Rac1 confers substrate specificity, allowing preferential recognition of Rac1-specific Dbl-containing GEFs (32Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In turn, the phenylalanine residue at position 56 (Phe-56) in Cdc42 allows recognition of Cdc42-specific Dbl-GEF proteins (32Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). GEF specificity can be simply inverted by performing either the Trp → Phe conversion in Rac1 or the Phe → Trp change in Cdc42, allowing Cdc42(F56W) to recognize some Rac1-specific GEFs such as Tiam1 and allowing Rac1(W56F) to recognize the Cdc42-specific GEF intersectin (32Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Gao Y. Xing J. Streuli M. Leto T.L. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47530-47541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The prediction from this model is that the point mutation W56F should relieve potential titration of a Rac1 GEF by the Rac1(T17N) mutant and reverse the effects of the dominant inhibitory mutant. Therefore, we tested whether the Rac1(T17N/W56F) double mutant could reverse the inhibitory effects of the T17N mutation. To this end, transfected COS-1 cells producing either Rac1(WT), Rac1(T17N), or the double mutant Rac1(T17N/W56F) were challenged with Y. pseudotuberculosis, and the efficiency of bacterial uptake was determined. Surprisingly, the double mutant Rac1(T17N/W56F) was as strong an inhibitor of invasin-promoted uptake as the parental Rac1(T17N) (Fig. 1A). Either the W56F residue change did not cause altered specificity of Rac1(T17N) or the Rac1(W56F) variant itself was a dominant inhibitory mutant. To test the model that the W56F mutation produces an inhibitory Rac1 molecule, COS-1 cells transfected with the single mutant Rac1(W56F) were challenged with Y. pseudotuberculosis. The Rac1(W56F) mutant impaired uptake as severely as did Rac1(T17N) (Fig. 1A). Therefore it appears that altering the GEF specificity of Rac1 renders it an inhibitor of invasin-promoted uptake. Rac1(W56F) Interferes with Cdc42-dependent Uptake of EPEC into HeLa Cells—As the Rac1(W56F) mutation is predicted to bind Cdc42-specific GEFs, and it has unexpected effects on Rac1-dependent uptake, we considered that Cdc42-dependent events also may be antagonized by this mutant. One such Cdc42-dependent event is uptake of EPEC by HeLa cells. Uptake of this organism is inhibited by Cdc42(T17N), but not by Rac1(T17N) (37Jepson M.A. Pellegrin S. Peto L. Banbury D.N. Leard A.D. Mellor H. Kenny B. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and is a good model to determine the effects of Rac1(W56F) on events that are Cdc42-dependent and Rac1-independent. Rac1(W56F) efficiently interfered with EPEC uptake (Fig. 1B). The inhibition of uptake observed was as strong as that for Cdc42(T17N), whereas Rac1(T17N) had no effect (Fig. 1B). Therefore, Rac1(W56F) could interfere with signaling events promoted by multiple small GTPases. Rac1(W56F) Binds Effectors and RhoGDI—One of the key characteristics of the Rac1(T17N) dominant negative mutant is that it assumes an inactive conformation that fails to bind to downstream effectors (38Dharmawardhane S. Schurmann A. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Schmid S.L. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3341-3352Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether Rac1(W56F) had a similar mechanism of interference of Y. pseudotuberculosis uptake and is unable to bind effectors. We measured the binding of Rac1 derivatives to the PBD of PAK1 by FRET, both throughout the uninfected cells and in the region around phagosomes after incubation with Y. pseudotuberculosis.

https://openalex.org/W2089759395,"The Drosophila heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M, HRP59, is a nuclear protein that associates co-transcriptionally with pre-mRNA and is necessary for the correct expression of a subset of mRNAs. We show here that the hrp59 pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to generate two different mRNAs that differ in the presence of exon 3. Exon 3-containing transcripts make up the majority of hrp59 transcripts and encode for the functional protein, HRP59-1. Transcripts that lack exon 3 contain a premature translation termination codon and are targeted to the nonsense mediated decay pathway. We show that exon 3 inclusion is itself inhibited by HRP59 and that changes in the HRP59 protein levels affect the splicing activity of the cell. We propose that the ability of HRP59 to regulate the alternative splicing of its own pre-mRNA serves in a negative feedback loop that controls the levels of the HRP59 protein and maintains the homeostasis of the splicing environment.

Pre-mRNAs associate co-transcriptionally with a variety of RNA-binding proteins known as hnRNP 2The abbreviations used are: hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; RT, reverse transcription; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PTC, premature termination codon; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; UTR, untranslated region. proteins or mRNP proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Krecic A.M.

Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). hnRNP proteins exist in all eukaryotes and are evolutionarily conserved. More than 20 hnRNP proteins have been identified in human cells, and these have been designated from A1 to U (reviewed in Ref. 2Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Although the degree of homology at the amino acid level is not very high, hnRNP proteins from different organisms share the same types of domain and the same domain organization. In Drosophila melanogaster, more than 10 hnRNP proteins have been identified (3Haynes S.R. Raychaudhuri G. Johnson D. Amero S. Beyer A.L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 4Matunis E.L. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Matunis M.J.

Biol. 1992; 12: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). hnRNP proteins are abundant nuclear proteins and they play a general role in the packaging of nascent transcripts into ribonucleoprotein complexes (pre-mRNP). Many hnRNP proteins also have specific functions in gene expression. For instance, in the cell nucleus the mammalian hnRNP K interacts with the transcription machinery and stimulates transcription (7Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), while in the cytoplasm hnRNP K controls translation initiation of specific mRNAs (8Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). hnRNP I, also known as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, plays a role in mRNA stability and mRNA localization (9Valcarcel J. Gebauer F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R705-R708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). hnRNP proteins are modular and characterized by the presence of one or more RNA-binding motifs and auxiliary domains of different types (reviewed in Ref. 11Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Several hnRNP genes generate multiple isoforms through alternative splicing. The significance of these alternatively spliced forms has been elucidated for members of the hnRNP families A/B, D, and I. For example, the stabilities of human hnRNP D isoforms are differentially controlled by the insertion of an alternate exon that regulates their ubiquitin targeting activities (12Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3052-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Different isoforms of hrp40, a Drosophila hnRNP A/B homolog, play distinct roles in Gurken localization during oogenesis (13Norvell A. Kelley R.L. Wehr K. Schupbach T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 864-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Alternative skipping of exon 11 in the human hnRNP I transcript leads to the production of a mRNA that is degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway (14Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Smith C.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 91-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Exon 11 skipping is promoted by hnRNP I itself, and thus it has been proposed that autoregulation maintains normal levels of hnRNP I expression. Some D. melanogaster hnRNPs play a role in the regulation of alternative splicing. Overexpression of members of the hnRNP-A/B family in flies induces exon skipping in the dopa-decarboxylase (Ddc) pre-mRNA (15Shen J. Zu K. Cass C.L. Beyer A.L. Hirsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1822-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Zu K. Sikes M.L. Haynes S.R. Beyer A.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1059-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), while the hrp48 protein is involved in P-element pre-mRNA splicing (17Siebel C.W. Fresco L.D. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1386-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Siebel C.W. Kanaar R. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1713-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have previously studied the hnRNP M proteins of Chironomus tentans and of D. melanogaster, referred to as HRP59 (19Kiesler E. Hase M.E. Brodin D. Visa N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The hnRNP M proteins in insects and in mammals have a molecular mass of 65–75 kDa and contain three RNA-binding domains of the RRM type. The hnRNP M family in human cells comprises at least six immunologically related isoforms (20Datar K.V. Dreyfuss G. Swanson M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Kafasla P. Patrinou-Georgoula M. Guialis A. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HRP59 in C. tentans is dynamically recruited to transcribed genes and binds co-transcriptionally to pre-mRNA. Immunoelectron microscopy studies in the Balbiani ring genes of C. tentans have shown that HRP59 accompanies the mRNA from the gene to the nuclear envelope and that it is released from the mRNA at the nuclear pore. We have recently identified the preferred RNA targets of HRP59 and identified a purine-rich motif recognized by HRP59 (19Kiesler E. Hase M.E. Brodin D. Visa N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this purine-rich motif resembles an exonic splicing enhancer of the (GAR)n type (reviewed in Ref. 22Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and is similar to the binding site for SF2/ASF, an SR protein involved in splicing regulation (23Cartegni L. Wang J. Zhu Z. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3568-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HRP59 is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Further support comes from a study showing that two of the human hnRNP M isoforms, referred to as 72/72(M), are associated with pre-mRNA in pre-spliceosomal A complexes (24Kafasla P. Patrinou-Georgoula M. Lewis J.D. Guialis A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 793-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have explored the possibility that hnRNP M proteins play a role in pre-mRNP splicing by studying the splicing activity of HRP59 in Drosophila S2 cells. We show that the hrp59 pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced and that HRP59 affects the splicing of its own pre-mRNA by promoting the synthesis of a mRNA with a premature stop codon that is a target for NMD. Our results provide a new example of RNA-binding proteins that regulate their own expression by a feedback mechanism in which alternative splicing is coupled to NMD. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from Drosophila S2 cells was extracted using the RNAaqueous kit (Ambion). Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript-II (Invitrogen) and hexamer primers on 5 or 25 μg total RNA. One-tenth of the reverse transcription product was used for PCR in a 50-μl reaction, using primers described in the supplemental data. The PCR reaction was conducted as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles, each consisting of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension phase for 7 min. The up-10 RT-PCR was followed by nesting a 1:50 dilution of the reaction for 25 cycles. A 25-μl portion of each reaction was run on a 1% agarose gel and stained with EtBr or GelStar (Cambrex BioScience). Amplimers were quantified from digital images using Bio-Rad Quantify Analysis software. cDNA Cloning and Expression in Drosophila S2 Cells–cDNAs for overexpression in S2 cells were cloned into the vector pMT-V5-His B (Invitrogen). Primers used to amplify cDNA (supplemental data) spanned the start and stop codons of the respective genes and had EcoRI, KpnI, or XhoI restriction sites designed into their 5′ and 3′ ends. Amplification of cDNA was carried out using Platinum Taq-Pfx (Invitrogen). S2 cells were stably transfected using the calcium phosphate method, with hygromycin as the selection co-plasmid. cDNA expression was induced with 500 μm cupric sulfate for 48 h and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Fractionation—6 × 107 Drosophila S2 cells were centrifuged, washed with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The ice-cold cell suspension was then homogenized and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet, which contained the nucleoplasmic fraction, was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and sonicated. 10 μl of the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic fraction were separately boiled in protein sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. RNA Interference (RNAi) in Drosophila S2 Cells—Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) against HRP59, dSF2/ASF, UPF1, and GFP were prepared by in vitro transcription from PCR products with T7 promoters on both ends of the amplimers, using the Megascript RNAi kit (Ambion). Two templates were produced for hrp59, targeting overlapping regions of the exon 4. The PCR primers are described in the supplemental data. 20 μg of dsRNA was applied to S2 cells every 48 h, and the cells were harvested after 120 h. Immunoblot Analysis and Antibodies—Western blotting to determine HRP59 levels was carried out as described previously (19Kiesler E. Hase M.E. Brodin D. Visa N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-HRP59 antibody. dSF2/ASF levels were measured using a monoclonal anti-SF2/ASF antibody (Zymed Laboratories). A monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was used for detection of V5-tagged proteins. In Vivo Splicing Assays—The constitutive expression vector pAc5/V5-HisB (Invitrogen) was used to construct minigenes. Regions flanking the exon 10A/B and exon 11 were amplified from Drosophila S2 genomic DNA using primers as listed supplemental data to create an up-10 minigene. Hrp59 genomic DNA was amplified using three different primer pairs, I, II, III, that spanned overlapping gene regions. Fragment I, which included exons 1 and 2 and introns 1 and 2, was cloned between the KpnI and XbaI sites of the pAc5 vector. The resulting construct was digested with restriction enzymes XbaI and SacII, and Fragment II, which contained exon 3, the first 100 nucleotides of exon 4, and intron 3 sequences, was inserted. The full-length hrp59 minigene was constructed by inserting Fragment III into construct I and II after it had been digested with SacII. All constructs were verified by sequencing. In vivo splicing assays were carried out using S2 cells and RNAi-depleted S2 cells, which were transiently transfected with 19 μg of minigene DNA. Transient transfection of minigenes was performed according to the Drosophila Expression System Technical Manual (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated after 24–48 h and reverse-transcribed. Splicing patterns were analyzed by RT-PCR using vector-specific and gene-specific primers. The hrp59 pre-mRNA Is Alternatively Spliced—A recent bioinformatic approach identified two alternatively spliced mRNAs that originate from the hrp59 pre-mRNA in Drosophila (25Philipps D.L. Park J.W. Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We prepared cDNA from Drosophila S2 cells and amplified hrp59 sequences by PCR. We detected a major hrp59 transcript and a less abundant hrp59 transcript of lower molecular mass. We sequenced both PCR products, and the sequence analysis revealed the existence of two alternatively spliced hrp59 mRNAs that differed in the inclusion of exon 3. We termed these transcripts hrp59-1 and hrp59-2 (Figs. 1, A and C, and 2C). We concluded that both hrp59-1 and hrp59-2 mRNAs coexist in S2 cells, hrp59-1 being the predominant mRNA. We did not detect the alternative isoform reported by Philipps et al. (25Philipps D.L. Park J.W. Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2HRP59 regulates the levels of its own mRNA. A, Western blot analysis of S2 cells expressing V5-tagged HRP59-1 and dSF2/ASF (control) before and after induction with 500 μm cupric sulfate. The blots were probed with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody. B, RT-PCR analysis of hrp59 pre-mRNA levels in non-transfected S2 cells and in cells expressing HRP59-1 (pMT-59), dSF2/ASF (pMT-ASF), and pMT expression vectors. All cell lines were treated with 500 μm cupric sulfate for ∼48 h before RNA purification and RT-PCR analysis. The hrp59 pre-mRNA was amplified using a forward primer complementary to sequences in intron 3. The reverse primer was complementary to sequences in exon 4. C, RT-PCR analysis of endogenous hrp59 mRNA levels in S2 cells transfected as above. We ensured selective amplification of the endogenous hrp59 transcripts by using a forward primer that was complementary to a 5′-UTR sequence that is not present in pMT-derived transcripts. The reverse primer was complementary to sequences in exon 4. Bands corresponding to the abundant hrp59-1 and to the minor hrp59-2 transcripts are indicated. 18 S rRNA in the same samples was analyzed in parallel and used for normalization. The histograms in B and C show the abundance of hrp59 pre-mRNA and hrp59-1 mRNA, respectively, relative to 18 S rRNA. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Virtual translation of the hrp59-1 and hrp59-2 mRNAs revealed that the skipping of exon 3 introduces a frameshift and results in the presence of a premature termination codon (PTC) at amino acid 214 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the stop codon of hrp59-2 precedes the boundary between exons 4 and 5, and the hrp59-2 transcript is therefore a potential substrate for NMD. The Majority of hrp59-2 Transcripts Is Degraded by NMD–To investigate whether the hrp59-2 transcript is targeted to NMD, we depleted UPF1, an essential NMD factor, by RNAi in S2 cells and examined changes in hrp59 mRNA levels by RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). We applied the RNAi method described by Clemens et al. (26Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) based on the use of long dsRNAs. The efficiency of the UPF1 depletion was confirmed by RT-PCR amplification of upf1 mRNA and by the stabilization of an endogenous mRNA, the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme mRNA (oda), known to be regulated by NMD (27Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Nature. 2004; 429: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We quantified changes of mRNA levels after UPF1 depletion and determined the fold of enrichment compared with the mRNA levels in control cells treated with GFP dsRNA (Fig. 1C). The UPF1 knockdown caused a significant increase of hrp59-2 mRNA levels relative to the GFP control cells. After five independent experiments, we calculated a 4-fold average enrichment of hrp59-2 mRNA in the UPF1 knockdown. This result indicates that the hrp59-2 mRNA is degraded by the NMD pathway. The HRP59-2 Isoform Accumulates in the Cytoplasm—Most of the hrp59-2 mRNA is degraded by NMD, but there is a remaining fraction that can be detected by RT-PCR under steady-state conditions in non-treated S2 cells. This remaining hrp59-2 mRNA is probably translated. The predicted protein encoded by the hrp59-2 mRNA contains RRM 1 but lacks RRM 2 and RRM 3 (Fig. 1D). We analyzed the subcellular distributions of the predicted HRP59 protein isoforms by expressing cDNAs that encoded V5-tagged versions of HRP59-1 and HRP59-2 in S2 cells, preparing nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, and analyzing the presence of each protein in the extracts by Western blotting (Fig. 1E). HRP59-1 was predominantly nuclear, as expected from our previous study (19Kiesler E. Hase M.E. Brodin D. Visa N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), while HRP59-2 was excluded from the nucleus. In summary, the results reported above show that the hrp59 pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced in S2 cells. One of the resulting hrp59 mRNAs, hrp59-1, has all the features of a functional mRNA and encodes a protein that is transported into the nucleus. The hrp59-2 mRNA, in contrast, appears to be a non-functional mRNA that is either degraded by NMD or translated into a truncated protein that accumulates in the cytoplasm. The Levels of hrp59 mRNA Are Regulated in S2 Cells—Previous studies have shown that HRP59 binds preferentially to a subset of transcripts that includes the hrp59 mRNA itself (19Kiesler E. Hase M.E. Brodin D. Visa N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that there is a feedback mechanism that regulates the production of HRP59. We analyzed how the expression of the hrp59 gene is regulated by overexpressing HRP59-1 in S2 cells. We constructed a S2 cell line stably transfected with a plasmid that expresses the hrp59-1 cDNA under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter (pMT-59). We constructed in parallel one control cell line transfected with a plasmid that expressed dSF2/ASF (pMT-ASF) and one transfected with the parental vector plasmid (pMT) (Fig. 2). Induction of the metallothionein promoter led to significant expression of HRP59-1 and dSF2/ASF, as shown by Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 2A). We analyzed the effects of HRP59-1 overexpression on the levels of endogenous hrp59 pre-mRNA (2B) and mRNA (2C) by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The conditions used for PCR amplification were optimized to avoid saturation of the PCR reactions. Control reactions in the absence of reverse transcriptase were carried out in parallel and were negative (data not shown). Overexpression of HRP59-1 from the pMT-59 construct in stably transfected S2 cells caused a 3-fold increase of hrp59 pre-mRNA (Fig. 2B). In contrast, overexpression of dSF2/ASF did not produce significant changes in the hrp59 pre-mRNA levels. We used 18 S rRNA as an internal reference to monitor the efficiencies of total RNA purification and cDNA synthesis in the different samples. Quantification of the intensity of the PCR bands from three independent experiments showed that the effects were significant and specific for pMT-59. The detection of hrp59 pre-mRNA was carried out using a forward PCR primer that was located in intron 3 of the hrp59 pre-mRNA and that could not amplify the transcripts derived from the pMT-59 construct. The endogenous hrp59 mRNAs (Fig. 2C) were detected exclusively using a forward primer that was complementary to the 5′ untranslated region of the hrp59 mRNA, which is not present in transcripts derived from the pMT-59 construct, and a reverse primer that was complementary to sequences in exon 4. Overexpression of HRP59-1 from the pMT-59 construct resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the levels of endogenous hrp59 mRNAs (Fig. 2C). In summary, these results point to the existence of a feedback mechanism by which the HRP59-1 protein inhibits the splicing of the hrp59 pre-mRNA. HRP59 Depletion Promotes the Formation of the hrp59-1 mRNA—To further analyze the effect of HRP59-1 on the alternative splicing of the hrp59 pre-mRNA, we silenced the expression of HRP59-1 in S2 cells by RNAi and analyzed the splicing of an hrp59 pre-mRNA expressed from a minigene after HRP59-1 depletion. We used a mixture of two dsRNAs corresponding to two different segments of the hrp59 mRNA (bars in Fig. 3A) for efficient depletion. The levels of endogenous hrp59 transcripts were drastically reduced after 4 days of RNAi treatment (Fig. 3A). The levels of HRP59 protein were also significantly reduced as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). GFP and dSF2/ASF dsRNAs were used in parallel to assess the specificity of the depletion effects. After 4 days of RNAi treatment, the S2 cells were transiently transfected with a minigene that carried a synthetic hrp59 gene under the control of a constitutive promoter. This minigene included the genomic hrp59 sequences that lay between the start and the stop codons, including the introns (Fig. 3C). The 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR sequences of the synthetic hrp59 gene were those of the parental pAc5 vector. Primer pairs were designed to amplify both hrp59 splice variants in the same PCR reaction, as indicated in Fig. 3C. The forward primer was complementary to the 5′-UTR of the pAc5 vector, to ensure that only the transcripts derived from the plasmid were amplified. Two different hrp59 transcripts were amplified under these conditions (lane 1 in Fig. 3C), and sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that these two transcripts differed in the inclusion of exon 3. Interestingly, the hrp59-2 transcript was not detectable in HRP59-depleted cells (lane 4 in Fig. 3C). This effect was reproducible and specific. Both hrp59-1 and hrp59-2 mRNAs could be amplified in mock-treated cells (lane 1 in Fig. 3C) and in cells treated with dsRNA for either GFP or dSF2/ASF (lanes 2 and 3, respectively, in Fig. 3C). The same results were obtained when each of the two dsRNAs that target different regions of hrp59 (bars in Fig. 3A) were tested separately (data not shown). In summary, these observations support the conclusion that HRP59 regulates the splicing of its own pre-mRNA and favors, directly or indirectly, the exclusion of exon 3 (see “Discussion”). HRP59 Regulates the Splicing of Other Transcripts—We have previously identified several mRNAs that are preferentially associated with HRP59-1, one of which is the hrp59 mRNA itself. We have shown that most of these preferred mRNAs contain a common purine-rich sequence that resembles an exonic splicing enhancer of the (GAR)n type (19Kiesler E. Hase M.E. Brodin D. Visa N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HRP59-1 can regulate the splicing of its own pre-mRNA, as described above, and this suggests that HRP59-1 can regulate the splicing of other pre-mRNAs as well. The purine-rich sequence found in transcripts bound to HRP59-1 was highly enriched in some exons of the upheld (up) mRNA, also known as troponin T. Therefore we sought to determine whether HRP59-1 depletion has any effect of the splicing of the up pre-mRNA. The up pre-mRNA is ∼8 kb long and contains 12 exons that are alternatively spliced into at least four different isoforms (28Benoist P. Mas J.A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7538-7546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Herranz R. Mateos J. Mas J.A. Garcia-Zaragoza E. Cervera M. Marco R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 2231-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Due to the low levels of up expression in S2 cells, we designed a minigene called up-10. The up-10 construct contains the alternatively spliced exons 10A and B, and exon 11, which contains several copies of the purine-rich motif (Fig. 4). We expressed this minigene in transiently transfected S2 cells, and we analyzed by RT-PCR the splicing of the resulting pre-mRNAs. Sequencing of the PCR products showed that the two introns present in the up-10 pre-mRNA are efficiently spliced in control S2 cells (lane 1 in Fig. 4B). However, depletion of HRP59-1 by RNAi prevented up-10 pre-mRNA splicing (lane 4 in Fig. 4B). The only spliced transcript detected in the HRP59-1 depleted cells was a shorter, low abundance transcript that arose as a result of activation of a cryptic splice site in exon 11. From this we conclude that the levels of HRP59-1 affect the splicing of pre-mRNAs other than the hrp59 pre-mRNA itself. These results suggest that HRP59-1 is required for the proper splicing of the up pre-mRNA also under physiological conditions. Our results show that the hrp59 transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate two mRNAs that differ in the presence or absence of exon 3. Most hrp59 mRNAs in Drosophila S2 cells contain exon 3 and code for a functional RNA-binding protein. Exon 3 exclusion results in a shift in the ORF that generates a PTC located 1500 nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon boundary. We show that the PTC-containing transcripts are degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. The existence of detectable levels of hrp59-2 mRNA suggests that the HRP59-2 isoform is synthesized in S2 cells. However, its functional significance is unclear. HRP59-1 is a predominantly nuclear protein that associates co-transcriptionally with a subset of mRNAs. In contrast, the HRP59-2 isoform is not imported into the nucleus. HRP59-2 has no obvious nuclear localization signals, and its nuclear import probably requires interacting proteins. HRP59-2 lacks two RNA-binding motifs (RRM 2 and RRM 3) and a glycine-rich region that is located between RRM 2 and RRM 3. Several studies have shown that RRMs and glycine-rich regions support important functions such as protein location, RNA-binding, protein self-association, and splicing regulation (30Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Heinrichs V. Baker B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Zu K. Sikes M.L. Beyer A.L. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 12: 1585-1598Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fact that HRP59-2 lacks these important domains suggests that this truncated HRP59 isoform is not functional. However, our present results do not exclude a cytoplasmic role for HRP59-2. We demonstrate that HRP59-1 regulates the alternative splicing of the hrp59 pre-mRNA. In S2 cells, the inclusion of exon 3 appears to be more efficient than its exclusion, based on the observation that the hrp59-1 is the predominant hrp59 mRNA at steady state. Overexpression of HRP59-1 results in accumulation of hrp59 pre-mRNA with a concomitant reduction in the levels of spliced hrp59 mRNAs. These observations support a model in which HRP59 is a negative regulator of pre-mRNA splicing. We have also shown that depletion of HRP59 by RNAi favors the inclusion of exon 3. Two possible mechanisms can be envisioned to explain this observation: HRP59 either inhibits inclusion of exon 3 or facilitates exclusion of exon 3. The results from the overexpression experiment, however, are in conflict with HRP59 acting as a positive regulator. Therefore we favor a model in which HRP59 inhibits the inlusion of exon 3 (Fig. 5). According to this model, increased levels of HRP59-1 inhibit the formation of hrp59-1 mRNA, which in turn limits the production of HRP59-1 protein. Under these conditions, splicing leading to the formation of hrp59-2 can still take place, but the hrp59-2 levels are kept low by NMD. When HRP59-1 is down-regulated, the repression on the synthesis of hrp59-1 is released, the inclusion of exon 3 is more efficient, and exon 3 skipping is disadvantaged. In this way, alternative splicing and NMD are employed in a negative feedback circuit to control the abundance of HRP59-1 protein. In summary, our findings add HRP59 to the list of reported splicing factors that regulate their own expression by regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST) (33Lewis B.P. Green R.E. Brenner S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). A recent study (34Martinez-Contreras R. Fisette J.-F. Nasim F.H. Madden R. Cordeau M. Chabot B. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 0172-0185Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar) on the role of hnRNP proteins in modulation of alternative splicing has led to the proposal that some hnRNP proteins, such as hnRNP A/B and F/H, can bind to both ends of an intron and bring distant splice sites together. The existence of HRP59-1 binding sites located in both exon 2 and exon 4 of the hrp59 transcript suggests that a similar model could apply here. However, the accumulation of hrp59 pre-mRNA transcript observed after HRP59 overexpression strongly suggests HRP59 acts as a negative regulator. For these reasons, we favor a model in which HRP59-1 acts by preventing the interaction of other splicing factors with the transcript. Several authors have proposed a model in which the ratio of SF2/ASF-type SR proteins to A/B-type hnRNPs plays a role in regulating alternative splicing through antagonistic effects of the two protein types on splice site selection (reviewed in Ref. 35Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). The HRP59-binding motif is similar to the exonic splicing enhancer recognized by the human SF2/ASF (23Cartegni L. Wang J. Zhu Z. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3568-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), and we thus expected the insect SF2/ASF ortholog to compete with HRP59 for splicing regulation. However, neither SF2/ASF depletion nor overexpression affected the splicing of the minigenes tested. We suggest two possible explanations: either there is no competition for the same kind of binding sites, or other SR proteins can perform the required function. We analyzed the splicing of the up-10 minigene in S2 cells and showed that depletion of HRP59-1 causes a drastic reduction of up-10 splicing. The up-10 is a synthetic transcript that may lack important regulatory sequences, and from our present experiment we cannot draw conclusions about the molecular mechanisms that lie behind the observed effects. However, our results indicate that the levels of HRP59-1 protein are important for the splicing activity of the cell and can affect the splicing of transcripts other than the hrp59 pre-mRNA. In a previous study, we identified additional transcripts that bind HRP59 in S2 cells (19Kiesler E. Hase M.E. Brodin D. Visa N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1013-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Most of the identified transcripts contain introns, but not all of them are alternatively spliced, and a few of them are intronless. The activity of HRP59 in splicing regulation is likely to affect both general and alternative splicing. Moreover, HRP59-1 may also act by preventing splicing at cryptic or undesired splice sites. This possibility is supported by the observation that splicing of the up-10 transcript occurs at a new splice site when the levels of HRP59-1 are experimentally reduced. In summary, our results show that the levels of HRP59 affect splice site selection and that HRP59 regulates its own expression by controlling the alternative splicing of its own pre-mRNA. We propose that this autoregulatory function serves as negative feedback control of HRP59 activity. Such a mechanism would ensure a constant level of HRP59 protein, which is important for the homeostasis of the splicing environment. We thank George Farrants for language editing.

Examining the effect of Eap on endothelial function in more detail, we here show that, in addition, Eap functions as a potent angiostatic agent. Concomitant treatment of EC with purified Eap resulted in the complete blockage of the mitogenic and sprouting responses elicited by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165 or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Moreover, the induction of tissue factor and decay-accelerating factor were repressed by Eap, as determined by qRT-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), with a corresponding reduction in Egr-1 protein up-regulation seen. This angiostatic activity was accompanied by a corresponding inhibition in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while activation of p38 was not affected. Inhibition occurred downstream of tyrosine kinase receptor activation, as comparable effects were seen on TPA-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Similar to previously described angiostatic agents like angiopoietin-1 or the 16-kDa prolactin fragment, Eap blockage of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade was localized by pull-down assay at the level of Ras activation. Eap's combined anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties render this bacterial protein not only an important virulence factor during S. aureus infection but open new perspectives for therapeutic applications in pathological neovascularization."

In this study, we have identified two splice variants of human FXYD3, or Mat-8, in CaCo-2 cells. Short human FXYD3 has 72% sequence identity with mouse FXYD3, whereas long human FXYD3 is identical to short human FXYD3 but has a 26-amino acid insertion after the transmembrane domain. Short and long human FXYD3 RNAs and proteins are differentially expressed during differentiation of CaCo-2 cells. Long human FXYD3 is mainly expressed in nondifferentiated cells and short human FXYD3 in differentiated cells and both FXYD3 variants can be co-immunoprecipitated with a Na,K-ATPase antibody. In contrast to mouse FXYD3, which has two transmembrane domains for lack of cleavage of the signal peptide, human FXYD3 has a cleavable signal peptide and adopts a type I topology. After co-expression in Xenopus oocytes, both human FXYD3 variants associate stably only with Na,K-ATPase isozymes but not with H,K-ATPase or Ca-ATPase. Similar to mouse FXYD3, short human FXYD3 decreases the apparent K+ and Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase over a large range of membrane potentials. On the other hand, long human FXYD3 decreases the apparent K+ affinity only at slightly negative and positive membrane potentials and increases the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase. Finally, both short and long human FXYD3 induce a hyperpolarization activated current, similar to that induced by mouse FXYD3. Thus, we have characterized two human FXYD3 isoforms that are differentially expressed in differentiated and non-differentiated cells and show different functional properties.

Thus, we have characterized two human FXYD3 isoforms that are differentially expressed in differentiated and non-differentiated cells and show different functional properties. Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the P-type ATPase family and is responsible for active cation transport. During each reaction cycle, Na,K-ATPase transports 3Na+ ions out and 2 K+ ions into the cell by using the energy of the hydrolysis of ATP. Na,K-ATPase maintains the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ ions that are necessary to maintain the cell volume and the membrane potential, affect the activity of secondary transport systems, and permit neuronal excitability and muscle contraction. The minimal functional unit of Na,K-ATPase is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, α and β. The α subunit contains 10 transmembrane segments and an ATP-hydrolyzing domain and is responsible for ion transport. The β subunit that is a type II, glycosylated protein, plays a chaperone role by allowing the structural and functional maturation of Na,K-ATPase (1Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Four α and 3 β isoforms have been identified. Na,K-ATPase isozymes are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific way, and show different transport properties indicating that each isoform could play specific roles adapted to specific physiological processes (2Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar, 3Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.D. Lelievre L. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1976-1986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Numerous mechanisms are known to modulate the expression and/or activity of Na,K-ATPase. The Na,K-ATPase activity is tightly coupled to the intracellular concentration of Na+. The number of active Na,K-ATPase units at the plasma membrane is controlled by phosphorylation of the catalytic α subunit by protein kinases, stimulated by peptide hormones and neurotransmitters (4Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, mineralocorticoid and thyroid hormones mediate long-term regulation of Na,K-ATPase by affecting α and β gene transcription and leading to an increased number of Na,K-ATPase units at the cell surface (5Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Recently, a family of small proteins called FXYD proteins was defined (6Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In mammals, the FXYD family contains seven members including phospholemman (FXYD1) (7Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Na,K-ATPase γ subunit (FXYD2) (8Forbush B. II I Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3264-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Family members have a molecular mass between 7.5 and 24 kDa. They share a common signature of 6 amino acid residues, comprising the FXYD motif, from which the family takes its name, 2 glycine residues and a serine residue. Most characterized FXYD proteins are type I membrane proteins with a single transmembrane domain, adopted in some, but not all cases, by cleavage of a N-terminal signal peptide. FXYD proteins are widely distributed in mammalian tissues that perform fluid and solute transport or that are electrically excitable. However, the expression of FXYD proteins is tissue-specific and at least one of their common functions is their association with Na,K-ATPase and the modulation of its transport properties. To date, all FXYD proteins, except FXYD6, have been shown to associate with and to alter the activity of the Na,K-ATPase. Actually, it seems that each of these proteins modifies the transport properties of Na,K-ATPase in a distinct way adapted to the physiological needs of the tissue in which they are expressed (14Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F241-F250Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Due to the important role of Na,K-ATPase, variations of FXYD protein expression may be the cause of pathophysiological states as in human primary hypomagnesaemia, which is associated with a mutation in a conserved glycine residue in the transmembrane domain of FXYD2 (15Meij I.C. Koenderink J.B. van Bokhoven H. Assink K.F. Groenestege W.T. de Pont J.J. Bindels R.J. Monnens L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The FXYD3 protein, or Mat-8, is expressed at high levels in uterus, stomach, and colon, and at low levels in breast, ovary, lung, small intestine, and thymus (9Morrison B.W. Moorman J.R. Kowdley G.C. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mouse FXYD3 was identified as a protein inducing hyperpolarization activated chloride conductance after expression in Xenopus oocytes (9Morrison B.W. Moorman J.R. Kowdley G.C. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This could suggest that FXYD3 may be involved in the regulation of transepithelial ion transport in tissues containing absorptive or secretory epithelia. Recently, we have shown that mouse FXYD3 shares features in common with other members of the FXYD family, namely its capacity to interact with Na,K-ATPase and to modify its transport properties (16Crambert G. Li C. Claeys D. Geering K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mouse FXYD3 exhibits structural and functional features that differ from the other FXYD proteins. First, the lack of cleavage of the predicted signal peptide indicates that mouse FXYD3, in contrast to other FXYD proteins, may have two transmembrane domains. The second feature that distinguishes mouse FXYD3 from other FXYD proteins is its ability to interact, not only with Na,K-ATPase, but also with gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPase. So far, the physiological relevance of the functional properties of FXYD3 remains unclear. Interestingly, FXYD3 was shown to be overexpressed in human and mouse breast tumors initiated by the neu and ras oncogenes, suggesting a correlation between FXYD3 and mammary tumorigenesis (17Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Grzmil et al. (18Grzmil M. Voigt S. Thelen P. Hemmerlein B. Helmke K. Burfeind P. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar) showed that small interfering RNA inhibition of FXYD3 expression promotes a decrease in cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells. On the other hand, it has been shown that FXYD3 mRNA expression is increased after treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the fluoropyrimidine drug, 5-fluorouracil, and that this activation is dependent on p53 expression (19Maxwell P.J. Longley D.B. Latif T. Boyer J. Allen W. Lynch M. McDermott U. Harkin D.P. Allegra C.J. Johnston P.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4602-4606PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be shown whether there is a correlation between the regulation of the functional properties of Na,K-ATPase by FXYD3 and the possible role of FXYD3 in cell proliferation. Human adenocarcinoma cells, CaCo-2 cells, spontaneously convert from undifferentiated cells into polarized cells. By investigating the impact of differentiation on gene expression, Anderle et al. (20Anderle P. Rakhmanova V. Woodford K. Zerangue N. Sadee W. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 20: 3-15Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have shown that expression of FXYD3 mRNA is increased during differentiation of CaCo-2 cells. In this study, we have identified two human FXYD3 isoforms in CaCo-2 cells that are differentially expressed during cell differentiation and are also expressed in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Both human FXYD3 isoforms are able to stably associate with Na,K-ATPase and play different functional roles in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activities.

To produce the FXYD1 and FXYD2 chimeras containing the 26 additional amino acids of human FXYD3-lf, we first PCR amplified the sequence coding for the N-terminal domain of dog FXYD1 or human FXYD2 by using a sense primer tailed with an EcoRI site (5′-GCGAATTCATGGCACCTCTCCACCACATC-3′/5′-GCGAATTCATGACTGGGTTGTCGATGGAC-3′) and an antisense primer tailed with 15 base pairs coding for the additional 26 amino acids of human FXYD3-lf (5′-CCCCGAGCTCCTCCACTCGCTCAGGACGATGAG-3′/5′-CCCCGAGCTCCTCCACTCGCTGAGGAGGATGAG-3′). In parallel, the sequence coding for the additional 26 amino acids of FXYD3-lf was PCR amplified by using a sense primer tailed with 15 base pairs coding for the last amino acids of the N-terminal part of FXYD1/FXYD2 (5′-CTCATCGTCCTGAGCGAGTGGAGGAGCTCGGGGGAG-3′/5′-CTCATCCTCCTCAGCGAGTGGAGGAGCTCGGGGGAG-3′) and an antisense primer tailed with 15 base pairs coding for the first amino acids of the C-terminal part of FXYD1/FXYD2 (5′-TTTGCACCGGCATCTTCTACCTGTTGGGGAGAGCTG-3′/5′-CCCACAGCGGAATCTTCTACCTGTTGGGGAGAGCTG-3′). Both PCR products were mixed and used for a third PCR by using the sense primer tailed with an EcoRI site and the antisense primer tailed with the 15 base pairs coding for the first amino acids of the C-terminal part of FXYD1 or FXYD2. In parallel, the sequence coding for the C-terminal of FXYD1 or FXYD2 was amplified by using a sense primer tailed with 15 base pairs coding for the last amino acids of the additional 26 amino acids of FXYD3-lf (5′-CTCTCCCCAACAGGTAGAAGATGCCGGTGCAAATTC-3′/5′-CTCTCCCCAACAGGTAGAAGATTCCGCTGTGGG-3′) and the antisense primer tailed with a NotI site (5′-CAGCGGCCGCCTACCGCCTGCGGGTGGACAGACGGCG-3′/5′-CAGCGGCCGCTTACGGCTCATCTTCATTGAT-3′).

In Vitro Translation—In vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate of human wild type FXYD3 isoform or mutant FXYD3Δ22 cRNAs, in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Cell Culture—CaCo-2 cells were passaged every 6 days by treatment with trypsin/EDTA and used between passages 35 and 50. The cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells in 25-cm2 Costar flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C at 9% CO2. The medium was changed every 2 days. For non-differentiated cells, cells were collected at about 80% of confluence. Differentiated cells were harvested 3 weeks after they have reached confluency. MCF-7 breast cancer cells (kindly provided by D. Longley, University of Belfast) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C at 5% CO2. RT-PCR—The extraction and purification of total RNAs from CaCo-2 cells or from human intestinal carcinoma cell lines DLD-1, HT29, and T84 were carried out according to the manufacturer's specifications (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen). The yield of each RNA was determined and was about 25 μg/culture dish. Total isolated RNA (0.5 μg) was then reverse transcribed using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR System (Roche). Briefly, PCR amplification was performed using 40 cycles with denaturation, annealing, and extension conditions, respectively, at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. Specific primers were prepared for the human gene FXYD3 (GenBank accession number NM_005971) (forward, 5′-ATGCAGAAGGTGACCCTGGGCCTG-3′, reverse, 5′-TCAGCTTTGGGCTGAGCCTGGGG-3′). The housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was amplified as a control. PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light. Cell Lysis and Western Blotting—Cellular extracts for immunoblotting analysis were prepared as follows. Cells grown on Petri dishes were washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with trypsin/EDTA. The cell suspension was diluted in culture medium and centrifuged at 110 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline before being frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for subsequent analysis. Cells were suspended on ice, in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl, 0,5% digitonin, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). After 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation, resuspended cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,600 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and the protein content was determined by the method of Lowry. Proteins (50 μg) were directly subjected to SDS-PAGE or to immunoprecipitations under non-denaturing conditions and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, overnight at 40 V. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibody. The following primary antibodies were used: hFXYD3 (1/500), Na,K-ATPase α subunit (1/10,000), villin (Serotec Ltd., United Kingdom) (1/500), and actin (Sigma) (1/5,000). Primary antibody binding was detected using the following secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1/10,000, Amersham Biosciences). Detection was achieved with the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. N-terminal Sequencing—Five ng of His-tagged hFXYD3-lf cRNA was injected in Xenopus oocytes. After 48 h, microsomes were prepared, and the His-tagged fusion protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Qiagen). The column-bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% digitonin containing 200 mm imidazole. The purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol, overnight at 40 V. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then washed 5 min in distilled water and 5 min in methanol. The protein band was then visualized by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol followed by destaining with 50% methanol and by washing with distilled water. The excised protein band was then subjected to N-terminal sequencing done by J. P. Andrieu (Laboratoire d'Enzymologie moléculaire, Institut de Biologie Structurale Jean-Pierre Ebel, Grenoble, France). Electrophysiological Measurements—Electrophysiological measurements were performed 3 days after oocyte injections with rat α1 (10 ng) and β1 (1 ng) cRNAs alone or together with FXYD3-sf, FXYD3-lf, FXYD1, FXYD2, or chimeric FXYD1, FXYD2 cRNA by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Measurements of the apparent external K+ affinity were carried out as described previously (22Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 μm ouabain that inhibits the endogenous Na,K-pump but not the expressed ouabain-resistant rat Na,K-ATPase. The maximal pump current and the apparent K+ affinity (K1/2 K+) measured in the presence or absence of external Na+ (100 mm) were obtained by fitting the Hill equation to the data using a Hill coefficient of 1.6 or 1, respectively (27Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Measurements of the apparent Na+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase were performed as described previously (28Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Beguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol.

The maximal current (Imax) and the apparent Na+ affinity (K1/2 Na+) were fitted by using the Hill equation and a Hill coefficient of 3. For the determination of FXYD3-induced current, electrophysiological measurements were performed 3 days after oocyte injections with mouse FXYD3, FXYD3-sf, or FXYD3-lf cRNA by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Briefly, oocytes were placed in a recording chamber in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dextrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage steps were done from potentials at –10 mV as described by Morrisson et al. (9Morrison B.W. Moorman J.R. Kowdley G.C. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Expression Pattern of FXYD3 in Human Colon Adenocarcinoma Cells—Human colon adenocarcinoma cells, CaCo-2 cells, exhibit a typical enterocytic differentiation, spontaneously after confluency. FXYD3 mRNA expression was assessed by using RT-PCR during the differentiation process. Total RNA was amplified using primers that span all exons of human FXYD3. As shown in Fig. 1A, two FXYD3 mRNA species could be revealed, a lower molecular mass species (FXYD3-sf) present all along during differentiation and a higher molecular mass species (FXYD3-lf) present only in non-differentiated CaCo-2 cells. Together with FXYD3-sf, FXYD3-lf was also slightly expressed in three other human intestinal carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). To verify translation and visualize whether alterations of FXYD3 transcript expression during differentiation results in alterations of FXYD3 protein levels, we performed Western blot analysis. Villin, which plays a major role in the initiation of brush-border assembly (29Friederich E. Pringault E. Arpin M. Louvard D. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was used as a marker for enterocytic differentiation of CaCo-2 cells (30Vecchini F. Pringault E. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Hausel P. Felley-Bosco E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Western blot analysis showed 2 FXYD3 translation products, the expression of which differed during differentiation of CaCo-2 cells (Fig. 1, C and D, upper panel). The FXYD3-lf protein was the major form in non-differentiated cells and its expression slightly decreased during differentiation, whereas the FXYD3-sf protein was the major form in differentiated cells and its expression increased during differentiation (Fig. 1E). Moreover, Western blot analysis showed the expression of FXYD3-lf transcripts not only in CaCo-2 cells but also in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (Fig. 1F), indicating that the expression of FXYD3-lf is not restricted to CaCo-2 cells. PCR products of the two FXYD3 transcripts in CaCo-2 cells were isolated and sequenced. Sequences corresponded to sequences reported in GenBank (NM_005971 and NM_021910) and revealed the presence of two transcript variants of the human FXYD3 gene in CaCo-2 cells. FXYD3-lf corresponds to the full-length transcript, whereas FXYD-sf contains an in-frame deletion of 78 nucleotides in the coding sequence compared with the full-length variant. FXYD3-sf corresponds to the common form of FXYD3 and has a 73.6% sequence identity with mouse FXYD3. At the protein level, the 78 extra nucleotides in FXYD3-lf correspond to a 26-amino acid insertion right after the putative transmembrane domain of FXYD3 (Fig. 2A). Processing of Human FXYD3 Isoforms—We have previously shown that the signal peptide of mouse FXYD3 is not cleaved during synthesis despite prediction by the SignalIIP 3.0 program (16Crambert G. Li C. Claeys D. Geering K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mouse FXYD3 thus has two transmembrane segments in contrast to other FXYD proteins, which are type I membrane proteins. Similar to mouse FXYD3, a signal peptide cleavage site is predicted between amino acids Ala20 and Asn21 in human FXYD3 isoforms (Fig. 2A). To test whether the signal peptide is cleaved or not, we expressed wild type human FXYD3 isoforms or a N-terminal truncated mutant, lacking 22 N-terminal amino acids (Fig. 2A), in a reticulocyte lysate or in Xenopus oocytes. As shown in Fig. 2B, the wild type human FXYD3-lf, synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate, migrated at the same molecular mass in the"
https://openalex.org/W2149744473,"Supernatant protein factor (SPF) is a novel cholesterol biosynthesis-accelerating protein expressed in liver and small intestine. Here, we report on the physiological role of SPF by using Spf-deficient mice. Although plasma cholesterol levels were similar in chow-fed Spf-/- and wild-type (WT) mice, fasting significantly decreased plasma cholesterol levels in Spf-/- mice but not in WT mice. While fasting reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis rate in WT mice, a more pronounced reduction was observed in Spf-/- mice. The expression of cholesterogenic enzymes was dramatically suppressed by fasting both in WT and Spf-/- mice. In contrast, hepatic SPF expression of WT mice was up-regulated by fasting in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha)-dependent manner. These results indicate that in WT mice, the decrease of hepatic cholesterol synthesis under fasting conditions is at least in part compensated by SPF up-regulation. Fibrates, which function as a PPAR-alpha agonist and are widely used as hypotriglycemic drugs, reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis and plasma cholesterol levels by approximately one-half in Spf-/- mice but not in WT mice. These findings suggest that co-administration of fibrates and an SPF inhibitor may reduce not only plasma triglyceride but also cholesterol levels, indicating that SPF is a promising hypocholesterolemic drug target."

It has a substrate specificity for small uncharged residues at -1 (P1) and aliphatic residues at the -3 (P3) position. Previously, we have reported that certain alterations of the Ile-144 and Ile-86 residues in Escherichia coli signal peptidase I (SPase) can change the specificity such that signal peptidase is able to cleave pro-OmpA nuclease A in vitro after phenylalanine or asparagine residues at the -1 position (Karla, A., Lively, M.

The double mutant tolerated arginine, glutamine, and tyrosine residues at the -3 position of the substrate. The altered specificity of the I144C/I86T mutant was confirmed by in vivo processing of pre-β-lactamase containing non-canonical arginine and glutamine residues at the -3 position.

In the case of the E. coli SPase I, Ser-90 is the nucleophilic residue that attacks the scissile bond of the precursor substrate and lysine 145 is the general base that deprotonates the serine residue (for review, see Ref. 11Paetzel M. Karla A. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A critical serine and lysine residue is also present in SPases from other species of bacteria (12van Dijl J.M. de Jong A. Venema G. Bron S. J. Biol.

Green N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37750-37754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With the exception of the mitochondrial inner membrane peptidase I (Imp1), all type I signal peptidases carry out processing with a specificity for small aliphatic residues at the -1 (P1) and -3 (P3) positions (11Paetzel M. Karla A. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4549-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Alanine is usually the preferred amino acid residue at the -1 and -3 positions and results in the frequently observed “Ala-X-Ala” motif for signal peptide cleavage (14von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 15Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 16von Heijne G. J. Mol.

The residues of SPase I that comprise the substrate binding site have been identified by solving the x-ray structure of the soluble catalytic domain with a covalently attached 5S penem inhibitor (10Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and a structure with a non-covalent lipo-hexapeptide inhibitor (17Paetzel M. Goodall J.J. Kania M. Dalbey R.E. Page M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30781-30790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of SPase I with no inhibitor bound (apo-structure) revealed that there is some variation in the binding pocket volume when compared with the inhibitor-bound structures (18Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The E. coli SPase residues making direct van der Waals contact with the P1 methyl group are Met-91, Ile-144, Leu-95, and Ile-86. Those making contact with the P3 residues are Phe-84, Ile-144, Val-132, and Ile-86. The substrate binding to SPase I occurs in an extended conformation. Recently, we have made mutations of the E. coli SPase I in the S1 and S3 pockets that bind the P1 and P3 residues of the substrate to identify the residues that control the substrate specificity (19Karla A. Lively M.O. Paetzel M. Dalbey R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6731-6741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We found that alterations of the Ile-144 and Ile-86 residues to alanine residues could alter the substrate specificity and lead to cleavage after a -1 Phe residue in vitro. Defining the SPase residues that control the substrate specificity is important because it provides insight into how SPase is able to locate the site of cleavage at the cell membrane surface. Recognition of the substrate by SPase at the correct site is challenging because the substrate specificity determinant Ala-X-Ala is a common motif in proteins. In addition to the importance of the SPase S1 and S3 subsites in recognition of the correct cleavage site, it is likely that the interaction of the SPase catalytic domain with the membrane is important for high fidelity of the enzyme (10Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 20van Klompenburg W. Paetzel M. de Jong J.M. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this paper we have systematically determined the substrate specificity of various signal peptidase Ile-144 single mutants and Ile-144/Ile-86 double mutants by using a powerful fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based peptide library approach. These mutants exhibited a more relaxed substrate specificity at the -3 position, with the double mutant tolerating glutamine and arginine as P3 residues. In a cellular assay, the SPase I144C/I86T mutant efficiently cleaved a pre-β-lactamase mutant with a glutamine or arginine at the -3 position. These results show that Ile-144 and Ile-86 play critical roles in controlling the substrate specificity at the -3 position and demonstrate the power of this new combinatorial library method for determining the substrate specificity of proteases. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The E. coli strain DH5α was obtained from our laboratory collection although the E. coli temperature-sensitive SPase I strain, IT41, was obtained from Dr. Yoshikazu Nakamura (21Inada T. Court D.L. Ito K. Nakamura Y. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 585-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pRD8, which contains the SPase I gene in the pING vector, and pUC19 were obtained from our collection. The plasmid pGZ119HE was generously provided by Dr. Andreas Kuhn. Construction of Plasmids—To examine the ability of various SPase binding pocket mutants to process β-lactamase mutants, a two-plasmid system was employed requiring the preparation of two constructs. The construction of the two plasmids was accomplished as follows. First, the SPase mutants were subcloned from the pET23b vector (19Karla A. Lively M.O. Paetzel M. Dalbey R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6731-6741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to avoid the concomitant expression of WT β-lactamase from this vector in these studies. To this end, SPase was subcloned into the SmaI/SalI site of the pGZ119HE vector (22Lessl M. Balzer D. Lurz R. Waters V.L. Guiney D.G. Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pGZ119HE is suitable for this study because it possesses the ColD origin of replication and confers chloramphenicol resistance. The pET23b plasmids bearing the various SPase mutants were digested with SalI and SmaI in the same reaction vessel using 1.5× Universal Buffer (Stratagene), and the DNA fragment containing SPase was purified by excision from an agarose gel. The pGZ119HE vector was prepared in the same way and the two were ligated to produce the pGZ119HE-SPase expression vector. The resulting DNA was sequenced to confirm successful subcloning of SPase. Second, a plasmid capable of expressing E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase (UniRef90_P62593) was needed that could be simultaneously transformed with the SPase mutants. For this vector, we modified pRD8 by removing the SPase gene (23Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15925-15931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pRD8 plasmid contains the ColE1 replication origin and the bla gene for ampicillin resistance and is thus compatible with the pGZ119HE-SPase expression vector. Additionally, β-lactamase can be highly expressed from this plasmid by the addition of 0.2% arabinose. The pRD8 plasmid was digested with the SalI and SmaI enzymes as described above and the products were separated on an agarose gel. The DNA fragment corresponding to the doubly cut vector was excised and purified from the gel. The 5′ overhangs left by SalI digestion were filled in with Klenow and the resulting DNA was then ligated to produce what is essentially the original pING vector (24Johnston S. Lee J.H. Ray D.S. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 34: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additionally, pUC19 empty vector was also used in the pulse-chase studies to express β-lactamase. The plasmid, pUC19, contains the pMB1 origin of replication and can be co-transformed with the pGZ119HE-SPase constructs. In addition, it expresses β-lactamase constitutively at high level. The pING and pUC19 plasmids were then modified using the QuikChange (Stratagene Inc.) site-specific mutagenesis method to incorporate different amino acid residues at the position -3 to the cleavage site. Purification of β-Lactamase—β-Lactamase was purified using the PheBo system from MoBiTec (Goettigen, Germany) that utilizes phenylboronate-agarose resin for the specific purification of β-lactamase. The purification was conducted as described in the manual. First, DH5α cells were transformed with the pUC19 vector containing either WT or mutant β-lactamase and were grown to saturation at 37 °C. Cells were isolated by low speed centrifugation (4000 × g, Beckman JA-10) and the periplasmic fraction was isolated by osmotic shocking of the E. coli cells. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold STE buffer (20% sucrose, 200 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm EDTA, pH 9.0) with gentle shaking for 20 min and then pelleted (10,000 × g, Beckman JA-10). The pellet was then resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, with gentle shaking for 20 min and then centrifuged (10,000 × g, Beckman JA-10). At this step, the supernatant containing the periplasmic cell fraction was isolated. β-Lactamase was precipitated from the periplasmic fraction with ammonium sulfate (130 g into a 200-ml periplasmic fraction) and the precipitated proteins were dissolved in 20 mm triethanolamine, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.0, buffer and applied to the phenylboronate column. Elution was performed with borate buffer to elute the β-lactamase. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to determine the masses of the SPase cleavage products. The sites of cleavage of wild-type and the -3 Trp β-lactamase were determined by comparison of the predicted masses of the product proteins to the observed masses. Theoretical molecular masses of the proteins were calculated using the PeptideMass program (25Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from intact cells as described above and the samples precipitated for mass spectrometry analysis. β-Lactamase fractions purified by phenylboronate-agarose chromatography were first precipitated with a final concentration of 12% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h on ice. Precipitated proteins were then centrifuged at maximum speed at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 20 min. The trichloroacetic acid supernatant was carefully removed and the pellet was washed with ice-cold 90% acetone, vortexed, and centrifuged again at maximum speed for 15 min. The acetone supernatant was carefully removed and the acetone wash was repeated once. The protein pellet was finally dried of all residual acetone. The precipitated β-lactamase protein pellets were dissolved by addition of 5 μl of 10% formic acid. The dissolved proteins were mixed with the MALDI matrix solution: 5 μl of saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 500 μl of CH3CN). The aluminum MALDI-TOF target plate was spotted with 1 μl of each reaction sample containing matrix and analyzed using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex mass spectrometer in the linear mode. The instrument was calibrated with a mixture of protein standards including insulin (5,734.6 Da); cytochrome c (12,361.1 Da), and myoglobin (16,952.6 Da). The mass accuracy in the 30-kDa mass range is approximately ±25 Da. Pulse-Chase Assay of β-Lactamase Processing—Competent cells of the IT41 strain were prepared using the CaCl2 method and co-transformed with the various mutants of the pGZ119HE-SPase and pING vectors. In the later studies that incorporate the P2F mutation in addition to the -3 mutations in β-lactamase, pUC19 was used to express these mutants of β-lactamase alongside the pGZ119HE-SPase vector. For culturing IT41, all media were prepared with a reduced salt concentration of 2.5 g of NaCl/liter (LS2.5 media). IT41 cells carrying the plasmids for SPase and β-lactamase were then grown at 30 °C on solid LS2.5 media until colonies were 1-2 mm in diameter. These were then transferred to liquid LS2.5 media and grown to a cell density of 0.3-0.5 A600. At this point, the cells were transferred to M9 media containing 0.5% fructose plus 19 amino acids minus methionine and incubated at 30 °C. Even at this permissive temperature, the chromosomal SPase I activity is strongly impaired. After 30 min, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% for 10 min to increase the expression of β-lactamase from the pING vector. For co-transformants utilizing the pUC19 vector for β-lactamase expression, the arabinose induction was omitted. The cells were pulsed with Trans35S-label for 1 min and then chased with nonradioactive methionine for the indicated times. At each time point, samples were quenched with a 10% final concentration of trichloroacetic acid in preparation for immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-β-lactamase polyclonal antibody (Chemicon Int.). Materials for Peptide Library—PL-PEGA resin (0.2 mmol/g, 300-500 μm) was purchased from Polymer Laboratories Ltd. (Amherst, MA). All of the reagents for peptide synthesis were purchased from Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY), Novabiochem (San Diego, CA), or Bachem (Torrance, CA). Sodium 5-((2-aminoethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonate (EDANS) was purchased from Invitrogen Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and Acros Organics (Belgium). Synthesis of Peptide Library I—Peptide library I, Fmoc-K(DABCYL)ATXXXXATE(EDANS)BBRM-resin, was synthesized using the standard Fmoc/HBTU/HOBt synthesis protocol (X = 18 natural amino acids except cysteine and methionine, B = β-alanine). The PL-PEGA resin was used as the solid support. The synthesis was carried out on 1.5 g of PEGA resin in a reaction vessel specifically designed for manual peptide synthesis. First, the 7-residue constant region, ATE(Allyl)BBRM, was synthesized with 4 eq of reagents. Next, the random region was generated using the split-pool synthesis method (26Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). The resin was evenly divided into 18 aliquots and placed into 18 separate reaction vessels. Each aliquot was coupled with a different amino acid (4 equivalents of reagent, 30 min) and the coupling reaction was repeated once. Then, the resin from all the vessels was combined, mixed, washed exhaustively with DMF, and the Fmoc group was removed by treatment with 20% piperidine/DMF twice (5 + 15 min). The resin was then redistributed into 18 reaction vessels, and this process was repeated until a library with four randomized positions was generated. After the construction of the entire peptide chain was completed, the allyl group was selectively removed using 1 eq of Pd(PPh3)4 in CHCl3/AcOH/N-methylmorpholine (37:2:1) under argon at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 0.5% N,N-diisopropylethylamine/DMF and 0.5% diethyldithiocarbamate/DMF after 3 h and the resin was washed exhaustively with DMF. The resin was then treated twice with 5-fold excess of a EDANS-sodium salt/HBTU/HOBt mixture for 4 h at room temperature and washed with DMF and methanol until the white precipitate that had formed throughout the reaction completely disappeared. Finally, the side chain protecting groups were removed with a cleavage mixture containing 4.75 ml of trifluoroacetic acid, 0.2 ml of thioanisole, 0.1 ml of anisole, and 0.1 ml of ethanedithiol for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was washed with CH2Cl2 (5 × 10 ml) and stored in the same solvent in the swollen form at 4 °C. Synthesis of Peptide Library II—Fully protected peptide library I from above, Fmoc-K(DABCYL)ATXXXXATE(Allyl)BBRM-resin, was treated with 20% piperidine/DMF twice (5 + 15 min) to remove the NH2-terminal Fmoc group. The resulting resin was washed with DMF and water, and soaked in water overnight. The water was drained and the resin was treated with 1 eq of Fmoc-OSu and N,N-diisopropylethylamine in CH2Cl2 while vigorously shaking for 30 min to achieve the Fmoc group coupling only on the surface of the beads. This procedure spatially segregated the beads into two layers; the peptides on the surface layer were NH2 terminally blocked by Fmoc group, whereas the interior peptides contained a free NH2 terminus (27Liu R. Marik J. Lam K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7678-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Next, the interior peptides were NH2 terminally blocked with a Boc group by the treatment of 4 eq of Boc-Gly-OH and HBTU/HOBt/N,N-diisopropylethylamine for 30 min twice. After removal of the NH2-terminal Fmoc group, the peptide sequence KKKKLLLLLLLLLL was coupled to the beads sequentially. The last lysine residue introduced was Ac-Lys(Boc)-OH with the same conditions. Removal of the allyl group from glutamic acid, addition of the EDANS group, and peptide deprotection were carried out as described above. On-bead Screening of Peptide Library—A typical screening reaction involved ∼30,000 beads of peptide libraries I or II. The beads were washed with water and the E. coli SPase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0), and treated with 250 μl of WT (0.4 mg/ml) or 400-800 μl of mutant E. coli SPase (I144A, 0.13 mg/ml; I144C, 0.061 mg/ml; I144C/I86T, 0.36 mg/ml) for 18 h at 37 °C in a 60 × 15-mm Petri dish (Baxter Scientific Products). The dish was viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus SZX12) using the appropriate filter set for the EDANS group (filter set for 1,5-IAEDANS group: exciter 360 nm, emitter 460 nm). Positive beads were identified by their intense turquoise color and removed from the library by a micropipette. A control screening was carried out under the same conditions with the exclusion of the enzyme. This screening resulted in no fluorescent beads. Peptide Sequencing—Positive beads from above were sequenced by the method of partial Edman degradation/mass spectrometry (PED/MS) as previously described (28Sweeney M.C. Pei D. J. Comb. Chem. 2003; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After washing with water and pyridine, the beads were suspended in 160 μl of pyridine and treated with 10% N-hydroxysuccinimidyl benzoate (Bz-OSu) for 12 min at room temperature. This blocked any free NH2 terminus including those resulting from enzymatic cleavage. The beads were then treated with 20% piperidine in DMF to remove the NH2-terminal Fmoc group and subjected to PED reactions and MS (28Sweeney M.C. Pei D. J. Comb. Chem. 2003; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—A model of the wild-type SPase in complex with the c-region of the β-lactamase signal peptide was built using the atomic coordinates from the crystal structure of signal peptidase in complex with a lipopeptide inhibitor (Protein Data Bank code 1T7D) as the template (17Paetzel M. Goodall J.J. Kania M. Dalbey R.E. Page M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30781-30790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The model for the E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase signal peptide (Sequence Swiss-Prot accession number Q1WBW3) was built into the active site of SPase using the acyl-enzyme penem inhibitor (29McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) and noncovalently bound lipopeptide inhibitor complexes (17Paetzel M. Goodall J.J. Kania M. Dalbey R.E. Page M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30781-30790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as a guide to position the P1 and P3 residues into the S1 and S3 binding pockets. The paths taken by the signal peptide along the surface of SPase and the parallel β-sheet-type hydrogen bonding interactions with SPase are similar to those observed in the lipopeptide-inhibitor complex structure. The model of the SPase double mutant (I144C/I86T) in complex with the -3 Argβ-lactamase signal peptide was built from the modeled wild-type complex. The mutations were made with the program COOT (30Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23356) Google Scholar). The models of the SPase/β-lactamase signal peptide complexes were energy minimized using the program CNS (31Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). Figures were prepared using the program PyMol (32DeLano W.L. PyMol.0.96 Ed. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The surface and binding site analysis was performed using the CASTp server (33Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Design, Synthesis, and Sequencing of FRET-based Peptide Library—A peptide library, Fmoc-K(DABCYL)ATXXXXATE(EDANS)BBRM-resin (X = 18 amino acids), was designed to probe the sequence specificity of WT and mutant E. coli SPase I (I, Fig. 1A). The peptide library was synthesized on a solid support using a split-pool methodology to generate a one bead-one sequence library (26Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). A polyethylene glycol and acrylamide-based amino PEGA1900 resin was chosen as the solid support due to its ability to swell in hydrophilic conditions thus allowing relatively large biomolecules such as enzymes to easily permeate the resin (34Meldal M. Svendsen I. Breddam K. Auzanneau F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Prior to enzymatic reaction, the resin beads are non-fluorescent due to efficient quenching of EDANS fluorescence by the DABCYL group within the same peptide. Upon enzymatic cleavage, however, the quencher group DABCYL is released into the solution and the beads carrying the cleaved substrates containing the EDANS group become intensely fluorescent. The fluorescent beads are easily detected and manually collected under a fluorescence microscope. The selected beads were then subjected to PED/MS, a sensitive and reliable method for sequence determination of support-bound peptides from combinatorial libraries (28Sweeney M.C. Pei D. J. Comb. Chem. 2003; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this method, a support bound peptide is converted into a series of sequence-related truncation products by treating the peptide with a 5:1 mixture of phenylisothiocyanate and N-hydroxysuccinimidyl nicotinate (Fig. 2B). The resulting peptide ladder was analyzed by MALDI-MS and the sequence of the original peptide is identified. In this study, the PED/MS procedure was slightly modified to reveal the site of enzymatic cleavage. The NH2 termini of the resin-bound peptides were protected with Fmoc groups during incubation with the enzyme (Fig. 1B). After treatment with SPase, the isolated fluorescent beads were treated with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl benzoate to cap the new amino termini produced by SPase. Thus attachment of the benzoyl group (Bz) marked the sites of cleavage (a, Fig. 1B). The remaining Fmoc groups on the uncleaved peptides were then removed and “partial” Edman degradation were performed to create the peptide ladder (Fig. 1B, see legend for details). The amino termini of the ladder were capped with the nicotinoyl group by treatment with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl nicotinate. In the resulting MALDI-TOF spectrum, the NH2-terminal benzoylated peptides produced by enzymatic cleavage of the resin-bound peptide have a mass that is 0.995 Da less than the corresponding N-nicotinoylated counterpart formed during the four cycles of partial Edman degradation. The mass spectrum allows the interpretation of the amino acid sequence present on the bead by calculating the differences between the nicotinoyl-labeled peptide fragments. The cleavage site is identified as the one benzoyl-labeled fragment with a mass 0.995 Da less than the corresponding nicotinoyl-labeled form. This approach permits the identification of the peptidase cleavage site"
https://openalex.org/W2080790025,"Cardiomyocytes expressing host markers, such as the Y chromosome in sex-mismatched transplants, have been described in human allografts, suggesting that circulating cells can contribute to cardiac regeneration. It has not been established, however, whether host-derived cardiomyocytes result from transdifferentiation of stem cells or cell fusion. To address this issue, we used heterotopic heart xenografts and looked for markers of donor and recipient cells. Golden Syrian hamsters or transgenic mice expressing nuclear beta-galactosidase under the control of the cardiac troponin I promoter served as organ donors, while GFP+ transgenic rats were used as recipients. GFP+ cells, including abundant CD-45+ inflammatory cells and rare undifferentiated cells expressing early cardiac markers (GATA-4 or MEF2C), were found in xenografts harvested two weeks after surgery. In addition, rare GFP+ mature cardiomyocytes were found in 7 of 8 hamster xenografts and 6 of 6 mouse xenografts. The proportion of these cells was very low (0.0001% to 0.0344% in hamster xenografts) but similar to the one observed in control rat heart allografts. Without exception, all GFP+ cardiomyocytes also expressed donor markers, i.e., hamster membrane antigens or lacZ, so they must derive from cell fusion, not transdifferentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1987933525,"Electrocytes, the current-producing cells of electric organs (EOs) in electric fish, are unique in that they derive from striated muscle and they possess biochemical characteristics of both muscle and non-muscle cells. In the freshwater teleost Sternopygus macrurus, electrocytes are multinucleated cells that do not contract yet retain expression of some proteins common to skeletal muscle cells. Given the role that transcriptional regulation plays in the activation of the myogenic program in vertebrates, we examined the expression patterns of several genes associated with multiple functions of skeletal muscle in mature electrocytes of S. macrurus. Our expression analyses detected transcripts for alpha-actin, alpha-acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (alpha-AChR), desmin, muscle creatine kinase (MCK), myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, titin, tropomyosin, and troponin-T genes in the EO. However, immunolabeling studies revealed that electrocytes do not contain MCK, MHCs, or tropomyosin or troponin-T proteins. These results underscore the contribution of gene regulatory mechanisms in the maintenance of the muscle-like phenotype of EO that may be transcriptional-independent. We also report the classification and frequency of distinct transcripts from a random selection of 420 clones from an EO cDNA library. This is the first characterization of expressed genes in an EO, and it is an important step toward identifying mechanisms that affect different muscle protein systems for the evolution of highly specialized noncontractile tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2074085822,"Calmodulin, regulatory, and essential myosin light chain are evolutionary conserved proteins that, by binding to IQ motifs of target proteins, regulate essential intracellular processes among which are efficiency of secretory vesicles release at synapsis, intracellular signaling, and regulation of cell division. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae calmodulin Cmd1 and the essential myosin light chain Mlc1p share the ability to interact with the class V myosin Myo2p and Myo4 and the class II myosin Myo1p. These myosins are required for vesicle, organelle, and mRNA transport, spindle orientation, and cytokinesis. We have used the budding yeast model system to study how calmodulin and essential myosin light chain selectively regulate class V myosin function. NMR structural analysis of uncomplexed Mlc1p and interaction studies with the first three IQ motifs of Myo2p show that the structural similarities between Mlc1p and the other members of the EF-hand superfamily of calmodulin-like proteins are mainly restricted to the C-lobe of these proteins. The N-lobe of Mlc1p presents a significantly compact and stable structure that is maintained both in the free and complexed states. The Mlc1p N-lobe interacts with the IQ motif in a manner that is regulated both by the IQ motifs sequence as well as by light chain structural features. These characteristic allows a distinctive interaction of Mlc1p with the first IQ motif of Myo2p when compared with calmodulin. This finding gives us a novel view of how calmodulin and essential light chain, through a differential binding to IQ1 of class V myosin motor, regulate this activity during vegetative growth and cytokinesis.

This finding gives us a novel view of how calmodulin and essential light chain, through a differential binding to IQ1 of class V myosin motor, regulate this activity during vegetative growth and cytokinesis. Myosin V are processive motors that transport a variety of intracellular cargo in a manner that is timely, selectively, and reversibly regulated by its interaction with different proteins via their cargo bound domain (1Sellers J.R.

Myosin V display a dimeric heavy chain containing several light chain binding sites called IQ motifs. The so-called IQ motif (∼23-25 residues), with a consensus sequence of the form IQXXXRGXXXR, is repeated tandemly (2-6 times) in the heavy chain of many myosins.

Recent structural and genetic studies point to a previously uncovered role for calmodulin/myosin light chain interaction with the class V myosin IQ motifs in regulating the cargo binding abilities of this class of motors (12Li X.D.

Yeast calmodulin (Cmd1) was the first myosin light chain discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, (9Cyert M.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 647-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Among the Cmd1 targets there is the class V myosin Myo2p to which the essential myosin light chain 1 (Mlc1p) also binds (15Stevens R.C. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Unlike calmodulin, Mlc1p does not bind to calcium or other divalent ions (3May K.M. Win T.Z. Hyams J.S. Cell Motil.

Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1576-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). One of the puzzling features of the mechanism by which CaM and myosin light chain by binding to IQ motifs regulate target protein activity is given by the redundancy of IQ motifs in myosins as well as by the presence in the cellular environment of several types of light chain and target IQ motifs. How each light chain specifically recognizes its target IQ motif and by which mechanism such an interaction regulates target protein activity is unclear. The flexibility of light chain structure as well as that of the target protein upon CaM or light chain interaction with IQ motifs might be one of the mechanisms by which such regulation is achieved (10Terrak M.

The structure of complexes of Mlc1p with three of the six Myo2p IQ motifs were solved by x-ray crystallography (10Terrak M. Wu G. Stafford W.F. Lu R.C. Dominguez R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Terrak M. Rebowski G. Lu R.C. Grabarek Z. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12718-12723Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Like all other members of the calmodulin superfamily, the structure of Mlc1p shows a dumbbell-shaped structure with similar N- and C-terminal lobes, each of which contains two EF-hand motifs flanked by tightly structured domains. Depending on the IQ sequence, Mlc1p is capable of binding Myo2p using both lobes (IQ2 and IQ3) or only the C-lobe (IQ4). When it interacts with the IQ motif, the N-lobe displays a closed conformation, whereas the C-lobe undergoes upon binding a conformational change, leading to a semi-open conformation (19Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To understand how calmodulin and Mlc1p differently and/or co-ordinately regulate Myo2p activity during cytokinesis by responding to different intracellular signals, we have used NMR analysis to determine the structure assumed by Mlc1p before Myo2p IQ motif binding. In addition, we have mapped the region of Mlc1p involved in the interaction with the first three IQ motifs present in Myo2p. Our results show that the closed conformation of the Mlc1p C-lobe is very similar to that found for calmodulin proteins, suggesting a common openingclosure mechanism for all the myosin light chains. The differences among Mlc1p and other calmodulins are mainly localized in the N-lobe that shows, in the case of Mlc1p, a rather compact and stable structure characterized by some features that are unique to this protein. We show that these features differentiate the interaction mode of CaM and Mlc1p when they interact with the first IQ motif of the class V myosin Myo2p. Cloning and Plasmid Construction—For pET15b-CMD1, a 0.48-kilobase fragment containing CMD1 was amplified by PCR using the oligos CMD1/13/NdeI forward (5′-ATAAAAAAGTCATATGTCCTCCAATCTTACCGAAG-3′) and CMD1/+460/BamHI reverse (5′-AATCACAAGGATCCACCTATTTAGATAAC-3′ and genomic K699 DNA as template (16Wagner W. Bielli P. Wacha S. Ragnini-Wilson A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6397-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the fragment was digested with BamHI-NdeI and cloned into the BamHI-NdeI sites of pET15b. For pET15b-MLC1, a 0.48-kilobase fragment containing MLC1 was amplified by PCR using the oligos MLC1/-12/NdeI forward (5′-CATAGAATACATATGTCAGCCACCAGAGCCAATAAAG-3′) and MLC1/+471/BamHI reverse 5′-TAAATTTGTGGATCCGCACTCTCATTGTCTC-3′ and as DNA template YCp111MLC1 (16Wagner W. Bielli P. Wacha S. Ragnini-Wilson A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6397-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the fragment was digested with BamHI-NdeI and cloned into the BamHI-NdeI sites of pET15b. Protein Expression and IQ Interaction—15N- or 13C,15N-la-beled Mlc1p were expressed in Escherichia coli cells BL21(DE3) using a pET-15b expression vector. The cells were grown in M9 minimal media containing (15NH4)2SO4 and [13C]glucose. Expression was achieved by incubating the cells with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.7 for 4 h at 37 °C. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Further purification of the protein was achieved by gel filtration chromatography (prepSuperdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the first three IQ motifs of Myo2p (KMHNSIVMIQKKIRAKYYRKQYL, QISQAIKYLQNNIKGFIIRQRVNDE, and MKVNCATLLQAAYRGHSIRANVF, corresponding to IQ1, IQ2, and IQ3, respectively) were purchased from C4T (Rome, Italy). Aliquots corresponding roughly to 0.2 eq of the IQ peptide were added stepwise to Mlc1p, and the titration was monitored by collecting two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra after each addition. The peptide was added until no change in the spectrum was detected. The pH was fixed at 6.5, and the Mlc1p concentration was ∼0.2-0.4 mm. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples contained 0.8 mm Mlc1p in 60 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, 0.33 m NaCl, and 0.01% NaN3. All NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with pulsed field gradient triple resonance probes. Distance restraints were obtained from 15N NOESY-HSQC and aromatic and aliphatic 13C NOESY-HSQC spectra. A set of 3JHNHα was determined by measuring cross-peak intensities in the HNHA spectrum. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured using two different salt concentrations. At 0.33 m NaCl, the IPAP experiment (20Ottinger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) and the three-dimensional HACACO (21Cicero D.O. Contessa G.M. Paci M. Bazzo R. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 180: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were used for the measurements of HN-N and Hα-Cα RDC, respectively. At 0.1 m NaCl, variations of the experiments described by McFeeters et al. (22McFeeters R.L. Fowler C.A. Gaponenko V.V. Byrd R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were used for the HN-N and Cα-CO RDC measurements. These experiments, which are based on the J-modulation of the signal corresponding to the HN, were separated in two-dimensional using the CO nuclei instead of the N nuclei. The three-dimensional HACACO (21Cicero D.O. Contessa G.M. Paci M. Bazzo R. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 180: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was used for Hα-Cα RDC measurement. The samples used for RDC also contain 16 mg/ml filamentous phage Pf1 (Asla Labs) to induce the molecular alignment. The Mlc1p·IQ1complex was partially assigned by analysis of HNCO, HNCA, CBCAcoNH and HACACO experiments. The NMR data were processed and analyzed on Linux and Silicon Graphics workstations using NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and NMRView (24Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar) programs. 15N relaxation measurements were conducted at 700 MHz at pH 6.8 and 25 °C temperature. Protein concentration was 1.5 mm. Results are shown in the supplemental data. Structure Calculation—Structure calculations and refinement were performed with XPLOR-NIH (25Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M J. Magn. Res. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). For the N-lobe structure calculation (residues 2-79) we used the refinement protocol described by Chou et al. (26Chou J.J. Shipeng L. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and a set of 93 HN-N, 97 Hα-Cα and 42 Cα-CO RDCs, obtained by combining the two salt concentrations. After the two-step refinement process, a structure representing the free N-lobe was obtained and deposited together with the constraint list in the Protein Data Bank (code 2FCD). The C-lobe structure (residues 80-149) was calculated using a simulated annealing protocol (27O'Donoghue S.I. King G.F. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and a refinement against a data base of Ramachandran plot dihedral angles (28Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Tjandra N. J. Magn.

Backbone dihedral restraints (φ and ψ angles) were derived from chemical shift analysis using the program TALOS (30Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). A set of 118 1H,15N, 83 Hα-Cα, and 53 Ca-CO residual dipolar couplings was included in the refinement. Fitting of the observed RDCs to a preliminary structure using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method (31Losonczi J.A. Andrec M. Fischer M.W. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9013-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) within the PALES program (33Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (593) Google Scholar) provided an initial guess for the magnitude and orientation of the molecular alignment tensor for each of the two alignment conditions used. Subsequently, these values were optimized during the simulated annealing process The ensemble of the 20 lowest energy target function structures (from a total of 500), in which the number of residues in favored regions of Ramachandran plot is higher than 90%, was chosen to represent the protein solution structure and together with the constraints lists were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2FCE). The programs AQUA and PROCHECK (34Laskowsky R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486PubMed Google Scholar) were used to analyze the structures. Table 1 reports the structural statistics. To carry out a complete cross-validation of RDCs, a series of simulated annealing calculations were performed, each lacking 10% of the RDCs (randomly chosen from the whole dataset) (35Clore G.M. Garrett D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9008-9012Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The missing RDCs in each run were back-calculated to determine how well each RDC could be predicted; an average Rfree of 0.25 ± 0.08 was obtained.TABLE 1Experimental restraints and structural statistics for the 20 lowest energy structures of the C-domain of Mlc1pNumber of experimental restraints1245Distance restraints from NOEs843Intraresidue274Interesidue569Hydrogen bond distance restraintsaHN-O and N-O distances were constrained to 2.1 ± 0.5 and 3.0 ± 0.5 Å, respectively.23Dihedral angle restraints125φ constraints63ψ constraints62H-N RDCs118bTotal number for the two alignment conditions used (see text).Hα-Cα RDCs83bTotal number for the two alignment conditions used (see text).Cα-CO RDCs53Average number of restraints per residue17.8XPLOR energies (kcal/mol)cvdw, cdih, rama and sani energy terms refer to Van der Waals, dihedral angles, Ramachandran potential and dipolar couplings constraints, respectively.Etotal786.0 ± 9.7Ebond9.3 ± 0.5Eangle125.0 ± 2.9Eimproper29.5 ± 0.8Evdw31.2 ± 1.4Ecdih10.3 ± 0.9Erama259.0 ± 4.0Erioe24.1 ± 6.1Esani297.6 ± 3.8r.m.s.d. from experimental restraintsAverage distance restraints violation (Å)0.036 ± 0.004Average dihedral angle restraints violation (deg)1.13 ± 0.05Average H-N RDCs violation (Hz)0.974 ± 0.008Average Hα-Cα RDCs violation (Hz)0.667 ± 0.009dNormalized to the H-N value.Average Cα-CO RDCs violation (Hz)2.82 ± 0.04dNormalized to the H-N value.Rfree %25 ± 8r.m.s.d. from idealized covalent geometryBond (Å)0.00288 ± 0.00007Angle (°)0.633 ± 0.007Improper (°)0.591 ± 0.008Ramachandran analysisResidues in favored regions (%)91.5 ± 1.3Residues in additional allowed regions (%)6.9 ± 1.3Residues in generously allowed regions (%)1.6 ± 0.0Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.0 ± 0.0Coordinates precisionBackbone (Å)0.33 ± 0.05All heavy atoms (Å)0.90 ± 0.05a HN-O and N-O distances were constrained to 2.1 ± 0.5 and 3.0 ± 0.5 Å, respectively.b Total number for the two alignment conditions used (see text).c vdw, cdih, rama and sani energy terms refer to Van der Waals, dihedral angles, Ramachandran potential and dipolar couplings constraints, respectively.d Normalized to the H-N value. Open table in a new tab When we started this work three structures of uncomplexed proteins in the metal-free form belonging to the calmodulin family were already published. NMR structures were available for Xenopus laevis calmodulin, CaM (PDB code 1CFD) (36Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and of S. cerevisiae calmodulin, Cmd1 (PDB code 1LKJ) (37Ishida H. Nakashima K. Kumaki Y. Nakata M. Hikichi K. Yazawa M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15536-15542Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The structure of the Mlc1p homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cdc4p, was also published (PDB code 1GGW) (38Slupsky C.M. Desautels M. Huebert T. Zhao R. Hemmingsen S.M. McIntosh L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) The two calmodulin proteins exhibit very similar conformation of the N and C domain. On the other hand, Cdc4p was described as having a very unusual open conformation for the C-lobe, very different from that of the two calmodulins. This result suggests a significant difference between calmodulin and other myosin light chains that can be interpreted as the basis of a different transition between the free and bound states. In view of that, we have decided to determine the solution structure of uncomplexed Mlc1p, which can be used to test this hypothesis. The complete assignment of Mlc1p was already described (Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) entry 6332) (39Melino S. Pennestri M. Santoprete A. Bielli P. Paci M. RagniniWilson A. Cicero D.O. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; 31: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this work we have characterized by NMR the solution structure of Mlc1p using a combination of RDCs, 1H-1H distances derived from NOEs, and dihedral information derived from three bonds HN-Hα coupling constants and chemical shift information. RDCs are nowadays used as a complement to more classical NMR-derived constraints like interproton distances and angles (40Grishaev A. Bax A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The orientation information that is contained in RDCs constitutes valuable information that helps to define more precisely the conformation of a protein in solution. To obtain this information, it is necessary to partially align the protein in a liquid crystal medium. As Mlc1p an acidic protein, the use of Pf1 liquid crystal (41Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) is particularly advantageous for the measurement of RDCs. In this work we have explored the possibility of having two different degrees of alignment by changing the salt concentration. In fact, the alignment is the consequence of electrostatic repulsion between negative charges located in the filamentous phage and the protein. Low salt concentration will favor a higher degree of alignment, whereas increasing amounts of salt will shield the repulsion, leading to smaller values of the observed RDCs. In this study we have used salt concentrations of 0.33 m and 0.1 m (NaCl). No change in chemical shift was evident between these two experimental conditions, indicating that the structure remains unaltered. A set of 231 and 256 RDCs were measured for the N-lobe and the C-lobe, respectively, combining the two alignment conditions. These include one bond 1H-15N, 1Hα-13Cα (for both salt concentrations), and 13Cα-13C′ couplings (only for the lower salt concentration). In a first analysis, the constants were combined and used to compare the solution structure of the N and C lobes with those of the two crystal structures of Mlc1p complexed with IQ4 (PDB code 1M46) and IQ2 (PDB code 1M45) (10Terrak M. Wu G. Stafford W.F. Lu R.C. Dominguez R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In 1M46 the N-lobe does not participate in the peptide binding, whereas in 1M45 it contacts the peptide. Fits are performed separately for the N- and C-terminal domains of Mlc1p because, as already observed for CaM and other proteins of this family, the two domains align to different degrees. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The N-lobe Conformation Does Not Change between Free and Bound Forms of Mlc1—Fitting of the RDCs to the N domain belonging to the crystal structures 1M46 and 1M45 is shown in Figs. 1, A and B. A good agreement was obtained for 1M46, corresponding to a correlation coefficient of the SVD fit (RSVD) of 0.96 or a quality factor Q (42Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6836-6837Crossref Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 43Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) of 29% (Fig. 1A). A slightly poorer correlation was obtained for the N-lobe of 1M45 (RSVD = 0.94, Q = 35%; Fig. 1B), most likely reflecting minor variations occurred upon binding with the peptide. Three conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the solution structure and the crystal structure of the non-complexed N-lobe are very similar, giving the high sensitivity of the Q factor upon small changes in conformational properties and that a Q factor less than 30% still represents a good agreement between the two structures (43Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Second, the good agreement observed for RDCs measured for helices as well as loops anticipates a stable conformation with only moderate flexibility of the loops. Third, although the Q factor is slightly higher for the complexed N-lobe (Fig. 1B), conformational variations induced by interaction with the IQ peptide are not significant. To calculate a solution structure of Mlc1p N-lobe that fits the observed RDCs, we have followed the refinement protocol described by Chou et al. (26Chou J.J. Shipeng L. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for the case of other proteins of the calmodulin family (26Chou J.J. Shipeng L. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this simple dipolar refinement procedure can be used to examine conformational changes of a protein without going through the time-consuming NOE analysis, especially those belonging to aliphatic side chains. In the present case the result obtained by fitting the observed RDCs to the crystal structure of 1M46 already anticipated only slight variations. The N-lobe exhibits the expected topology with two EF-hand motifs. Four helices are observed, in line with the experimental values of the HN-Hα scalar couplings and chemical shift index analysis (data not shown): helix A (7-14), helix B (24-34), helix C (40-48), and helix D (61-70). Helix A results in solution shorter than the one observed in the 1M46. In the last structure, helix A starts at residue 4. A number of experimental evidences, however, show that this is not the case for the solution structure. Both HN-Hα coupling constants and Cα chemical shifts indicate that residues 4-6 are not in helical conformation. This observation is also sustained by 15N relaxation measurements (see the supplemental data). It is worth noting that in the IQ2 complex (1M45), helix A presents the same length and involves the same residues to that of free Mlc1p. An extra portion of helix, helix D′ (72-77), is observed, involving residues that in other calmodulin-like proteins are part of the linker connecting the two lobes (see below). In line with this observation, low values were measured for the HN-Hα coupling constants and clear evidence is also found in the chemical shift index for Cα nuclei (Fig. 2B). The kink between helices D and D′ occurs at the level of Asn-71, for which a large HN-Hα coupling const"
https://openalex.org/W1976752543,"Malonamidase E2 (MAE2) from Bradyrhizobium japonicum is an enzyme that hydrolyzes malonamate to malonate and has a Ser-cis-Ser-Lys catalytic triad at the active site. The crystal structures of wild type and mutant MAE2 exhibited that the guanido group of Arg-158 could be involved in the binding of malonamate in which the negative charge of the carboxyl group could destabilize a negatively charged transition-state oxyanion in the enzymatic reaction. In an attempt to elucidate the specific roles of Arg-158, site-directed mutants, R158Q, R158E, and R158K, were prepared (see Table 1). The crystal structure of R158Q determined at 2.2 Angstrom resolution showed that the guanido group of Arg-158 was important for the substrate binding with the marginal structural change upon the mutation. The k(cat) value of R158Q significantly decreased by over 1500-fold and the catalytic activity of R158E could not be detected. The k(cat) value of R158K was similar to that of the wild type with the K(m) value drastically increased by 100-fold, suggesting that Lys-158 of R158K can stabilize the negative charge of the carboxylate in the substrate to some extent and contribute to the stabilization of the transition-state oxyanion, but a single amine group of Lys-158 in R158K could not precisely anchor the carboxyl group of malonamate compared with the guanido group of Arg-158. Our kinetic and structural evidences demonstrate that Arg-158 in MAE2 should be critical to both binding the substrate and stabilizing the transition-state oxyanion for the catalytic reaction of MAE2."
