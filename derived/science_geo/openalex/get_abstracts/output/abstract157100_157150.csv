https://openalex.org/W2168692939,"During leptin signaling, each of the phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the long form of the leptin receptor (LRb) mediates distinct signals. Phosphorylated Tyr(1138) binds STAT3 to mediate its tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activation, while phosphorylated Tyr(985) binds the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and reportedly mediates both activation of ERK kinases and inhibition of LRb-mediated STAT3 activation. We show here that although mutation of Tyr(985) does not alter STAT3 signaling by erythropoietin receptor-LRb (ELR) chimeras in transfected 293 cells at short times of stimulation, this mutation enhances STAT3 signaling at longer times of stimulation (>6 h). These data suggest that Tyr(985) may mediate feedback inhibition of LRb signaling by an LRb-induced LRb inhibitor, such as SOCS3. Indeed, SOCS3 binds specifically to phosphorylated Tyr(985) of LRb, and SOCS3 fails to inhibit transcription by ELR following mutation of Tyr(985), suggesting that SOCS3 inhibits LRb signaling by binding to phosphorylated Tyr(985). Additionally, overexpression of SOCS3, but not SHP-2, impairs ELR signaling, and the overexpression of SHP-2 blunts SOCS3-mediated inhibition of ELR signaling. Thus, our data suggest that in addition to mediating SHP-2 binding and ERK activation during acute stimulation, Tyr(985) of LRb mediates feedback inhibition of LRb signaling by binding to LRb-induced SOCS3."

https://openalex.org/W2009047341,"The effects of mutagenesis on geminate and bimolecular O2 rebinding to 90 mutants at 27 different positions were used to map pathways for ligand movement into and out of sperm whale myoglobin. By analogy to a baseball glove, the protein catches and then holds incoming ligand molecules long enough to allow bond formation with the iron atom. Opening of the glove occurs by outward movements of the distal histidine (His(64)), and the ligands are trapped in the interior webbing of the distal pocket, in the space surrounded by Ile(28), Leu(29), Leu(32), Val(68), and Ile(107). The size of this pocket is a major determinant of the rate of ligand entry into the protein. Immediately after photo- or thermal dissociation, O2 moves away from the iron into this interior pocket. The majority of the dissociated ligands return to the active site and either rebind to the iron atom or escape through the His(64) gate. A fraction of the ligands migrate further away from the heme group into cavities that have been defined as Xe binding sites 4 and 1; however, most of these ligands also return to the distal pocket, and net escape through the interior of wild-type myoglobin is <20-25%."
https://openalex.org/W2011107835,"LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1) and LIM-kinase 2 (LIMK2) regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization via cofilin phosphorylation downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases. We report our findings that ROCK, a downstream protein kinase of Rho, specifically activates LIMK2 but not LIMK1 downstream of RhoA. LIMK1 and LIMK2 activities toward cofilin phosphorylation were stimulated by co-expression with the active form of ROCK (ROCK-Δ3), whereas full-length ROCK selectively activates LIMK2 but not LIMK1. Activation of LIMK2 by RhoA was inhibited by Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of ROCK, but Rac1-mediated activation of LIMK1 was not. ROCK directly phosphorylated the threonine 505 residue within the activation segment of LIMK2 and markedly stimulated LIMK2 activity. A LIMK2 mutant with replacement of threonine 505 by valine abolished LIMK2 activities for cofilin phosphorylation and actin cytoskeletal changes, whereas replacement by glutamate enhanced the protein kinase activity and stress fiber formation by LIMK2. These results indicate that ROCK directly phosphorylates threonine 505 and activates LIMK2 downstream of RhoA and that this phosphorylation is essential for LIMK2 to induce actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Together with the finding that LIMK1 is regulated by Pak1, LIMK1 and LIMK2 are regulated by different protein kinases downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases. LIM-kinase 1 (LIMK1) and LIM-kinase 2 (LIMK2) regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization via cofilin phosphorylation downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases.

Actin cytoskeletal dynamics is precisely regulated by a variety of actin-binding proteins involved in polymerization/depolymerization, capping, and bundling of actin filaments (1Schafer D.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton with exposure to extracellular signals is regulated by Rho family GTPases (including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), and each member participates in the specific regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and various cell adhesion-related events (3Hall A.

Several direct or indirect downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases have been identified, but signal transduction pathways by which Rho family GTPases evoke specific actin reorganization are not completely understood.Small actin-binding proteins of the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin family play a definitive role in depolymerization of actin filaments (7Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 8Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S.

A mechanism involved in regulating cofilin function is phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue of cofilin, through which its F-actin-depolymerizing activity is inactivated (9Moriyama K.

We report that two types of LIMKs, LIMK1 and LIMK2, are regulated in a distinct manner downstream of Rho family GTPases. LIMK1 is specifically activated downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA, whereas LIMK2 is specifically activated downstream of RhoA and Cdc42 but not Rac1 (20Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). LIMKs may be indirectly activated by Rho family GTPases, because LIMKs are not a direct target of these GTPases.Several target proteins of Rho are involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Among them, ROCK, an isoform of Rho- kinase, plays a key role in formation of actin stress fibers downstream of Rho (21Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N.

Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Previous reports showed that the constitutive active form of ROCK activates both LIMK1 and LIMK2 (27Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and that LIMK1 is activated by wild-type ROCK (28Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, these reports contradict a previous notion that LIMK1 is specifically activated by Rac but not by Rho (18Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 19Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K.

In the present study, we asked if ROCK could specifically activate LIMK2 downstream of RhoA. We found that signal transduction pathways wherein ROCK directly phosphorylates and activates LIMK2, but not LIMK1 downstream of RhoA resulted in phosphorylation and inactivation of the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin.DISCUSSIONWe reported that LIMK1 and LIMK2 function downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases (20Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the LIMK2 activity was specifically activated by ROCK downstream of RhoA and that ROCK directly phosphorylated at Thr-505 in the activation segment of LIMK2. Moreover, phosphorylation of this site was essential for actin cytoskeletal change and cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK2. On the other hand, it has been reported that LIMK1 is phosphorylated and activated by Pak1 (34Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that LIMK1 and LIMK2 are regulated by distinct upstream protein kinases downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases.LIM-kinase is the LIM domain-containing serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase composed of closely related LIMK1 and LIMK2 (11Ohashi K. Toshima J. Tajinda K. Nakamura T. Mizuno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T.

Commun. 1997; 241: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that LIMK1 and LIMK2 play a role of actin cytoskeletal reorganization through cofilin phosphorylation downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases (18Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 19Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). LIMK1 acts downstream of Rac1 but is not a direct target of this GTPase. It has been shown that LIMK1 is directly phosphorylated and activated by Pak1, an effector protein kinase of Cdc42/Rac and is essential for Pak1-induced dorsal membrane ruffles formation (34Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 35Edwards D.C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Maekawa et al. (27Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) showed that ROCK can activate LIMK1 and LIMK2. However, they used the constitutive active form of ROCK (C-terminally deleted ROCK including ROCK-Δ3), which resulted in a non-selective activation of LIMK1 and LIMK2. We found that the full-length ROCK specifically activates LIMK2 but not LIMK1. Thus, the C-terminal-half region containing Rho-binding and PH domain has a definite role in the substrate-targeting mechanism for specifying actions of ROCK toward LIMK2. Ohashi et al.(28Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) reported that wild-type ROCK phosphorylates and activates LIMK1. Although we have no explanation for the discrepancy in all these results, their data contradict the proposal that LIMK1 is specifically regulated by Rac1 but not RhoA and plays a role in the Rac1-induced lamellipodia formation (18Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 19Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), as do our present results.The mechanisms that determine the specificity of Rho-kinase/ROCK action toward its multiple kinase substrates have only been partly characterized. In cells, this kinase, once activated, translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (23Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It was also reported that both Rho and Rho-kinase are translocated from the cytosol to the cleavage furrow and play a critical role in inducing and maintaining the contractile ring during cytokinesis (36Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kosako H. Goto H. Yanagida M. Matsuzawa K. Fujita M. Tomono Y. Okigaki T. Odai H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2783-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The target proteins of Rho-kinase/ROCK, including the ezrin/radixin/moesin family, myosin light chain, myosin binding subunit, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and desmin, accumulate at these area, where their phosphorylation occurs specifically (33Kawano Y.

However, the dominant active form of Rho-kinase C-terminally deleted form) non-selectively phosphorylates vimentin and desmin in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (42Inada H. Togashi H. Nakamura Y. Kaibuchi K. Nagata K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34932-34939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 43Goto H. Kosako H. Tanabe K. Yanagida M. Sakurai M. Amano M.

These observations suggest that the C-terminal region of Rho-kinase containing PH and Rho binding domains may regulate its subcellular localization and, hence, provide susceptibility to specific substrates. The PH domain has a role in the signal-dependent membrane localization of several proteins (44Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Rho binding domains of Rho-kinase/ROCK is essential for activation of protein kinase activity through binding to Rho and translocation to the membrane by forming a complex with activated Rho (22Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 23Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Therefore, even though potential substrates are non-selectively phosphorylated in vitro, susceptibility of Rho-kinase/ROCK to substrates at specific loci may determine if Rho-kinase/ROCK could act on substrate proteins within cells. Although the intracellular localization of endogenous LIMK2 remains to be determined, all these observations lead to the notion that the activated native form of ROCK may translocate to specific sites where LIMK2 co-localizes, then preferentially phosphorylate LIMK2, the result being LIMK2-dependent cofilin phosphorylation and stabilization of actin filaments.The spatial and temporal organization of actin filaments plays an essential role in cellular locomotion, and actin cytoskeletal reorganization is distinctly regulated both spatially and temporally within migrating cells (45Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar, 46Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In these cells, membrane ruffling and filopodial protrusion, respectively, regulated under Rac and Cdc42 are observed in the leading edge, whereas actin-myosin contraction regulated under Rho is observed in the ruffling area and posterior regions of cells (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Thus, actin cytoskeletal reorganization, which occurs in a distinct spatiotemporal manner in distinct subcellular loci, appears to be regulated through Rho family GTPases, which utilize different sets of downstream effectors. In terms of actin filament depolymerization, independent pathways, i.e. Rac1-Pak1-LIMK1 and RhoA-ROCK-LIMK2, may play a role in distinct regulation of cofilin-mediated actin filament depolymerization such that it occurs in a distinct spatiotemporal manner. Alternatively, different expression patterns of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in tissues and cells (12Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T.

Cell division, motility, and shape determination depend on reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Extensive remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton with exposure to extracellular signals is regulated by Rho family GTPases (including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), and each member participates in the specific regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and various cell adhesion-related events (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Kaibuchi K.

Sci. 1995; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Several direct or indirect downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases have been identified, but signal transduction pathways by which Rho family GTPases evoke specific actin reorganization are not completely understood. Small actin-binding proteins of the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin family play a definitive role in depolymerization of actin filaments (7Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 8Bamburg J.R. McGough A. Ono S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 364-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and, hence, are potential downstream effectors of signaling cascades that evoke actin cytoskeletal reorganization. A mechanism involved in regulating cofilin function is phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue of cofilin, through which its F-actin-depolymerizing activity is inactivated (9Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 10Agnew B.J. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. J. Biol.

We report that two types of LIMKs, LIMK1 and LIMK2, are regulated in a distinct manner downstream of Rho family GTPases. LIMK1 is specifically activated downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA, whereas LIMK2 is specifically activated downstream of RhoA and Cdc42 but not Rac1 (20Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). LIMKs may be indirectly activated by Rho family GTPases, because LIMKs are not a direct target of these GTPases. Several target proteins of Rho are involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Among them, ROCK, an isoform of Rho- kinase, plays a key role in formation of actin stress fibers downstream of Rho (21Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N.

Previous reports showed that the constitutive active form of ROCK activates both LIMK1 and LIMK2 (27Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) and that LIMK1 is activated by wild-type ROCK (28Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, these reports contradict a previous notion that LIMK1 is specifically activated by Rac but not by Rho (18Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 19Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K.

In the present study, we asked if ROCK could specifically activate LIMK2 downstream of RhoA. We found that signal transduction pathways wherein ROCK directly phosphorylates and activates LIMK2, but not LIMK1 downstream of RhoA resulted in phosphorylation and inactivation of the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin. DISCUSSIONWe reported that LIMK1 and LIMK2 function downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases (20Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Takai Y. Nakamura T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the LIMK2 activity was specifically activated by ROCK downstream of RhoA and that ROCK directly phosphorylated at Thr-505 in the activation segment of LIMK2. Moreover, phosphorylation of this site was essential for actin cytoskeletal change and cofilin phosphorylation by LIMK2. On the other hand, it has been reported that LIMK1 is phosphorylated and activated by Pak1 (34Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that LIMK1 and LIMK2 are regulated by distinct upstream protein kinases downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases.LIM-kinase is the LIM domain-containing serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase composed of closely related LIMK1 and LIMK2 (11Ohashi K.

Recent studies showed that LIMK1 and LIMK2 play a role of actin cytoskeletal reorganization through cofilin phosphorylation downstream of distinct Rho family GTPases (18Arber S. Barbayannis F.A.

It has been shown that LIMK1 is directly phosphorylated and activated by Pak1, an effector protein kinase of Cdc42/Rac and is essential for Pak1-induced dorsal membrane ruffles formation (34Edwards D.C.

However, they used the constitutive active form of ROCK (C-terminally deleted ROCK including ROCK-Δ3), which resulted in a non-selective activation of LIMK1 and LIMK2. We found that the full-length ROCK specifically activates LIMK2 but not LIMK1. Thus, the C-terminal-half region containing Rho-binding and PH domain has a definite role in the substrate-targeting mechanism for specifying actions of ROCK toward LIMK2. Ohashi et al.(28Ohashi K.

Although we have no explanation for the discrepancy in all these results, their data contradict the proposal that LIMK1 is specifically regulated by Rac1 but not RhoA and plays a role in the Rac1-induced lamellipodia formation (18Arber S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1519-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), as do our present results.The mechanisms that determine the specificity of Rho-kinase/ROCK action toward its multiple kinase substrates have only been partly characterized. In cells, this kinase, once activated, translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (23Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It was also reported that both Rho and Rho-kinase are translocated from the cytosol to the cleavage furrow and play a critical role in inducing and maintaining the contractile ring during cytokinesis (36Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kosako H. Goto H. Yanagida M. Matsuzawa K. Fujita M. Tomono Y. Okigaki T. Odai H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2783-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The target proteins of Rho-kinase/ROCK, including the ezrin/radixin/moesin family, myosin light chain, myosin binding subunit, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and desmin, accumulate at these area, where their phosphorylation occurs specifically (33Kawano Y.

However, the dominant active form of Rho-kinase C-terminally deleted form) non-selectively phosphorylates vimentin and desmin in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (42Inada H. Togashi H. Nakamura Y. Kaibuchi K. Nagata K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34932-34939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 43Goto H. Kosako H. Tanabe K. Yanagida M. Sakurai M. Amano M.

These observations suggest that the C-terminal region of Rho-kinase containing PH and Rho binding domains may regulate its subcellular localization and, hence, provide susceptibility to specific substrates. The PH domain has a role in the signal-dependent membrane localization of several proteins (44Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Rho binding domains of Rho-kinase/ROCK is essential for activation of protein kinase activity through binding to Rho and translocation to the membrane by forming a complex with activated Rho (22Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 23Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Therefore, even though potential substrates are non-selectively phosphorylated in vitro, susceptibility of Rho-kinase/ROCK to substrates at specific loci may determine if Rho-kinase/ROCK could act on substrate proteins within cells. Although the intracellular localization of endogenous LIMK2 remains to be determined, all these observations lead to the notion that the activated native form of ROCK may translocate to specific sites where LIMK2 co-localizes, then preferentially phosphorylate LIMK2, the result being LIMK2-dependent cofilin phosphorylation and stabilization of actin filaments.The spatial and temporal organization of actin filaments plays an essential role in cellular locomotion, and actin cytoskeletal reorganization is distinctly regulated both spatially and temporally within migrating cells (45Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar, 46Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In these cells, membrane ruffling and filopodial protrusion, respectively, regulated under Rac and Cdc42 are observed in the leading edge, whereas actin-myosin contraction regulated under Rho is observed in the ruffling area and posterior regions of cells (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Thus, actin cytoskeletal reorganization, which occurs in a distinct spatiotemporal manner in distinct subcellular loci, appears to be regulated through Rho family GTPases, which utilize different sets of downstream effectors. In terms of actin filament depolymerization, independent pathways, i.e. Rac1-Pak1-LIMK1 and RhoA-ROCK-LIMK2, may play a role in distinct regulation of cofilin-mediated actin filament depolymerization such that it occurs in a distinct spatiotemporal manner. Alternatively, different expression patterns of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in tissues and cells (12Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T.

The mechanisms that determine the specificity of Rho-kinase/ROCK action toward its multiple kinase substrates have only been partly characterized. In cells, this kinase, once activated, translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (23Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It was also reported that both Rho and Rho-kinase are translocated from the cytosol to the cleavage furrow and play a critical role in inducing and maintaining the contractile ring during cytokinesis (36Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kosako H. Goto H. Yanagida M. Matsuzawa K. Fujita M. Tomono Y. Okigaki T. Odai H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2783-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The target proteins of Rho-kinase/ROCK, including the ezrin/radixin/moesin family, myosin light chain, myosin binding subunit, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and desmin, accumulate at these area, where their phosphorylation occurs specifically (33Kawano Y.

However, the dominant active form of Rho-kinase C-terminally deleted form) non-selectively phosphorylates vimentin and desmin in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (42Inada H. Togashi H. Nakamura Y.

These observations suggest that the C-terminal region of Rho-kinase containing PH and Rho binding domains may regulate its subcellular localization and, hence, provide susceptibility to specific substrates. The PH domain has a role in the signal-dependent membrane localization of several proteins (44Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Rho binding domains of Rho-kinase/ROCK is essential for activation of protein kinase activity through binding to Rho and translocation to the membrane by forming a complex with activated Rho (22Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 23Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Therefore, even though potential substrates are non-selectively phosphorylated in vitro, susceptibility of Rho-kinase/ROCK to substrates at specific loci may determine if Rho-kinase/ROCK could act on substrate proteins within cells. Although the intracellular localization of endogenous LIMK2 remains to be determined, all these observations lead to the notion that the activated native form of ROCK may translocate to specific sites where LIMK2 co-localizes, then preferentially phosphorylate LIMK2, the result being LIMK2-dependent cofilin phosphorylation and stabilization of actin filaments. The spatial and temporal organization of actin filaments plays an essential role in cellular locomotion, and actin cytoskeletal reorganization is distinctly regulated both spatially and temporally within migrating cells (45Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar, 46Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In these cells, membrane ruffling and filopodial protrusion, respectively, regulated under Rac and Cdc42 are observed in the leading edge, whereas actin-myosin contraction regulated under Rho is observed in the ruffling area and posterior regions of cells (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Thus, actin cytoskeletal reorganization, which occurs in a distinct spatiotemporal manner in distinct subcellular loci, appears to be regulated through Rho family GTPases, which utilize different sets of downstream effectors. In terms of actin filament depolymerization, independent pathways, i.e. Rac1-Pak1-LIMK1 and RhoA-ROCK-LIMK2, may play a role in distinct regulation of cofilin-mediated actin filament depolymerization such that it occurs in a distinct spatiotemporal manner. Alternatively, different expression patterns of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in tissues and cells (12Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T.

Since connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a potent mitogen for fibrosis, extracellular matrix production, and angiogenesis, we have studied the effects and mechanism by which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates CTGF gene expression in retinal capillary cells. In our study, VEGF increased CTGF mRNA levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in bovine retinal endothelial cells and pericytes, without the need of new protein synthesis and without altering mRNA stability. VEGF activated the tyrosine receptor phosphorylation of KDR and Flt1 and increased the binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) p85 subunit to KDR and Flt1, both of which could mediate CTGF gene induction. VEGF-induced CTGF expression was mediated primarily by PI3-kinase activation, whereas PKC and ERK pathways made only minimal contributions. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutive active Akt was sufficient to induce CTGF gene expression, and inhibition of Akt activation by overexpressing dominant negative mutant of Akt abolished the VEGF-induced CTGF expression. These data suggest that VEGF can increase CTGF gene expression in bovine retinal capillary cells via KDR or Flt receptors and the activation of PI3-kinase-Akt pathway independently of PKC or Ras-ERK pathway, possibly inducing the fibrosis observed in retinal neovascular diseases.

D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In addition, these processes commonly occur together in many disease states where neovascularization is believed to initiate the pathological cascade. Some of these diseases are proliferative diabetic retinopathy (2Aiello L.P. Gardner T.W. King G.L. Blankenship G. Cavallerano J.D. Ferris III, F.L. Klein R. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), rheumatoid arthritis (3Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and age-related macular degeneration (4Lopez P.F. Sippy B.D. Lambert H.M. Thach A.B. Hinton D.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 855-868PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the factors that regulate angiogenesis may also induce factors that stimulate extracellular matrix production and fibrosis. Accordingly, we have studied the ability of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 an established angiogenic factor, to regulate the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a growth factor with known actions on fibroblast proliferation, matrix production, and associated with fibrotic disorders. VEGF is expressed as a family of peptides of 121, 145, 165, 189, and 206 amino acid residues (5Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). Its expression is induced by hypoxia (6Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4144) Google Scholar) and is essential in the vasculogenesis process during development (7Ferrara N. Carver-Moore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L. O'Shea K.S. Powell-Braxton L. Hillan K.J. Moore M.W. Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3027) Google Scholar). Several receptors have been shown to mediate the action of VEGF, and most of them belong to the tyrosine kinase receptor family (8Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Upon the binding of VEGF to its receptors, multiple signaling cascades are activated, including the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ, elevation of intracellular calcium and diacylglycerol, activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) for endothelial cell proliferation (9Wu L.W.

In addition, VEGF also stimulates activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase leading to Akt/PKB activation and possibly enhancing endothelial cell survival (13Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 14Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

However, in non-endothelial cells such as capillary pericytes that predominantly express Flt1 receptor, the action of VEGF is poorly understood. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a member of CCN family (CYR61, CTGF, and NOV) (16Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 17Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), is a potent and ubiquitously expressed growth factor that has been shown to play a unique role in fibroblast proliferation, cell adhesion, and the stimulation of extracellular matrix production (18Frazier K.

The 38-kDa protein was originally identified in conditioned medium from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (20Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), and the expression was shown to be selectively stimulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in cultured fibroblasts (21Igarashi A. Okochi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Due to its mitogenic action on fibroblasts and its ability to induce the expression of the extracellular matrix molecules, collagen type I, fibronectin, and integrin α5 (18Frazier K. Williams S. Kothapalli D. Klapper H. Grotendorst G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 404-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), CTGF is supposed to play an important role in connective tissue cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition as one of the mediators of TGF-β (22Kothapalli D. Frazier K.S. Welply A. Segarini P.R. Grotendorst G.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar). CTGF also seems to be an important player in the pathogenesis of various fibrotic disorders, since it was shown to be overexpressed in scleroderma, keloids, and other fibrotic skin disorders (23Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Fujimoto M. Grotendorst G.R. Takehara K. J. Invest.

Pech M. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 95: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recently, the integrin αvβ3 has been reported to serve as a receptor on endothelial cells for CTGF-mediated endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis (26Babic A.M. Chen C.C. Lau L.F.

Besides TGF-β, the expression of CTGF is reported to be regulated by dexamethasone in BALB/c 3T3 cells (28Dammeier J. Beer H.D. Brauchle M. Werner S. J. Biol.

Since many of these cytokines are known to induce VEGF, it is possible that increased VEGF expression can regulate the expression of CTGF.

All other materials were ordered from Fisher and Sigma. Primary cultures of bovine retinal endothelial cells (BREC) and pericytes (BRPC) were isolated by homogenization and a series of filtration steps as described previously (34King G.L. Goodman A.D. Buzney S. Moses A. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). BREC were subsequently cultured with endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 10% plasma-derived horse serum, 50 mg/liter heparin, and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor. BRPC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5.5 mm glucose and 20% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2at 37 °C, and media were changed every 3 days. Cells were characterized for their homogeneity by immunoreactivity with anti-factor VIII antibody for BREC and with monoclonal antibody 3G5 for BRPC (35Nayak R.C. Berman A.B. George K.L.

The recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by homologous recombination between the parental virus genome and the expression cosmid cassette or shuttle vector as described (42He T.C.

The adenoviruses were applied at a concentration of 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml, and adenoviruses with the same parental genome carrying thelacZ gene or enhanced green fluorescein protein gene (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used as controls. Expression of each recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis and increased about 10-fold compared with cells infected with the control adenovirus. Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/liter HEPES, 10 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mmol/liter sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, 1.0 mg of protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation. To clear the protein extract, protein A-Sepharose (20 μl of a 50% suspension) was added to the cell lysates, after which they were incubated for 1 h, followed by centrifugation and collection of the supernatant. A specific rabbit anti-KDR or Flt1 antibody was added and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h; 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the sample was rocked for another 2 h at 4 °C. For denaturation, protein A-Sepharose antigen-antibody conjugates were separated by centrifugation, washed five times, and boiled for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins or 30 μg of total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was soaked in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Visualization was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per the manufacturer's instructions. PI3-kinase activities were measured by thein vitro phosphorylation of PI (10Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PI3-kinase was immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the supernatant with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. After successive washings, the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 and 10 μl of PI (2 μg/μl) sonicated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EGTA was added to each pellet. The PI3-kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 mm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min at room temperature with constant shaking, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The samples were centrifuged, and the organic phase was removed and applied to silica gel TLC plates developing in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11:2). The radioactivity in spots was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). cDNA templates for PCR were synthesized by reverse transcriptase (First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from human fibroblast according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. A standard PCR was performed (PCR optimizer kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using 5′-AGGGCCTCTTCTGTGACTTCG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-TCATGCCATGTCTCCGTACATC-3′ (antisense primer) (20Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The PCR products were then subcloned into a vector (pCRII, Invitrogen) and sequenced in their entirety, and comparison with the published human sequences revealed complete sequence identity. This cDNA probe was used for hybridization. Total RNA was isolated using acid-guanidinium thiocyanate, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (44Kuboki K. Jiang Z.Y. Takahara N. Ha S.W. Igarashi M. Yamauchi T. Feener E.P. Herbert T.P. Rhodes C.J. King G.L. Circulation. 2000; 101: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed through 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and then transferred to a nylon membrane. 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were generated by use of labeling kits (Megaprime DNA labeling systems, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After ultraviolet cross-linking using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), blots were pre-hybridized, hybridized, and washed in 0.5× SSC, 5% SDS at 65 °C with 4 changes over 1 h. All signals were analyzed using a PhosphorImager, and lane loading differences were normalized using the 36B4 cDNA probe (45Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar). CTGF mRNA half-life experiments were carried out using BREC and BRPC. The cells were exposed to vehicle or VEGF (25 ng/ml) for the indicated periods prior to mRNA stability measurements. Transcription was inhibited by the addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). For inhibition of protein synthesis, cells were treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for the times indicated. Determinations were performed in triplicate, and all experiments were repeated at least three times. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D., unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analysis employed Student's t test or analysis of variance to compare quantitative data populations with normal distributions and equal variance. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test or the Kruskal-Wallis test for populations with non-normal distributions or unequal variance. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The effects of VEGF on the expression of CTGF mRNA were studied by Northern blot analysis in BREC and BRPC. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, 25 ng/ml VEGF increased CTGF mRNA (∼2.4 kb) levels in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum after 6 h in BREC (3.1 ± 0.70-fold, p < 0.001, Fig. 1 A) and after 9 h in BRPC (2.0 ± 0.22-fold,p < 0.01, Fig. 1 B). The dose response to VEGF-induced CTGF mRNA expression was studied after 6 h of VEGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1, Cand D, the expression of CTGF mRNA was up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner, with significant increases observed at concentrations as low as 0.25 ng/ml in both BREC (Fig. 1 C) and BRPC (Fig. 1 D). Maximal increases were observed at VEGF concentrations of 25 ng/ml in both BREC and BRPC. Since BREC and BRPC may express both KDR and Flt1, we examined the effects of PlGF, a Flt1-specific ligand (46Clauss M. Weich H. Breier G. Knies U. Rockl W. Waltenberger J. Risau W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22554-25646Google Scholar), on the induction of CTGF gene expression in vascular cells. As shown in Fig. 1 E, CTGF mRNA levels were not affected after stimulation of 25 ng/ml of PlGF in BREC. In contrast, PlGF increased CTGF mRNA after 3 h of stimulation, which peaked after 9 h in BRPC (1.9 ± 0.30-fold, p < 0.01, Fig. 1 F), suggesting that VEGF-induced CTGF gene expression was mediated primarily by KDR in BREC and Flt1 in BRPC. To determine if the effects of VEGF on CTGF mRNA were correlated with its protein level, CTGF protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis using anti-human CTGF antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the detected size of CTGF protein was ∼38 kDa in both BREC and BRPC. VEGF (25 ng/ml) increased the level of CTGF protein after 10 h in both BREC and BRPC. Comparative studies were performed on the effects of VEGF (25 ng/ml) and TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) on the expression of CTGF mRNA and protein. As shown Fig. 2 B, VEGF and TGF-β1 increased CTGF protein expression by a similar amount (2.5 ± 0.4- and 2.8 ± 0.8-fold, respectively, in BREC). CTGF mRNA levels were also increased a similar extent (3.0 ± 0.3- and 3.3 ± 0.5-fold, respectively). The effects of VEGF on the stability of CTGF mRNA were examined. Northern blot analyses were performed with addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) after 6 h of VEGF (25 ng/ml) stimulation. In BREC (Fig. 3 A) and BRPC (Fig. 3 B), the half-life of CTGF mRNA was 1.7 and 3.6 h, respectively. There was no significant difference between VEGF-treated and -untreated cells.Figure 1Stimulation of CTGF mRNA expression by VEGF and PlGF.

Fig. 3, Cand D, shows that cycloheximide did not prevent the increase of CTGF mRNA. Addition of both VEGF and cycloheximide increased CTGF mRNA 2.4 ± 0.41-fold in BREC (Fig. 3 C) and 2.5 ± 0.40-fold in BRPC (Fig. 3 D) after 6 h as compared with cycloheximide alone (p < 0.01). These data suggest that the stimulation of CTGF mRNA expression by VEGF was not induced by increased synthesis of a regulatory protein.

We investigated the effects of HIV protease inhibitors on adipogenesis and adipocyte survival using the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line. Several HIV protease inhibitors were found either to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation or to promote adipocyte cell death. One protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, elicited both of these effects strongly. When induced to differentiate in the presence of nelfinavir, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes failed to accumulate cytoplasmic triacylglycerol and failed to express normal levels of the adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. The level of the proteolytically processed, active 68-kDa form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, a transcription factor known to promote lipogenic gene expression, also was reduced markedly in nelfinavir-treated cells, whereas the level of the 125-kDa precursor form of this protein was unaffected. The inhibitory effect of nelfinavir occurred subsequent to critical early events in preadipocyte differentiation, expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β and completion of the mitotic clonal expansion phase, because these events were unaffected by nelfinavir treatment. In addition, nelfinavir treatment of fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in DNA strand cleavage and severe loss of cell viability. In contrast, cell proliferation and viability of preadipocytes were unaffected by nelfinavir treatment. Thus, molecular or cellular changes that occur during acquisition of the adipocyte phenotype promote susceptibility to nelfinavir-induced cell death. When considered together, these results suggest that nelfinavir may promote adipose tissue atrophy by compromising adipocyte viability and preventing replacement of lost adipocytes by inhibiting preadipocyte differentiation.

The underlying cause of the syndrome may be a complex physiological response to multiple factors including one or more components of combination drug regimens, viral infection, or effective viral suppression. Currently, the cause of this syndrome, referred to hereafter as HIV/HAART-associated syndrome (HAS), is unknown. A commonly reported symptom of HAS appears to be alteration of adipose tissue depots. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of adipocyte biology using the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line (20Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (744) Google Scholar) as a model. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, when growth-arrested at confluence, can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes in the presence of fetal bovine serum and a hormonal mixture that includes insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine (reviewed in Refs. 21Cornelius P.

At least two classes of transcription factors serve important roles in regulating adipogenesis, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belonging, respectively, to the basic leucine zipper class of transcription factors and to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (reviewed in Refs. 22MacDougald O.A.

Concomitantly, synchronous re-entry into the cell cycle occurs, and cells proceed through a mitotic clonal expansion phase that consists of approximately two rounds of mitosis (27Bernlohr D.A.

C/EBPα and PPARγ then promote sustained expression of numerous adipocyte genes, including that which encodes the fatty acid binding protein 422/aP2 (reviewed in Refs. 22MacDougald O.A.

Similar regulatory elements have been identified within the promoters of numerous other adipocyte genes through which transcriptional activation is achieved (reviewed in Refs. 22MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 24Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1, also referred to as ADD1) is expressed during 3T3-L1 differentiation (33Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 34Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and, like C/EBPα and PPARγ, is classified as a proadipogenic transcription factor. SREBP-1/ADD1, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor class, promotes lipogenic gene expression (34Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and stimulates production of an unidentified PPARγ ligand (35Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Thus, C/EBPα, PPARγ, and SREBP-1/ADD1 cooperatively promote adipogenesis and subsequent maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype. Inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation by PIs has been reported recently. Several PIs, including amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir, have been shown to inhibit triacylglycerol accumulation and expression of 422/aP2 mRNA in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (36Zhang B. Macnaul K. Szalkowski D. Li Z. Berger J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metabol. 1999; 84: 4274-4277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indinavir and saquinavir were demonstrated to inhibit glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, a late lipogenic marker of the adipogenic process, in primary human preadipocytes (37Wentworth J.M. Burris T.P. Chatterjee V.K.K. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: R7-R10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indinavir also has been shown to augment the inhibitory action of all-trans-retinoic acid on lipogenesis in the pluripotent mesenchymal stem cell line, C3H10T1/2 (38Lenhard J.M. Weiel J.E. Paulik M.A. Furfine E.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A poorly understood mechanism whereby indinavir enhances retinoic acid receptor signaling has been proposed (38Lenhard J.M. Weiel J.E. Paulik M.A. Furfine E.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PIs inhibit preadipocyte differentiation, although the precise molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. We conducted a detailed analysis of the effects of nelfinavir on both preadipocyte differentiation and adipocyte survival. Results from our investigation indicate that nelfinavir inhibits differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at a point following two early, differentiation-associated events, C/EBPβ expression and mitotic clonal expansion, because these events were not affected by nelfinavir. Nelfinavir-dependent inhibition of adipogenesis was manifest by severe reductions in both triacylglycerol accumulation and expression of C/EBPα, PPARγ, SREBP-1/ADD1, and 422/aP2 protein. Furthermore, nelfinavir inhibited expression of the same adipogenic transcription factors and promoted cell death in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, nelfinavir and other PIs may promote adipose tissue atrophy by promoting adipocyte loss and/or preventing replacement of lost adipocytes by inhibiting preadipocyte differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (20Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (744) Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY). Differentiation was induced as described (39Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating 2-day postconfluent cells (designated day 0) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a hormonal mixture composed of 520 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone and 167 nm insulin (termed MDI) for 48 h. Cells were then incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 167 nm insulin for another 48 h, after which they were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum with a medium change every 48 h. All cell culture medium was supplemented throughout with 62.5 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 8 μg/ml biotin. All test agents were diluted into culture medium, and in all experiments cells were exposed to an identical concentration of vehicle (0.1% v/v). Oil Red O staining was performed by fixing cell monolayers in 3.7% formaldehyde, washing in water and staining with a 0.6% (w/v) Oil Red O solution (60% isopropanol, 40% water) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell monolayers were then washed extensively with water to remove unbound dye. Trypan blue staining was performed by incubating cell monolayers in a 0.2% (w/v) trypan blue solution (0.15 m NaCl) for 10 min at room temperature. Cell number data shown in Fig. 3 Cwere determined by trypsinizing cell monolayers from 6-cm culture dishes followed by counting with a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Inc., Hialeah, FL).Figure 4Effects of anti-HIV drugs on fully differentiated adipocytes. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate with MDI and cultured for 6 days, a time period sufficient for complete differentiation into adipocytes. Adipocytes at day 6 were then treated with vehicle, stavudine (20 μm), or the indicated protease inhibitor (20 μm) for a period of 6 days after which cells were stained with Oil Red O. Preadipocytes not induced to differentiate (NO MDI), simultaneously cultured in the presence of vehicle for an identical period of time and stained with Oil Red O are shown for comparison.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from preadipocytes before (0 h after MDI) and during differentiation (33 and 46 h after MDI). Extracts were obtained at all time points from preadipocytes cultured in the presence of vehicle or 20 μm nelfinavir. A, nuclear extracts were examined for C/EBP DNA binding activity. Supershift analysis was performed by addition of preimmune serum (PRE,lanes 4–7) or serum that specifically recognizes C/EBPβ (ANTI-β, lanes 8–11). Lane 1 represents recombinant C/EBPβ (38-kDa form only) shown for comparative purposes. B, nuclear extracts examined for binding activity in A were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antiserum that recognizes C/EBPβ. Lanes 1–7of B correspond to samples taken from those represented inlanes 1–7 of A. C, preadipocytes were induced to differentiate (MDI) in the presence of vehicle or 20 μm nelfinavir and cultured for a period of 3 days. At the same time, additional dishes of preadipocytes not induced to differentiate (NO MDI) were grown under otherwise identical conditions. Cell number was then determined using a Coulter Counter. Two independent experiments were conducted in triplicate with similar results. Data shown are the means ± S.E. of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Whole cell extracts were prepared at the indicated times by washing cell monolayers from 6-cm plates once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.5) followed by lysis in 1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of all samples were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (41Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). Data shown in Figs. 2 and 4 were obtained by subjecting 100 μg of total protein from each experimental extract to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two identical sets of protein extracts were run individually on 8% and 12.5% acrylamide gels to achieve maximum resolution for each series of immunoblots. After transferring to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (0.45-micron pore size; Immobilon-P, Millipore), blots were probed with antibodies (see below) recognizing the proteins indicated. Blots were sequentially probed, stripped in 2% SDS, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) at 65 °C for 1 h, equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6) + 0.1% Tween-20 (TTBS), and reprobed after blocking nonspecific protein binding by incubation for 30 min in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk dissolved in TTBS. In Fig. 2, extracts separated on the 12.5% gel were probed for C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and 422/aP2, and those on the 8% gel were probed for PPARγ, RXRα, and SREBP-1. In Fig. 4, extracts separated on the 12.5% gel were probed for C/EBPα and 422/aP2, and those on the 8% gel were probed for PPARγ, RXRα, and SREBP-1. Commercially available primary antibodies recognizing the following proteins were used: PPARγ (Santa Cruz, catalogue number sc-7273), RXRα (Santa Cruz, catalogue number sc-553), and SREBP-1 (Santa Cruz, catalogue number sc-367; note this antibody recognizes both SREBP-1a and -1c (also known as ADD1)). Rabbit polyclonal antisera specific to C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, and 422/aP2 were generated in this laboratory. Protein detection was performed by ECL using commercially available reagents as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Identical procedures were used to generate immunoblot data shown in Fig. 3 B except 10 μg of nuclear extract was loaded per lane. Assays were performed as described (28Tang Q.-Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) with 10-μg nuclear extract except extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Recombinant C/EBPβ (38-kDa isoform) was generated using a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells grown on No. 1 coverslips (22 × 22 mm) were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and fixed in freshly prepared 1% paraformaldehyde on ice for 15 min. Coverslips were washed once with PBS and incubated in 70% methanol at −20 °C for 60 min to permeabilize cells. Coverslips were then washed three times in PBS, and 50 μl of TUNEL assay reaction mixture was pipetted gently onto coverslips. The mixture included 200 mm potassium cacodylate, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm cobalt chloride, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.6) supplemented with 0.5 nmol ChromaTide Alexa Fluor 488–5-dUTP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and 10 units terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 90 min at 37 °C followed by one wash in 2× SSC to terminate reactions. Coverslips were washed twice in PBS, incubated in PBS + 1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature to stain nuclei and washed three times before mounting on microscope slides in Prolong Antifade solution (Molecular Probes). Samples were viewed at 630× magnification using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were obtained using IP Lab software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA). Percentage of cells exhibiting TUNEL reactivity (TUNEL index in Fig. 6) was determined by the number of TUNEL staining cells divided by the total number of cells (DAPI-stained cells). Five different fields were scored for each treatment group in three independent experiments with similar results. Each field included approximately 10 and 40 cells for undifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student's t test. Indinavir (Merck, West Point, PA), nelfinavir (Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Torrey Pines, CA), ritonavir (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), and saquinavir (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were supplied as powders and were kind gifts from the indicated sources. All protease inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 20 mm. Stavudine (2′,3′-didehydro-3′-deoxythymidine; Sigma) was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 20 mm and filter sterilized before use. Under appropriate culture conditions, including incubation with a hormonal mixture (see the Introduction and “Experimental Procedures”), 3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo differentiation and assume adipocyte characteristics that include a specific pattern of gene expression and accumulation of cytoplasmic, triacylglycerol-rich lipid droplets. Experiments were conducted to determine whether HIV PIs affect this process. Preadipocytes were induced to differentiate in the presence or absence of the PIs indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir (20 μm). Six days after the onset of differentiation, when cytoplasmic lipid droplets are normally abundant, cells were stained with the lipophilic dye Oil Red O to determine the extent of triacylglycerol accumulation. Exposure to nelfinavir throughout the course of differentiation severely inhibited lipid accumulation, but this effect was not observed readily with 20 μmindinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir under identical conditions (Fig. 1, A, lower panels, and B). The inhibitory effect of nelfinavir was not observed when preadipocytes were exposed to this drug only during the first 2 days of the differentiation program (Fig. 1 A, upper panels). Similarly, exposure to nelfinavir from days 2–6 of the program did not inhibit lipid accumulation (data not shown). Thus, the inhibitory effect of nelfinavir was observed only when preadipocytes were exposed to this drug throughout the course of differentiation. Adipose tissue abnormalities independent of PI-containing therapy regimens have been reported in some HIV-infected patients (15Kotler D.P. Rosenbaum K. Wang J. Pierson R.N. J. Acquir. Immune Defic.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity shows a circadian oscillation and may account for the morning onset of myocardial infarction. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this circadian oscillation remain unknown. Recent evidence indicates that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS domain transcription factors play a crucial role in controlling the biological clock that controls circadian rhythm. We isolated a novel bHLH/PAS protein, cycle-like factor (CLIF) from human umbilical vein endothelial cells. CLIF shares high homology with Drosophila CYCLE, one of the essential transcriptional regulators of circadian rhythm.

In endothelial cells, CLIF forms a heterodimer with CLOCK and up-regulates the PAI-1 gene through E-box sites.

It may result in part from the circadian variation of fibrinolytic activity. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)1 is the major component of inhibitors of fibrinolysis activity. PAI-1 activity shows a clear circadian oscillation peaking in the early morning, and this may account for the morning onset of myocardial infarctions (1Muller J.E. Stone P.H. Turi Z.G.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this circadian oscillation remain unknown. Every organism from bacteria to humans has an internal biological clock that adapts its activity to a circadian rhythm. Recently, the molecular mechanisms underlying these circadian processes are beginning to be elucidated (3Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 4Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1998; 392: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Schibler U. Nature. 2000; 404: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The biological clock is composed of transcriptional-translational feedback loops (3Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). Many of these components, including CLOCK, CYCLE, and PERIOD (PER), belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS domain family of transcription factors. Thus, the PAS domain plays a crucial role in regulating the biological clock (4Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1998; 392: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In mammals, CLOCK and BMAL1, the mammalian counterpart of Drosophila CYCLE, induce Per andCryptochrome (Cry) gene expression (6Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). The PER and CRY proteins in turn act as negative components of the feedback loop by suppressing CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription through CACGTG E-box enhancer elements (7Kume K. Zylka M.J.

Recent studies have shown circadian oscillations of various transcripts in both peripheral tissues and cultured cells. Their underlying rhythm is inferred to be due to the same mechanisms that are present in the SCN (9Oishi K. Sakamoto K. Okada T. Nagase T. Ishida N. Biochem. Cell Biol.

We report here the identification of a novel bHLH/PAS domain transcription factor, CLIF (cycle likefactor) that shares high homology withDrosophila CYCLE. Since CLIF is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, we hypothesize that CLIF may regulate the circadian oscillation of PAI-1 gene expression in endothelial cells. We show that CLIF forms a heterodimer with CLOCK and in endothelial cells up-regulates the PAI-1 gene through its E-box sites. Furthermore, PER2 and CRY1, whose expression show a circadian oscillation in peripheral tissues, inhibit the PAI-1 promoter activation by the CLOCK:CLIF heterodimer. This may account for the circadian oscillation of PAI-1 gene expression. The endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1) bait plasmid pBDGAL4-EPAS1 was constructed by amplification of cDNA encoding amino acids (aa) 30–380 of the human EPAS1 protein by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified fragment was cloned into the vector pBDGAL4 Cam (Stratagene). The plasmids for GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins were constructed by amplification of cDNAs encoding bHLH/PAS domain (ARNT, aa 70–508; BMAL1, aa 64–445; CLIF, aa 74–445) by PCR. The amplified fragments were cloned into pBDGAL4Cam. The plasmids for GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins were constructed by PCR amplification of cDNAs encoding EPAS1 or CLOCK. The amplified fragments were cloned into the yeast GAL4 activation domain vector, pADGAL4 (Stratagene). The phCLIF expression plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification of the full-length human CLIF cDNA using the primers 5′-TGAGAATTCGACCAAGTGGCTCCTGCGATG-3′and 5′-CAAGGATCCGAGGGTCCACTGGATGTCACT-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in frame into pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-HisA (Invitrogen).

A human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library was constructed by cloning HUVEC cDNAs into the vector HybriZAP-2.1 (Stratagene). The yeast strain YRG-2 (Stratagene) was made competent by the lithium acetate method (17Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Approximately 1010 yeast cells were transformed with 100 μg of the EPAS1 bait plasmid pBDGAL4-EPAS1 and 100 μg of library plasmid. The screening and sequencing of positive clones were performed as described previously (18Chin M.T. Maemura K. Fukumoto S. Jain M.K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6381-6387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus expressing CLIF (AdCMV.CLIF) was prepared by standard homologous recombination techniques using the replication-defective E1/E3-deleted serotype 5 human adenovirus (19Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing CLOCK (AdCMV.CLOCK) was generated using the AdEasy system as described previously (20He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). In brief, the full-length mouse CLOCK cDNA was cloned into the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. After recombination with the vector pAdEasy-1 in bacteria, high titer virus was generated in 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. The titer of the purified adenovirus was determined in 293 cells by plaque assay techniques. Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues and cultured cells with the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). Northern analysis was performed as described previously (15Maemura K. Hsieh C.-M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To obtain a probe for mouse CLIF, a fragment of the mouse CLIF cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers based on the PAS domain sequences of the hCLIF cDNA (5′-AAGATGTTGCCAAAGTAAAGGA-3′, 5′-ATTCCAGTTCTTTTGTCCAAGG-3′). The mouse CLIF cDNA shares 80.8% homology to hCLIF cDNA (data not shown). In situ hybridization studies were performed with paraffin sections as detailed previously (21de la Monte S.M. Bloch K.D. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1997; 30: 139-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22de la Monte S.M. Ng S.C. Hsu D.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 934-946PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, denatured, acetylated, and prehybridized tissue sections were hybridized for 12 h at 50 °C with 250 ng/ml of 14-biotin-UTP-labeled hCLIF antisense and sense cRNA probes. The hCLIF riboprobes were transcribed from a 447-bp (nucleotides 1600–2046) hCLIF cDNA fragment. After stringent washing and digestion of nonspecifically bound probe, the hybridized cRNAs were detected with VectorBrown substrate (Vector Laboratories). The sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Gel mobility shift assays were performed using in vitro translated proteins as described previously (15Maemura K. Hsieh C.-M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 32-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (5′-CTGGACACGTGGGGAGACAATCACGTGGCTGG-3′) contains the two E-boxes derived from the sequence of the PAI-1 promoter. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were plated in six-well dishes and transfected with 15 ng of reporter construct and 1 μg of expression constructs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To correct for variation in transfection efficiency, we cotransfected 15 ng of pCMVβ (CLONTECH) in all experiments. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection by a detergent lysis method (Promega). Luciferase activity and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (23Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Each construct was transfected at least four times, and each transfection was done in triplicate. Data for each construct are presented as the mean ± S.E. EPAS1 is a bHLH/PAS domain transcription factor that is expressed preferentially in vascular endothelial cells (24Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). To identify novel bHLH/PAS domain transcription factors in the cardiovascular system, we screened a HUVEC cDNA library by a yeast two-hybrid system using the HLH/PAS domain of EPAS1 as a bait. Eleven clones out of approximately 2 × 106independent transformants were positive for both HIS3 andlacZ. Of the 11 positive clones, two represented overlapping cDNAs encoding the same novel bHLH/PAS domain protein. We screened a HUVEC cDNA λ phage library using this cDNA as a probe and obtained 10 additional clones for further analysis. The open reading frame encoded a novel polypeptide of 602 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kDa. The putative initiation codon (GCGATGG) is in agreement with the Kozak consensus sequence. Computer data base searches revealed that the amino acid sequence of this bHLH/PAS protein is homologous to Drosophila CYCLE and its mammalian homolog BMAL1 (44.1 and 44.9% identity, respectively) (25Rutila J.E. Suri V. Le M. So W.V. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 93: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 26Ikeda M. Nomura M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1997; 233: 258-264Google Scholar). Thus we designated this novel bHLH/PAS protein as CLIF (CYCLE-like factor). The protein sequence alignment of hCLIF, hBMAL1, and Drosophila CYCLE revealed a particularly high degree of homology in the bHLH and PAS domains (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis within the ARNT superfamily revealed that CLIF and BMAL1 are most closely related toDrosophila CYCLE and diverge early from other members of the ARNT family (Fig. 1 B). Since Drosophila CYCLE shows the highest homology to BMAL1 and CLIF with comparable identities, we conclude that CLIF is the second mammalian homolog ofDrosophila CYCLE. BMAL1 is known to heterodimerize with both EPAS1 and CLOCK (27Hogenesch J.B. Gu Y.Z. Jain S. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5474-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). To determine whether CLIF also interacts with EPAS1 and CLOCK, quantitative yeast β-galactosidase assays were performed. Similar to BMAL1, CLIF interacted with EPAS1 and CLOCK, whereas ARNT interacted only with EPAS1 (Fig. 1 C). This interaction of CLIF is specific because the combination of CLIF and other bHLH/PAS domain proteins, ARNT or BMAL1 was not sufficient to activate β-galactosidase activity in yeast (data not shown). To examine the expression pattern of CLIF, we performed Northern blot analysis on RNA isolated from human tissues. The human CLIF probe hybridized to four mRNAs of 8, 6, 2.4 and 2.2 kilobases. CLIF is expressed most abundantly in the brain and placenta, with lower expression in the heart, thymus, kidney, liver, and lung (Fig.2 A). In contrast to the restricted tissue distribution of CLIF, ARNT and BMAL1 were expressed in many tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles as reported previously (Fig. 2 A) (26Ikeda M. Nomura M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1997; 233: 258-264Google Scholar, 27Hogenesch J.B. Gu Y.Z. Jain S. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5474-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). We further performed in situ hybridization on human tissues to identify the cellular expression of CLIF. CLIF was expressed in endothelial cells and neurons in the brain, including the SCN,i.e. the center of the circadian clock (Fig. 2 B). We also detected CLIF mRNA transcripts in endothelial cells in the heart, lung, and kidney (data not shown). Additional analysis by gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that CLIF formed a heterodimer with CLOCK and bound to the E-box within the Per1 promoter (data not shown). Furthermore, transient transfection of CLOCK and CLIF together transactivated the Per-1 promoter to the same extent as CLOCK and BMAL1 (data not shown) (6Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Taken together, CLIF as a heterodimerization partner of CLOCK may contribute to the control of circadian rhythm in both the central and peripheral clocks. The endothelial cell regulation of vascular tone and fibrinolytic activity shows circadian variation (28Guney H.Z. Uluoglu C. Hodoglugil U. Gorgun C.Z. Yamanoglu T.M. Abacioglu N. Zengil H. Chronobiol. Int. 1999; 16: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 29Adreotti F. Kluft C. Chronobiol. Int. 1991; 8: 336-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For instance, the frequent onset of myocardial infarction during the early morning may partly result from the circadian variation of fibrinolytic activity (2Braunwald E. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1604-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Kurnik P.B. Cardiol. Clin. 1996; 14: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the basal state, PAI-1 is produced mainly in endothelial cells, with the highest activity in the early morning. This elevated PAI-1 activity corresponds with the peak occurrence of myocardial infarctions (31Angleton P. Chandler W.L. Schmer G. Circulation. 1989; 79: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Until now, the molecular mechanisms regulating this type of circadian rhythm have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that peripheral endothelial cells also contain a biological pacemaker and that CLOCK and CLIF are the critical components that activate genes with circadian variations such as PAI-1. To address this hypothesis, we first determined whether PAI-1 mRNA levels exhibited circadian variation. Indeed, Northern blot analysis of the mouse heart (Fig.3 A), kidney (Fig.3 B), brain, and lung (data not shown) showed circadian variation of PAI-1 mRNA levels with peak expression in the evening. This circadian oscillation pattern of mouse PAI-1 mRNA is antiphase to that of human PAI-1 activity, potentially due to the fact that rodents are nocturnal whereas humans are diurnal. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the circadian oscillation of PAI-1 activity is regulated at mRNA level. The blots were then reprobed to analyze CLIF and BMAL1 expression in relation to PAI-1. These studies revealed that CLIF mRNA was constitutively expressed, whereas BMAL1 mRNA levels oscillated as reported previously (9Oishi K. Sakamoto K. Okada T. Nagase T. Ishida N. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1998; 253: 199-203Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). The constant circadian expression pattern of CLIF is similar to that of Drosophila CYCLE (25Rutila J.E. Suri V. Le M. So W.V. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 93: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Per2 and Cry1 are important negative regulators of the biological clocks (32Shearman L.P. Sriram S. Weaver D.R. Maywood E.S. Chaves I. Zheng B. Kume K. Lee C.C. van der Horst G.T. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Science. 2000; 288: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Per2 and Cry1 expression followed a clear circadian oscillation (Fig.3 C). In these experiments, Clock was constitutively expressed as reported previously (data not shown) (33Sun Z.S. Albrecht U. Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Eichele G. Lee C.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the CLOCK:CLIF heterodimer is able to increase the endogenous PAI-1 mRNA in HUVEC. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, we demonstrated that overexpression of CLOCK resulted in a dose-dependent increase in PAI-1 mRNA levels relative to the control cells infected with a GFP-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 3 D). Coinfection of adenovirus expressing CLIF with CLOCK further increased the PAI-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3 D). To further elucidate the mechanisms by which CLOCK and CLIF increase PAI-1 mRNA levels, we performed transient transfection assays using human PAI-1 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids (16van Zonneveld A.J. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of CLOCK and CLIF increased PAI-1 promoter activity by 5-fold (Fig. 4 A). Deleting bp −800 to −550 of the PAI-1 promoter markedly diminished this induction by CLOCK and CLIF (Fig. 4 B). Two E-box elements (CACGTG), which are the consensus binding sites of CLOCK and BMAL1 (6Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar), are located at bp −677 to −672 and at bp −562 to −557. We generated point mutations in these E-boxes to determine whether they are important for the transactivation of PAI-1 promoter by CLOCK and CLIF. Indeed, mutation in either E-box decreased the transactivation of PAI-1 promoter (Fig. 4 B). Mutation of both E-boxes nearly abolished the CLOCK and CLIF mediated transactivation (Fig.4 B). Thus, both E-box elements are important for the CLOCK:CLIF transactivation of the PAI-1 promoter. To determine whether the CLOCK:CLIF heterodimer transactivates the PAI-1 promoter by directly binding to the E-boxes, we performed gel mobility shift assays with in vitro translated CLOCK and CLIF proteins and a labeled probe containing the PAI-1 E-boxes. In the presence of CLOCK, a weak shifted band was observed. In the presence of both CLOCK and CLIF proteins, however, robust DNA binding activity was detected (Fig. 4 C). In the central circadian pacemaker, PER and CRY function by inhibiting CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription of their own promoter through CACGTG E-box enhancer elements (7Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 8Griffin Jr., E.A. Staknis D. Weitz C.J. Science. 1999; 286: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We found that Per2 and Cry1 mRNAs showed a clear circadian oscillation in peripheral tissues (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, we asked whether PER2 or CRY1 could affect the CLOCK:CLIF activation of PAI-1. Cotransfection of PER2 partially inhibited CLOCK:CLIF-dependent transcription, while cotransfection of CRY1 abolished the induction of the PAI-1 promoter (Fig.4 D). These data suggest that PER2 and/or CRY1 suppress the CLOCK:CLIF-mediated transcription of PAI-1, resulting in the circadian oscillation of PAI-1 gene expression. We identified that both E-boxes in PAI-1 promoter are responsible for its activation by CLOCK:CLIF. It is noteworthy that the E-box at bp −677 to −672 overlaps with the sequence of the 4G/5G polymorphism of the PAI-1 promoter, which correlates with serum levels of PAI-1 and the frequency of ischemic diseases (34Eriksson P. Kallin B. van't Hooft F.M. Bavenholm P. Hamsten A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1851-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 35Roest M. van der Schouw Y.T. Banga J.D. Tempelman M.J. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Grobbee D.E. Circulation. 2000; 101: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the 4G/5G polymorphism of PAI-1 promoter may affect the binding of CLOCK:CLIF to this E-box or interaction with adjacent transcription factors, resulting in an altered circadian expression of the PAI-1 gene. Therefore, it may be interesting to see the relation between the circadian oscillation pattern of PAI-1 activity and the 4G/5G polymorphism. Recent data indicate that the mammalian circadian system is hierarchically organized, with self-sustained oscillators in the SCN entraining dampened oscillators in the periphery (12Yamazaki S. Numano R. Abe M. Hida A. Takahashi R. Ueda M. Block G.D. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Tei H. Science. 2000; 288: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of these peripheral oscillators remains unknown. Our results suggest that a peripheral tissue pacemaker regulates the circadian expression of PAI-1 gene directly. There are two heterodimers containing CLOCK; BMAL1:CLOCK dimer and CLIF:CLOCK dimer. The oscillation pattern and distribution of these two dimers are different in peripheral tissues. Therefore it may be possible that the combination of CLOCK:CLIF or CLOCK:BMAL1 together with PER and CRY function to regulate the peripheral pacemakers differently. Thus circadian rhythm in mammals may be regulated by both the central and peripheral tissue pacemakers. In addition, since PAI-1 plays a crucial role in controlling fibrinolytic activity, the results potentially provide a molecular basis for the circadian variation of myocardial infarction.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Later S100 proteins were discovered in a variety of other tissues and cells. In the nervous system S100 proteins are highly enriched in glial cells. The primary structure of S100 proteins is highly conserved (2Schafer B.M. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of several S100 proteins has been reported, revealing a novel homodimeric fold (3Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure ( Lond. ). 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Structural studies have demonstrated the presence of intramolecular disulfide bridges in S100A7 and intermolecular disulfide bridges between two monomers in S100A10. An S100 monomer contains two EF-hand calcium binding domains (2Schafer B.M. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The calcium binding results in a conformational change with subsequent exposure of a hydrophobic patch through which S100 proteins can interact with their target (4Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure ( Lond. ). 1998; 6: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, S100 proteins have been shown to interact with numerous targets and modulate multiple cellular processes including remodeling of the cytoskeleton, cell growth, and differentiation (5, 6,). Extracellularly, disulfide-linked dimers of the S100B protein have been demonstrated to stimulate neurite outgrowth in primary cultures of neurons from the cerebral cortex (7Winningham-Major F. Staecker J.L. Barger S.W. Coats S. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3063-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).The mts1/S100A4 gene was isolated as a gene specifically expressed in metastatic tumor cell lines (8Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and results obtained in transgenic mice strongly suggest an important role for themts1 gene in tumor progression (9Ambartsumian N.S.

Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar). The biological functions of the Mts1 protein are only partially known. It has been shown that Mts1 is associated with actin stress fibers, and probably it is through this interaction that Mts1 affects the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular motility (11Gibbs F.E. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18992-18999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy chain of non-muscle myosin (MHC)1has been identified as an intracellular target of Mts1 (12Kriajevska M. Neira M. Ambartsumian N. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 239: 19679-19682Google Scholar). The role of Mts1 in metastasis has been suggested to depend on its effect on cell motility and possibly cytokinesis by controlling myosin assembly/disassembly presumably through modulation of MHC phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) (13Kriajevska M. Tarabykina S. Bronstein I. Maitland N. Lomanosov M. Hansen K. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9852-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).We here show for the first time that the Mts1 protein can function extracellularly as a very efficient neuritogenic factor. Neurite outgrowth induced by the oligomeric form of Mts1 is not dependent on the presence of intermolecular disulfide bonds. We also addressed the signal transduction mechanisms underlying Mts1-induced neuronal differentiation and showed that Mts1-stimulated neurite outgrowth involves activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C, depends on the intracellular level of Ca2+, and requires activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2.DISCUSSIONThe Mts1 protein is one of 18 members of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. We here present the first evidence that Mts1 has a function when applied extracellularly. Recombinant Mts1 added to cell culture medium strongly stimulated neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons. It is known that many neurotrophic factors have different effects on different type of neurons. For example, basic FGF has been demonstrated to promote neurite outgrowth of vestibulospinal neurons in vitro (30Pataky D.M. Borisoff J.F. Fernandes K.J. Tetzlaff W. Steeved J.D. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but in cultures of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons, it stimulates cell proliferation (31Brewer G.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). S100B has been shown to stimulate neurite outgrowth from a number of neurons including dorsal root ganglia neurons (5Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, neuritogenic effects of S100A1 and S100B on embryonic hippocampal neurons in vitro have never previously been tested. Hippocampal neurons cultured in the presence of Mts1 displayed abundant neurites, whereas treatment with FGF, S100A1, and S100B had no effect on these cells. Incubation with specific antibodies abolished this activity of Mts1. The concentrations of recombinant Mts1 required for maximal stimulation was 5–10 μm, which is higher than that needed for other neurotrophic factors (32Mitsumoto H. Tsuzaka K. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 983-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the calculated effective concentration of Mts1 oligomers was only 90 nm.Size exclusion chromatography followed by dynamic light scattering analysis of the individual fractions showed that recombinant Mts1 existed both as a dimer and as higher order oligomers. The Mts1 dimer did not exhibit any neuritogenic activity. Neurite outgrowth induction by Mts1 was exclusively associated with high molecular weight complexes. We have previously shown that the tyrosine 75 residue regulates the capacity of Mts1 for dimerization and that substitution of this residue with phenylalanine lead to formation of more stable dimers. The Y75F mutant of Mts1 existed predominantly as a dimer, and it exhibited a negligible neuritogenic activity. In contrast, deletion of tyrosine 75, which promoted oligomerization, enhanced the neurite outgrowth activity of Mts1 to levels comparable with the wild type protein. We hypothesize that formation of high molecular weight aggregates of the Mts1 protein change its conformation in such a way that the putative active surface/sequence hitherto buried in the dimeric form becomes exposed.The degree of dimerization and olygomerization of Mts1 is dependent on the concentration of the protein in solution.3 In the yeast two-hybrid system, in which intranuclear concentration of baits and transcriptional activation domain-tagged proteins estimates are 10−7–10−5m (33Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), del75 was unable to form dimers.2However, del75 can dimerize at much higher protein concentrations. Highly concentrated solutions of del75 (>0.1 mm), which were used in the present work, contain a significant amount of oligomeric species as well as dimeric forms (Fig. 4 c).Biologically active S100B contains two disulfide bridges. It has been suggested that these bridges might be formed after secretion of the protein from glial cells into the oxidizing extracellular environment (34Van Eldik LJ. Zimmer D.B. Gerday C. Gilles R.

Even though disulfide-oxidized species have been detected in Mts1 preparations, we do not attribute the neurite outgrowth activity of Mts1 to this phenomenon, the reason being that an Mts1 mutant in which all four cysteines were substituted by serines retained the capacity to promote neurite outgrowth, albeit with a reduced activity compared with wtMts1 protein. These results suggest that disulfide bonds themselves are not important for the neuritogenic activity of the Mts1 protein, even though they may be important for stabilizing the active conformation of the molecule.It is not known at present whether the biological activity of Mts1 is mediated via binding to a cell surface receptor. A 30-min incubation in the presence of Mts1 was sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons. The short time of exposure needed to generate the neuritogenic response to Mts1 and the fact that immobilized Mts1 also can induce neuritogenesis indicate that the effect may be attributed to a receptor mediating a signaling similar to that of other neurotrophic factors (35Walicke P.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that one of the proteins belonging to the S100 family, calgranulin C (S100A12), recognizes a distinct cell surface receptor for advancedglycation end products (RAGE) expressed on endothelial cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes (36Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath MF. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 889-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). RAGE is a multiligand member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and one of its potential ligands, a 30-kDa heparin-binding protein (amphoterin), has been demonstrated to induce neurite outgrowth (37Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Whether Mts1 induces neuritogenesis by binding to RAGE or to another specific receptor remains to be determined.It is well established that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, the ERKs, can be activated by growth and differentiation factors, and this activation may be mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, or cytokine receptors (38Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 48-139Google Scholar). Although the receptor for the Mts1 protein has not been identified, the demonstrated activation of ERKs in response to Mts1 treatment suggests an involvement of the Ras/Raf-signaling cascade in Mts1-stimulated neurite outgrowth. However, there are other intracellular pathways that can activate ERKs. Thus, in neurons, activation of PKC (39Ueda Y. Hirai Si. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) or elevation of intracellular calcium also result in phosphorylation of ERKs (40Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Activation of ERKs can also be mediated by the non-receptor focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is activated in neuronal cells in response to elevated calcium (41Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). The Ca+2-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II may also be involved in activation of ERKs (42Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Udin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fact that inhibition of the Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II kinase in Mts1 prevented Mts1-stimulated neurite outgrowth suggests that an alternative, Ras/Raf-independent pathway may participate in the observed ERKs activation. Intracellular calcium is important for many neuronal functions including neuronal plasticity (43Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the Mts1 protein may increase intracellular calcium in hippocampal neurons is not understood but might occur through calcium release from intracellular stores. Interestingly, we show that Mts1 does require PLC activation and, thereby, phosphoinositide turnover to stimulate neurite outgrowth. It is commonly known that PLCγ activation through accumulation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate results in elevation of intracellular calcium. Thus, the obtained results identify signaling cascades responsible for neuritogenesis promoted by Mts1 stimulation, as shown in Fig. 8, in which it is indicated that Mts1-induced neurite outgrowth depends on modulation of the intracellular level of Ca2+, the subsequent activation of mediator of the action of Ca2+, Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II, and the activation of the PLC-PKC-MAP kinase kinase-ERK1/2 pathway.There is evidence that S100 proteins can be secreted. Secretion of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins has been observed after activation of human monocytes by protein kinase C (44Rammes A. Roth J. Goebeler M. Klempt M. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9496-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Release of Mts1 from intact peridontal ligament cells (45Duarte W.R. Limura T. Takenaga K. Ohya K. Ishikawa I. Kasugai S. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and cultured metastatic mammary carcinoma cells (46Ambartsumian N. Klingelhöfer J. Grigorian M. Karlstrøm O. Sidenius N. Lukanidin E. Invasion Metastasis. 1999; 18: 96-104Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has also been reported. Recently we have demonstrated that in vivo Mts1 is expressed in mouse embryonic macrophages (47Klingelhöfer J. Ambartsumian N.S. Lukanidin E.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and in white matter astrocytes of the rat spinal cord (48Kozlova E.N. Lukanidin E.M. Glia. 1999; 27: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It may therefore be hypothesized that Mts1 released from astrocytes or macrophages modulates neuronal differentiation. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the functional significance of Mts1 expression in the nervous system, particularly in astrocytes, to characterize the mechanism of secretion and to identify the receptor involved in the neuritogenic activity of Mts1. S100 proteins were first identified in brain and were for a long time considered to be nervous system-specific proteins (1Moore B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Later S100 proteins were discovered in a variety of other tissues and cells. In the nervous system S100 proteins are highly enriched in glial cells. The primary structure of S100 proteins is highly conserved (2Schafer B.M. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of several S100 proteins has been reported, revealing a novel homodimeric fold (3Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure ( Lond. ). 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Structural studies have demonstrated the presence of intramolecular disulfide bridges in S100A7 and intermolecular disulfide bridges between two monomers in S100A10. An S100 monomer contains two EF-hand calcium binding domains (2Schafer B.M. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). The calcium binding results in a conformational change with subsequent exposure of a hydrophobic patch through which S100 proteins can interact with their target (4Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure ( Lond. ). 1998; 6: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, S100 proteins have been shown to interact with numerous targets and modulate multiple cellular processes including remodeling of the cytoskeleton, cell growth, and differentiation (5, 6,). Extracellularly, disulfide-linked dimers of the S100B protein have been demonstrated to stimulate neurite outgrowth in primary cultures of neurons from the cerebral cortex (7Winningham-Major F. Staecker J.L. Barger S.W. Coats S. Van Eldik L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3063-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The mts1/S100A4 gene was isolated as a gene specifically expressed in metastatic tumor cell lines (8Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Revazova E. Lukanidin E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and results obtained in transgenic mice strongly suggest an important role for themts1 gene in tumor progression (9Ambartsumian N.S.

Jolicoeur P. Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar). The biological functions of the Mts1 protein are only partially known. It has been shown that Mts1 is associated with actin stress fibers, and probably it is through this interaction that Mts1 affects the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular motility (11Gibbs F.E. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18992-18999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heavy chain of non-muscle myosin (MHC)1has been identified as an intracellular target of Mts1 (12Kriajevska M. Neira M. Ambartsumian N. Georgiev G.P. Lukanidin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 239: 19679-19682Google Scholar). The role of Mts1 in metastasis has been suggested to depend on its effect on cell motility and possibly cytokinesis by controlling myosin assembly/disassembly presumably through modulation of MHC phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) (13Kriajevska M. Tarabykina S. Bronstein I. Maitland N. Lomanosov M. Hansen K. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9852-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We here show for the first time that the Mts1 protein can function extracellularly as a very efficient neuritogenic factor. Neurite outgrowth induced by the oligomeric form of Mts1 is not dependent on the presence of intermolecular disulfide bonds. We also addressed the signal transduction mechanisms underlying Mts1-induced neuronal differentiation and showed that Mts1-stimulated neurite outgrowth involves activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C, depends on the intracellular level of Ca2+, and requires activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2. DISCUSSIONThe Mts1 protein is one of 18 members of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. We here present the first evidence that Mts1 has a function when applied extracellularly. Recombinant Mts1 added to cell culture medium strongly stimulated neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons. It is known that many neurotrophic factors have different effects on different type of neurons. For example, basic FGF has been demonstrated to promote neurite outgrowth of vestibulospinal neurons in vitro (30Pataky D.M. Borisoff J.F. Fernandes K.J. Tetzlaff W. Steeved J.D. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 163: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but in cultures of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons, it stimulates cell proliferation (31Brewer G.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). S100B has been shown to stimulate neurite outgrowth from a number of neurons including dorsal root ganglia neurons (5Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, neuritogenic effects of S100A1 and S100B on embryonic hippocampal neurons in vitro have never previously been tested. Hippocampal neurons cultured in the presence of Mts1 displayed abundant neurites, whereas treatment with FGF, S100A1, and S100B had no effect on these cells. Incubation with specific antibodies abolished this activity of Mts1. The concentrations of recombinant Mts1 required for maximal stimulation was 5–10 μm, which is higher than that needed for other neurotrophic factors (32Mitsumoto H. Tsuzaka K. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 983-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the calculated effective concentration of Mts1 oligomers was only 90 nm.Size exclusion chromatography followed by dynamic light scattering analysis of the individual fractions showed that recombinant Mts1 existed both as a dimer and as higher order oligomers. The Mts1 dimer did not exhibit any neuritogenic activity. Neurite outgrowth induction by Mts1 was exclusively associated with high molecular weight complexes. We have previously shown that the tyrosine 75 residue regulates the capacity of Mts1 for dimerization and that substitution of this residue with phenylalanine lead to formation of more stable dimers. The Y75F mutant of Mts1 existed predominantly as a dimer, and it exhibited a negligible neuritogenic activity. In contrast, deletion of tyrosine 75, which promoted oligomerization, enhanced the neurite outgrowth activity of Mts1 to levels comparable with the wild type protein. We hypothesize that formation of high molecular weight aggregates of the Mts1 protein change its conformation in such a way that the putative active surface/sequence hitherto buried in the dimeric form becomes exposed.The degree of dimerization and olygomerization of Mts1 is dependent on the concentration of the protein in solution.3 In the yeast two-hybrid system, in which intranuclear concentration of baits and transcriptional activation domain-tagged proteins estimates are 10−7–10−5m (33Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), del75 was unable to form dimers.2However, del75 can dimerize at much higher protein concentrations. Highly concentrated solutions of del75 (>0.1 mm), which were used in the present work, contain a significant amount of oligomeric species as well as dimeric forms (Fig. 4 c).Biologically active S100B contains two disulfide bridges. It has been suggested that these bridges might be formed after secretion of the protein from glial cells into the oxidizing extracellular environment (34Van Eldik LJ. Zimmer D.B. Gerday C. Gilles R. Bolis L. Calcium and Calcium-binding Proteins. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 114-127Google Scholar). Even though disulfide-oxidized species have been detected in Mts1 preparations, we do not attribute the neurite outgrowth activity of Mts1 to this phenomenon, the reason being that an Mts1 mutant in which all four cysteines were substituted by serines retained the capacity to promote neurite outgrowth, albeit with a reduced activity compared with wtMts1 protein.

Interestingly, we show that Mts1 does require PLC activation and, thereby, phosphoinositide turnover to stimulate neurite outgrowth. It is commonly known that PLCγ activation through accumulation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate results in elevation of intracellular calcium. Thus, the obtained results identify signaling cascades responsible for neuritogenesis promoted by Mts1 stimulation, as shown in Fig. 8, in which it is indicated that Mts1-induced neurite outgrowth depends on modulation of the intracellular level of Ca2+, the subsequent activation of mediator of the action of Ca2+, Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II, and the activation of the PLC-PKC-MAP kinase kinase-ERK1/2 pathway. There is evidence that S100 proteins can be secreted. Secretion of S100A8 and S100A9 proteins has been observed after activation of human monocytes by protein kinase C (44Rammes A. Roth J.

Glia. 1999; 27: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It may therefore be hypothesized that Mts1 released from astrocytes or macrophages modulates neuronal differentiation. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the functional significance of Mts1 expression in the nervous system, particularly in astrocytes, to characterize the mechanism of secretion and to identify the receptor involved in the neuritogenic activity of Mts1."

In the present study, we demonstrate a novel β2-AR-mediated cross-talk between PKA and p38 MAPK in adult mouse cardiac myocytes expressing β2-AR, with a null background of β1β2-AR double knockout. β2-AR stimulation by isoproterenol increased p38 MAPK activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Inhibiting Gi with pertussis toxin or scavenging Gβγ with βARK-ct overexpression could not prevent β2-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation. In contrast, a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA, PKI (5 μm), completely abolished the stimulatory effect of β2-AR, suggesting that β2-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation is mediated via a PKA-dependent mechanism, rather than by Gi or Gβγ. This conclusion was further supported by the ability of forskolin (10 μm), an adenylyl cyclase activator, to elevate p38 MAPK activity in a PKI-sensitive manner.

There are three major subgroups identified, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), c-jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. Various extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, mechanical stress, UV light, osmotic stress, and heat shock, can activate MAPK signaling cascades (5Christian W. Spencer G. Matthew B.J. Gary L.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has shown that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),e.g. β-adrenergic receptor (AR), also regulate MAPKs, particularly ERK1/2 MAPK. One major pathway of GPCR-mediated activation of MAPKs is dependent on “transactivation” of a panel of receptor tyrosine kinases (such as epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor) (6Roudabush F.L.

Specifically, stimulation of GPCRs leads to the release of free Gβγ dimers, which, in turn, activate these receptor tyrosine kinases by unidentified mechanisms, resulting in activation of ERK1/2 MAPKs (9van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 10Koch W.J. Hawes B.E.

A large body of evidence has demonstrated that activation of p38 MAPK, also called a stress-activated protein kinase, is associated with the onset of cardiac hypertrophy and cell death in response to in vivo pressure overload or ischemic/reperfusion injury (11Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7228-7234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In Gαq transgenic mice, the transition of hypertrophy to apoptosis is coincident with activation of p38 MAPK (14Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W., II Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This paradigm has been further manifested by p38 MAPK-induced apoptosis in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes overexpressing p38 MAPK (15Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These previous studies suggest an involvement of p38 MAPK in cardiac apoptosis. However, more recent studies have proposed that in cultured adult rat myocytes, p38 MAPK is activated by β-AR stimulation via a Gi-dependent mechanism, protecting myocytes against β-AR/Gs-mediated apoptosis (16Communal C. Colucci W.S. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19395-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to the wealth of knowledge as to GPCR-mediated ERK1/2 activation, the role of GPCRs in regulating p38 MAPK activity and its physiological relevance remains controversial. This study seeks to determine whether cardiac β2-AR stimulation regulates p38 MAPK signaling and, if so, to explore underlying mechanisms and examine the possible interaction between the concurrent PKA and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. To selectively stimulate cardiac β2-AR, we expressed the human β2-AR in ventricular myocytes isolated from adult β1β2-AR double knockout (DKO) mice using adenoviral gene transfer (17Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that “pure” β2-AR stimulation activates p38 MAPK via a PKA-dependent mechanism, but independent of Giand Gβγ, and that the activated p38 MAPK provides a novel negative feedback to the PKA-mediated contractile response in adult mouse ventricular myocytes. The investigation conforms to National Institutes of Health guiding principles in the care and use of animals. Single mouse cardiac myocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2–3-month-old β1/β2-AR DKO mice with an enzymatic technique, then cultured and infected with β2-AR-adenoviral vector, adeno-β2-AR at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100, as described previously (17Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a subset of experiments, myocytes were co-infected by adeno-β2-AR and adeno-βARK-ct (adenovirus vector carrying a βARK carboxyl-terminal fragment) or infected by adeno-β-Gal (adenovirus vector with reporter genelacZ) as negative control, all at m.o.i. of 100. Before culture, myocytes were washed three times with minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and then plated at 0.5 ∼ 1 × 104/cm2 with the same medium in the culture dishes precoated with 10 μg/ml mouse laminin. Following 1 h of culture (to achieve attachment), the culture medium was aspirated along with unattached cells. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was implemented by adding a minimal volume of the FBS-free MEM containing an appropriate titer of gene-carrying adenovirus. The full volume of FBS-free MEM was supplied after culture for another 1–2 h. All experiments were performed after 24 h of adenoviral infection. In a subset of experiments, myocytes were treated with pertussis toxin (PTX, 0.5 μg/ml for 24 h) to ribosylate Gi/Go proteins. The efficacy of PTX was routinely examined by the abolition of M2-muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibitory effect on β-AR contractile response (19Xiao R.P. Ji X. Lakatta E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After culture for 24 h, cells were incubated with isoproterenol (ISO) or forskolin at 37 °C for an indicated period of time (1 ∼ 60 min), then lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein contents were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was measured by Western blotting as described previously (18Kuschel M. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Zhang S.J. Chen Y. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22048-22052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of protein were denatured in 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8. The samples were separated by 12% Tris-glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% fat-free dry milk in Western buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with 1:1000 phospho-p38 MAPK antibody overnight in Western Buffer with 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. After being washed twice, membranes were incubated with 1:2000 anti-IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by LumiGLO Chemiluminescent Substrate (new United Kingdom Biolabs), and the relative level of phosphorylated p38 MAPK was quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The same membrane was striped in strip buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min, then re-probed with a second primary antibody to determine the total p38 protein abundance using a similar procedure. p38 MAPK activity was detected by using MAPK assay kits (New England Biolabs) following the instruction manual. Briefly, 200 μg of total protein were immunoprecipitated with immobilized phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) monoclonal antibody. After the immune complexes were washed three times with the lysis buffer and three times with the kinase buffer, the reaction was performed in kinase buffer containing 200 μmATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein as a substrate of p38 MAPK. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× Laemmli sample buffer at the time indicated. The boiled samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the membrane was blocked, anti-phospho-ATF2 antibody was used to probe the activity of p38 MAPK. In a subset of experiments, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (SB), at variable concentrations was added into the reaction mixture to determine its inhibitory effect on p38 MAPK activity. Cells were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss, model IM-35), perfused with HEPES-buffered solution (1.0 mm CaCl2, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 15 mm dextrose, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min and electrically stimulated at 0.5 Hz at 23 °C. Cell length was monitored by an optical edge-tracking method using a photodiode array (model 1024 SAQ, Reticon) with a 3-ms time resolution. Cell contraction was measured by the percent shortening of cell length following electrical stimulation. MEM, PTX, ISO, forskolin, and propranolol were purchased from Sigma. FBS and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Laminin was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. PKI (a cell membrane-permeable protein kinase A inhibitor 14–22 amide) and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against phospho-p38 was purchased from New England Biolabs. Mouse monoclonal antibody against SAPK/p38 and anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Adeno-β2-AR and adeno-βARK-ct were kindly provided by Robert J. Lefkowitz and Walter J. Koch at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between control and treatments were performed using Student's unpaired t test or analysis of variance when appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To define the effect of β2-AR stimulation on p38 MAPK, both the phosphorylation status and the activity of p38 MAPK in response to a β-AR agonist ISO were examined in adult β1β2 DKO mouse cardiac myocytes expressing β2-AR (450 ± 48 fmol/mg protein, n = 4). Stimulation of β2-AR by ISO (1 μm) increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation (an index of the kinase activation) in a time-dependent manner, as shown by the typical Western blot (Fig. 1 A, top band) and the average data (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was transiently elevated following β2-AR stimulation; it occurred significantly as early as 5 min, reached the peak of 1.7-fold augmentation at 15 min, and then gradually declined to the basal level at 60 min (Fig. 1, A and B). Concomitantly, phosphorylation of its substrate protein, ATF-2, was also enhanced by 1.8-fold in response to β2-AR stimulation, with a similar temporal profile to that of p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1,A and B). Pretreatment of cells with a β-AR antagonist, propranolol (10 μm), 15 min prior to ISO, completely abolished β2-AR-stimulated p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, antagonized a β2-AR-induced increase in p38 MAPK activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 D). Fig. 2 shows the average dose-response curve of p38 MAPK phosphorylation to β2-AR stimulation; ISO dose-dependently increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation with an EC50 of 10 nm and a maximal response at concentrations ≥ 1 μm. These results indicate that ISO-induced β2-AR stimulation activates p38 MAPK in a time- and dose-dependent fashion.Figure 2Dose response of p38 MAPK Phosphorylation to β2-AR stimulation by ISO. Adeno-β2-AR-infected myocytes were incubated with ISO at variable concentrations for 15 min (see “Experimental Procedures”).A shows a typical Western bolt with an anti-phospho-p38 antibody to determine p38 phosphorylation (top band) or with an anti-p38 MAPK antibody to show the total p38 MAPK (bottom band). Note that while the total p38 amount is highly comparable at different ISO concentrations, the phosphorylated p38 is increased by ISO in a dose-dependent manner. B shows the average dose response of p38 phosphorylation to ISO (with a log EC50 of −8 ± 0.24) (n = 3 independent experiments; *, p < 0.05 versuscontrol value).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since β2-AR couples to both Gs and Gi proteins (19Xiao R.P.

Res. 1999; 84: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), we first asked whether Gi signaling is essentially involved in the β2-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with PTX to disrupt Gi/Go signaling. While PTX treatment completely abolished the inhibitory effect of M2-muscarinic stimulation on β-AR-mediated positive contractile response in all of the cells examined (data not shown), it could not prevent the effect of β2-AR stimulation to activate p38 MAPK (Fig. 3, A and B). Next, we determined whether the β2-AR stimulatory effect is dependent on Gβγ, as often is the case for GPCR-mediated ERK1/2 MAPK activation (9van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 10Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, Aand B, inhibiting Gβγ subunits by overexpressing Gβγ scavenger, βARK-ct, could not abolish β2-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation. In contrast, overexpression of βARK-ct fully prevented β2-AR-mediated anti-apoptotic effect (data not shown), indicating it is effective in blocking Gβγ. Thus, the effect of β2-AR stimulation on p38 MAPK is independent of either Gi or Gβγ signaling. We next examined the possible role of the classic Gs-adenylyl cyclase-PKA signaling pathway in β2-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation. Cells were treated with PKI (5 μm), a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA, 15 min prior to ISO application. Fig. 4shows that PKI fully prevented the effect of β2-AR stimulation (1 μm ISO for 15 min) on p38 MAPK. If PKA is sufficient to activate p38 MAPK, receptor-independent reagents induced PKA activation should also increase this MAPK activity. Indeed, direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin (FSK, 10 μm), similar to β2-AR stimulation by ISO, markedly increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Moreover, PKI completely abolished the response of p38 MAPK to forskolin (Fig. 4, Aand B). As a negative control, we further demonstrated that in cells transfected with adeno-β-Gal, ISO had no effect on p38 MAPK activation, whereas FSK did increase the p38 MAPK activity in a PKI-sensitive manner (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that β2-AR stimulation activates p38 MAPK via a PKA-dependent pathway. A predominant functional role of acute β-AR stimulation in cardiac myocytes is to increase contractility. To investigate the possible physiological relevance of β2-AR-stimulated p38 MAPK activation, we measured cell contractile response to β2-AR stimulation by ISO at a submaximal concentration (10−9m) in the presence or absence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. Since our data showed that SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, at 10 μm effectively antagonized β2-AR-mediated p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 1 D), we chose this concentration of SB203580 to determine the possible cross-talk between p38 MAPK and PKA in regulating cardiac contractility. SB203580 at 10 μm markedly enhanced β2-AR-induced contractile response, although SB alone at the concentration employed had no detectable effect on cell base-line contractility (Fig. 5, A and B). On average, the positive inotropic effect of β2-AR stimulation was enhanced by ∼60% (Fig. 5 B). In fact, SB203580 even at a lower concentration (5 μm) also significantly enhanced ISO-induced positive inotropic effect. Thus, inhibition of p38 MAPK potentiates β2-AR-stimulated contractile response in adult mouse cardiac myocytes, suggesting that p38 MAPK provides a negative feedback to β2-AR-stimulated, PKA-mediated contractile response. There are three major findings in this study. First, we have demonstrated that in adult mouse cardiac myocytes, β2-AR stimulation by ISO induces a time- and dose-dependent increase in p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 1). Second and most importantly, we have shown that the stimulatory effect of β2-AR on p38 MAPK is mediated by a PKA-dependent pathway, rather than by Gi or Gβγ signaling (Fig. 2). Finally, the present results elucidate a novel role of p38 MAPK in regulating cardiac contractility, in addition to its chronic functional role in regulating cell growth and cell death (11Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J.

Thus, the present study not only shows that β2-AR sequentially activates the Gs-adenylyl cyclase-PKA and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, but also documents an intriguing forward and retrograde cross-talk between those signaling pathways. While previous studies have demonstrated that Gβγ and Gαq/11increase p38 MAPK activity (22Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol.

We determined the possible role of Gi in β2-AR-mediated p38 MAPK activation in adult mouse ventricular myocytes. Surprisingly, inhibition of Gi with PTX cannot prevent the β2-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation, although PTX treatment fully abolishes M2-mediated anti-adrenergic effect under the same experimental conditions. In sharp contrast, inhibition of PKA by a specific peptide inhibitor, PKI, completely abrogates the stimulatory effect of β2-AR on p38 MAPK activation, strongly suggesting that PKA plays an essential role in β2-AR-induced p38 MAPK activation. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin also markedly increases p38 activity in a PKI-sensitive manner, resembling β2-AR stimulation. Thus, β2-AR-stimulated p38 MAPK activation is largely attributable to the Gs-adenylyl cyclase-PKA, rather than a Gi signaling pathway. The reason caused the different outcomes of the present study from that of the previous work in adult rat cardiac myocytes (16Communal C. Colucci W.S. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19395-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) is presently unclear. However, it might be related to the different species used. It has been shown that there are six p38 MAPK isoforms (24Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di, Padova F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Both α and β p38 MAPK isoforms co-exist in cardiac myocytes and elicit divergent functional roles (25Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 26Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Whether rat and mouse cardiac myocytes have different predominant isoform(s) of p38 MAPK awaits further studies. In principal, a dynamic interplay of protein phosphatases and protein kinases may be applicable to the cross-talk between PKA and p38 MAPK. Various protein kinases may regulate p38 MAPK activity by modulating the phosphorylation status of this MAPK. It has been well accepted that that MKK (MAPK kinase)3/6-mediated phosphorylation of this kinase at Thr-Glu-Tyr motif is essential for its activation. Recent evidence suggests that phosphorylation of intermediate signaling molecules,e.g. glia maturation factor, by PKA causes a robust increase in p38 MAPK activity (27Lim R. Zaheer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22953-22956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, in HEK 293 cells, activation of PKA mediates phosphorylation of β2-AR, resulting in a switch of the receptor coupling preference from Gs to Gi and release of Gβγ, then the resultant free Gβγ subunits subsequently activate MAPKs (28Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, under our experimental conditions, inhibiting free Gβγ with βARK-ct cannot prevent β2-AR-stimulated p38 MAPK activation. Thus, Gβγ subunits are not involved in β2-AR-mediated, PKA-dependent p38 MAPK activation in cardiac myocytes. PKA may enhance the activity of MAPKs by inhibiting Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, particularly, phosphatase 1 (PP1). PKA inhibits PP1 either by direct inhibition via phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit or by indirect inhibition via phosphorylation and subsequent activation of endogenous phosphatase inhibitor 1 (29Gupta R.C. Neumann J. Watanabe A.M. Lesch M. Sabbah H.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1159-H1164PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that PKA phosphorylates protein tyrosin phosphatases and inhibits their interaction with MAPKs, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK (30Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11693-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), thereby resulting in enhanced activation of MAPKs, including p38 MAPK (31Saxena M. Williams S. Taskén K. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between PKA and MAPKs signaling pathways is complicated and remains highly controversial. The exact mechanism underlying β2-AR-stimulated, PKA-dependent p38 MAPK activation in adult mouse cardiac myocytes merits further investigations. Previous studies on p38 MAPK have been focused on multitude aspects of cell growth and cell death. Activation of p38 MAPK has been shown to enhance apoptosis in neonatal cardiac myocytes (26Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 32Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J.

Colucci W.S. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19395-19400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A similar controversial situation has been reported in other cell types. The diversity in p38 MAPK functions may be related to the heterogeneity of this kinase or different experimental settings, e.g.different cell types or distinct developmental or differentiation status of the studied cells. It has been well accepted that β2-AR increases cardiac contractility through Gs-adenylyl cyclase-PKA signaling cascade (18Kuschel M. Zhou Y.Y. Cheng H. Zhang S.J. Chen Y. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. J.

Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that this PKA pathway subsequently induces a β2-AR-stimulated p38 MAPK activation. Interestingly, the activated p38 MAPK provides a negative feedback to its upstream, PKA, mediated contractile response, because inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB significantly enhances β2-AR-mediated contractile response. This observation is supported by a strikingly reduced β-AR contractile response in transgenic mice overexpressing p38 MAPK. 2Y. Wang and P. Liao, personal communication. The opposing effects of PKA and p38 MAPK on cardiac contractility may have important physiological and pathophysiological relevance. Since increased p38 MAPK activity is associated with cardiomyopathy induced by overexpression of Gαq (14Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H.

In summary, the present study provides the first documentation that in adult mouse cardiac myocytes, β2-AR stimulation increases p38 MAPK activation via a PKA-dependent mechanism, rather than by Gi or Gβγ signaling. Furthermore, the present results reveal an important cross-talk between β2-AR-stimulated PKA and the concurrent p38 MAPK signaling cascades in regulating cardiac contractility, i.e.cardiac β2-AR-PKA activated p38 MAPK provides a negative feedback to the PKA-mediated contractile response. These findings shed new light on understanding the close association of p38 MAPK activation with the onset of cardiac dysfunction and markedly diminished β-AR contractile support in response to pressure overload and ischemia or reperfusion injury (11Bogoyevitch M.A. Gillespie-Brown J.

Copper for instance, is maintained at a total intracellular concentration in the 10−4-10−5m range. Despite this abundance, it has recently been shown that copper ions are typically unavailable in the cytoplasm for direct substitution into metalloenzymes. In fact, the steady state concentration of the free or labile form of copper ion in the cytoplasm of yeast is far less than one ion per cell (1Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the intracellular milieu has a significant overcapacity for metal chelation, and raises the issue of how apo-proteins acquire the correct metal cofactor. A class of metal ion trafficking proteins is emerging that act in distribution of essential transition metal cofactors to specific targets in the cytoplasm, to the cell surface or integral membranes, or to various intracellular compartments. Several newly discovered metal-receptor proteins called metallochaperones are now known to serve as key agents in cellular trafficking of these cofactors (2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

These cytosolic proteins are characterized by a metal-exchange partnership with one or more specific intracellular target proteins and by a metal-specific binding activity.

In each structurally characterized case, the metal ion is bound by two cysteine thiolate moeities in a highly conserved MX CXX C sequence motif.

Both acquisition and delivery of the copper ion between these proteins is expected to occur at the single copper-binding site, although this may not necessarily be the case for the more complex metallochaperones.

These 26–30-kDa proteins possess an Atx1-like sequence at the N terminus, complete with the MX CXX C metal-binding motif, which is fused to a sequence homologous to its SOD1 target. The C-terminal region of CCS has high sequence homology with CCS proteins from other species, and also contains two highly conserved cysteine residues. While the latter region is essential for CCS activity in vivo, a requirement for the Atx1-like region is only apparent under copper-limiting conditions (17Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T.

The three regions correspond to domain I (Atx1-like), domain II (SOD1-like), and domain III (unique CCS sequence). Recent crystallographic structures for yeast and human CCS show that domain II from yeast and human fold in a “Greek key” β-barrel conformation that is quite similar to its target, SOD1 (19Lamb A.L.

To date, no structural data is available for either domain III or a copper-bound form of any CCS protein. Based on a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments with yeast CCS, mechanistic functions for each of the three domains in yeast SOD1 activation have been hypothesized (17Schmidt P.J.

An isolated peptide corresponding to domain III of yCCS is capable of binding Cu(I) ions and is hypothesized to function independently of domain I, which is thought to act in copper acquisition from the cellular source.

Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), is assumed to provide a specific interaction with SOD1 to target the delivery of copper ions. Recent studies of the metal-binding environments in purified human and tomato CCS support the involvement of both domains I and III in metal ion binding (18Zhu H. Shipp E. Sanchez R.J. Liba A.

Blackburn N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although these studies contend that both domains bind metal ions simultaneously, the spectroscopic data on isolated CCS may describe only “transport stage” of the metallochaperone as it diffuses through the cytoplasm. To elucidate the mechanism of SOD1 activation by CCS, we have investigated the biochemical basis of copper transfer for human CCS protein. Direct activation of both human and yeast SOD1 by human CCS is demonstrated by in vitro assays with denatured apo-SOD1. Intriguingly, the denatured human SOD1 enzyme always requires the chaperone for optimal SOD activity. Under the same experimental conditions, the yeast SOD1 can be activated by simple copper salts (1Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conformational changes in the human CCS protein observed upon binding of copper support the proposal that domains I and III carry out independent functions, with domain III directing the exchange of copper ion to the active site of SOD1. The differences between the biochemistry of the human and yeast SOD1/CCS partnership thus reveal several new insights into how one family of metallochaperones execute the direct transfer of copper ions. The gene for the full-length, wild-type human CCS protein was cloned into the expression vector pET24d (Novagen) and transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Several liters of this transformed strain were grown to A 600 = 0.6 in LB media with 40 μg/ml kanamycin and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Purification of hCCS was accomplished through freeze-thaw extraction with 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor in the extraction buffer, followed by precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate, salt removal with several buffer exchanges, anion chromatography through Uno-Q12 (Bio-Rad), and gel filtration chromatography through Superdex 75 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified full-length hCCS protein was confirmed by a mass of 28,906.4 ± 4.7 Da determined by ESI mass spectrometry, which corresponds to the mass predicted for hCCS missing the N-terminal methionine residue (28,909.4 Da). In this report, residue numbering is maintained with methionine as residue 1, giving a sequence of 2–274 for the isolated protein we refer to as full-length human CCS. A correction factor for the Bradford protein assay, [hCCS]actual = {[hCCS]apparant/1.85}versus IgG protein standard, was applied to calculations of hCCS concentrations for all analyses. Human CCS polypeptides corresponding to the Atx1-homolous segment, residues 9–79 (referred to as the DI polypeptide), the SOD1-homologous region from Gly77-Lys241 (DII polypeptide), or to a truncation missing the C-terminal-most domain Ala2-Lys241 (DI, II polypeptide) were isolated as follows. DNA fragments corresponding to the appropriate regions of the human CCS gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into complementary sites Nco I andEco RI in pET 24d overexpression vector (Novagen). The plasmid products were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cultures were grown to A 600 = 0.6 in LB media with 40 μg/ml kanamycin and induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Purification of hCCS DI, II, or DII was accomplished through freeze-thaw extraction followed by precipitation with 40% ammonium sulfate, salt removal with several buffer exchanges, anion chromatography through Uno-Q12 (Bio-Rad), and gel filtration chromatography through Superdex 75 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purification of the domain I polypeptide was accomplished through freeze-thaw extraction followed by salt removal with several buffer exchanges and gel filtration chromatography through Superdex 75 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The masses of the purified hCCS polypeptides were confirmed by ESI mass spectrometry (hCCS-DI ESI/MS = 7,555.6 ± 0.26, predicted = 7,555.7; hCCS-DI, II ESI/MS = 25,320.9 ± 0.97, predicted = 25,322.3; hCCS-DII ESI/MS = 17,365.3 ± 1.30, predicted = 17,371.4). Human CCS proteins were injected on Superose 12 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) calibrated with 100 μm samples of protein standards. Nitrogen-purged and Chelexed 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, buffer with 100 mm NaCl was used as the elution buffer. Standards included blue dextran (5000 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), and cytidine (243 Da). The expression strains for full-length hCCS or hCCS domain polypeptides were grown as described above, with the exception that after 30 min of protein induction, the culture was spiked with CuSO4 to a final media concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h of induction, the cells were separated by centrifugation and cell pellets were resuspended in Chelex-treated buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) to remove residual media and extracellular CuSO4. Purification of copper-bound proteins was accomplished through a combination of freeze-thaw extraction, 0.5% streptomycin sulfate treatment, 40% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, and preparative gel filtration chromatography. All buffers used during these preparations contained fresh 1 mm DTT. Initial freeze thaw extraction buffers also contained 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride to inhibit protease activity. Ion exchange chromatography was removed from this purification procedure to avoid stripping of metal ions from the hCCS protein constructs. All stages of thein vitro metal complexation of purified hCCS were carried out under anaerobic atmosphere in a VAC Atmospheres glove box. Buffers were thoroughly treated with Chelex to remove all trace metal impurities prior to use. A solution of 80 μm hCCS protein in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mmDTT, 10 mm reduced glutathione (GSH), 10 mmhistidine, pH 7.8, was mixed slowly with an excess of ZnSO4and Cu(I)(CH3CN)4PF6 (final concentration of each was 240 μm, corresponding to a 3-fold molar excess to hCCS protein monomer) followed by overnight incubation at 15 °C. The excess metal ions, either free in solution or bound to nonspecific sites on the protein, were first removed by five exchanges with the same Tris/NaCl/DTT/GSH/histidine buffer in an Amicon ultrafiltration stir cell, followed by five exchanges with a buffer containing only 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to remove all metal-binding competitors from the protein solution. Human SOD1, holo-wild type form, was kindly donated by the laboratory of I. Bertini, University of Florence. Yeast SOD1 was overexpressed inE. coli BL12(DE3) and purified as described previously (1Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The apo-form of hSOD1 for CCS activation assays was prepared by first removing the bulk (about 80–85%) of the metal by dialysis against 50 mm ETDA in 100 mm NaOAc, pH 3.8, followed by dialysis versus 100 mm MgCl2 in 100 mm NaOAc, pH 3.8, and then 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.5. Since the apo-hSOD was found to retain 10–15% of its native activity, a further treatment was employed to reduce the residual activity of the SOD1 and therefore enhance the sensitivity for detection of SOD activation by CCS or copper controls. The “apo”-hSOD1 obtained after dialysis demetallation (3 mg/ml, 100 μm) was incubated with a mixture of 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm BCS, and 20 mm sodium ascorbate in 15% acetonitrile, 10% methanol, and 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid for 3 h at 4 °C. The apo, denatured hSOD1 protein was purified of the chelating reagents and residual metal by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography separation through a Vydac C4 column with H2O/CH3CN/trifluoroacetic acid gradient elution. The protein-containing eluent was stripped of solvent under vacuum and resuspended in Chelex-treated potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm), pH 7.8, immediately prior to use in SOD1 activation assays. The yeast SOD1 protein purified from E. coli contained only 10–20% of its holo-metal content. This protein sample was therefore directly applied to the second stage demetallation/denaturation with organic solvents and high performance liquid chromatography clean-up for use in the activation assays. Design of an in vitro assay for CCS activity poses several challenges. Based on EXAFS data and metal-complexation methods, the copper bound to hCCS is concluded to be in the reduced, +1 oxidation state as applied in the assay. Given the possibility of copper-catalyzed air oxidation of the metal-binding cysteine thiol ligands, the metal-loading and transfer events are evaluated under strictly anaerobic atmosphere. Copper ion transfer to apo-SOD1 in this assay is conveniently assessed by the gain of SOD activity in classic enzyme assays, yet these require aerobic buffers to produce superoxide substrate. Another challenge inherent in determination of CCS function is the well documented ability of apo-SOD1 to acquire uncomplexed, or “free” copper ions from solution without the aid of a chaperone protein. Because of this self-activating ability of SOD1 with copper ions from solution, additional considerations were made to distinguish between SOD1 activation by direct copper insertion mechanisms (facilitated activation), and SOD1 activation by simple co-equilibration mechanisms (incidental activation). To address these challenges, an SOD1 activation assay for CCS function has been designed with partitioned anaerobic and aerobic stages in combination with the application of appropriate metal chelates in each stage (schematic illustrated in Fig. 5 A). The copper source as either Cu(I)-glutathione complex or Cu-bound CCS was combined with ZnSO4 and reduced GSH in one tube, the apo-SOD1 and BCS chelate competitor in another. Both solutions were prepared anaerobically in deoxygenated and Chelex-treated, 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, and the total copper concentration was normalized for all reaction samples. The two solutions were then combined and incubated in a heating block at 34 °C for 2 h. An aliquot of each reaction mixture was extracted from the anaerobic chamber and diluted into an aerobic 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, for assay of SOD activity by standard in-gel assay with NBT staining (23Flohe L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) or cytochrome c assay (24Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 213-215Google Scholar). The aerobic buffers (both loading and running buffers for in-gel assay) included 1 mm EDTA to scavenge any Cu(II) formed from oxidation of any Cu(I) source. The multidomain structure of hCCS was established by partial proteolysis with trypsin. A 400-μl solution with 1 μg/μl apoZn-hCCS was proteolyzed by 1 μg of trypsin in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 15 °C in an anaerobic chamber. Proteolysis was halted after 30 min with 2 μl 6m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Prior to extracting the sample from the anaerobic chamber for analysis by MALDI-TOF MS, 2 μl of 1 m DTT solution was added to prevent disulfide cross-linking of cysteine thiols on the peptide fragments. A 3-μl aliquot of the whole protein digest was added to a standard sinapinic acid/H2O/CH3CN/trifluoroacetic acid matrix solution for spotting on a MALDI-TOF sample plate. MALDI-TOF spectra of the digest mixture were collected with delayed extraction (300 ns) in linear mode on a Voyager DE Pro spectrometer from PE Biosystems. An internal standard of myoglobin (horse skeletal muscle, Sigma) was used in a parallel MALDI-TOF sample spot for accurate calibration of the digest fragment masses. Fragment masses were matched to predicted tryptic sequences of hCCS with the MS Digest program on the ProteinProspector web site authored by the UCSF Mass Spectrometry Facility. To examine copper-induced conformational changes and localization of the copper-binding site in hCCS, limited trypsin proteolysis of E,Zn-hCCS, and Cu,Zn-hCCS was carried out with similar methods as above. For these studies, the trypsin digest was monitored as a function of time to elucidate relative proteolytic rates. Aliquots of the proteolysis mixture were extracted and terminated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at digest times ranging from 5 min to 3 h. For examination of metal content in the proteolytic fragments, the digest aliquots were mixed in a matrix solution without trifluoroacetic acid. 5,5′-Dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) assay for quantifying the reduced cysteine thiols of E,Zn-hCCS was carried out according to the published procedures of Riddleset al. (25Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Localization of the thiol and disulfide cysteines was accomplished by first alkylating a 20 μmhCCS protein sample (no DDT, anaerobically) with 10 mmiodoacetamide in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, adjusted to pH 7.2. After removal of excess iodoacetamide and guanidine-HCl with several buffer exchanges in an Amicon ultrafiltration stir cell, the alkylated protein was subject tototal proteolysis with 10 μg/μl trypsin at 34 °C for 20 h. The alkylated cysteine residues, indicating those not involved in disulfide linkages on the original protein, were identified with MALDI-TOF MS by a mass increase of 58 Da for the predicted mass of a specific tryptic peptide. Disulfide-linked peptides were first identified by a covalent combination of two predicted peptide masses and then confirmed by the disappearance of the combined-peptide mass signal in a digest sample treated with DTT. The metal-complexed forms of human CCS are abbreviated in this report according to a similar system as that used for Cu,Zn-SOD (26Valentine J.S. Pantoliano M.W. Spiro T.G. Copper Proteins. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1982: 292-358Google Scholar). Unlike the yeast form of the CCS protein, human CCS binds both copper and zinc. We have designated the copper-deficient protein as E,Zn-hCCS rather than apo-hCCS, and the copper-occupied as Cu,Zn-hCCS rather than holo-hCCS. The Cu,Zn-hCCS designation does not represent the protein with copper bound to the potential SOD1 site within domain II of hCCS. As shown below, the copper ions in Cu,Zn-hCCS in fact bind to sites other than in domain II. The human CCS protein consists of three proteolytically separable domains in solution that closely correlate to the independent domain structure predicted for yCCS (17Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of a limited trypsin digest mixture of hCCS isolated with no bound copper (E,Zn-hCCS form) reveals three protease-resistant fragments corresponding closely to the predicted Atx1-like domain I (dI, residues 2–76), SOD1-like domain II (dII, residues 77–241), and the fusion of domains I and II (dI,II, residues 2–241) (Fig. 1). Domains determined by proteolytic susceptibility are denoted by lowercase (i.e. dI,dII, etc.) while expressed and purified proteins that correspond to given domains are denoted by the uppercase (i.e. DI). For example, the expressed protein corresponding to the Atx1-like region of hCCS was constructed for amino acids 9–79 while the observed trypsin fragment of hCCS corresponding to the domain I consists of amino acids 2–76. Both position 76 and 79 are within the expected 8–12 amino acid junction between domains I and II of hCCS based on the crystallographically characterized yeast protein (19Lamb A.L. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The trypsin-accessible domain junctions in hCCS are also equivalent to the trypsin cleavage sites observed for yeast CCS protein (17Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Unlike domains I and II, the third domain (dIII) is rapidly cleaved from the human CCS protein with either trypsin or chymotrypsin proteases, indicating that this C-terminal peptide segment has little conformational stability in the absence of copper. There are only two trypsin sites near the dI-dII junction (Fig. 1 A): site A is adjacent to Arg71 and site B follows Lys76. Unde"
https://openalex.org/W2084820537,"Protein interactions are critical for the function of SMADs as mediators of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signals. TGF-β receptor phosphorylation of SMAD2 or SMAD3 causes their association with SMAD4 and accumulation in the nucleus where the SMAD complex binds cofactors that determine the choice of target genes. We provide evidence that in the basal state, SMADs 2, 3, and 4 form separate, strikingly different complexes. SMAD2 is found mostly as monomer, whereas the closely related SMAD3 exists in multiple oligomeric states. This difference is due to a unique structural element in the MH1 domain of SMAD2 that inhibits protein-protein interactions in the basal state. In contrast to SMAD2 and SMAD3, SMAD4 in the basal state is found mostly as a homo-oligomer, most likely a trimer. Upon cell stimulation with TGF-β, SMAD proteins become engaged in a multitude of complexes ranging in size from SMAD2–SMAD4 heterodimers to assemblies of >650 kDa. The latter display the highest DNA binding affinity for the TGF-β-response elements of <i>JUNB</i> and collagen 7. These observations, all validated with endogenous SMAD proteins, modify previous models regarding the assembly and activity of SMAD complexes in the TGF-β pathway."

To elucidate the role of MAPKs in keratinocyte differentiation, activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 in response to stimulation with extracellular calcium was analyzed. We provide evidence that calcium-induced differentiation of keratinocytes is associated with rapid and transient activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Stimulation of keratinocytes with extracellular calcium resulted in activation of Raf isozymes and their downstream effector ERK within 10–15 min, but did not increase JNK or p38 activity. Calcium-induced ERK activation differed in kinetics from mitogenic ERK activation by epidermal growth factor and could be modulated by alterations of intracellular calcium levels. Interestingly, calcium stimulation led to down-regulation of Ras activity at the same time that ERK activation was initiated. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Ras also did not significantly impair calcium-induced ERK activation, indicating that calcium-mediated ERK activation does not require active Ras. Despite the transient nature of ERK activation, calcium-induced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1 and the differentiation marker involucrin was sensitive to MEK inhibition, which suggests a role for the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in early stages of keratinocyte differentiation.

In healthy skin, there is a balance between proliferation of mitotically active keratinocytes in the innermost basal layer and differentiation of post-mitotic cells within the suprabasal layers of the epithelium. Under certain pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis or in hyperproliferative diseases, this equilibrium is disturbed. Elucidation of the intracellular signaling pathways involved in regulation of these processes is therefore of great interest.Several in vitro modulators of keratinocyte growth and differentiation have been described (1Fuchs E. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 197-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Stimulators of proliferation include epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 (3Rheinwald J.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; 21: 229-254Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and transforming growth factor-α (4Coffey Jr., R.J. Derynck R. Wilcox J.N. Bringman T.S. Goustin A.S. Moses H.L. Pittelkow M.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), whereas elevation of extracellular calcium levels induces many changes that also occur during the differentiation process in vivo. Switching extracellular calcium levels from 0.05 to >0.1 mm results in rapid and irreversible cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes (5Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 6Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This is followed by increased expression of differentiation-associated proteins as well as induction of morphological changes characteristic of differentiation such as the establishment of intercellular desmosomal contacts (5Hennings H.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In addition to its well characterized effect on keratinocyte differentiation in vitro, calcium constitutes a gradient in epidermal layers (8Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Forslind B. Lindberg M. Roomans G.M. Pallon J. Werner-Linde Y. Microsc. Res. Technol. 1997; 38: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which also implies a function for calcium as regulator of keratinocyte growth and differentiationin vivo. Intracellularly, calcium has been shown to trigger phospholipase Cγ activation, thereby elevating cytosolic calcium levels (10Jaken S. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Haase I. Liesegang C. Binting S. Henz B.M. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 748-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It also activates certain protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes (12Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar) as well as tyrosine kinases such as Fyn (13Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); however, the downstream consequences of these events are not clear.A signaling pathway known to be crucially involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation in a variety of cells is the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. This pathway transduces signals from the extracellular compartment through an evolutionarily conserved intracellular signaling module that is composed of the serine/threonine kinase Raf, the dual specificity kinase MEK, and the nuclear shuttle kinase ERK (14Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 15Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). In pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, the best studied example for involvement of this pathway in differentiation, the duration of ERK activation determines which fate a cell adopts: transient activation of ERK by EGF leads to mitosis, whereas sustained activation by nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes differentiation of these cells into sympathetic-like neurons (15Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar, 16Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Similarly, sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is associated with differentiation of muscle cells (17Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, recent data argue against the notion that sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is the only determinant decisive for induction of cellular differentiation and suggest that other signaling pathways may also play a role. For instance, inhibition of the sustained phase of ERK activation alone was not sufficient to block NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (18York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NGF stimulation of PC12 cells resulted in rapid and sustained activation of the p38 MAPK pathway (19Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and inhibition of this pathway prevented NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in these cells (20Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, a similar correlation between p38 activation and differentiation has been observed (21Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 22Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar), which supports the view that the p38 pathway is also involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation.Since the role of MAPK cascades (particularly the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway) in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation is still unclear, we compared the activation and function of these pathways upon calcium-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes. We show here that calcium-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes leads to a transient, peak-like activation of ERK, which differs in kinetics from EGF-induced ERK activation. In contrast to EGF, activation of ERK by calcium occurs through a Ras-independent pathway and appears to be mediated by accumulation of intracellular calcium. Despite the transient nature of ERK activation, the calcium-induced up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1 and the differentiation marker involucrin is sensitive to MEK inhibition, which suggests a role for the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in the early stages of keratinocyte differentiation.DISCUSSIONIn this report, the role of MAPK pathways in calcium-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes was examined. We observed that elevation of extracellular calcium levels resulted in a rapid and transient activation of ERK, but not JNK and p38. ERK activation occurred independently of Ras activity since expression of dominant-negative Ras N17 did not prevent calcium-induced ERK activation. Furthermore, calcium stimulation led to down-regulation of Ras activity in HaCaT cells, which is consistent with previous observations of Medema et al. (43Medema J.P. Sark M.W. Backendorf C. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7078-7085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in primary keratinocytes. In their study, elevation of extracellular calcium did not result in ERK activation, but inhibited EGF-induced ERK activation when preincubated. Interestingly, inhibition was transient and only effective within a narrow time window of calcium pretreatment. Since, in our experiments, calcium triggered a transient, peak-like ERK activation that was associated with concomitant down-regulation of Ras activity, it is conceivable that calcium stimulation renders the cell temporarily insensitive to mitogenic ERK activation, which may account for its inhibitory effect on EGF-induced ERK activation. It is tempting to speculate that this transient down-regulation of Ras activity may represent a kind of “safety mechanism” that prevents an immediate second wave of ERK activation by other stimuli that may disturb the cellular response to the calcium signal.Although Ras activity is down-regulated after calcium treatment, the direct downstream effectors of Ras, Raf, and MEK become activated. It is still unclear whether calcium-induced Raf activation is mediated by GTPases different from Ras or by a GTPase-independent mechanism, and experiments are underway to address this question.Both HaCaT cells and primary NHEK express the MEK activators c-Raf-1 and B-Raf (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Since activation of both isoforms was observed upon calcium stimulation, we presently cannot decide which isoform mediates the response. In PC12 cells, sustained ERK activation induced by NGF was reported to be a result of B-Raf activation, which may reflect isozyme-specific control of proliferation and differentiation in neuronal cells (18York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 44Wixler V. Smola U. Schuler M. Rapp U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although our experiments do not rule out that Raf isozymes have distinct functions in keratinocytes, the similar activation kinetics of both Raf isoforms rather argue against such a notion and predict a common mode of regulation for both isozymes in keratinocytes. On the other hand, the recent finding that c-Raf-1 mutant mice exhibited a defect in skin differentiation particularly emphasizes the role of c-Raf-1 in the regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation in vivo (45Wojnowski L. Stancato L.F. Zimmer A.M. Hahn H. Beck T.W. Larner A.C. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), even though B-Raf may also be required.Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by extracellular calcium appears to be mediated by a mechanism that triggers elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels. In accordance with our observation that ERK activation by extracellular calcium is mediated by Raf isoforms, a previous study reported Raf-dependent activation of ERK by elevation of intracellular calcium levels in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (46Chao T.S.

Recently, a receptor for extracellular calcium has been cloned from both human and mouse keratinocytes that might provide the missing link between elevation of extracellular calcium and increased intracellular calcium levels (47Bikle D.D. Ratnam A. Mauro T. Harris J. Pillai S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 48Oda Y. Tu C.L. Chang W. Crumrine D. Komuves L. Mauro T. Elias P.M. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the full-length form of this receptor show defective skin development, and keratinocytes of these mice do not respond with elevation of cytosolic calcium levels after stimulation with extracellular calcium (48Oda Y.

Interestingly, a homolog of this receptor is required for ERK activation in response to extracellular calcium in Rat1 fibroblasts (49McNeil S.E. Hobson S.A. Nipper V. Rodland K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1114-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism is not resolved yet, calcium receptors are putative candidates for the mediation of calcium-induced ERK activation in keratinocytes.An early step in the differentiation process of keratinocytes is cell cycle arrest. Our observation that calcium-induced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1 is sensitive to MEK inhibition provides a first hint that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays an important role in the initial switch from growth to differentiation. Whether activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is the actual trigger for calcium-induced cell cycle arrest has to await further experiments; however, such a view would be consistent with previous data from other cell types that have implicated this pathway in cell cycle control (42Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17 (and references therein): 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Since transforming growth factor-β-induced expression of p21/Cip1 is also dependent on MEK in keratinocytes (50Hu P.P. Shen X. Huang D. Liu Y. Counter C. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35381-35387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may be a common mechanism by which several stimuli induce cell cycle arrest in these cells.Calcium-induced expression of the differentiation marker involucrin was sensitive to MEK inhibition. This suggests that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway directly or indirectly affects differentiation-specific gene expression. Since EGF stimulation did not result in increased involucrin expression in primary NHEK, we conclude that activation of the ERK pathway alone is not sufficient to induce involucrin synthesis. Although the different kinetics of ERK activation by calcium and EGF may account for the reciprocal effect of both stimuli on involucrin expression, we favor a model in which calcium triggers activation of multiple pathways that act in concert with the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway to induce the differentiation program in keratinocytes. An early event occurring upon calcium-induced differentiation is enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation (51Filvaroff E. Stern D.F. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1164-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Particularly phosphorylation of a protein of ∼60 kDa (p62) that associates with the Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) has attained much attention since it was reported to become phosphorylated after both calcium treatment of mouse keratinocytes (52Filvaroff E. Calautti E. McCormick F. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5319-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and disruption of integrin-mediated cell-matrix interactions (53Sharma S.V. Boyajian A. Myers C.D. Nakano H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of surface integrins and loss of adhesiveness to the extracellular matrix are among the first changes to occur during the differentiation processin vivo (54Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), which suggests that phosphorylation of p62 in response to calcium stimulation may mimic the signal induced by integrin loss in vivo. p62 phosphorylation occurs as early as 5 min after calcium stimulation, but is not observed after stimulation with EGF (52Filvaroff E. Calautti E. McCormick F. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5319-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calcium-induced phosphorylation of p62 is associated with translocation of Ras GAP to the membrane. Since Ras GAPs catalyze the conversion of GTP-loaded active Ras to its inactive GDP-loaded form, translocation of Ras GAP to the membrane may be responsible for the calcium-induced down-regulation of Ras activity observed in our experiments, although it is presently unclear if translocation of Ras GAP is sufficient to activate its enzymatic activity. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation even though other pathways may be important in the modulation of the cellular response upon its activation. The epidermis is a regenerative organ subject to permanent turnover throughout the life of an organism. In healthy skin, there is a balance between proliferation of mitotically active keratinocytes in the innermost basal layer and differentiation of post-mitotic cells within the suprabasal layers of the epithelium. Under certain pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis or in hyperproliferative diseases, this equilibrium is disturbed. Elucidation of the intracellular signaling pathways involved in regulation of these processes is therefore of great interest. Several in vitro modulators of keratinocyte growth and differentiation have been described (1Fuchs E. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1993; 17: 197-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Stimulators of proliferation include epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 (3Rheinwald J.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1980; 21: 229-254Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and transforming growth factor-α (4Coffey Jr., R.J. Derynck R. Wilcox J.N. Bringman T.S. Goustin A.S. Moses H.L. Pittelkow M.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), whereas elevation of extracellular calcium levels induces many changes that also occur during the differentiation process in vivo. Switching extracellular calcium levels from 0.05 to >0.1 mm results in rapid and irreversible cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes (5Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 6Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5451-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This is followed by increased expression of differentiation-associated proteins as well as induction of morphological changes characteristic of differentiation such as the establishment of intercellular desmosomal contacts (5Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 7Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In addition to its well characterized effect on keratinocyte differentiation in vitro, calcium constitutes a gradient in epidermal layers (8Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Forslind B. Lindberg M. Roomans G.M. Pallon J. Werner-Linde Y. Microsc. Res. Technol. 1997; 38: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which also implies a function for calcium as regulator of keratinocyte growth and differentiationin vivo. Intracellularly, calcium has been shown to trigger phospholipase Cγ activation, thereby elevating cytosolic calcium levels (10Jaken S. Yuspa S.H. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Haase I. Liesegang C. Binting S. Henz B.M. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 748-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It also activates certain protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes (12Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Williams E.K. Szallasi Z. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 149-157PubMed Google Scholar) as well as tyrosine kinases such as Fyn (13Calautti E. Missero C. Stein P.L. Ezzell R.M. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2279-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); however, the downstream consequences of these events are not clear. A signaling pathway known to be crucially involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation in a variety of cells is the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. This pathway transduces signals from the extracellular compartment through an evolutionarily conserved intracellular signaling module that is composed of the serine/threonine kinase Raf, the dual specificity kinase MEK, and the nuclear shuttle kinase ERK (14Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 15Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). In pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, the best studied example for involvement of this pathway in differentiation, the duration of ERK activation determines which fate a cell adopts: transient activation of ERK by EGF leads to mitosis, whereas sustained activation by nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes differentiation of these cells into sympathetic-like neurons (15Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar, 16Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Similarly, sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is associated with differentiation of muscle cells (17Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, recent data argue against the notion that sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is the only determinant decisive for induction of cellular differentiation and suggest that other signaling pathways may also play a role. For instance, inhibition of the sustained phase of ERK activation alone was not sufficient to block NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (18York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NGF stimulation of PC12 cells resulted in rapid and sustained activation of the p38 MAPK pathway (19Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and inhibition of this pathway prevented NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in these cells (20Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, a similar correlation between p38 activation and differentiation has been observed (21Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 22Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar), which supports the view that the p38 pathway is also involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation. Since the role of MAPK cascades (particularly the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway) in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation is still unclear, we compared the activation and function of these pathways upon calcium-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes. We show here that calcium-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes leads to a transient, peak-like activation of ERK, which differs in kinetics from EGF-induced ERK activation. In contrast to EGF, activation of ERK by calcium occurs through a Ras-independent pathway and appears to be mediated by accumulation of intracellular calcium. Despite the transient nature of ERK activation, the calcium-induced up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/Cip1 and the differentiation marker involucrin is sensitive to MEK inhibition, which suggests a role for the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in the early stages of keratinocyte differentiation. DISCUSSIONIn this report, the role of MAPK pathways in calcium-induced differentiation of human keratinocytes was examined. We observed that elevation of extracellular calcium levels resulted in a rapid and transient activation of ERK, but not JNK and p38. ERK activation occurred independently of Ras activity since expression of dominant-negative Ras N17 did not prevent calcium-induced ERK activation. Furthermore, calcium stimulation led to down-regulation of Ras activity in HaCaT cells, which is consistent with previous observations of Medema et al. (43Medema J.P. Sark M.W. Backendorf C. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7078-7085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in primary keratinocytes. In their study, elevation of extracellular calcium did not result in ERK activation, but inhibited EGF-induced ERK activation when preincubated. Interestingly, inhibition was transient and only effective within a narrow time window of calcium pretreatment. Since, in our experiments, calcium triggered a transient, peak-like ERK activation that was associated with concomitant down-regulation of Ras activity, it is conceivable that calcium stimulation renders the cell temporarily insensitive to mitogenic ERK activation, which may account for its inhibitory effect on EGF-induced ERK activation. It is tempting to speculate that this transient down-regulation of Ras activity may represent a kind of “safety mechanism” that prevents an immediate second wave of ERK activation by other stimuli that may disturb the cellular response to the calcium signal.Although Ras activity is down-regulated after calcium treatment, the direct downstream effectors of Ras, Raf, and MEK become activated. It is still unclear whether calcium-induced Raf activation is mediated by GTPases different from Ras or by a GTPase-independent mechanism, and experiments are underway to address this question.Both HaCaT cells and primary NHEK express the MEK activators c-Raf-1 and B-Raf (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Since activation of both isoforms was observed upon calcium stimulation, we presently cannot decide which isoform mediates the response. In PC12 cells, sustained ERK activation induced by NGF was reported to be a result of B-Raf activation, which may reflect isozyme-specific control of proliferation and differentiation in neuronal cells (18York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 44Wixler V. Smola U. Schuler M. Rapp U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although our experiments do not rule out that Raf isozymes have distinct functions in keratinocytes, the similar activation kinetics of both Raf isoforms rather argue against such a notion and predict a common mode of regulation for both isozymes in keratinocytes. On the other hand, the recent finding that c-Raf-1 mutant mice exhibited a defect in skin differentiation particularly emphasizes the role of c-Raf-1 in the regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation in vivo (45Wojnowski L. Stancato L.F. Zimmer A.M. Hahn H. Beck T.W. Larner A.C. Rapp U.R. Zimmer A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), even though B-Raf may also be required.Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by extracellular calcium appears to be mediated by a mechanism that triggers elevation of cytoplasmic calcium levels. In accordance with our observation that ERK activation by extracellular calcium is mediated by Raf isoforms, a previous study reported Raf-dependent activation of ERK by elevation of intracellular calcium levels in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (46Chao T.S. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a receptor for extracellular calcium has been cloned from both human and mouse keratinocytes that might provide the missing link between elevation of extracellular calcium and increased intracellular calcium levels (47Bikle D.D.

Calautti E. McCormick F. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5319-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and disruption of integrin-mediated cell-matrix interactions (53Sharma S.V. Boyajian A. Myers C.D. Nakano H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of surface integrins and loss of adhesiveness to the extracellular matrix are among the first changes to occur during the differentiation processin vivo (54Adams J.C. Watt F.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), which suggests that phosphorylation of p62 in response to calcium stimulation may mimic the signal induced by integrin loss in vivo. p62 phosphorylation occurs as early as 5 min after calcium stimulation, but is not observed after stimulation with EGF (52Filvaroff E. Calautti E. McCormick F. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5319-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calcium-induced phosphorylation of p62 is associated with translocation of Ras GAP to the membrane. Since Ras GAPs catalyze the conversion of GTP-loaded active Ras to its inactive GDP-loaded form, translocation of Ras GAP to the membrane may be responsible for the calcium-induced down-regulation of Ras activity observed in our experiments, although it is presently unclear if translocation of Ras GAP is sufficient to activate its enzymatic activity. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of keratinocyte growth and differentiation even though other pathways may be important in the modulation of the cellular response upon its activation.

https://openalex.org/W2003573406,"Progesterone-induced maturation ofXenopus oocytes is a well known example of nongenomic signaling by steroids; however, little is known about the early signaling events involved in this process. Previous work has suggested that G proteins and G protein-coupled receptors may be involved in progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation as well as in other nongenomic steroid-induced signaling events. To investigate the role of G proteins in nongenomic signaling by progesterone, the effects of modulating Gα and Gβγ levels in Xenopus oocytes on progesterone-induced signaling and maturation were examined. Our results demonstrate that Gβγ subunits, rather than Gα, are the principal mediators of progesterone action in this system. We show that overexpression of Gβγ inhibits both progesterone-induced maturation and activation of the MAPK pathway, whereas sequestration of endogenous Gβγ subunits enhances progesterone-mediated signaling and maturation. These data are consistent with a model whereby endogenous free Xenopus Gβγ subunits constitutively inhibit oocyte maturation. Progesterone may induce maturation by antagonizing this inhibition and therefore allowing cell cycle progression to occur. These studies offer new insight into the early signaling events mediated by progesterone and may be useful in characterizing and identifying the membrane progesterone receptor in oocytes.

J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many steroid-induced signaling events appear to be triggered independently from the classic nuclear receptor pathways. In fact, these processes likely involve steroid signaling via membrane receptors (2Wehling M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Examples of rapid, nongenomic signaling by steroids are myriad, including aldosterone-induced increases in intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells (3Christ M. Douwes K. Eisen C.

The phenomenon of progesterone-induced maturation of Xenopusoocytes serves as a useful experimental model for studying nongenomic steroid signaling (16Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1712-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Smith L.D. Ecker R.E.

The maturation of an oocyte refers to the meiotic stage at which an oocyte rests. “Immature” oocytes are arrested in prophase of meiosis I. Before ovulation, oocytes are induced to re-enter the cell cycle, finally resting in metaphase II. These “mature” oocytes are then competent for ovulation and subsequent fertilization, after which the final stages of meiosis are completed (16Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that progesterone-induced maturation ofXenopus oocytes is mediated by cell surface rather than nuclear receptors. First, maturation is unaffected by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (21Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Dev. Biol. 1971; 25: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Second, progesterone covalently attached to either polymers or bovine serum albumin and therefore unable to diffuse through the oocyte membrane still mediates maturation (16Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Godeau J.F. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Hubert P. Baulieu E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Third, progesterone injection directly into oocytes does not induce maturation (16Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Smith L.D. Ecker R.E. Dev. Biol. 1971; 25: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 23Masui Y. Markert C.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1971; 177: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Finally, progesterone appears to bind specifically and with relatively high affinity to oocyte membranes (24Blondeau J.P. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Liu Z. Patino R. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). At this point, however, no progesterone binding proteins have been identified in Xenopus oocyte membranes. Progesterone signaling may be coupled to G proteins. Progesterone treatment of oocytes results in a rapid decrease in intracellular cAMP, perhaps through attenuation of adenylyl cyclase activity (26Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. Cooper D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 526-531PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7935-7941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sadler S.E. Maller J.L. J. Biol.

This suggests that Gαi, and therefore a Gαi-coupled receptor, may be involved in progesterone-mediated signaling. In addition, progesterone activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 cascade in oocytes (30Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1994; 18: 115-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kosako H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2131-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 32Kosako H. Nishida E. Gotoh Y.

Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), which could be mediated by Gβγ subunits. Finally, 1-methyladenine induces maturation of starfish oocytes in a pertussis toxin-sensitive fashion, suggesting that Gαimediates oocyte maturation in a comparable system (35Chiba K. Kontani K. Tadenuma H. Katada T. Hoshi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Chiba K. Longo F.J. Kontani K. Katada T. Hoshi M. Dev.

Interestingly, progesterone binds to the G protein-coupled oxytocin receptor, thereby partially blocking oxytocin binding and oxytocin-mediated signaling (38Grazzini E. Guillon G. Mouillac B. Zingg H.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One hypothesis is that the high amounts of progesterone present during pregnancy bind to the oxytocin receptor and prevent the induction of labor. When progesterone levels decrease at the end of pregnancy, this “release of inhibition” may allow oxytocin-mediated contractions, and therefore labor, to begin. Again, these data are consistent with progesterone modulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. The role of G proteins in progesterone-mediated Xenopusoocyte maturation was examined by systematically depleting or overexpressing G protein subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Our data suggest that, in fact, Gαi is not important for this process. Rather, Gβγ subunits appear to be the principal mediators of progesterone action in Xenopus oocytes, acting as inhibitors of oocyte maturation. Progesterone may therefore induce maturation by antagonizing constitutive Gβγ-mediated inhibition of cell cycle progression. Oocytes were harvested from femaleXenopus laevis (Nasco) and treated as described previously (39Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2679) Google Scholar, 40Williams J.A. McChesney D.J. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. Logsdon C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4939-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, follicular cells were removed by incubation of the oocytes for 3–4 h at room temperature with 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in modified Barth's solution (MSBH) without Ca2+. Oocytes were then washed extensively and incubated overnight at 16 °C in MSBH II (MSBH with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml Ficoll, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Stage V–VI oocytes were selected, and maturation assays were performed on each preparation to determine its sensitivity to progesterone-induced maturation. Injected or uninjected stage V–VI ooctyes were washed extensively with MSBH to remove the bovine serum albumin from the storage buffer. They were then incubated with various doses of progesterone (Sigma) for the times indicated in the figure legends. The ethanol concentration was always kept constant at 0.1% regardless of the progesterone concentration. Maturation was detected by visualizing germinal vesicle breakdown, which manifests itself as a white spot on the dark animal pole of the oocyte (16Maller J.L. Krebs E.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1980; 16: 271-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Oocyte membranes were prepared from Stage V–VI or Stage I–IIII oocytes as described (25Liu Z. Patino R. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In summary, oocytes were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes, pestle A, 15 strokes) in membrane buffer (83 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed and centrifuged again at 800 ×g. After a third centrifugation at 800 × g, the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 25 min, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in membrane buffer, taking caution to avoid disturbing the black melanin component of the pellet. Membranes were centrifuged two more times at 20,000 ×g and finally resuspended in MSBH at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Samples were then frozen at −80 °C until needed. 1,2,6,7-3H(N)]-progesterone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was diluted in ethanol on ice to 100× the final concentrations indicated in the figure legends. 5 μl of each of the 100× solutions was added to individual 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes with either 1 μl of unlabeled progesterone stock in ethanol (concentration indicated in the figure legends) or 1 μl of ethanol alone. Each condition (i.e. concentration of radiolabeled progesterone) was tested in triplicate for every experiment. Membranes were diluted to the concentrations indicated in the figure legends in MSBH at 4 °C, and 500 μl of this mixture was added to each tube containing radiolabeled steroid. The tubes were then rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. 25 μl was collected from each tube, diluted in scintillation fluid, and counted to determine the concentration of free progesterone at the end of the assay. Glass microfiber filters (Millipore) that had been preincubated in MSBH at 4 °C were placed on a prechilled vacuum filter holder (Millipore), and 400 μl of each sample was applied to individual filters. The filters were washed with 20 ml of cold MSBH, removed, and placed in 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Budget-Solve, Research Products International Corp.) for counting on a Beckman LS1801 scintillation counter. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides directed against sequences near the start codons of XenopusGαi1 (accession number AF086606), Gαi2 (accession number X56089), and Gαi3 (accession numberX56090) (41Olate J. Martinez S. Purcell P. Jorquera H. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Allende J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. These sequences were as follows: ATCGCTGCCATGGGCTGCACCTCGAGCGCC (Gαi1), GCTGAACGGAGAACCGTCGCCATGGGATGTACT (Gαi2), and CGGGAGGCGCCGAGCGAAGTAAAATGATC (Gαi3). 50.6 nl of 2 mg/ml solutions of oligonucleotides in 10 mm Hepes were injected into each oocyte as indicated in the figure legend. The Xenopus Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 cDNAs were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library created from purifiedXenopus oocyte mRNA (Fast-Track, Invitrogen) using standard techniques. The modified Gαi2 cDNA (Gαi2-Mod) contains the following 5′ sequence: CCAGCCATGGGTTGCACA. The Gαi2-Mod cDNA will match with only 12 of 33 nucleotides of the Gαi2 antisense oligonucleotide. The rat Gαi-WT and Gαi-Q203L cDNAs were a gift from A. Gilman (UTSW). All of these cDNAs were cloned into theXenopus oocyte expression vector pGEM HE (a gift from L. Jan, University of California at San Francisco) and were sequenced using the dideoxy method. The bovine Gβ1 cDNA in pGEM HE and bovine Gγ2 cDNA in pFROG were gifts from L. Jan (University of California at San Francisco). The bovine transducin Gα cDNA in pFROG was a gift from S. Coughlin (University of California at San Francisco), and the GRK-minigene in pGEM HE was a gift from E. Reuveny (Tel Aviv). All constructs were linearized and transcribed in vitro with either T7 or SP6 (Promega transcription kit). Stage V–VI oocytes were injected with 50.6 nl of cRNA at a concentration of approximately 200 ng/μl using a Drummond automatic injector, and injected oocytes were then incubated 30–48 h in MSBH II before the maturation or MAPK assays were performed. Injected oocytes were washed with MSBH and incubated with 50 nm progesterone as described in the experimental procedures under “Progesterone Maturation Assay.” Oocytes were lysed at the indicated times with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm NaF, 1% Tx-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) at 4 °C. 20 μl of lysis buffer was used per oocyte. Lysates were microcentrifuged at full speed for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed and diluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 1 h, incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs), washed four times with TBST, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000, Bio-Rad), and washed another four times with TBST. Blots were then treated with ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to visualize the proteins. Next, blots were stripped in 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7 at 55 °C for 30 min, washed four times with TBST, and reblotted as above using a rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs) that will bind all p44/p42 regardless of its phosphorylation status. Maturation experiments using increasing concentrations of progesterone revealed an EC50 for maturation in the range of 75–150 nm, depending upon the oocyte preparation (Fig. 1 A). The sensitivity of thein vitro maturation response to low concentrations of progesterone suggests that it could be relevant in vivo, where physiologic concentrations of progesterone in the ovary could easily be in the 100 nm range (38Grazzini E. Guillon G. Mouillac B. Zingg H.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The maturation response was also relatively specific to progesterone, because much higher concentrations of pregnenolone (EC50 = ∼1 μm), 17-OH progesterone, corticosterone, and aldosterone (all with EC50 values of ∼0.5–1 μm) were needed to induce maturation (data not shown).Figure 1Progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and progesterone binding to oocyte membranes. A, the EC50 for progesterone-mediated maturation was determined by treating oocytes with the indicated concentrations of progesterone (x axis) for 18 h. Maturation, which was detected by looking for germinal vesicle breakdown, is displayed on they axis as a percentage of the total number of oocytes/concentration of progesterone (n = 20). This experiment was performed over 10 times with a range of EC50from 50 to 150 nm. B, binding studies on stage V–VI oocyte membranes using a wide range of radiolabeled progesterone concentrations was performed. 300 μg of membranes were used for each sample. Data represent the means of three samples at each concentration of progesterone and are expressed as a Scatchard plot. This experiment was performed three times with three different membrane preparations with nearly identical results. C, binding assays were performed on membranes from stage I–III and stage V–VI oocytes. 50 μg of membranes were incubated with 10 nm radiolabeled progesterone ± 100 nm unlabeled progesterone for each sample. Data represent the means ± S.D. (n = 3) of the total counts after subtracting background, with background defined as the number of counts in samples incubated with labeled plus excess unlabeled progesterone. The total counts bound in Stage V–VI membranes was approximately 2-fold above background. D, binding studies on stage V–VI oocyte membranes (300 μg/point) were done using the indicated radiolabeled progesterone concentrations. Experiments were performed as described in the experimental procedures only the MSBH contained 5 mm MgCl2, and half of the membranes were preincubated with 200 μm GTPγS in MSBH for 30 min at 4 °C (open squares) before being added to the radiolabeled progesterone. Data represent the means of three samples at each concentration. This experiment was performed three times with nearly identical results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Progesterone binding studies were performed on Xenopusoocyte membranes to compare the affinity of progesterone binding to the EC50 for progesterone-induced maturation. Scatchard analysis revealed two different sets of progesterone binding sites on the oocyte membranes: a set of lower affinity sites (Kd = 140 nm), which most likely represented nonspecific binding, and a set of high affinity sites (Kd = 3 nm), which likely represented the specific progesterone binding sites (Fig. 1 B). The density of high affinity binding sites in this experiment was approximately 1 × 10−13 mol/mg (∼3 × 108 molecules/oocyte). The EC50 for progesterone-induced maturation correlated with the equilibrium constants calculated for both sets of binding sites, suggesting that progesterone binding to either set of receptors could be mediating the maturation response. To confirm that the high affinity sites were mainly responsible for progesterone-mediated effects, membranes from maturation-competent (Stage V–VI) and incompetent (Stage I–III) oocytes were tested for progesterone binding. A radiolabeled progesterone concentration of 10 nmwas used to favor detection of the high affinity binding sites. Although stage V–VI oocytes contained specific high affinity binding sites for [3H]progesterone, the earlier stage oocytes (Stages I–III) did not (Fig. 1 C). The presence of the high affinity progesterone binding sites almost exclusively on maturation-competent oocytes suggests that the specific binding of progesterone to the high affinity sites may indeed be linked to the maturation process. Competition studies with other steroids revealed that progesterone binding to the stage V–VI oocyte membranes was specific, because over 100-fold more corticosterone, testosterone, and aldosterone were needed to compete for the high affinity progesterone binding sites (data not shown). The affinity of a GPCR agonist for its receptor is generally decreased when associated Gα subunits are in the GTP-bound, activated state (42Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For example, agonist affinity for the β-adrenergic receptor is markedly decreased in the presence of GTP (43Maguire M.E. Van Arsdale P.M. Gilman A.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1976; 12: 335-339PubMed Google Scholar). If progesterone is acting as a GPCR agonist to mediate oocyte maturation, then, accordingly, its affinity for this receptor might be expected to be lower when Gα subunits are in the activated state.Xenopus oocyte membranes were incubated both with and without the nonhydroyzable GTP analogue GTPγS. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 D, incubation with GTPγS had no effect on progesterone binding to the oocyte membranes, suggesting that progesterone is not binding to its receptor in a fashion typical for a GPCR agonist. The role of Gαi in progesterone-induced maturation was examined by modulating its expression in oocytes. Depletion of endogenous Gαi was attained by injection of antisense oligonucleotides directed against mRNAs encoding three knownXenopus Gαi proteins into oocytes. Antisense experiments work well in oocytes because the oligonucleotides can be injected directly into the cell, thus avoiding the usual problems of degradation and inconsistent uptake seen with cultured cells (44Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J. Vande Woude G.F. Nature. 1988; 335: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Note that progesterone concentrations used in this and subsequent experiments were just below the EC50 calculated from Fig. 1 A. This allowed more subtle changes in progesterone sensitivity to be detected. Given the slight variability in EC50 between oocyte preparations, however, all experiments were performed multiple times to confirm the results. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides against mRNA encoding each individual Gαi subunit (Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3) had minimal effect on progesterone-induced maturation when compared with injection of matching sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, simultaneous injection of antisense oligonucleotides against mRNAs encoding all three Gαi subunits significantly attenuated progesterone-mediated maturation when compared with oocytes injected with matching sense oligonucleotides (Fig. 2 A). The results from these antisense experiments are difficult to interpret, because antibodies against XenopusGαi proteins are not available to confirm that the antisense oligonucleotides are indeed reducing Gαiexpression. To further examine the effects of Gαi on maturation, cRNA encoding the Xenopus Gαi2 protein was injected into oocytes. Injection of this cRNA resulted in marked spontaneous maturation when compared with oocytes injected with 10 mm Hepes (mock) or nonspecific cRNA (PAR1) (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, this spontaneous maturation was inhibited by nearly 80% with co-injection of the antisense oligonucleotide directed against Gαi2 (Fig. 2 C, Gαi 2-WT). In contrast, co-injection of the Gαi2 antisense oligonucleotide with a modified cRNA encoding the wild-type Gαi2 protein but containing 21 of 33 mismatches in the region corresponding to antisense oligonucleotide binding had less of an inhibitory effect on maturation (Fig. 2 C, Gαi 2-Mod). This suggests that at least the Gαi2 antisense oligonucleotide can inhibit Gαi activity via binding to its complementary RNA sequence. Together, these results indicate that the amount of Gαi expressed in oocytes directly correlates with the maturation response to progesterone. Two interpretations can explain the observation that decreased Gαi attenuated, whereas excess Gαi enhanced, progesterone-induced maturation. First, Gαi itself may be signaling to induce maturation. Second, Gβγ that is released by activation of Gαi may be affecting the maturation response. To differentiate between these two possibilities, oocytes were injected with cRNAs encoding bovine Gβ1 or Gγ2 subunits. These cRNAs encode functional proteins, because they have been injected together intoXenopus oocytes and markedly enhanced Gβγ-dependent G protein inward rectifying potassium channel activity (45Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). 2S. R. Hammes, unpublished results. Individual expression of either Gβ1 or Gγ2 had no effect on progesterone-induced maturation when a progesterone concentration just below the EC50 was used (50 nm). In contrast, simultaneous expression of both subunits in oocytes significantly attenuated progesterone-induced maturation (Fig. 3 A). Incubation with higher concentrations of progesterone overcame this inhibition by Gβγ (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the processes of Gβγ-mediated inhibition and progesterone-mediated induction of maturation can compete with each other. In addition, these data demonstrate that injected Gβγ subunits are not simply damaging their host oocytes in a nonspecific fashion. The effect of lowering endogenous Xenopus Gβγ was examined by injecting oocytes with cRNA encoding the bovine retinal transducin Gα subunit. Transducin Gα itself has no apparent activity in oocytes but has been used as a Gβγ “sink” to inhibit Gβγ-mediated signaling (46Miller B.A. Bell L. Hansen C.A. Robishaw J.D. Linder M.E. Cheung J.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1728-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with transducin Gα exhibited enhancement of progesterone-induced maturation (Figs. 3 C and 2 B). In addition, injection of a GRK minigene encoding the carboxyl portion of the GRK1 protein, which has been shown to inhibit Gβγ function in a very specific fashion (47Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a regulatory cytokine that has been implicated in a variety of renal diseases where it promotes extracellular matrix deposition and proinflammatory events. We hypothesize that the release of TGF-β1 via autocrine and/or paracrine pathways may induce HO-1 and serve as a protective response in renal injury. To understand the molecular mechanism of HO-1 induction by TGF-β1, we exposed confluent human renal proximal tubule cells to TGF-β1 and observed a significant induction of HO-1 mRNA at 4 h with a maximal induction at 8 h. This induction was accompanied by increased expression of HO-1 protein. TGF-β1 treatment in conjunction with actinomycin D or cycloheximide demonstrated that induction of HO-1 mRNA requires <i>de novo</i> transcription and, in part, protein synthesis. Exposure to TGF-β1 resulted in marked induction of Smad7 mRNA with no effect on Smad6 expression. Overexpression of Smad7, but not Smad6, inhibited TGF-β1-mediated induction of endogenous HO-1 gene expression. We speculate that the induction of HO-1 in the kidney is an adaptive response to the inflammatory effects of TGF-β1 and manipulations of the Smad pathway to alter HO-1 expression may serve as a potential therapeutic target."

The structure shows that the heterodimer forms an asymmetric coiled-coil. Even in the absence of DNA, the basic region of ATF4 forms a continuous α-helix, but the basic region of C/EBPβ is disordered. Proteolysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, circular dichroism, and NMR analyses indicated that (i) the bZIP domain of ATF4 is a disordered monomer and forms a homodimer upon binding to the DNA target; (ii) the bZIP domain of ATF4 forms a heterodimer with the bZIP domain of C/EBPβ that binds the cAMP response element, but not CCAAT box DNA, with high affinity; and (iii) the basic region of ATF4 has a higher α-helical propensity than that of C/EBPβ. These results suggest that the degree of ordering of the basic region and the fork and the dimerization properties of the leucine zipper combine to distinguish the structurally similar bZIP domains of ATF4 and C/EBPβ with respect to DNA target sequence.

Many, if not most, transcription factors, including the bZIP1 proteins, bind their cognate DNA elements as dimers. Dimerization between transcription factors from the same or different families can generate considerable functional diversity using only a relatively small number of components. By binding with different specificity to distinct DNA sites within promoters, heterodimeric transcription factors facilitate the positioning and orientation of proteins on DNA, thus providing distinct surfaces for interaction with other transcriptional regulatory proteins bound to adjacent DNA sites. Among coiled-coil proteins, bZIP family members form dimers via their characteristic leucine zipper helices, which consist of seven-residue (heptad) repeats, (abcdefg) n . Dimer formation by bZIP proteins is selective: some form only homodimers, some form only heterodimers, and others form both homo- and heterodimers. Hydrophobic interactions by leucine and other hydrophobic amino acids in positions 3 and 4 in the helix (the a and d positions of the helical wheel) form the hydrophobic core of the bZIP dimer. Leucine residues occupy most of the d positions in the leucine zipper helix. At the same time, hydrophilic amino acids located just outside of the hydrophobic core (the e and gpositions of the helical wheel) also participate in stabilizing the dimer. A highly conserved asparagine amino acid in the aposition in the middle of the leucine zipper helix has been shown to destabilize oligomer formation in several bZIP dimers (1Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on the precise distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues in the bZIP helix, only selective pairs of bZIP transcription factors are able to form stable dimers, which in turn lead to distinct DNA binding propensity. The basic DNA-binding region of the bZIP domain adopts a stable structure upon association with DNA. Binding to the cognate DNA induces a coil-to-helix transition of the basic DNA-binding region (2Patel L. Abate C. Curran T.

NMR and CD studies of GCN4 and C/EBP bZIP domains have shown that in the absence of the DNA target, the basic region has some residual helical character and has been described as an ensemble of transiently formed helical structures (4O'Neil K.T. Shuman J.D. Ampe C. DeGrado W.F.

The folding transition involved in the DNA binding of the GCN4 basic region results in an unfavorable contribution to the overall free energy from the loss of conformational entropy (6Bracken C. Carr P.A. Cavanagh J. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2133-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The bZIP transcription factor family, one of many dimeric protein families, participates in a number of different transcriptional activities. The DNA-binding motif, consisting of basic and leucine zipper regions, is one of the simplest DNA-binding domains. However, the bZIP transcription factors are capable of recognizing a broad range of DNA sequences, yet at the same time, discriminate sufficiently to regulate the transcription of a diverse range of genes in different promoters. Based on DNA-binding activity, the bZIP transcription factors in mammals are divided into three major families: (i) activator protein-1 (AP-1), (ii) cAMP response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF), and (iii) C/EBP. AP-1 family members have been the most heavily studied. In particular, structural analyses of bZIP domains of AP-1 proteins such as Fos/Jun and GCN4 in the absence and presence of the AP-1 DNA target (5′-TGAGTCA-3′) and cAMP response element (CRE; 5′-TGACGTCA-3′) have led to a general understanding of bZIP DNA binding. Among bZIP transcription factors, the CREB/ATF family appears to have a higher selectivity for DNA target sites. As homodimers, CREB/ATF proteins recognize CRE, a palindrome of two inverted identical half-sites (TGAC·GTCA), which differs from the AP-1 target site by 1 base pair in the center. The AP-1 target is also a palindrome consisting of two inverted identical half-sites with 1 overlapping base pair in the middle (TGACTCA) (7Andrisani O.M. Pot D.A. Zhu Z. Dixon J.I. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although a number of three-dimensional structures of bZIP domains in the presence of DNA targets have been studied (18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C.

Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structure of a bZIP homo- or heterodimer containing the basic regions has not been studied in the absence of a DNA target. To obtain a better understanding of dimerization properties and the conformational changes to the dimer upon DNA binding, we determined the crystal structure of the bZIP heterodimer formed between ATF4 and C/EBPβ. Furthermore, we used circular dichroism and NMR to show that the bZIP domain of ATF4 does not form homodimers, but does form heterodimers with C/EBPβ, a member of the C/EBP family. The heterodimer does not bind to the CCAAT box, but binds to CRE with high affinity. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of the C/EBPβ·ATF4 heterodimer revealed that the basic region of the bZIP domain of the ATF4 subunit is an α-helix, whereas the basic region of C/EBPβ is disordered. These results suggest that a degree of ordering of the DNA-binding region and the dimerization properties of the bZIP domains are important in DNA recognition by bZIP transcription factors. The NdeI-BamHI fragments containing the coding sequences for residues 280–341 of human ATF4 (8Hai T. Allegretto E.A. Karin M. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and residues 224–285 of mouse C/EBPβ (21Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) were generated by polymerase chain reaction from the full-length cDNAs and cloned into a pET11a plasmid. Both proteins were separately overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The bZIP domain of C/EBPβ was purified from the insoluble fraction. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in Buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 6 m urea and applied to an SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with Buffer A containing 6 m urea (10 column volumes) and then with Buffer A (10 column volumes). Renatured C/EBPβ bZIP domain was eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in Buffer A. Protein was precipitated on ice and pelleted by centrifugation. The resulting pellet was dissolved in water and used for crystallization trials. The ATF4 bZIP domain was purified from the soluble fraction. The cells were frozen and thawed in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm Na2S2O3. The soluble fraction was incubated for 20 min at 70 °C; the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, whereas the supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 20–800 mm NaCl in Buffer A. The fractions containing the ATF4 bZIP domain were diluted 5-fold and applied to an SP-Sepharose column. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 20 mm to 1 m NaCl in Buffer A. The protein peak was pooled and concentrated further in a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). For CD and NMR spectroscopy studies, Cys-310 of ATF4 was substituted with Ser to prevent the cysteine oxidation and formation of high molecular mass aggregates. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Vanderbilt Core Facility. Oligopeptides were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostic International Inc. (San Antonio, TX). CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C using a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter. All spectra were run using a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette. Protein samples contained 10 μm protein, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0–50 μm DNA. The synthetic peptide samples contained 50 μm peptide, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0–80% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). The CD spectra were averaged from three wavelength scans, blanked, smoothed, and analyzed using the manufacturer's software. The concentrations of the proteins and synthetic peptides used for experiments were determined by amino acid analysis. Lyophilized proteins were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 90:10 (v/v) H2O/D2O at 1.5 mm. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 without correction for deuterium isotope effect. A series of homonuclear two-dimensional NMR experiments were recorded at 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C. Experiments were done on a DRX600 (14.2 T) instrument (Bruker) operating at 600.13 MHz. Sweep widths were adjusted to 7183 Hz. The size of acquired free induction decay was 2048 complex points. The carrier frequency was set on the H2O. Thirty-two transients were acquired for each of 1024 t1 values. In NOESY experiments (22Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar), time proportional phase incrementation was used (23Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Pulsed field gradient water suppression was used in all experiments (27Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3486) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding activities of the bZIP domain of C/EBPβ and the bZIP domain of ATF4 were examined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay using oligonucleotides containing CRE or the CCAAT box. bZIP proteins in a micromolar concentration range were mixed with [32P]DNA (5 nm final concentration) in 10 μl of binding buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mg/ml poly(dA-dT)/poly(dG-dC) (1:1, w/w)). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min on ice and analyzed by native electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gel (Phast system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The positions of radiolabeled DNA on the gel were determined by autoradiography. Equimolar quantities of purified, concentrated bZIP domains of C/EBPβ and ATF4 were mixed to form the heterodimer. Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at 15 °C from a solution containing 0.3 mmC/EBPβ·ATF4 heterodimer, 1 m ammonium sulfate, 50 mm sodium cacodylate, and 5% dioxane. Hanging drops were equilibrated over well solutions containing twice the concentration of salts and dioxane. Plate-like crystals grew to final dimensions of 1.0 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm over the course of 3 weeks. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic P2221 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 72.628, b = 81.152, and c = 35.317 Å, with one heterodimer in one asymmetric unit. Using 30% glycerol as a cryoprotectant, a data set was collected at −172 °C from one crystal to a resolution of 2.6 Å on an R-AXIS II mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 x-ray generator. The data set was indexed, processed, and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Sawyer L. Isaacs N.I. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing.

The model that included residues 286–341 for ATF4 and residues 239–284 for C/EBPβ was further refined by torsion angle molecular dynamics alternating with conjugate gradient minimization refinement and individual B factor refinement against 8 to 2.6 Å data using the program CNS (31Brunger A.T.

The three-dimensional structure of the C/EBPβ·ATF4 bZIP heterodimer solved at 2.6 Å resolution is similar to those of other bZIP dimers determined in the complex with DNA targets. The heterodimeric coiled-coil is formed by the more curved C/EBPβ helix wrapping around the approximately straight ATF4 helix (Fig.1 A). The most prominent structural feature of the C/EBPβ·ATF4 heterodimer is that most of the basic region of the ATF4 bZIP domain is a continuous α-helix. The α-helix starts at Asn-288 of ATF4 in the N terminus, which is conserved among bZIP domains. In the three bZIP domain·DNA complex structures determined (18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K.

The helical conformation of the bZIP domain is maintained in part by several intrahelical interactions (Fig. 1, B and C). In particular, intrahelical interactions between ATF4 Tyr-295 and Lys-299 as well as between ATF4 Gln-297 and Arg-300 contribute to the stability of the α-helical conformation in the fork and the basic region of ATF4. Both pairs of residues are bridged by well ordered water molecules (Figs. 1 B and2 A). Interestingly, the Gln-297 and Arg-300 pair in ATF4 have been shown to be important for the discrimination between CRE and AP-1 sites by AP-1 and CREB/ATF proteins. The GCN4 point mutant containing only these two substitutions from ATF1 has been shown to have a preference for CREB/ATF sites over the AP-1 site (35Kim J. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2531-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The second pair of interaction, Tyr-295 and Lys-299, appears to be unique to ATF4 because position 295 in other bZIP domains is usually occupied by serine, cysteine, or phenylalanine. ATF4 Arg-296 is conserved in the basic region and the crystal structures of GCN4 bound to either an AP-1 site or a CRE DNA target show that ATF4 Arg-296 interacts differently with the central base pair(s) of the DNA target (18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 19Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In our structure of the non-complexed bZIP dimer, ATF4 Arg-296 is sandwiched between Tyr-295 and Lys-299 in the same turn of the α-helix and is unable to adopt many alternative conformations. These four residues are involved in important intrahelical interactions that may increase a degree of ordering of the basic region and the fork of ATF4. Ala-291, Ala-292, Arg-294, and Tyr-295 in the basic region of ATF4 participate in crystal lattice interactions by making a backbone-backbone contact with the same residues in the symmetrically related ATF4 molecule (ATF4*) (Fig. 2 A). The successive alanine residues in these regions of the helices allow the main chain atoms to approach at the distance of 3.0–3.5 Å to make strong van der Waals contacts, resulting in two ATF4 helices packing at an angle of ∼80°. These lattice contacts may contribute to the stability of the α-helical conformation of the basic region of ATF4 in the crystal structure. The crystallization of the heterodimer in this particular conformation reflects that the α-helical propensity of the ATF4 basic region is higher than that of C/EBPβ. Evidence that the basic region of ATF4 may have some α-helical propensity also comes from circular dichroism studies performed on two synthetic 26-residue peptides comprising both the basic region and the fork of ATF4 or C/EBPβ. In aqueous solution, both peptides lack helicity. The α-helical content increased upon addition of TFE (Fig.3 C), which is known to stabilize the helical conformation of a peptide and is used as a quantitative probe for helical tendency in polypeptides (36Jasanoff A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2129-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In both peptides, the mean residue ellipticity ([θ]222) exhibited sigmoidal dependence on TFE concentration and showed a sharp transition as TFE concentration was increased above 10%. For the ATF4 peptide, [θ]222 was higher than for the C/EBPβ-derived peptide at TFE concentrations above 20% and approached −31,800 degrees cm2dmol−1, which corresponds to ∼89% helicity assuming a value of −35,800 degrees cm2dmol−1 for 100% helicity of a 26-residue peptide at 20 °C (37Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). For the C/EBPβ peptide, [θ]222 approached −24,700 degrees cm2dmol−1, which corresponds to 69% helicity and is 20% below the value shown by the ATF4 peptide. Under these conditions, the basic region of ATF4 has a significantly greater helical propensity than the same region of C/EBPβ and lends support to the notion that the α-helical basic region of ATF4 seen in our structure is not just reflection of crystal packing forces. As expected, the CD spectra of C/EBPβ showed two negative peak at 208 and 222 nm, indicating the presence of α-helix in the leucine zipper region, and a negative peak near 200 nm, indicating a random conformation (38Woody R.W. Advances in Biophysical Chemistry. 2. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1992: 37-79Google Scholar) in the basic region (Fig. 3 A). The CD spectra of the bZIP domain of ATF4, however, revealed a negative peak near 200 nm and no strong negative peak at 208 and 222 nm. This indicates not only that the basic region is a random coil, but also that the leucine zipper region is also disordered, which suggests that the bZIP domain of ATF4 may not form a coiled-coil or a typical stable bZIP homodimer in the absence of DNA. When the bZIP domain of ATF4 was titrated with the CRE-containing DNA, two negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm appeared in the CD spectrum, which are characteristic of an α-helical structure. The α-helical content is estimated by [θ]222. The end point of the titration does not exceed −18,200 degrees cm2dmol−1, which corresponds to 48% helicity and suggests that the leucine zipper region of ATF4 may not necessarily form a stable coiled-coil even in the presence of the DNA target. In contrast, the CD spectra for the bZIP domain of C/EBPβ showed the helical content of ∼50%, which increased to 81% upon binding to CCAAT box DNA (Fig. 3 A). When equal amounts of the bZIP domains of C/EBPβ and ATF4 were mixed together, the CD spectrum showed two strong negative bands at 206 and 222 nm (Fig.3 B), leading to an estimation of the helical content of ∼85%. This exceeds not only that of the bZIP domain of ATF4 in the presence of specific DNA (CRE), but also that of the bZIP domain of C/EBPβ without DNA. In fact, it is comparable to that of the bZIP domain of C/EBPβ in the presence of the DNA target (CCAAT box). This indicates that the formation of the heterodimer between the bZIP domains of ATF and C/EBPβ induces an α-helix in the bZIP domain of ATF4 even in the absence of specific DNA. Proteolytic digestion of the bZIP domains confirmed our CD observation (Fig. 4). Proteolysis by endoproteinases, V8 (Glu-C) and trypsin showed that the basic region of the C/EBPβ bZIP domain is digested in a short period time (<10 min under the condition we used), whereas the leucine zipper region remained uncut for a longer period of time. However, the basic region of the ATF4 bZIP domain is more stable than that of C/EBPβ, with only about one-third of the basic region from the N terminus digested in the same period time. Surprisingly, there was an additional cleavage at the middle of the leucine zipper region of the ATF4 bZIP domain, suggesting that the leucine zipper of ATF4 may not be able to maintain an α-helical conformation in the absence of specific DNA. NMR experiments performed for ATF4 and C/EBPβ at protein concentration of 1.5 mm at different temperatures are in good agreement with the results of the CD experiments.

The best characterized Raf substrates are MEK1 and MEK2. The activation of MEK1/2 by Raf is required to mediate many of the cellular responses to Raf activation, suggesting that MEK1/2 are the dominant Raf effector proteins. However, accumulating evidence suggests that there are additional Raf substrates and that subsets of Raf-induced regulatory events are mediated independently of Raf activation of MEK1/2. To examine the possibility that there is bifurcation at the level of Raf in activation of MEK1/2-dependent and MEK1/2-independent cell regulatory events, we engineered a kinase-active Raf1 variant (RafBXB(T481A)) with an amino acid substitution that disrupts MEK1 binding. We find that disruption of MEK1/2 association uncouples Raf from activation of ERK1/2, induction of serum-response element-dependent gene expression, and induction of growth and morphological transformation. However, activation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression and induction of neurite differentiation were unimpaired. In addition, Raf-dependent activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase was only slightly impaired. These results support the hypothesis that Raf kinases utilize multiple downstream effectors to regulate distinct cellular activities.

The Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases is critically involved in this signal transduction process. Raf kinases were first discovered as gain of function mutants with the ability to induce growth and morphological transformation of established cell lines. Subsequently it was discovered that activation of cellular Raf proteins is a downstream response to growth factors and is required to link growth factor receptor signaling to activation of gene expression (1Daum G.

Activated ERKs phosphorylate a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear targets, including transcription factors that mediate growth factor regulation of gene expression. ERK activation is required for cellular transformation induced by oncogenic Ras and Raf (3Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kinch M.S. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

However, several cellular responses to activated Raf have been characterized that appear to be independent of MEK or MAP kinase activation. For example, constitutively active variants of Raf but not MEK are sufficient to induce differentiation of hippocampal neuronal cells (6Kuo W.L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E.M. McCarthy S.A. Yan M.

RafBXB(T481A) can efficiently stimulate morphological changes in PC12 cells indicative of differentiation events, NF-κB-dependent gene expression, and activation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), despite severely impaired ERK1/2 activation.DISCUSSIONAlthough it is clear that MEK1 and MEK2 are major substrates of Raf, accumulating observations suggest that Raf may regulate important cellular events independently of, or in parallel with, MEK1/2 activation (see the Introduction). To begin to explore this concept in detail, we have engineered a kinase-active Raf1 variant that is uncoupled from MEK1/2-dependent signaling events because of an amino acid substitution (T481A of human Raf1) that interferes with MEK1/2 binding. Expression of this Raf variant (RafBXB(T481A)) in cells revealed that it is uncoupled from activation of ERK1 and ERK2, cannot induce growth and morphological transformation, and cannot activate transcription from serum response elements or the HB-EGF promoter. In contrast RafBXB(T481A) retained the ability to induce neurite-like outgrowths in PC12 cells, activate transcription from NF-κB-dependent promoters, and induce the kinase activity of p90 RSK.The above results suggest that RafBXB(T481A) can be used to define subsets of Raf-induced responses that are MEK-independent. Our observation that Raf activation of NF-κB can be uncoupled from MEK1/2 regulation is consistent with recent data examining NF-κB regulation in Jurkat T cells (8Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J.

Our observations that RafBXB(T481A) mimics RafBXB effects on PC12 cell neurite differentiation and p90 RSK activation were more unexpected.

Our results suggest that although some extent of MEK1/2 activation may be required for these responses, activated Raf can contribute to neurite differentiation and RSK activation independently of MEK1/2 activation. It is important to note that dominant interfering MEK1/2 variants retain the ability to associate with Raf and therefore may block both MEK1/2-dependent and MEK1/2-independent Raf functions (25Janssen R.A. Veenstra K.G. Jonasch P. Jonasch E. Mier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32182-32186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, both of the widely used chemical inhibitors of MEK1/2, PD98059 and U0126, also inhibit at least one other MEK family member involved with Raf signaling, MEK5 (26Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar).The epistatic relationships of proteins functioning in mammalian signal transduction cascades are most often explored using combinations of constitutively active and dominant interfering variants of the components that contribute to regulation of the cascade. This approach has been highly successful in ordering the components of the Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinase cascade and for assessing the importance of this cascade in mediating mitogenic signals (27English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, as a more sophisticated understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell regulation develops, it is becoming clear that many signal transduction proteins are multifunctional, introducing branch-points into what were once considered to be simple linear pathways of information flow (28Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar,29Zuker C.S. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 283: 650-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the context of complex regulatory networks, phenotypes observed with dominant interfering variants of signaling proteins can often be difficult to interpret because of association of the variants with multiple regulatory and effector proteins.As all of the components that mediate Raf action in cells have not been identified, we currently can not rule out the formal possibility that RafBXB(T481A) regulation of neurite induction, NFκB, and p90 RSK is mediated by activation of ERK1/2 to levels that are below the threshold of detection. Nevertheless, the dramatic uncoupling of RafBXB(T481A) from ERK1/2 activation, SRE activation, and focus formation is in stark contrast to the intact regulation of NFκB, neurite formation, and p90 RSK activation. Further characterization of the mechanism of action of RafBXB(T481A) in cells, as well as the isolation of additional Raf variants that differentially uncouple association with Raf-binding proteins, will contribute to a better understanding of the complexities of cellular Raf kinase function.

In addition, both of the widely used chemical inhibitors of MEK1/2, PD98059 and U0126, also inhibit at least one other MEK family member involved with Raf signaling, MEK5 (26Kamakura S. Moriguchi T.

This approach has been highly successful in ordering the components of the Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinase cascade and for assessing the importance of this cascade in mediating mitogenic signals (27English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). However, as a more sophisticated understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell regulation develops, it is becoming clear that many signal transduction proteins are multifunctional, introducing branch-points into what were once considered to be simple linear pathways of information flow (28Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar,29Zuker C.S. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 283: 650-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the context of complex regulatory networks, phenotypes observed with dominant interfering variants of signaling proteins can often be difficult to interpret because of association of the variants with multiple regulatory and effector proteins.As all of the components that mediate Raf action in cells have not been identified, we currently can not rule out the formal possibility that RafBXB(T481A) regulation of neurite induction, NFκB, and p90 RSK is mediated by activation of ERK1/2 to levels that are below the threshold of detection. Nevertheless, the dramatic uncoupling of RafBXB(T481A) from ERK1/2 activation, SRE activation, and focus formation is in stark contrast to the intact regulation of NFκB, neurite formation, and p90 RSK activation. Further characterization of the mechanism of action of RafBXB(T481A) in cells, as well as the isolation of additional Raf variants that differentially uncouple association with Raf-binding proteins, will contribute to a better understanding of the complexities of cellular Raf kinase function. Although it is clear that MEK1 and MEK2 are major substrates of Raf, accumulating observations suggest that Raf may regulate important cellular events independently of, or in parallel with, MEK1/2 activation (see the Introduction). To begin to explore this concept in detail, we have engineered a kinase-active Raf1 variant that is uncoupled from MEK1/2-dependent signaling events because of an amino acid substitution (T481A of human Raf1) that interferes with MEK1/2 binding. Expression of this Raf variant (RafBXB(T481A)) in cells revealed that it is uncoupled from activation of ERK1 and ERK2, cannot induce growth and morphological transformation, and cannot activate transcription from serum response elements or the HB-EGF promoter. In contrast RafBXB(T481A) retained the ability to induce neurite-like outgrowths in PC12 cells, activate transcription from NF-κB-dependent promoters, and induce the kinase activity of p90 RSK. The above results suggest that RafBXB(T481A) can be used to define subsets of Raf-induced responses that are MEK-independent. Our observation that Raf activation of NF-κB can be uncoupled from MEK1/2 regulation is consistent with recent data examining NF-κB regulation in Jurkat T cells (8Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J.

Our observations that RafBXB(T481A) mimics RafBXB effects on PC12 cell neurite differentiation and p90 RSK activation were more unexpected. Experiments using dominant inhibitory variants of MEK1 and the pharmacological inhibitor PD98059 suggest that MEK activation is required for Raf-induced neurite differentiation and p90 RSK activation (4Cowley S.

All four GDNF family ligands utilize c-Ret as a common signaling receptor, whereas specificity is conferred by differential binding to four distinct GFRα homologues. To understand how the different GFRαs discriminate ligands, we have constructed a large set of chimeric and truncated receptors and analyzed their ligand binding and signaling capabilities. The major determinant of ligand binding was found in the most conserved region of the molecule, a central domain predicted to contain four conserved α helices and two β strands. Distinct hydrophobic and positively charged residues in this central region were required for binding of GFRα1 to GDNF. Interaction of GFRα1 and GFRα2 with GDNF and neurturin required distinct subsegments within this central domain, which allowed the construction of chimeric receptors that responded equally well to both ligands. C-terminal segments adjacent to the central domain are necessary and have modulatory function in ligand binding. In contrast, the N-terminal domain was dispensable without compromising ligand binding specificity. Ligand-independent interaction with c-Ret also resides in the central domain of GFRα1, albeit within a distinct and smaller region than that required for ligand binding. Our results indicate that the central region of this class of receptors constitutes a novel binding domain for cystine-knot superfamily ligands.

Understanding the molecular interactions underlying the affinity and selectivity of ligand-receptor complexes is of fundamental importance if we are to comprehend fully the molecular basis of signal transduction by polypeptide growth factors. A large group of growth factors contain a distinctive structural motif, the “cystine knot,” formed by a cluster of three disulfide bridges, with two disulfide bridges and their connecting residues forming a ring structure through which the third disulfide bridge passes (1McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 2Murray-Rust J. McDonald N.Q. Blundell T.L. Hosang M. Oefner C. Winkler F. Bradshaw R.A. Structure. 1993; 1: 153-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The protomer of cystine-knot superfamily factors is typically elongated and formed primarily by β strands connected by highly flexible hairpin loops, where most of the sequence variability among paralog factors is located. Different configurations of dimer assembly lead to various shapes, elongated either along or across the 2-fold symmetry axis, which are characteristic of the different subfamilies. Two high-resolution structures of the complex of a cystine-knot factor with its corresponding receptor have been obtained recently, that of vascular endothelial growth factor with the ligand binding domain of Flt-1 (3Wiesmann C.

Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In both cases, distinct immunoglobulin-like domains in the receptors are both necessary and sufficient for ligand binding. However, not all receptors of cystine-knot superfamily ligands contain immunoglobulin-like domains, suggesting the existence of novel binding domains for this class of ligands. GDNF1 is the prototype member of a new subfamily of cystine-knot ligands with important roles in the control of neuron survival and differentiation (5Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol.

Interestingly, four different GFRα receptors have been identified (GFRαs 1 to 4), each selective, although not totally specific, for one member of the GDNF ligand family (reviewed in Ref. 5Airaksinen M.S.

In vivo, GFRα receptors are more widely expressed than c-Ret, suggesting additional roles for these “ectopic” sites of GFRα expression. Both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous functions have been proposed for GFRα receptors expressed in the absence of c-Ret. Recent evidence obtained in c-Ret-deficient cell lines and primary sensory neurons isolated from c-Ret knock-out mice indicates the existence of alternative signaling mechanisms mediated by GFRα receptors acting in a cell-autonomous manner independently of c-Ret (23Trupp M.

GFRα receptors may also function in a non-cell-autonomous manner to capture and concentrate diffusible GDNF family ligands from the extracellular space and then present these factors in trans to afferent c-Ret-expressing cells (25Trupp M.

A large collection of chimeric and truncated receptors was generated and tested in binding and c-Ret autophosphorylation assays. The results of these experiments allowed us to identify a determinant of ligand binding specificity in a central region containing four predicted α helices and two short β strands. The cDNAs for rat GFRα1, rat GFRα2, and mouse GFRα3 subcloned in the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) were obtained as described previously (21Trupp M. Raynoschek C. Belluardo N. Ibáñez C.F. Mol. Cell.

Monoclonal IgG against hemagglutinin was from BabCO; anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal IgG, PY99, and goat polyclonal antibodies, C-20 and T-20, against c-Ret were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. GDNF was prepared in Sf21 cells as described previously (28Trupp M. Rydén M. Jörnvall H. Timmusk T. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Ibáñez C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). NTN was from Peprotech. Recombinant ART and PSP were generous gifts from Jannssen Research Foundation (Belgium). GFRα1-Fc was from R&D Systems. Reagents for radioiodination and cross-linkings were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sigma, and Pierce. An hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted after the putative signal peptide sequence of each GFRα construct by Kunkel mutagenesis (29Kunkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Both Kunkel method and QuickChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) were used to incorporate novel restriction sites at selected conserved strings of residues PYE (BsiWI), RRR (NarI), and SGN (BspEI). Binary chimeras were prepared using these new restriction sites for segmental exchanges. Each exchange site was located in predicted loop regions in the different receptor constructs. Secondary structure predictions were done using PHD Predict (30Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Alignments were done with Clustal X. N-terminal deletions for GFRα1 (ΔN57, ΔN84, ΔN113, and ΔN144) and for GFRα2 (ΔN126) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using upstream primers containing the HA epitope sequence facilitating the grafting of the appropriate signal peptide using NdeI sites within the epitope and the cytomegalovirus promoter region of pCDNA3 (see Fig. 2). C-terminal deletions in GFRα1 (ΔC31, ΔC55, and ΔC79) upstream of Gly-421 (to retain the GPI anchor) were made sequentially from the smallest to the largest truncation using QuickChange mutagenesis. Ligands were radioiodinated to specific activities of about 0.5 to 2 × 108 cpm/μg by the lactoperoxidase method as described previously (28Trupp M. Rydén M. Jörnvall H. Timmusk T. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Ibáñez C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran. 48 h after transfection, cells were rinsed once with chilled binding buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline) and equilibrated with binding buffer containing 50–100 ng/ml radioiodinated ligand for 4 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, bis(succinimidyl) suberate (BS3) cross-linker was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm and incubated for an additional 45 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 mm glycine. Cells were rinsed twice with chilled 50 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4). To assess expression of the various GFRα constructs, an aliquot of each lysate was used for immunoblots on polyvinylidene difluoride (Hybond P) membrane processed for detection of the HA tag. The rest of the lysates were immunoprecipitated using the anti-HA antibody and run on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot analysis was done using enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both immunoblot and autoradiographic exposures were detected and quantified using a Storm840 phosphor/fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Neuro2A cells were transfected with the different GFRα constructs by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The day after transfection, cells were switched to serum-free medium containing 5 μmall-trans retinoic acid, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and N2 supplements and were incubated for 16–20 h. An hour before stimulation, cells were incubated with fresh serum-free medium. Stimulations were done by adding ligands to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml for 12 min, after which cells are lysed in RIPA buffer. Aliquots were taken from each lysate for HA immunoblot analysis, whereas the rest of the lysates were used for c-Ret immunoprecipitations. c-Ret phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. To assess ligand-independent association of different GFRα constructs with c-Ret, co-transfections were done in COS cells using DEAE-dextran. Transfected cells were lysed 48 h later in RIPA buffer containing 60 mm β-octylglucoside. The presence of both sodium deoxycholate and β-octylglucoside in the cell lysis buffer assured complete solubilization of membrane lipid rafts, which was required to establish the co-existence of both GFRα and c-Ret receptors in the same molecular complex, as opposed to the same subcellular compartment. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for c-Ret and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies, recognizing epitope-tagged GFRα constructs. No previous study had examined the binding specificity of all four GDNF family ligands to all four members of the GFRα receptor family in the same experiment. We used125I-labeled GDNF family ligands in chemical cross-linking assays to COS fibroblasts transiently expressing different GFRα receptors carrying an HA tag at the N terminus (Fig.1 A). In all cases, affinity labeling of the receptor band could be prevented by addition of an excess (up to 100-fold) of the corresponding unlabeled ligand (data not shown), indicating specific binding. Western blotting of the same cell lysates with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lower panels) was used to normalize the binding to the levels of expression of the different GFRα receptors for quantification. These experiments confirmed the main established interactions between GDNF family ligands and GFRα receptors (Fig. 1 B, solid arrows) and revealed a number of additional interactions of lower affinity between non-cognate pairs (Fig. 1 B, dotted arrows). Interestingly, although GFRα3 was only able to bind ART, this ligand was capable of interacting, to varying degrees, with all GFRα receptors (Fig. 1 A). Conversely, although PSP binding could only be detected to GFRα4, this receptor was able to interact with lower affinity with all members of the GDNF ligand family (Fig. 1 A). Secondary structure predictions indicated that GFRα receptors contain primarily α helices connected by shorter segments of undefined structure, presumably representing loops (Fig. 2). Two predicted short β strands are also conserved in the central region of all four GFRαs (Fig. 2). The remarkable conservation of the predicted pattern of secondary structure elements among different GFRα receptors suggests that these may represent true structural elements in this class of receptors. For the first set of chimeric receptors, we initially defined two internal boundaries corresponding to two highly conserved triplets in the primary sequence of GFRα receptors, i.e. PYE and SGN (Fig. 2). These boundaries coincide with interhelical regions in secondary structure predictions and divide the GFRα molecule into N-terminal (three predicted helices), central (four predicted helices and two β strands), and C-terminal (two predicted helices) domains of roughly 100, 200, and 100 residues, respectively. Similar domain boundaries have also been defined by others (5Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The percentage similarity of each of the domains in GFRα2, -3, and -4 with respect to GFRα1 is shown in Table I. Unique restriction sites,BsiWI and BspEI, were created by silent mutagenesis at the conserved PYE and SGN triplets, respectively, in all four GFRα receptors. Chimeric molecules were then constructed by exchanging homologous domains using these two restriction sites.Table IPercentage similarity of N-terminal (less signal sequence), central (PYE to SGN), and C-terminal (until GPI consensus sequence) domains of GFRα2 (rat), GFRα3 (mouse), and GFRα4 (chicken) receptors relative to GFRα1 (rat)N-terminalPYE to SGNC-terminalGFRα263.865.748.6GFRα337.843.934.7GFRα461.56447.3 Open table in a new tab We constructed chimeras between two relatively distant members of the GFRα receptor family, GFRα1 and GFRα3, and tested their ability to bind 125I-labeled GDNF and ART and to activate the c-Ret receptor. These experiments indicated that the N-terminal domain is dispensable for ligand binding specificity. A receptor molecule containing the N terminus of GFRα3 and the central and C-terminal domains of GFRα1 (termed 3–1-1) was able to bind GDNF as efficiently as wild type GFRα1 (Fig.3 A). Similarly, the 1–3-3 chimera was able to bind ART, albeit somewhat less efficiently than wild type GFRα3 (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, exchanges involving the central and C-terminal domains disrupted ligand binding (Fig. 3 A), suggesting the requirement of these domains for ligand interaction. The ability of the receptor chimeras to induce ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of c-Ret was examined after transient transfection into the neuroblastoma line Neuro2A, which expresses c-Ret endogenously. In agreement with the results from cross-linking experiments, only GFRα molecules retaining the central and C-terminal domains of GFRα1 were able to support GDNF-dependent stimulation of c-Ret tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). The results from chimeras between GFRα1 and GFRα3 receptors suggested that the N-terminal domain was not essential for ligand recognition and indicated the importance of the central and C-terminal segments of the GFRα molecule. To determine the generality of these observations for other members of the GFRα family, we constructed chimeras between GFRα2 and GFRα3 and tested their ability to bind125I-labeled NTN and to activate the c-Ret receptor. The only molecule capable of significant NTN binding, in addition to wild type GFRα2, was the 3–2-2 chimera (Fig. 3 C). This result indicated that, similar to GFRα1, the N terminus of GFRα2 is dispensable for ligand binding specificity, and both the central and C-terminal domains are required for interaction with NTN. In agreement with the cross-linking data, the 3–2-2 chimera also supported NTN-dependent c-Ret phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D). In Neuro2A cells, however, the 2–2-3 chimera was also able to mediate ligand-dependent c-Ret phosphorylation, despite its undetectable binding to 125I-NTN in COS cells (Fig. 3,C and D). These data are in accordance with previous observations indicating that c-Ret and GFRα receptors collaborate in the binding of suboptimal ligands and suggested that, under certain circumstances and in the presence of c-Ret, the C-terminal domain of GFRα receptors may also be exchanged without compromising ligand binding specificity (see below). We then analyzed chimeras between more closely related receptors, i.e. GFRα1 and -2, GFRα1 and -4, and GFRα2 and -4. The chimeras between GFRα1 and GFRα2 revealed a reciprocal pattern of binding to 125I-GDNF and125I-NTN (Fig.4 A). In all cases, the receptor chimeras showing the strongest binding to a given ligand were those retaining the central domain from the cognate receptor,i.e. X-1-X for GDNF and X-2-X for NTN. A similar pattern was observed in chimeras between GFRα1 and -4 analyzed by affinity labeling with 125I-GDNF (Fig. 4 B) and in chimeras between GFRα2 and -4 analyzed with 125I-NTN and 125I-PSP (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate the importance of the central domain of GFRα receptors for ligand recognition. In contrast to the chimeras between GFRα1 and -3, the C-terminal domains of GFRα1, -2, and -4 could be exchanged without loss of binding (Fig. 4, A and B), probably because of their closer relative similarity (Table I). This indicates that the C-terminal domain can modulate ligand binding but is not an essential determinant of specificity. The results of c-Ret phosphorylation assays in Neuro2A cells were again in general agreement with the binding data, i.e. the chimeras with the highest activity were the ones that retained the central domain from the cognate receptor (Fig. 4, C and D). A number of GFRα molecules that showed low or undetectable binding, however, did mediate significant levels of c-Ret phosphorylation after GDNF stimulation, such as the 2–2-1 and the 2–2-2 molecules (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, all chimeras between GFRα1 and GFRα2, as well as wild type GFRα1, supported some degree of c-Ret activation after NTN stimulation (Fig.4 C, lower panels). These data are in agreement with results from previous studies demonstrating significant cross-reactivity between the GFRα1-GDNF and GFRα2-NTN systems in the presence of c-Ret (20Sanicola M.

To further investigate structure-function relationships in the GFRα receptor family, we constructed chimeras involving subsegments of the central domain of GFRα1 and GFRα2 receptors. We took advantage of the conserved RRR triplet sequence located in the middle of the central domain, between the two predicted β strands (Fig. 2), to introduce a unique NarI site by silent mutagenesis. This new boundary subdivides the central domain into two roughly equal halves of approximately 100 residues, each predicted to contain two α helices and a β strand. Cross-linking studies with 125I-GDNF indicated that the chimeras that retained binding were the ones that contained the second central subsegment from GFRα1, i.e.corresponding to the formula X-2′-1′-X (Fig.5 A). Conversely, the chimeras that retained binding to 125I-NTN contained the first central subsegment from GFRα2 (Fig. 5 A), suggesting different structural requirements for ligand binding specificity within the central domains of GFRα1 and GFRα2. Thus, the chimeric receptor 2–2′-1′-1, which combined both elements, had a broader specificity and was able to bind 125I-GDNF and 125I-NTN with comparable efficiency (Fig. 5 A). As with the previous chimeras between these two receptors, all constructs supported some level of c-Ret phosphorylation over control when introduced into Neuro2A cells (Fig. 5 B), although the molecules that bound ligand more efficiently were still the most active. This again confirms the contribution of c-Ret in ligand recognition and demonstrates that the low ligand binding efficiency of some of the chimeras was not because of structural problems in these molecules, as they were still able to support some degree of ligand-dependent c-Ret activation. Although the N-terminal domain of GFRα receptors did not appear to play a role in ligand specificity, it was unclear whether it was at all necessary for ligand binding or it had some other function, such as contacting the c-Ret receptor. This question became all the more important in view of the proposed existence of a natural splice variant of GFRα2 lacking the first 146 residues (termed GFRα2c) (32Wong Y.W. Too H.P. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3767-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore generated truncated versions of GFRα1 lacking the first (GFRα1-ΔN57), the first and the second (GFRα1-ΔN87), or all three (GFRα1-ΔN113) predicted α helices"

Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of PHIP revealed no discernible insulin receptor-regulated phosphorylation, suggesting that PHIP is not itself a substrate of the insulin receptor. In contrast to full-length PHIP, overexpression of the PH-binding region of PHIP has a pronounced inhibitory effect on insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Furthermore, expression of this dominant-negative PHIP mutant leads to a marked attenuation of insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity.

Moreover, heterologous PH domains from the β-adrenergic receptor kinase, phospholipase Cγ, or spectrin, known to promote plasma membrane targeting by binding phosphatidylinositol phospholipids, fail to restore IRS-1-specific signaling, suggesting that the IRS-1 PH domain is not simply a membrane-targeting device but may interact with specific cellular ligands (7Burks D.J.

In an attempt to identify functional partners of the IRS-1 PH domain, we used a yeast two hybrid system where the PH domain of IRS-1 was used as a bait to screen a mouse cDNA library. A clone that coded for a novel protein termed PHIP, for PH-interactingprotein, selectively bound to the IRS-1 PH domain but not to PH domains from unrelated proteins and was thus chosen for further characterization.

The 612-base pair (bp) fragment spanning the IRS-1 PH-binding region (PBR) of the PHIP cDNA isolated from the yeast two hybrid screen was subcloned in frame into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X (Invitrogen). The expressed fusion protein is ∼45 kDa, corresponding to GST and residues 4–209 of PHIP. All of the following constructs were subcloned in frame with the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope in the pCGN mammalian expression vector. To prepare constructs encoding IRS-1 PHWT, a PCR-generated fragment containing the IRS-1 PH domain (residues 3–133), was subcloned into SmaI andBamHI sites within the pCGN expression vector. To generate the IRS-1 PH domain mutant constructs designated IRS-1 PHW106A, where the Trp106 residue conserved in all PH domains was changed to Ala, and either N-terminal (PHNT; residues 3–67) or C-terminal (PHCT; residues 55–133) PH domain regions, the following primers were used to amplify the corresponding regions. For PHW106A, primer 1, 5′ AAAAACCCGGGAAGCCCTCCGGATACCGATG 3′ and primer 2, 5′ AAAAAAGGATCCTCAATTATGCAGCTGCAGAAGAGCCTGGTACGCGCTGTCTTGTTCAGCCTCG 3′ (CCA is replaced with CGC); for PHNT, primer 1 and primer 3, 5′ AAAAAAGGATCCTCACTCGAGGGGGATCGAGCG 3′; for PHCT, primer 4, 5′ AAAAAATCTAGAAGCTGTTTCAACATCAACAAGC 3′ and primer 5, 5′ AAAAAAGGATCCTCAGCTGCAGCTACCACCGCA 3′ were used. SmaI, BamHI, and XbaI restriction sites were added (underlined) to facilitate subcloning into pCGN, which had been digested with the same enzymes. To generate the pCGN/HA-DN-PHIP mutant construct, a PCR fragment of 639 bp encompassing the IRS-1 PH-binding region of PHIP (residues 4–217) was amplified using sense primer 5′ GGACTAGTGCGAGATTGGCTGTGGAAGAACTAAC 3′ and antisense primer 5′CGGGATCCTCAGCAATATCTAGTGTCATCAACTGG 3′. The PCR fragment was digested with SpeI andKpn-1 and was subcloned into the compatibleXbaI/KpnI sites of the pCGN vector. To generate the full-length pCGN/HA-PHIP construct, a 2271-bpBstEII/BamHI fragment comprising amino acids 150–902 of PHIP was excised from the cDNA clone 6b26, isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library, and was subcloned into the pCGN/HA-DN-PHIP vector, which had been cleaved at the BstEII site within PHIP and BamHI within the pCGN vector. The pcDNAI/HA-tagged p44MAPK plasmid was a gift from Dr. J. Avruch. The PH domain from rat IRS-1 (residues 3–133) was fused to the LexA-binding domain within the BTM116 vector and used as a bait in a yeast two hybrid system to screen for interacting clones from a mouse 10.5-day embryonic cDNA library fused with the VP16-activation domain of the yeast pVP16 vector. Transformation of the yeast strain L40 with yeast plasmids and screening for positive colonies by β-galactosidase assays were done essentially as described by Sawka-Verhelle et al.

A total of 89 positive clones were identified, most of which were represented at least twice, indicating that the screen was saturated. The clone that displayed the strongest interaction with the IRS-1 PH domain, VP1.32, was representative of 18/89 positive clones. The 612-bp VP1.32 clone insert was subsequently used to screen adult mouse thymus (a gift from Dr. W. J. Muller) and human fetal brain (a gift from Dr. J. Rommans) cDNA libraries to obtain the complete coding region of mouse and human PHIP, respectively. cDNA clones encoding the extreme 5′ end of human PHIP mRNA were never obtained. 5′ RACE was performed as per manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Specific mPHIP primer, 5′ GTCAGGCATATCATGGTATTTCATGGT 3′, was used to generate the first strand cDNA. The two 5′ CCTTAGTTCCATCTTATGCCATGGCTG 3′ and 5′ CCAAGCTGAAGGCAACCACTC 3′ mPHIP primers were used as nested primers for first and second rounds of reverse transcription PCR, respectively. Alignment of sequences obtained from a combination of 5′ RACE and cDNA library screens were used to confirm the full PHIP cDNA sequences. Bacterially expressed GST-PHIP fusion proteins containing the PHIP PH-binding region (residues 5–209) were injected into rabbits to raise polyclonal anti-PHIP antibodies. Anti-GST antibodies were removed by passage over a GST affinity column. Anti-IRS-1PCT(generated against a 16-amino acid pre-C-terminal polypeptide sequence) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-MAPK (p42/44) and anti-phosphotyrosine, PY20, antibodies were from New England Biolabs. Anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Babco. Anti-IRS-1PH (generated against the IRS-1 PH domain) and anti-IRS-2 antibodies were gifts from Dr. M. F. White, and anti-IR and anti-Shc antibodies were generously provided by Dr. K. Siddle and Dr. J. McGlade, respectively. Rat-1 fibroblasts, 293 human embryonic kidney cells, and COS monkey kidney epithelial cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin-G, and 100 μg of streptomycin. The human multiple myeloma cell line U266 was cultured in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with the same reagents. In cases of serum starvation, cells were cultured in DMEM alone for 16 to 18 h and then stimulated with the indicated doses of insulin (Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in PLC lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μm sodium orthophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates (500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and immunoblotted with the corresponding antibodies. Whole cell lysates were prepared by harvesting cells 48 h after transfection with hot 2× SDS sample buffer. 50–200 μg of lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with the corresponding antibodies as indicated. COS and 293 cell lines were transfected with the indicated pCGN expression plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Rat-1 cells were transfected using GenePorter 2 (Gene Therapy Systems) as per manufacturer's instructions. L40 yeast cells expressing various HA-tagged PH domains (rat IRS-1, mouse SOS1, human RasGAP, and mouse Ect-2) were lysed with acid-washed beads in 1 ml of distilled water containing 0.1 mm PMSF. Clarified cell lysates were incubated with ∼5 μg of GST-PHIP (PBR) proteins for 90 min at 4 °C. For pull-down experiments with IRS-1 PH domain mutants, COS-1 cell lysates transiently transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged PHWT, PHNT, PHCT, or PHW106A and were mixed with either GST or GST-PHIP (PBR) proteins. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. COS cells transiently cotransfected with HA-p44MAPKand either pCGN control vector or pCGN/DN-PHIP were stimulated with or without insulin and lysed in PLC lysis buffer. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 30 μm cold ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. 20 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) was used as a substrate. The reaction was stopped by 6× SDS sample buffer, and the supernatant was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The top portion of the gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane for immunoblotting with anti-MAPK antibodies (Abs), and the bottom portion containing labeled MBP was detected by autoradiography. In an attempt to identify proteins that bind to the PH domain of IRS-1, we used a yeast two hybrid screen in which the PH domain from rat IRS-1 was used as a bait to screen a murine 10.5-day embryonic cDNA library. Sequence analysis of a cDNA clone, VP1.32, which displayed the strongest interaction with the IRS-1 PH domain, revealed an open reading frame of 204 amino acids with no significant homology to any known proteins. We designated this protein PHIP, for PH-interacting protein. To recapitulate the interaction of PHIP with the IRS-1 PH domain in mammalian cells and to assess the specificity of PH domain binding, the VP1.32 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEX-3X vector and expressed as a GST fusion protein. Bacterially expressed GST-PHIP was used to probe yeast cell lysates expressing HA-tagged derivatives of PH domains from IRS-1 and from unrelated signaling proteins mSos1 (Ras nucleotide exchanger), Ect-2 (Rho/Rac exchanger), and RasGAP (14Bowtell D.

Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 16Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interacting proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA Abs (Fig. 1 A). Whereas GST-PHIP bound to the IRS-1 PH domain, there was no discernable association with PH domains of other proteins, suggesting that PHIP may function as a specific ligand of the IRS-1 PH domain. Next, to examine whether a functional PH domain or a smaller motif within the domain is responsible for PHIP binding, we generated three independent mutants of the IRS-1 PH domain that disrupt the PH fold; PHNT encompasses the first half of the IRS-1 PH domain, spanning residues 3–67, PHCT comprises the C-terminal residues 55–133, and PHW106A defines a mutant where the tryptophan at position 106, a residue conserved in all PH domains, was changed to Ala. As expected, all three PH domain mutants expressed transiently in COS-1 cells did not detectably associate with GST-PHIP, consistent with the notion that an intact PH domain is required for PHIP binding (Fig. 1 B). VP1.32 was subsequently used to screen mouse thymus and human fetal brain cDNA libraries in combination with 5′ RACE analysis, to obtain the complete coding region of mPHIP and hPHIP, respectively. The conceptual translation predicts a 902-amino acid protein of relative molecular mass of 100K (Fig. 2 A). PHIP proteins do not share sequence homology with any known proteins. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the IRS-1 PBR is located at the N terminus of the protein (residues 5–209). The only defined structural motifs within PHIP are two bromodomains, BD1 (residues 230 to 345) and BD2 (387 to 503), located in tandem in the center of the molecule (Fig. 2 B). Bromodomains are conserved sequences of ∼100 amino acids that have been proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions (17Jeanmougin F. Wurtz J.M. Le Douarin B. Chambon P. Losson R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A homology search revealed that PHIP BD sequences were most homologous (44% identity, 61% homology) to the bromodomain of mouse CREB-binding protein (CBP) (Fig. 2 C), a transcriptional coactivator (18Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of PHIP mRNA from adult mouse tissues detected a transcript size of ∼7.0 kb whose expression is widespread (data not shown). Western blot analysis with Abs raised against a bacterial GST-PHIP fusion protein identified a 104-kDa protein from U266 cell lysates that was not precipitated by pre-immune sera (Fig. 3 A). Further analysis of PHIP expression in mammalian cell extracts revealed two forms of PHIP protein, the long 104-kDa form and a shorter 97-kDa form (Fig. 3 B). The 97- and 104-kDa polypeptides likely result from alternative usage of two putative translation initiation sites (Met1 and Met41; see Fig. 1) as ectopic expression of full-length hPHIP containing both sites produced a doublet in PHIP immunoblots (data not shown). To investigate the interaction of PHIP and IRS-1 in vivo, lysates from NIH/IR cells (NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the insulinreceptor) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 Abs directed against the C terminus of IRS-1. Endogenous PHIP was found to associate with IRS-1 in both unstimulated and insulin-treated cells. (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1and 2). In contrast, when antibodies directed against the IRS-1 PH domain were used in similar coimmunoprecipitation assays, no interaction was detected, confirming that structural determinants within the PH domain of IRS-1 confer binding to PHIP. Based on the observation that IRS-1 and IRS-2 PH domains are highly conserved (60% amino acid identity) and have been shown to be functionally interchangeable in promoting substrate recognition by the insulin receptor (7Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers M.G.J. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we predicted that IRS-2 may also associate with PHIPin vivo. Indeed, PHIP could be readily detected in anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitates, consistent with the notion that PHIP may have a conserved function in recruiting members of the IRS protein family to activated insulin receptor complexes (Fig. 4 A,lane 7). As there are several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the PHIP sequence we next examined whether PHIP serves as a substrate of the insulin receptor in vivo. Anti-PHIP immunoprecipitates from unstimulated or insulin-stimulated 293 cell lysates failed to show any discernable PHIP phosphorylation on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots (Fig. 4 B). PHIP however inducibly associated with a prominent 103-kDa phosphoprotein whose identity remains unknown. To establish the biochemical significance of IRS-1-PHIP interactions in insulin signaling, we designed PHIP constructs that encoded the PHIP PBR region alone (residues 5–209) and predicted that it should function in a dominant inhibitory fashion by competing with the endogenous PHIP for the IRS-1 PH domain. Indeed, ectopically expressed DN/PHIP binds to endogenous IRS-1 in both untreated and insulin-stimulated cell lysates (Fig. 5 A, panel 3). To analyze whether DN/PHIP interaction with endogenous IRS-1 leads to disruption of IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to insulin, we transiently transfected DN/PHIP in two different cell lines, COS-7 and Rat-1 cells. Transient expression of DN/PHIP, but not full-length PHIP, significantly impaired IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (>5-fold) in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 5, A and B). To ascertain whether the reduction in IRS-1 phosphorylation occurred through interference with receptor function, we looked for changes in phosphotyrosine levels of immunoprecipitated IR and Shc, a direct substrate of the activated IR. Our results demonstrate that diminution of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels was not attributable to inhibition of IR kinase activity in at least two cell backgrounds (Fig. 5, A and C). One of the early signaling events initiated by the IR is activation of MAP kinase. Moreover, in many cells, IRS-1 has been shown to be an upstream mediator of MAP kinase activation during insulin stimulation (19Myers M.G.J. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Schlessinger J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 20Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1778-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of DN/PHIP on IRS-1-mediated MAP kinase activation, COS cells were cotransfected with DN/PHIP and HA-tagged p44MAPK, and anti-HA immune complexes from serum-starved and insulin-stimulated cell lysates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using MBP substrate. As shown in Fig. 5 D, insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activation was reduced to basal levels by DN/PHIP expression. As expected, Shc phosphorylation remained refractile to the effects of DN/PHIP, suggesting that in these cells the PHIP/IRS-1 signaling pathway is essential for promoting MAP kinase activation during insulin stimulation. We next sought to establish whether PHIP directly interacts with the IR. Coimmunoprecipitation assays failed to reveal a direct interaction (data not shown). Similar results have previously been reported for the association of the IR with either IRS-1 or the Shc adaptor, suggesting that IR/effector interactions are weak or transient in nature and not detected in receptor immune complexes (22Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Pawson T. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5748-5753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Backer J.M. Myers M.G.J. Sun X.J. Chin D.J. Shoelson S.E. Miralpeix M.

White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2509-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that PHIP is a novel protein ligand of the IRS-1 PH domain that can modulate insulin signaling. Although it is generally accepted that most PH domains bind to phosphoinositides there are some reports of PH domains associating with protein ligands as illustrated by the β-adrenergic receptor kinase PH domain, which binds to the βγ subunits of G heterotrimeric proteins (25Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 39-74PubMed Google Scholar). Given that the majority of PH domain-containing proteins have a functional requirement for membrane association, it has been postulated that the lipid-binding function of PH domains serves to recruit these signaling proteins to membrane compartments. However, recent studies demonstrating that PH domains are not functionally interchangeable argue for the existence of specific PH domain cellular ligands (7Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J.

Our findings that PHIP selectively associates with the IRS-1 PH domain not only buttresses the notion of PH domains as protein-binding modules but also provides support for the specificity of PH domain interactions. The observation that inhibitory mutants of PHIP cause perturbation of IR-dependent IRS-1 phosphorylation suggests that PHIP may serve to couple IR to IRS-1. The molecular basis for PHIP-IRS-1 interaction has yet to be defined. Although recent data indicate that the IRS-1 PH domain binds to short stretches of acidic residues such as KVAEEEDDEE found in nucleolin I (12Burks D.J. Wang J. Towery H. Ishibashi O. Lowe D. Riedel H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these acidic motifs are not present in the PBR region of PHIP. Functional analysis of PHIP-IRS interactions may provide insights into the structural basis for PH ligand-binding specificity. As PHIP associates stably with both IRS-1 and IRS-2, it may fulfill a common function in regulating both signaling pathways. PHIP proteins also contain additional protein interaction domains, which may allow for the formation of multisubunit signaling complexes in response to insulin. In this regard, PHIP may serve as an adaptor that integrates IRS-1-mediated signals with signals from other cellular effectors of the activated insulin receptor. We are grateful to M. F. White, K.

One of these proteins, VspA of Borrelia turicatae, is also associated with neurotropism in infected mice. Vsp proteins are highly polymorphic in sequence, which may relate to their specific antibody reactivities and host cell interactions. To determine whether sequence variations affect protein structure, we compared B. turicatae VspA with three related proteins: VspB of B. turicatae, Vsp26 of the relapsing fever agent Borrelia hermsii, and OspC of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Recombinant non-lipidated proteins were purified by affinity or ion exchange chromatography. Circular dichroism spectra revealed similar, highly α-helical secondary structures for all four proteins. In vitro assays demonstrated protease-resistant, thermostable Vsp cores starting at a conserved serine at position 34 (Ser34). All proteins aggregate as dimers in solution.In situ trypsin treatment and surface protein cross-linking showed that the native lipoproteins also form protease-resistant dimers. These findings indicate that Vsp proteins have a common compact fold and that their established functions are based on localized polymorphisms.

Outer Surface Protein A variable large protein variable small protein variant surface glycoprotein Relapsing fever and Lyme disease are bacterial infectious diseases caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia. In contrast to other spirochetes that affect humans, such as the syphilis agent Treponema pallidum, their transmission to vertebrate hosts depends on arthropod vectors (1Barbour A.G. Hayes S.F. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 381-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout their vector-host life cycle, Borrelia cells display abundant lipoproteins on their surfaces. The genomic sequence of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi revealed over 130 putative lipoprotein genes on its chromosome and plasmids (2Casjens S. Palmer N. van Vugt R. Huang W.M.

Included in this class of lipoproteins with unknown function is the tick-associated Outer Surface Protein A (OspA)1 (6Howe T.R. Mayer L.W. Barbour A.G. Science. 1985; 227: 645-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which is in current use as a Lyme disease vaccine for humans (7Steere A.C. Sikand V.K. Meurice F. Parenti D.L. Fikrig E.

OspA is anchored to the outer membrane via an N-terminal triacyl-modified cysteine (8Beermann C. Lochnit G. Geyer R. Groscurth P. Filgueira L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The OspA crystal structure revealed 21 antiparallel β-strands and one C-terminal α-helix, which fold into globular N- and C-terminal domains connected by an unusual, freestanding nonglobular β-sheet (13Ding W.

Less is known about the structure of the major outer membrane lipoproteins of relapsing fever Borreliae, which are immunodominant and determine serotype (16Barbour A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Collectively called variable membrane proteins, they have been divided into two families: the variable large proteins (Vlps) of 36–40 kDa and the variable small proteins (Vsps) of 20–23 kDa (17Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3352-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vlp and Vsp proteins appear unique to the genus Borrelia. They have been described in the relapsing fever species Borrelia turicatae (17Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. Infect.

Immun. 1994; 62: 3213-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is phylogenetically related to the Vsps (17Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3352-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has led to the term Vsp-OspC family. While their signal peptides necessary for proper translocation and processing are conserved, the mature Vlp and Vsp-OspC lipoproteins are highly polymorphic. OspC amino acid sequences of different Lyme disease Borreliae can vary as much as 25% (25Jauris-Heipke S. Fuchs R. Motz M. Preac-Mursic V. Schwab E. Soutschek E. Will G. Wilske B. Med. Microbiol.

There is evidence that this variation is maintained, even within a local population, by frequency-dependent balancing selection (27Wang I.N. Dykhuizen D.E. Qin W.G. Dunn J.J. Bosler E.M. Luft B.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 15-30PubMed Google Scholar). Vlp and Vsp proteins diverge even more, with 40 to 80% amino acid identities among them (17Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3352-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hinnebusch B.J. Barbour A.G. Restrepo B.I. Schwan T.G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 432-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the single plasmid-encoded ospC of B. burgdorferi (29Sadziene A. Wilske B. Ferdows M.S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2192-2195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), several archival copies of B. hermsii vsp and vlpgenes are maintained on linear plasmids and sequentially expressed from a promoter site after gene conversions or DNA rearrangements (21Barbour A.G. Tessier S.L. Stoenner H.G. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1312-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 30Pennington P.M. Cadavid D. Bunikis J. Norris S.J. Barbour A.G. Mol.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3299-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The resulting multiphasic antigenic variation of Vsps and Vlps allows the spirochete to repeatedly evade the host's immune response, which leads to recurrent spirochetemia and the characteristic febrile episodes (16Barbour A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This strategy is analogous to that for variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) of African trypanosomes, the PfEMP1 proteins of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and the PilE/PilS and Opa surface proteins of Neisseria species (32Barbour A.G. Restrepo B.I. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2000; 6: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33Deitsch K.W. Moxon E.R. Wellems T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Experimental relapsing fever in mice has demonstrated a role for Vsp proteins in differential tissue localization as well as for avoidance of the immune response. In a clonal population of B. turicatae, expression of VspB was associated with high densities of spirochetes in the blood, while expression of VspA led to early invasion and persistent infection of the central nervous system (17Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3352-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cadavid D. Thomas D.D. Crawley R. Barbour A.G. J. Exp.

Immun. 1997; 65: 285-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VspA may help to evacuate the bacterium to an immunopriviledged niche, while VspB may facilitate efficient transmission to the next feeding tick. Tissue culture assays yielded clues about pathogenesis mechanisms. B. turicatae expressing VspA penetrated human umbilical vein epithelial cell monolayers more readily than those expressing VspB (18Cadavid D. Thomas D.D. Crawley R. Barbour A.G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, VspB increased binding of the spirochete to mammalian endothelial and glial cells (36Thomas D.D. Cadavid D. Barbour A.G. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), predominantly by the direct interaction of VspB with host cell surface glycosaminoglycans (37Magoun L. Zückert W.R. Robbins D. Parveen N. Alugupalli K.R. Schwan T.G. Barbour A.G. Leong J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 886-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Structural data for Vsp-OspC proteins are limited. NMR studies of B. burgdorferi strain B31 OspC have suggested that the core of OspC consists of four α-helices, while the N- and C-terminal sequences are highly flexible (38Huang X.L. Link K. Koide A. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Koide S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). OspC dimers were observed both with recombinant protein in solution (38Huang X.L. Link K. Koide A. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Koide S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 283-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as well as with cell surface-exposed native lipoprotein (11Bunikis J. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2874-2883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of sequence variation on Vsp-OspC protein structure, and thus the structural basis of their established functions, remained unknown. To address this, we determined structural features of VspA and three other members of the Vsp-OspC protein family by biochemical and biophysical methods. A comparison indicates that Vsp-OspC proteins share a highly α-helical, compact fold, which includes a dimerization domain and confers protease resistance to a large central portion of the Vsps. For high resolution x-ray structure determination, we obtained two forms of VspA crystals. Non-lipidated, soluble fusion proteins with N-terminal histidine tags (hisVspA, hisVspB, hisVsp26, and hisOspC) were obtained as described for hisVspA (17Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3352-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gene segments lacking the N-terminal signal sequence and lipidation site were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Taqthermostable DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Forward and reverse primers for hisVspB, hisVsp26, and hisOspC are listed in TableI. The polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into pET15b (Novagen) and cloned in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were expressed after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and subsequently purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described (17Cadavid D. Pennington P.M. Kerentseva T.A. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3352-3360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pennington P.M. Cadavid D. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4637-4645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All four proteins eluted >95% pure at an imidazole concentration of 300 mm. Recombinant, non-lipidated OspA was provided by R. Huebner (Aventis, Swiftwater, PA).Table IOligonucleotide primers used in this studyNameNucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′)1-aThe underlined sequences were added to introduce restriction sites and are noncomplimentary to the Borrelia sequences.hisVspB-fwdAGTGCGTTATTAATGACTTTATTTTTACATATGTCTGCTAATAhisVspB-revAATAATAAATTAGGATCCTTATTATTAGTTAGATTGAGChisVsp26-fwdTATGGTGTTTCATATGGCCAATAATGGAGGGCChisVsp26-revGGATCCTTAGTTATTTTGAGAAGGTTThisOspC-fwdCAATATTAATGACTTTATTTTTATTTCATATGGCTAATAATTCAGGGAhisOspC-revATATGGATCCTTATTAAGGTTTTTTTGGACTTTCTGCCS34vspAB-fwdGGAATTCCATATGTCTGATGGCACTGTTS34vspA-revCGGGATCCTTAGTTAGATTGAACAGTAGS34vspB-revCGGGATCCTTAGTTAGATTGAGCAGTAG1-a The underlined sequences were added to introduce restriction sites and are noncomplimentary to the Borrelia sequences. Open table in a new tab To obtain core proteins S34VspA and S34VspB,vspA and vspB sequences starting with the Ser34 codon and ending with the translational stop codon were amplified from plasmid clones (see above and Refs. 17Cadavid D.

Reverse primers were S34vspA-rev and S34vspB-rev, respectively (see Table I). The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET29b (Novagen). Recombinant plasmids pET29::S34vspA and pET29b::S34vspB were obtained after transformation of E. coli InvαF′ (Invitrogen). E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) transformants containing the plasmids were grown overnight from single colonies at 30 °C in LB containing 30 μg of kanamycin/ml. A 1:50 dilution of the overnight cultures was grown at 37 °C in Terrific broth (39Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989)Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., 3 Vols., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar) with kanamycin. Expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm when the culture OD595reached 0.9. Incubation continued overnight at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.2 × volume of anion exchange column buffers: (i) 20 mm Tris hydrochloride, 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.0 (AIEX-A), for S34VspA and (ii) 20 mm ethanolamine hydrochloride, 0.02% NaN3, pH 10.0 (AIEX-B), for S34VspB. Cleared lysates were obtained by ultrasonication, centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min and passing through a 0.45-μm pore size filter (Nalgene). Cleared lysates were passed over a HiPrep 16/10 Q XL anion exchange column (Pharmacia) in AIEX-A or -B column buffers. Under the respective conditions both S34VspA and S34VspB bound quantitatively to the matrix. The proteins were eluted in a linear gradient of AIEX-A or -B column buffers containing 0 to 200 mm NaCl. S34VspA and S34VspB eluted at salt concentrations of 80 and 130 mm, respectively. Peak fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled, concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon), and dialyzed overnight against deionized H2O at 4 °C. Protein aliquots were flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant purified proteins were treated separately with four proteases. The two serine proteases, trypsin and plasmin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), were used at 10 to 400 μg/ml or 1 mg/ml, respectively, in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, while lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B and aspartyl protease cathepsin D (Calbiochem) were used at concentrations of 1.5 units/ml in 250 mm Na citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 5.5. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then stopped with Roche Complete protease inhibitor mixture supplemented with 1 μm pepstatin. For in situ protease treatment, B. turicatae Oz1 serotype A cells were grown in BSK II medium and harvested as described (40Barbour A.G. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1984; 57: 521-525PubMed Google Scholar). Intact Borrelia cells were treated in situwith trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described (41Bunikis J. Luke C.J. Bunikiene E. Bergström S. Barbour A.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of surface-exposed proteins was performed using formaldehyde as described for B. burgdorferi OspC (11Bunikis J. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2874-2883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For immunoblots, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon-NC, Millipore) as described (42Zückert W.R. Meyer J. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were rinsed in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS), and either air-dried or processed directly. 5% Dry milk in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 was used for membrane blocking and subsequent incubations for 1 h each. TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 alone was used for intervening washes. Rabbit antisera were used at 1:500 dilutions, and mouse monoclonal antibody hybridoma supernatants at a 1:10 dilution. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Protein A/G (ImmunoPure Protein A/G CIP conjugate, Pierce) at a 1:5000 dilution was used as the second ligand, and a stabilized alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (1-Step NBT/BCIP, Pierce) was used for colorimetric detection. N-terminal protein sequences of recombinant proteins were determined on a Model 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) from protein samples previously purified by gel electrophoresis and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (43Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Molecular masses of purified recombinant proteins were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight on a Voyager biospectrometry workstation (Perseptive Biosystems) using sinapinic acid as matrix. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Proteins were diluted to a concentration of 20 μm in deionized H2O. Samples were placed in 0.1-mm path length cells at 25 °C and spectra were acquired using a scan speed of 20 nm/min, response time of 1 s, bandwidth of 1.0 nm, and step resolution of 0.5 nm. 20 Acquisitions between 260 and 180 nm wavelength were co-added. Spectral data were deconvoluted using the DICROPROT program suite (44Deléage G. Geourjon C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 197-199PubMed Google Scholar) and secondary structure ratios were determined by the least squares fit method using the Fasman algorithm. Predictions of secondary structure were obtained using software available on the protein sequence analysis server at the Biomolecular Engineering Research Center of Boston University (45Stultz C.M. Nambudripad R. Lathrop R.H. White J.V. Allewell N. Woodward C. Protein Structural Biology in Biomedical Research. 22B. JAI Press, Greenwich1997Google Scholar). For size determination, proteins were separated on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 high-resolution column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was first equilibrated with column running buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% NaN3) and then calibrated separately with blue dextran 2000 (for void volume determination), albumin (67 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 10 mg of concentrated recombinant proteins previously purified by anion exchange chromatography were loaded in 1 ml of column running buffer. For each protein, the partition constant Kav was calculated from the peak elution volume using the following formula: Kav = (Ve 2 −Vo)/(Vt −Vo), where Ve = elution volume,Vo = column void volume, and Vt = total bed volume. Recombinant purified S34VspA was dialyzed against deionized H2O, then diluted to 8 mg/ml. Crystals suitable for structure determination by x-ray diffraction methods were obtained using standard vapor diffusion techniques. Aggregated thin plates were produced in conditions numbers 6 and 22 during initial screening with Hampton Research sparse matrix kit I. These conditions share precipitant and buffer conditions of 30% PEG 4000 and 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, but differ in salt additive of 0.2m MgCl2 or 0.2 mNaCH2COOH, respectively. The precipitant, salt, and pH were varied systematically about these two conditions to optimize crystal size and quality (see “Results”). S34VspA crystals were characterized using a conventional rotating anode x-ray source and native diffraction data were collected at beamline X12C of the Brookhaven National Laboratory National Synchrotron Light Source on a CCD detector. Diffraction images were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (46Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 307-326Google Scholar). While pathogenesis-associated functions of Borrelia Vsp proteins, e.g. in antigenic variation and tissue tropism, have been established, the structural basis for these functions remain unknown. One question is how the observed primary protein sequence polymorphisms affect secondary, tertiary, and quarternary protein structure. Beginning to address this by biochemical and biophysical methods, we first expressed VspA of B. turicatae in E. coli. We chose this protein to focus on because of its association with nervous system invasion. Two related proteins, VspB of the same strain of B. turicatae and Vsp26 of B. hermsii, as well as the more distantly related OspC of B. burgdorferi, were also expressed. Their conserved signal peptides and overall amino acid identities of 40 to 70% are representative of the entire Vsp-OspC protein family (Fig. 1). The proteins were purified in an N-terminal histidine-tagged form by standard nickel affinity chromatography. In these constructs (hisVspA, hisVspB, hisVsp26, and hisOspC), the Vsp-OspC sequences start with residue Asn20 (Fig. 1), i.e. they lack the signal peptide and acylation site at Cys19. The recombinant proteins therefore were soluble, but otherwise mimic the full-length processed form. Previous studies showed that B. burgdorferi OspA and OspC are highly resistant to trypsin in situ, i.e. when expressed in a native, lipidated form on the surface of the bacteria (10Barbour A.G. Tessier S.L. Hayes S.F. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11Bunikis J. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2874-2883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that protease resistance is an intrinsic property of recombinant OspA (12Dunn J.J. Lade B.N. Barbour A.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether VspA and the related proteins are also protease resistant, we incubated recombinant hisVspA, hisVspB, hisVsp26, and hisOspC with trypsin at concentrations ranging from 12.5 μg to 400 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Recombinant, non-lipidated OspA and casein (Sigma) were used as controls (Fig.2). As expected, casein was digested to completion, while recombinant OspA was unaffected by trypsin. In contrast to the study of in situ OspC (11Bunikis J. Barbour A.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2874-2883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), several independently purified recombinant hisOspC preparations did not exhibit comparable trypsin resistance in vitro. This difference in results suggests that OspC is either stabilized by the lipid-mediated attachment to the cell surface, or that the recombinant hisOspC obtained from our construct is destabilized by the additional, non-native sequence at its N terminus. Although the processed VspA, VspB, and Vsp26 proteins have 27 to 30 predicted trypsin sites distributed over the whole length of their protein sequences, the three proteins were merely truncated 5 to 8 kDa by trypsin digestion (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with plasmin, which has trypsin-like activity. Yet, to reach an equivalent cleavage efficiency, plasmin concentrations had to be increased to 1 mg/ml, which corresponds to about 10 times the physiological concentration (47Coleman J.L. Roemer E.J. Benach J.L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3929-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that most of the sites were not accessible to the protease, thus yielding a protease-resistant core. No further truncations were observed with trypsin concentrations of up to 10 mg/ml, and VspA maintained its protease-resistant core even after being boiled for 10 min (not shown). Protein sequencing of the trypsin-treated VspA, VspB, and Vsp26 protein cores revealed the N-terminal amino acids in all three cases to be SDGTV. This sequence can be found starting at a conserved serine at position 34 (Ser34) (Fig. 1). To purify the protease-resistant cores and for further structural analysis of VspA (see below), we constructed N-terminal truncated versions of VspA and VspB starting at Ser34 (S34VspA and S34VspB). A methionine codon was added to initiate translation. S34VspA and S34VspB proteins were purified to >95% purity from crude E. coli lysates in a single-step anion-exchange chromatography step. Trypsin truncated S34VspA and S34VspB by approximately 1 kDa, revealing a succeptible site at the C terminus as well (Fig. 2). The location of this site, i.e. the C terminus of the core protein, was derived from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry data. The mass of undigested S34VspA was determined as a control, yielding a major peak of 18,507 Da. It corresponds to a protein starting with Ser34 and ending with Asn214 with a predicted size of 18,475 Da. As confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, the f-Met was removed, probably by the E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase (48Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A C-terminal 11-amino acid peptide from transducin, Gtα-(340–350), has been shown to both bind and stabilize the Meta II conformation, mimicking heterotrimeric Gt. Using a combinatorial library we identified analogs of Gtα-(340–350) that bound light-activated rhodopsin with high affinity (Martin, E. L., Rens-Domiano, S., Schatz, P. J., and Hamm, H. E. (1996)J.

We have made peptides with key substitutions either on the background of the native Gtα-(340–350) sequence or on the high affinity sequences and used the stabilization of Meta II as a tool to determine which amino acids are critical in G protein-rhodopsin interaction. Removal of the positive charge at the N termini by acylation or delocalization of the charge by K to R substitution enhances the affinity of the Gtα-(340–350) peptides for Meta II, whereas a decrease was observed following C-terminal amidation. Cys-347, a residue conserved in pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, was shown to interact with a hydrophobic site in Meta II.

Stimulation of a G protein-coupled receptor by an appropriate agonist results in conformational changes leading to its interaction with a heterotrimeric G protein, catalysis of GDP release, and subsequent G protein activation (for reviews see Refs. 1Gether U.

In the absence of additional guanine nucleotides, the G protein enhances agonist binding to a G protein-coupled receptor. Binding of either GDP or GTP to the G protein disrupts the high affinity complex or active state of the G protein-coupled receptor (5Iyengar R. Abramowitz J. Bordelon-Riser M. Blume A. Birnbaumer L.

Lin T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14428-14430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and binding by an antibody (39Hamm H. Deretic D. Mazzoni M. Moore C. Takahashi J. Rasenick M. J. Biol.

Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), mimicking the entire holo-G protein.

However, in many of the crystal structures the final residues of the Gα C terminus are disordered and not visible. NMR studies indicate that the C-terminal 11-amino acid peptide of Gtαhas no structure in solution, but it takes on significant structure when it is bound to either excited (light activated) or unexcited rhodopsin (51Dratz E.D.

A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct physical interaction between the C-terminal residues of Gtα and rhodopsin. However, detailed structures of the Gtα peptide-receptor or Gtα peptide-R* complexes are still uncertain because of methodological limitations. 2E. A. Dratz and D. Gizachew, submitted for publication.2E. A. Dratz and D. Gizachew, submitted for publication.In an alternative approach to defining important determinants in the C terminus, Martin et al. (54Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) used a combinatorial peptide library to identify high affinity analogs of Gtα-(340–350) that bound to light-activated rhodopsin. Sequences derived from panning the biased library demonstrated the presence of certain positions in which amino acids were absolutely conserved (Cys-347 and Gly-348). Based on work by Dratz et al. (51Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), as well as peptide substitutions, these residues are predicted to be part of a type II′ β turn, which is thought to be required for establishing Meta II stabilization. Also highlighted by the combinatorial library screening procedure was that the Lys-341 in the native sequence was selected against. In nearly 70% of the sequences obtained from the panning, and in all of the highest affinity sequences, Lys-341 was changed to a noncharged group (54Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that a positive charge at position 341 in Gtmight decrease its affinity for rhodopsin, leading to a faster “off” rate and a higher rate of G protein activation. Given that other G proteins do not have a positive charge at this position, the presence of a charged residue in Gt has implications for the evolved properties of the signaling mechanisms.In this study we have examined the structural basis for the invariance of Gly and Cys at the −3 and −4 positions, respectively, and the loss of a positively charged residue at the −10 position in the high affinity analogs from the combinatorial library. The structural features predicted by NMR were also further explored with analog peptide studies of the functional interaction of these peptides with activated rhodopsin leading to Meta II stabilization.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe three-dimensional structures of heterotrimeric G proteins have provided detailed information about their subunit and receptor interactions and have suggested mechanisms for GTP hydrolysis. In most of the crystal structures the final residues of the Gα C terminus are disordered and not visible. However, in one of the crystal structures of Gtα·GTPγS (45Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) the ordered C-terminal residues 343–349 form an α-helix and make van der Waals contacts with residues of the α2/β4 loop. It is not clear whether this is a crystal-packing artifact or an indication of a preferred conformation of the C terminus. Additionally, for both Gsα (47Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and the Giα·RGS4 complex (57Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), the C terminus of Gα is an extension of the α5 helix. In the Giα·RGS4 complex (57Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) the extended α5 helix was stabilized by the N-terminal helix as well as by crystal contacts, whereas for Gsα (47Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) the extended α5 helix is in close proximity with the α4-β6 loop. Sunahara et al.(47Sunahara R.K. Tesmer J.J. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) suggest that the divergence of the Gα C-terminal structures may contribute to receptor selectivity.NMR studies indicate that the C-terminal 11-amino acid peptide of Gtα has little or no structure in solution, but it takes on significant structure when it is bound to rhodopsin (51Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 52Dratz E. Gizachew D. Busse S.

A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), indicating a direct physical interaction between the C terminus of Gtα and its receptor. However, detailed structures of the Gtα peptide-receptor or Gtα peptide-R* complexes are still uncertain because of methodological limitations.2 It has not been possible to refine the published bound peptide structures (51Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 52Dratz E. Gizachew D. Busse S. Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 16Google Scholar) by comparing experimental NMR data to that calculated from the bound structures, indicating that there are significant errors in the NMR distance constraints. In addition, many of the predictions for amino acid substitutions that would be tolerated or favorable for the Kisselev et al. (53Kisselev O. Kao J. Ponder J. Fann Y. Gautam N. Marshall G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) proposed R*-bound structure were not born out by experiment (58Arimoto K. Ragno R. Kisselev O.G. Makara G.M. Marshall G.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (abstr.): 42Google Scholar). When more accurate NMR data are obtained, it may be possible to refine the protein-bound peptide structures to within the uncertainty in 1.6-Å resolution x-ray structures.2For an alternative approach, we identified potent high affinity sequences related to the C terminus of Gtα using a “peptides-on-plasmids” combinatorial technique (59Cull M. Miller J. Schatz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) in which a library with greater than 109 different peptide sequences was tested for binding to light-activated rhodopsin (54Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have now expanded on observations from the combinatorial screening by making specific point mutations within the C-terminal peptide sequence to clarify how the C terminus of Gtα interacts with and stabilizes the activated rhodopsin species Meta II.Rhodopsin can be measured spectrophotometrically in many of its light-induced conformational states (for review see Ref. 4Hargrave P. Hamm H. Hofmann K. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The binding of Gt to light-activated rhodopsin stabilizes an active signaling state of the receptor (R*) that can be measured spectrophotometrically (60Hofmann K. Reichert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7990-7995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Pfister C. Kuhn H. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 136: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The active state can be stabilized by the R*-catalyzed loss of GDP from Gt, leading to an empty guanine nucleotide binding pocket (62Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Addition of either GTP or GDP promotes the loss of the active R* state, as measured by the loss of Meta II stabilization (62Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 63Kahlert M. Konig B. Hofmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18928-18932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 64Panico J. Parkes J. Liebman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18922-18927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biologically active Meta II state can be differentiated from its precursor, Meta I, by the extra Meta II assay. This assay makes use of the observation that under conditions of slightly alkaline pH and low temperatures Meta I is strongly favored in the absence of Gt. Meta II is stabilized in the presence of Gt and can be measured spectrophotometrically. We have exploited the ability of Gtα-(340–350) C-terminal peptide analogs to stabilize Meta II in the same manner as Gt to investigate the interface between G proteins and their agonist-activated receptors.The Role of Free Amino Groups in the Peptide Stabilization of Meta IIThe native Gtα-(340–350) peptide is of relatively low potency in its ability to interact with and stabilize Meta II, with an EC50 of 1209 μm (Fig. 1, Table I). Two similar peptide analogs were found to have increased potencies at stabilizing Meta II; Gtα-(340–350)-K341R, with one fewer amino group, displayed an EC50 of 180 μm, andAc-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R, with two fewer amino groups, had an EC50 of 163 μm. The potencies of Gtα-(340–350)-K341R andAc-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R are 6.7- and 7.4-fold higher, respectively, than that of native Gtα-340–350 peptide (Table I). Substitution of the second Lys at position 345 with Arg (Ac-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R-K345R) decreased the EC50 even further to 35 μm, resulting in a 35-fold increase in potency as compared with the native Gtα-(340–350) peptide (Fig. 1, Table I).Table IRole of the charge at the N and C termini in Meta II stabilization by Gtα -(340–350) analogsPeptideSequenceEC50± S.E.SlopenμmRole of N terminus Gtα-(340–350) I K E N L K D C G L F1209.0 ± 2.70.824 Gtα-(340–350)-K341R I R E N L K D C G L F180.4 ± 1.21.403 Ac-Gtα-(340–350)Ac-I K E N L K D C G L F162.9 ± 2.00.783 Ac-Gtα-(340–350)-K341RAc-I R E N L K D C G L F162.7 ± 1.30.897 Ac-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R-K345RAc-I R E N L R D C G L F34.8 ± 1.21.183 Peptide 23 V L E D L K D C G L F0.7 ± 1.11.062 Ac-peptide 23Ac-V L E D L K D C G L F0.5 ± 1.71.272 Ac-peptide 23-K345RAc-V L E D L R D C G L F1.1 ± 3.60.783 Peptide 24 M L K N L K D C G M F152.1 ± 1.80.893 Ac-peptide 24Ac-M L K N L K D C G M F9.7 ± 1.20.834 Ac-peptide 24-K342R-K345RAc-M L R N L R D C G M F9.9 ± 1.20.813Role of C terminus Ac-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R-AmideAc-I R E N L K D C G L F-Amide395.7 ± 1.21.026The dose response for the ability of each of the listed Gtαanalogs to stabilize Meta II was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Bold letters indicate amino acid residues that differ relative to the native Gtα-(340–350) sequence. Dose-response curves were analyzed by non-linear regression using a sigmoidal dose-response variable slope equation (GraphPad Prism) to obtain the EC50 values, S.E., and slope. The number of independent experiments, done in duplicate, is listed as n. The EC50 obtained for heterotrimeric G protein was 0.28 ± 1.12 μm, with a slope of 1.19 (n = 8). Open table in a new tab We have shown previously that the increase in potency of Gtα-(340–350)-K341R as compared with the native Gtα-(340–350) peptide is associated with a slower rate of Meta II decay in the presence of a Lys to Arg change at position 341 (51Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the N terminus of the native peptide can attack the retinal Schiff's base linkage of Meta II nonspecifically (51Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the rate of Meta II decay in the presence of various peptide analogs to ascertain whether the increase in potency observed might be associated with changes in the rate of Meta II decay. The half-life for Meta II in the presence of 2 mm Ac-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R was 654 min versus a half-life of 702 min in the presence of 2 mm Ac-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R-K345R, indicating that there was little difference in their rate of Meta II decay over a 6-h period (data not shown). This is different from the results obtained for unacetylated Gtα-(340–350)-K341R and Gtα-(340–350) peptides, which attack the retinal Schiff's base and result in a much shorter half-life for Meta II when compared withAc-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R (51Dratz E.D. Fursteneau J.E. Lambert C.G. Thireault D.L. Rarick H. Schepers T. Pakhlevaniants S. Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased potency for the peptide in which both Lys residues have been changed to Arg (Ac-Gtα-(340–350)-K341R-K345R) appears to be due to an increase in affinity for Meta II rather than an increased stability of Meta II.We have also investigated the role of the free N terminus on activity using two of the high affinity analogs, peptide 23 (VLEDLKSCGLF) and peptide 24 (MLKNLKDCGMF), identified by combinatorial screening (54Martin E.L. Rens-Domiano S. Schatz P.J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 361-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Peptides 23 and 24 contain free N-terminal amino groups. Acylation of the N terminus of peptide 23 to neutralize the free N-terminal amino group decreases the EC50 only slightly, whereas acylation of peptide 24 decreases its EC50 16-fold (Fig. 2, TableI). Substitution of the Lys at position 345 with Arg in the acetylated peptide 23 or substitutions at positions 342 and 345 in acetylated peptide 24 do not affect the EC50 values significantly (Fig. 2, Table I). Taken together, the data in Table I suggest that removal of a localized positive charge by acylation of the N terminus or delocalization of the positive charge that occurs when Lys is replaced with Arg can enhance the affinity of certain Gtα-(340–350) peptide analogs for their interaction with Meta II.Figure 2The role of N termini and random linker sequence in peptide 24-mediated Meta II stabilization.Dose-response curves of Meta II stabilization by the 11-mer and 15-mer high affinity analogs of peptide 24.

Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the structural properties of the two isoforms reconstituted in a mixture of asolectin and 5% stigmasterol. The IR spectra of the two VDAC isoforms were highly similar indicating 50 to 53% anti-parallel β-sheet. The orientation of the β-strands relative to the barrel axis was calculated from the experimentally obtained dichroic ratios of the amide I β-sheet component and the amide II band. Comparing the IR spectra of the reconstituted VDAC isoforms with the IR spectra of the bacterial porin OmpF, for which a high resolution structure is available, provided evidence for a general structural organization of the VDAC isoforms similar to that of bacterial porins.

The mitochondrial outer membrane is freely permeable for small hydrophilic solutes up to approximately 6 kDa. This property has been attributed to the presence of a pore forming protein, the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC)1 or mitochondrial porin (1Benz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Biophysical properties of VDAC channels inserted in planar lipid bilayers have been studied in a large variety of organisms. VDAC channels switch from a high conducting fully open state (3.6 to 4.5 nS in 1 m KCl) at low voltages to several low-conducting substates upon application of voltages higher than ±20 mV. VDAC is slightly anion selective in the fully open state but switches to cation selectivity in the low-conducting substates (2Benz R. Kottke M. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In these substates, the flow of negatively charged metabolites such as succinate, citrate, phosphate (3Hodge T. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and adenine nucleotides (4Benz R. Wojtczak L. Bosch W. Brdiczka D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1954-1962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) through the channel is strongly reduced compared with the fully open state. Therefore, VDAC is thought to regulate the mitochondrial metabolism by regulating the flux of metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane. VDAC channels are involved in different cellular events like the induced release of cytochrome c, which constitutes an early step in apoptosis (6Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). VDAC is the binding site for cytoplasmic enzymes like glycerol kinase and hexokinase (7Adams V. Griffin L. Towbin J. Gelb B. Worley K. McCabe E.R. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1991; 45: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and for the cytoskeleton (8Linden M. Karlsson G. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1996; 218: 833-836Google Scholar). The different VDAC isoforms that exist in yeast, plants, and mammals could be involved in specific functions. Two human VDAC isoforms have different binding affinities for hexokinase (9Blachly-Dyson E. Zambronicz E.B., Yu, W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R. Adelman J. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plant VDAC isoforms have slightly different electrophysiological properties (10Elkeles A. Breiman A. Zizi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6252-6260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and mitochondria isolated from yeast vdac minus mutants show differences in their outer membrane permeability to NADH depending on which of the three mouse VDAC isoforms was expressed (11Xu X. Decker W. Sampson M.J. Craigen W.J. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the multitude of functional properties that are attributed to VDAC could arise from the presence of different VDAC isoforms in mitochondria. VDAC proteins from different far related organisms generally exhibit poor sequence homologies (∼30%) but VDAC from plants seem to have more conserved amino acid sequences (12Roosens N. Al Bitar F.

Despite poor sequence homologies, it is assumed that all VDACs have a rather conserved β-barrel structure similar to that of bacterial porins. This assumption arose from secondary structure predictions (13Forte M. Guy H.R. Mannella C.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Rauch G. Moran O.

Electron microscopic studies of two-dimensional crystals of fungal VDAC and low-resolution images of human VDAC crystals suggested that VDAC proteins form a pore (18Guo X.W. Smith P.R. Cognon B.

Here, we report on the secondary structure, orientation, and accessibility to the water phase of two VDAC isoforms purified from seeds of P. vulgaris. A possible structural organization of the VDAC isoforms is proposed and is compared with that of theEscherichia coli porin OmpF. Seeds from P. vulgaris var. “Streamline” were purchased from a local store. Percoll, chromatofocusing media PBE 94, and Polybuffer PB 96 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Asolectin (soybean phosphatidylcholine) and stigmasterol were obtained from Sigma. Genapol-X-080 was purchased from Fluka and D2O from Merck. Bio-Beads were from Bio-Rad. The bacterial porin, OmpF from E. coli was a kind gift from Dr. T. Schirmer (University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland). The two VDAC isoforms were purified from seeds of P. vulgaris var. “Streamline” following the procedure described previously with minor modifications. The two VDAC proteins were purified and separated in a single chromatofocusing chromatography step, i.e. the HTP batch described in the previous protocol (22Abrecht H. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M. Homblé F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was omitted. Briefly, seeds from P. vulgaris were soaked in tap water for 24 h and mitochondria were isolated from the cotyledons by differential centrifugation steps and further purified on a 28% Percoll gradient (23Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Then, the final mitochondrial pellet (300–400 mg of protein, 20–25 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated chromatofocusing start buffer (see below) supplemented with 4% (v/v) Genapol-X-080 to solubilize the membrane proteins. This suspension was aliquoted (2 ml) and frozen at −20 °C until use. A 10-ml (1.6 × 5 cm) chromatofocusing column was prepared with polybuffer exchanger media (PBE 94, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and equilibrated with the start buffer containing 25 mm ethanolamine, 4 m urea, 0.1% (v/v) Genapol-X-080, pH 9.4. A 2-ml mitochondria suspension in start buffer (containing 2% (v/v) Genapol-X-080) was thawed at room temperature and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min (Beckman, Allegra 21R). The supernatant, containing approximately 20 mg of protein, was loaded onto the chromatofocusing column and proteins were eluted with 10% (v/v) Polybuffer 96 (PB 96, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 m urea, 0.1% (v/v) Genapol-X-080 at pH 7.0. The fractions containing the individual VDAC isoforms from 3 chromatofocusing columns (about 25 ml) were pooled and concentrated about 20-fold (Centriprep-30, Amicon). The elution buffer was exchanged against 1 mm Hepes, 0.1% (v/v) Genapol-X-080, pH 7.2, by gel filtration (Sephadex G-75, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 7.5 cm/h. The proteins eluted at a concentration of about 0.07 to 0.12 mg/ml. 950 μg of purified asolectin (24Kagawa Y. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and 50 μg of stigmasterol were dissolved in chloroform and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of N2 to have a thin lipid film which was dried further overnight under vacuum. The dry lipids were resuspended in 2 ml of protein solution (∼0.1 mg of protein/ml). The lipid/protein/detergent mixture was incubated 30 min at room temperature under constant agitation followed by 3 freeze/thawing cycles. The removal of detergent was achieved by 4 subsequent additions of 40 mg of Bio-Beads (previously washed with methanol and water). Incubation times were 45, 45, 30, and 30 min under constant agitation at 4 °C. After removal of the final Bio-Beads, the proteoliposome suspension was diluted with 1 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, to a total volume of 4.5 ml. The proteins associated with the lipid vesicles were pelleted at 37,000 rpm for 2 h (Beckman L7, SW-60 rotor). This washing step was repeated once. Finally, the proteoliposomes were suspended in 20–30 μl of 1 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. The proteoliposomes had a lipid to protein ratio of about 10:1 (w/w). Protein recovery was in the range of 25–35%. Bacterial porin was diluted in 2 ml of 1 mm Hepes, 0.1% (v/v) Genapol, pH 7.2, to a similar concentration as were the VDAC proteins and reconstitution was then carried out as above described for VDAC. Liposome blanks were prepared with 2 ml of buffer in the absence of protein. In order to demonstrate the association of VDAC proteins with the lipids, the proteoliposomes were centrifuged on a 32 to 5% (w/v) sucrose gradient with a 40% (w/v) sucrose cushion for 16 h at 35,000 rpm (Beckman L7, SW-60 rotor). The gradient was then fractionated from the bottom of the tube. Turbidity of each fraction was measured at 405 nm and protein was detected with the BCA assay (Pierce). Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer 1720 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector as described elsewhere (25Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The spectra were recorded at a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1 and 128 scans were averaged for each measurement. The internal reflection element was a germanium ATR plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm, Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with dry air. Spectra with polarized incident light and kinetics of hydrogen/deuteration exchange were measured on a Bruker IFS-55 spectrophotometer equipped with liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector and a polarizer mount assembly (KRS-5 polarizer). 20–30 μl of reconstituted protein were spread on one side of the ATR plate. The solvent was slowly evaporated under a continuous stream of nitrogen. So, 15–30 μg of protein were deposited on the ATR plate. The determination of protein secondary structure was based on the multivariate statistical analysis method for band shape recognition similar as previously reported (26Cabiaux V. Oberg K.A. Pancoska P. Walz T. Agre P. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 406-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This analysis used a commercially available partial least-square package to determine fractional secondary structure composition (PLSPlus 2.1 from Spectra Calc, Galactic Industries, Salem NH). A reference set (RaSP50) was generated by collecting ATR-FTIR spectra of 50 proteins with known x-ray structures selected to represent a wide range of α-helix and β-sheet compositions as well as 60 different protein domain folds. Before analysis, all spectra were normalized so that the PLS algorithm was forced to use band shapes of the amide I and amide II bands (between 1720 and 1500 cm−1) rather than absolute intensities. Cross-validation procedures using the RaSP50 protein spectra have shown RMS structure determination errors of ±4.5% for α-helix and ±6.3% for β-sheet. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy provides information on the orientation of the peptide secondary structure embedded in the hydrated lipid film where the lipid acyl chains are oriented perpendicular to the surface of the ATR plate (27Fringeli U.P. Gunthard H.H. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 31: 270-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The protein spectra were recorded with parallel and perpendicular polarized light with respect to the plane of incidence, averaging 512 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. To determine the dichroic ratio of the different secondary structure components, the amide I band (1700 to 1600 cm−1) was decomposed by a least-square curve-fitting procedure using a Cauchy (Lorenzian/Gaussian) function as described previously (25Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The integrated areas corresponding to the β-sheet components (near 1630 cm−1) were determined, and the ratio of the integrated areas from the two polarized spectra then yielded the dichroic ratio of the β-sheet, RβATR. The same procedure was employed to determine the dichroic ratio, RαATR, of the α-helix component (at ∼1655 cm−1). The dichroic ratio of the amide II band was determined from the ratio of the integrated areas between 1590 and 1505 cm−1 from the two polarized spectra. The dichroic ratio of the lipid ν(C=O), called below RATRiso, was obtained from the parallel and perpendicular polarized spectra. RATRiso was used to compute the film thickness and the values of the electric field componentsEX, EY, and EZat 1631 cm−1 as described previously (28Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). For these calculations refractive indexes of 4.0 and 1.44 were used for the Ge-plate and the sample film, respectively. In a β-sheet the amide I transition dipole moment is oriented parallel to the C=O bond which is oriented perpendicular to the β-strand axis. The N-H bending contributes mainly to the amide II transition dipole, which is oriented parallel to the strand axis. Because two symmetry axes are needed to describe the sheet orientation, the combination of the dichroic ratios from both amide I and amide II bands are required to determine the orientation of the anti-parallel β-strands. In a barrel structure, axial symmetry around the barrel symmetry axis can be partially obtained (29Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2710-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Marsh D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The orientation of the β-strands was calculated according to Marsh (30Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Marsh D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Deuteration kinetics were carried out as described previously (32Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sonveaux N. Shapiro A.B. Goormaghtigh E. Ling V. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A computer program controlled the kinetic measurements. Prior to each experiment 10 spectra were recorded to verify the stability and the reproducibility of the system. At time 0 the sample was flushed with D2O-saturated N2 at a flow rate of 4 liters/min. For each spectrum 24 scans were accumulated at a resolution of 2 cm−1. Background and water vapor spectra were subtracted from the kinetic spectra as reported (32Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The areas of the amide I and amide II bands were calculated by integration of the spectra between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 and 1590 and 1505 cm−1, respectively. The area of the amide II band decreases as deuteration of the protein proceeds. To take into account variations of the overall spectral intensities related to film swelling upon hydration in the first minutes of the measurement, the amide II/amide I ratio was determined for each spectrum. Thus, the H/D exchange was monitored as the evolution of the ratio of amide II/amide I areas, expressed as percent of non-exchanged amide protons. The amide II/amide I ratios of the non-deuterated spectra were taken as 100%, whereas the 0% value corresponds to a zero absorption in the amide II region (34de Jongh H.H. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We observed in our experiments a considerable absorbance of the lipids in the amide I and amide II region that overlapped the protein spectra. To obtain the pure protein spectra, the spectra of H/D exchange kinetic of a liposome blank were recorded under identical conditions. A computer program subtracted the spectra of a liposome blank from each corresponding sample spectrum. To account for varying absorbance intensities in sample and lipid spectra, a subtraction coefficient was used to cancel the lipid ν(C=O) area integrated between 1705 and 1770 cm−1. As a modification to the previously reported protocol (22Abrecht H. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M. Homblé F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), purification of the two VDAC isoforms was achieved in a single purification step. Mitochondria were isolated from the cotyledons of 24-h imbibed kidney beans (P. vulgaris) seeds and solubilized with 2% (v/v) Genapol X-080 and 4 murea. The solubilized proteins were loaded on and eluted from a chromatofocusing column using a pH gradient from pH 9.4 to 7.0. Fig. 1 shows a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel with the two individual VDAC proteins which were separated and purified by chromatofocusing chromatography (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and3). The two isoforms are called VDAC 31 and VDAC 32 according to their respective apparent molecular mass. SDS gels loaded with high amounts of protein (10–20 μg) confirm the high purity of the protein preparation (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4). The staining intensities reflect the abundance of each isoform in the seed mitochondria (22Abrecht H. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M. Homblé F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The purified VDAC isoforms were reconstituted in asolectin supplemented with 5% (w/w) stigmasterol. The detergent was removed from the mixed lipid-detergent-protein micelles by adsorption on Bio-Beads to promote the formation of proteoliposomes. Formation of proteoliposomes was demonstrated by the co-migration of lipids and proteins during a sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2). No protein aggregates were detected at the bottom of the tube. Fig. 2 shows the distribution pattern for the VDAC 31, VDAC 32, and bacterial OmpF porin. One population of proteoliposomes was obtained with each protein, indicating a quite homogenous distribution of protein within the liposomes. The functional channel properties of the reconstituted VDAC isoforms were quite similar to those reported for other VDACs (22Abrecht H. Wattiez R. Ruysschaert J.M. Homblé F. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We compared the IR spectra of the reconstituted VDAC isoforms with the IR spectrum of the bacterial porin OmpF for which a high-resolution crystal structure is available (Fig. 3 A). Fourier deconvolution of the spectra allows a more detailed analysis of the spectral composition (Fig. 3 B). Spectra of VDAC 31 and VDAC 32 are almost identical in the region of the amide I band between 1700 and 1600 cm−1. The amide I bands are characterized by a major component located around 1631 cm−1 which can be assigned to β-sheet. The position of the major component at 1631 cm−1 and a weak component at about 1694 cm−1in the amide I region, together with the major amide II band at 1535 cm−1, indicate that the β-strands are in an anti-parallel configuration (35Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 329-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The shape of the amide I bands of the two VDAC isoforms are very similar to that of the OmpF porin, suggesting a similar secondary structure composition. The IR spectrum of the OmpF is virtually identical to that previously reported (36Kleffel B. Garavito R.M. Baumeister W. Rosenbusch J.P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 37Nabedryk E. Garavito R.M. Breton J. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 671-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The secondary structure content of the VDAC isoforms and of the OmpF is reported in Table I. The secondary structure of all three proteins is very similar. It must be noted here that the variations observed are in the range of the error made in evaluating the secondary structure. The secondary structure determined here for OmpF closely matches the crystal structure (TableI) (21Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P.

Open table in a new tab Quantitative determination of the secondary structure content was based on spectral band shape recognition using the FTIR spectra of 50 known proteins as the reference set. The values in parentheses are deduced from the OmpF crystal structure. The ATR-FTIR spectroscopy technique provides information about the orientation of proteins inserted in a lipid bilayer. Protein spectra were recorded with parallel and perpendicular polarized incident light (Fig. 4 A). The dichroic spectra (i.e. parallel minus perpendicular polarized spectrum) of the two VDAC isoforms and of the OmpF are illustrated in Fig. 4 B. The three spectra show a positive dichroism signal for the main component of the amide I band at ∼1630 cm−1 and a positive deviation of the amide II band indicating that the β-sheet structure has a preferred orientation. A similar dichroic spectrum of porin has been reported previously (37Nabedryk E. Garavito R.M. Breton J. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 671-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine the orientation of the β-strands, the amide I band was decomposed into its different components by a least-square curve-fitting procedure to obtain the dichroic ratio RβATR of the β-sheet component. For a quantitative determination of the β-strand orientation, the dichroic ratios of both the amide I band (here RβATR) and the amide II band have to be determined because the transition dipole moment of β-strands does not exhibit uni-axial symmetry (29Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2710-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The orientation ΘI of the amide I transition dipole moment with respect to normal to the membrane is related to the strand tilt, β, by ΘI = (π/2) − β. For the amide II transition dipole moment, which is oriented parallel to the strand axis, ΘII = β. For a regular β-barrel, the transition dipole moments are distributed with axial symmetry around the barrel axis and the orientation of the transition dipole moments is related to the dichroic ratios RATR by,〈P2(cosΘ)〉=EX2−EY2×RATR+EZ2〈P2(cos α)〉(EX2−EY2×RATR−2EZ2)Equation 1 where P2(x) = (1/2)(3x 2 − 1) is a second order Legendre polynomial and α is the orientation of the barrel axis relative to the membrane normal (30Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 354-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Marsh D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This equation can be written for either the amide I band or the amide II band, so that two equations are obtained to calculate the order parameters. Ex,Ey, and Ez, are the amplitudes of the electric field in a coordinate system, where z is perpendicular to the ATR plate surface, x and yare in the ATR-plate plane with x in the incidence plane andy perpendicular to the incidence plane. The values of Ex, Ey, and Ez were computed considering the real film thickness (see “Experimental Procedures”). The tilt angle, β, was calculated from the experimental dichroic ratios of both the amide I ( RβATR) and the amide II bands using Equation 1. The β-strands in all three proteins are tilted at a very similar angle of ∼45° to 47° relative to the barrel axis (Table II). A value of 45° for the strand tilt in OmpF is in good agreement with the mean strand orientation deduced from the crystal structure (21Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 31Marsh D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The order parameter corresponding to the α angle is similar for the two VDAC isoforms (〈P2(cosα)〉 = 0.36 and 0.45 for VDAC 31 and VDAC 32, respectively) but is significantly smaller than for OmpF 〈P2(cosα)〉 = 0.66). This point will be discussed later. The value for OmpF agrees well with data reported by Marsh (31Marsh D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The contribution of the α-helical component of the amide I band was too low (∼10%) to have enough accuracy to calculate the orientation of the α-helix.Table IIOrientation of the β-strands in VDAC and OmpFProteinRβATRRamide IIATRβVDAC 311.84 (± 0.04)1.76 (± 0.05)47 (± 1.2)VDAC 321.94 (± 0.07)1.89 (± 0.05)46 (± 0.3)OmpF1.73 (± 0.12)1.72 (± 0.14)45 (± 0.25)The dichroic ratio of the β-sheet component of the amide I band and the dichroic ratio of the amide II band were determined from parallel and perpendicular polarized ATR-FTIR spectra of the different proteins in films of asolectin + 5% stigmasterol.

For receptor ECDs, models have been constructed based on the crystal structure of porcine ribonuclease inhibitor (pRI), the first structurally defined member of the LRR family (10Kobe B.

Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar); according to pRI homology modeling, receptor ECDs would form a partial horseshoe-like structure generated by a succession of α helices and β sheets (12Kajava, A. V., Vassart, G., and Wodack, S. J.Structure3, 867–877Google Scholar, 13Jiang X. Dreano N. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. El Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although excluding the two N- and C-terminal cystein-rich clusters, the model allows hormone docking inside the horseshoe inner circumference formed by the parallel β sheets (14El Tayar N. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 125: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, more than ten years after cloning of their cDNAs, little information on the precise topology of the glycoprotein hormone receptors is available. Expression have been reported in several recombinant systems, as membrane full-length, free ECDs or as membrane-anchored ECDs attached through fusion with a single transmembrane domain or with glycophosphatidyl inositide (15Pajot-Augy E.

However, high expression of a functional receptor in any form has never been reported; this is mainly because of intrinsic properties of this receptor family, which render their production as recombinant functional proteins difficult and resulted in the production of mostly unfolded species trapped intracellularly (18Vu Hai M.T. Jolivet A. Salesse R. Bidart J.M. Houllier A. Guiochon-Mantel A. Garnier J. Jallal B. Milgrom E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,19Bozon V. Remy J.J. Pajot-Augy E. Couture L. Biache G. Severini M. Salesse R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ECDs can indeed be secreted in culture media in an active form when expressed at lower levels, though in highly unstable forms, sensitive to proteolytic degradation. However, when hCG subunits have been coexpressed with a complete receptor within eucaryotic cells, constitutive receptor activation without addition of exogenous hormone was observed (20Remy J.J. Bozon V. Couture L. Goxe B. Salesse R. Garnier J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas hormone coexpressed with receptor ECD leads to secretion of a stable and soluble complex (21Pantel J. Remy J.J. Salesse R. Jolivet A. Bidart J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When present during receptor synthesis, the ligand seems to help folding and further stabilized and protected receptor from hydrophobic aggregation, denaturation, and proteolytic attacks. Hormone-ECD receptor coexpression could therefore be used as a strategy for obtaining soluble and secreted complex stable enough to allow biochemical purification, structural analysis, and crystallization. In this paper, we demonstrate high expression (potentially 20 mg/liter) of a secreted form of a complex formed by hCG and its receptor extracellular domain by a stably cotransfected CHO cell line. Biochemical analysis of the immunopurified complex suggests that it exists as a unique 85-kDa assembly, corresponding, as confirmed by surface plasmon resonance, to a 1:1 hormone-receptor stoichiometry. Spectroscopic analysis by circular dichroism performed on the complex indicates that receptor-ECD contributed for more than 25% α helices, consistent with the predicted 3D models based on the crystal structure of the porcine ribonuclease inhibitor. A cDNA fragment encoding the first N-terminal 277 amino acids of the porcine LH receptor (pLHR; see Ref. 22Loosfelt H. Misrahi M. Atger M. Salesse R. Vu Hai M.T. Jolivet A. Guiochon-Mantel A. Sar S. Jallal B. Garnier J. Milgrom E. Science. 1989; 245: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using primer B (5′-GCTCTAGAATGAGACGGCGGTCCCTGG-3′) and primer S (5′-GGGTACCTGGGGTAAGTCAATGTGGC-3′), bearing a XbaI and a KpnI site, respectively. To add six histidines and a stop codon after serine 277 of the pLHR, two complementary oligonucleotides (5′-CATCATCATCATCATCATTAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGTAC-3′) were annealed and ligated into the PUC-18 vector opened by KpnI and EcoRI. The resulting plasmid was then restricted by XbaI andKpnI into which the pLHR XbaI-KpnI polymerase chain reaction fragment obtained by amplification with primers B and S was ligated. This construct was entirely sequenced, and the XbaI-EcoRI fragment encoding pLHR 1–277-polyHis was subcloned into the amplifiable glutamine synthetase/cytomegalovirus expression vector pEE14 from Celltech (23Cockett M.I. Bebbington C.R. Yarranton G.T. Biotechnology. 1990; 8: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This plasmid was used to transfect a CHO cell line secreting a high level of hCG (a kind gift from Dr. E. Bos, Organon, The Netherlands) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfectants were submitted to increasing concentration of methionine sulfoximine in glutamine-free GMEM medium containing dialyzed fetal calf serum. CHO-CGR cell clones showing resistance to 25 mm methionine sulfoximine were grown and tested individually for secretion of hormone-receptor complex in supernatants. The best producing CHO-CGR clone was further cultivated in selective medium, using regular culture flasks (Falcon) or “concentrating” flasks (INTEGRA CELLine, Integra BioSciences). Three different anti-hCG and two different anti-receptor monoclonals were used according to the different assays. For hormone detection or immobilization, mAb FBT10, whose determinant on the hCG β subunit (loop I and loop III) is accessible in free or receptor-bound hormone (24Bidart J.M. Troalen F. Bohuon C.J. Hennen G. Bellet D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15483-15489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mAb LH05, which recognizes only dimeric (determinants were identified on β subunit loop II and α subunit loop III) hormone (25Robert P. Troalen F. Bellet D. Bousfield G.R. Bidart J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocr. 1994; 101: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and mAb D1E8, directed against the C-terminal peptide of hCG β subunit. To identify or capture the receptor, we used mAb LHR38 and mAb LHR75, both selected against the testis-purified porcine LH/hCG receptor (18Vu Hai M.T. Jolivet A. Salesse R. Bidart J.M. Houllier A. Guiochon-Mantel A. Garnier J. Jallal B. Milgrom E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two-site sandwich monoclonal immunoradiometric assays (IRMA) for hCG and for soluble hCG-receptor complexes have been previously established (21Pantel J. Remy J.J. Salesse R. Jolivet A. Bidart J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); polystyrene beads (Precision Plastic Ball) were coated with the capture monoclonal antibodies anti-hormone LH05 or anti-receptor LHR38 by incubation overnight at 20 °C with mAb concentrations of 4 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. After washing with water, coated beads were used to capture antigens in the different analyzed fractions. Incubation of beads and antigens together in 50% calf serum for 2 h at room temperature was sufficient for their association. After washing in phosphate buffer, beads (LH05 or LHR38) were incubated with 100,000 cpm of125I-labeled FBT10 for 1 h in 50% calf serum at 37 °C. Beads were then washed, and the associated radioactivity was counted. Purified LHR38 antibody was dialyzed against coupling buffer (0.2 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) and loaded on a HiTrap N-hydroxy-succinimide-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After three serial washes with a deactivating buffer (0.5 m ethanolamine, 0.5m NaCl, pH 8.3) followed by an acidic buffer (0.1m acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4), the gel was equilibrated and stored in GMEM medium at neutral pH containing 0.4% sodium azide. CHO-CGR cell supernatants were applied at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After extensive washing with 100 column volumes of phosphate buffer (8 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mmNaH2PO4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, bound material was eluted in 0.5-ml fractions with two column volumes of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3, and immediately neutralized by one-third volume of 1m Tris, pH 8.5. Fractions containing the complex were concentrated using Centricon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and dialyzed before further analysis. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with or without boiling and reduction by 2β-mercaptoethanol and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybound C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were then blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 4% nonfat dry milk (Régilait, Lyon, France) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer in the presence of 4 mg/ml primary mAbs, D1E8 for the hormone, LHR775 for the receptor. After being washed, blots were incubated in the same buffer at 20 °C for 1 h with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin conjugated to peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An enhance chemoluminescent substrate (Pierce) for detection of peroxydase was then used for visualization of the mAb-recognized bands. Gel filtration chromatography of CHO-CGR-secreted products was performed by the use of a Superose 12 column, calibrated with standard protein markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Serum-free supernatants were concentrated approximately 20 times using Amicon 30 and dialyzed against 15 mm NH4HCO3 and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0, or against 100 mmTris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Concentrated material (0.5 ml) was deposited on the column equilibrated with the same buffer. Chromatography was run at 0.5 ml/min. After collection, 0.5-ml fractions were analyzed by complex-specific IRMA and immunoblotting. Covalent cross-linking of the immunopurified complex was done as follows: concentrated proteins to 0.5 mg/ml were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde (5, 10, or 20 mm) at 26 °C for 30 min. Cross-linked products were then analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a Biacore 1000 according to described procedures (26Johnsson B. Lofass S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 27Helman D. Staten N.R. Grosclaude J. Daniel N. Nespoulous C. Djiane J. Getler A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16067-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG-purified immunoglobulins (RAM) were covalently linked to the matrix gel and then capture antibodies, at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in HBS buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl), were injected (flow rate, 5 ml/min for 5 min). RAM capture ability was then saturated with a 10-min injection of non-relevant purified mice immunoglobulins to prevent further direct installation of any injected monoclonal (IgBlock, designated IgB). The complex was injected either as a cell supernatant or after immunopurification and captured by its hormone or receptor side, depending of the first monoclonal injected. Potential receptor or hormone homologous dimers (H-H or R-R) were assessed by a second injection of the capture antibody; a null signal was indicative of absence of these forms. Symmetrically, an injection of detection antibody against the counterpart antigen within the complex allowed us to confirm stoichiometry. Alternatively, once the complex was installed until saturation of the capture antibody ability, a second injection of the complex allowed us to check any further association into the complex of unbound components or formation of higher order complexes. Resonance unit levels are compared before and after each injection (asterisks), measuring the mass of material immobilized or captured. Intrinsic refractive index of each solution relative to the HBS buffer accounts for the sudden ups and downs in the sensorgrams and does not affect the resonance unit levels registered after the end of injection. After each run, matrix-bound RAM was regenerated by a pulse of 100 mm HCl taking off all bound immunoglobulins. For circular dichroic analysis, the protein concentrations were determined in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, using extinction coefficients of 11745 and 22330 m−1cm−1 for hCG and hCG-receptor complex at 276 nm, respectively, and calculated according to published procedures (28Pace C.N. Vajdas F. Fee L. Grimslev G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 11: 2411-2423Crossref Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). Protein samples (1 mg/ml) were then placed in a 0.01-cm path-length cell. CD spectra were recorded and analyzed according to the method of Yang et al. (29Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar) as described previously in (30Huet J.C. Nespoulous C. Pernollet J.C. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Anti-hormone and anti-receptor antibodies were used according to their specificity and previously known properties toward their respective antigens. LH05 and LHR38 were used as “capture” antibodies, and D1E8 and LHR775 were used for immunodetection on blots, whereas FBT10, as it can bind LH05-captured hCG or LHR38-captured complex, was used mostly as second antibody in free hormone and in complex sandwich assays. The concentration of hCG in medium was deduced from standard curves using purified hCG as antigen into the sandwich assay LH05/FBT10, whereas the concentration of receptor bound to hCG (soluble complex) was evaluated by the use of an anti-receptor antibody followed by the same iodinated anti-hormone antibody (sandwich assay LHR38/FBT10). Fig.1 A shows that the LH05/FBT10 IRMA assay can detect amounts of purified standard hGC lower than 1 ng/ml, whereas the LHR38/FBT10 IRMA assay did not detect free hormone up to 2 mg/ml. This assay therefore can be considered as highly specific for the soluble hCG-receptor complex. As shown by Fig.1 B, both assays indicated that the complexed hormone represented about 10% of total hormone in supernatants (medium dilutions for complex assay was ten times less than for hCG assay) at any time during cell growth. From Fig. 1, A andB, final concentrations of hCG-receptor complex in regular flask monolayer culture conditions have been estimated to 2 mg/liter, (for an amount of 20 mg/liter of free hormone) at 100% cell confluence. Free hCG and complex accumulated in medium even after cells reached confluence, so that supernatants were harvested only once a week. To facilitate purification, numerous attempts to decrease serum levels or to use serum-free synthetic media were made; without cell-growth rate alteration, all modifications of media resulted in a loss of product secretion. Several culture conditions (suspension cultures or hollow fibers) were also tested; higher yields of secreted complex (up to ten times monolayers yields) were only obtained by the use of cell line flasks. Cell supernatants from no-serum cultures were concentrated after dialysis against buffers of different ionic strength and deposited on Sepharose 12 column equilibrated with the same buffers; fractions were analyzed by the complex-specific LHR38/FBT10 assay. When chromatography was done in 100 mmTris, 50 mm NaCl buffer, most of the IRMA-positive material eluted as one specie at a molecular mass between monomeric bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) and alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa) markers, indicating little or no dissociation (Fig.2 A). By contrast, as shown on Fig. 2 B, at lower ionic strength (15 mmNH4HCO3), positive fractions were found in two peaks of molecular masses encompassing the bovine serum albumin marker. The low molecular mass species might be the result of partial dissociation of the complex resulting in free hCG and free receptor-ECD yet are reversible, because these fractions were also positive in the complex-specific IRMA assay. According to the expected molecular size of hCG-ECD complex (85 kDa), the absence of any higher molecular mass species in non-dissociating conditions suggests that no high order multimeric associations between hormone and receptor did occur. Immunoblotting analysis of the 85–90-kDa peak fractions in denaturing conditions (Fig. 2 C) with antibody LHR775 revealed the presence of a receptor-ECD specie of the expected molecular mass at 35 kDa. Receptor ECD was fused to a poly-His tag in C-terminal, to allow metal ion chromatography purification; although nickel or copper columns did actually retain the complex, interaction between metal ions and receptor appeared too weak for purification, because elution occurred as soon as 50 mm imidazole was applied to the gels (not shown). Immunoaffinity purification of the complex with immobilized anti-receptor LHR38 mAb was therefore undertaken; fractions eluted by acidic pH were analyzed by the complex-specific IRMA assay (Fig.3). The presence of receptor ECD at 35 kDa in the IRMA-positive fractions was confirmed on blotted proteins after denaturing SDS-PAGE separation, using the anti-receptor antibody LHR775, as shown on Fig. 3. Protein contents in immunopurified fractions were further analyzed with different monoclonals; although LHR775 revealed the presence of ECD receptor at 35 kDa, D1E8 labeled the dimeric αβ-hCG at 55 kDa when proteins were separated in non-reducing conditions. This result indicated that SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis indeed dissociated receptor-ECD from hCG but not the two hormone subunits. After reduction with 2% β-mercaptoethanol, the molecular mass of receptor did not change (LHR775 band), whereas hormone did dissociate, as D1E8 now revealed free β-hCG subunit (Fig.4, immunoblotting). Immunoblotting analysis was confirmed by direct visualization of the eluted proteins from LHR38 affinity column by silver staining of the gels; only two bands of 35 and 50–55 kDa, respectively, were seen in non-reducing conditions, receptor ECD, and dimeric hCG, respectively, whereas the 50–55-kDa band, once reduced, dissociated into two 32- and 20-kDa bands, corresponding to the apparent molecular masses of free β and α subunits of hCG, respectively (Fig. 4, silver staining). Silver staining also indicated that a high degree of purification has been achieved in a single immunoaffinity step. The immunopurified complex was submitted to covalent cross-linking with different concentrations of glutaraldehyde; whatever the concentration of cross-linker used, complex IRMA counts were constant, indicating no complex dissociation (not shown). Electrophoresis in reducing conditions followed by silver staining of the covalently bound proteins revealed a new protein band at 85 kDa, which could correspond to the hormone-receptor complex. The relative proportion of the 85-kDa protein increased with linker concentration (Fig.5). Other bands generated during cross-linking migrated at 45 and 65 kDa and could represent ECD receptor covalently bound to either hCG subunits, as already suggested in Ref. 31Hong S.H. Ji I.H. Ji T.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1285-1294PubMed Google Scholar. Although biochemical characterization of the complex suggested a 1:1 stoichiometry between hormone and receptor, more questions regarding the complex stability and hormone-receptor (H-R) interactions have been addressed through surface plasmon resonance. They confirmed that all three monoclonals, LHR38, LH05, and FBT10, once bound to immobilized rabbit anti-mouse antibody, displayed capture abilities for the complex, either by the receptor or by the hormone side (not shown). As already shown, anti-receptor LHR38 and anti-hormone LH05 and FBT10 were not competitors for the complex, whereas FBT10 and LH05 were not competitors for free hCG nor for receptor-bound hCG (not shown). Once bound to LHR38, the hormone-receptor complex was not able to bind free hormone anymore, suggesting the absence of free soluble receptor in samples. The possibility of having R-R, R-H-R, or R-H-H-R species was also eliminated, because the LHR38-bound complex was unable to bind more LHR38 or more complex, as shown by analysis of the first sequence of injections shown on Fig. 6. The symmetrical situation, where the complex was bound by the anti-hormone antibodies, was then analyzed; no further binding of complex (eliminating the formation of H-R-H, H-R-R, or H-R-H-R species) and no further binding of free hormone (no formation of H-R-H or H-H) were observed, as shown for the second sequence of injections in Fig.6. Moreover, free hCG bound to FBT10 was never able to bind the complex, confirming a high stability of hormone-receptor interactions and the absence of an H-R-H specie (not shown). Altogether, Biacore experiments strongly suggest the existence of only one stably associated 1:1 hormone-receptor complex. Fig. 7shows the CD spectrum of the hCG-ectodomain complex in 10 mm phosphate buffer. The shape of the spectrum, with a maximum at 191 and a minimum at 210 nm, clearly indicated the presence of α helices and β sheets in the hormone-receptor complex. The deconvolution of the measured spectrum revealed instead 17 ± 2% of α helix and 33 ± 11% β sheet. The hCG hormone is known to be mostly composed of β sheet (4Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 5Wu H. Lustbader J.W. Liu Y. Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and contributes to 47% of the complex-calculated molecular weight. If one assumed that hCG does not undergo sizeable conformational changes upon binding to the receptor, the calculated α helix proportion in the complex CD spectrum was likely because of the receptor. Therefore, after deduction of the hormone contribution from complex secondary structure values, the ECD receptor structural contribution could be estimated between 25 and 30% of α helices and between 30 and 35% of β sheets. Despite the fundamental physiological functions displayed by the gonadotropin hormones LH-hCG and follicle-stimulating hormone for the control of steroid production and gametes synthesis, the design of agonists or antagonists, although of obvious interest for clinical use in fertility control (32Simoni M. Gromoll J. Nieschlag E. Steroids. 1998; 63: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), has never been achieved. Because of the very high complexity of hormone and receptor structures, gonadotropin pharmacology will probably never be possible without spatial knowledge of hormone-receptor interactions. Gonadotropin receptors are amphipathic seven transmembrane proteins for which no crystallization strategy seems available yet. Fortunately, 3D structure of a soluble form of these receptors might bring the most important structure-function and docking information, because extracellular domains bear nearly all hormone-receptor contact sites. In this paper, we were able to demonstrate for the first time a quantitative production of a purifiable extracellular domain of one of the members of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family. Transfection of a cell line overproducing the human chorionogonadotropin hormone with a plasmid encoding the extracellular domain of its receptor resulted in secretion in medium of a mixture of 9/10 free and 1/10 receptor-bound hormone, as measured by quantitative immunoradiometric assays. This soluble form of hormone-receptor complex did accumulate in media, and the free/bound hormone ratio found a constant over time. Previous attempts of high yield receptor-ECD secretion by different eucaryotic cell types always failed because of important intracellular retention and fast proteolytic degradation in media. By contrast, soluble hormone-receptor complexes were indeed secreted in cell culture media and displayed very high stability even after a year of storage at 4 °C (not shown). Moreover, from producing cell supernatants (potentially 20 mg per liter), complex was purified at high yield to near homogeneity by one affinity chromatography step with the anti-receptor monoclonal LHR38. Extracellular domains of glycoprotein hormone receptors are structurally related to the LRR protein family, a group of proteins involved in a variety of functions through molecular interactions. The pRI has been the first LRR protein whose 3D structure was solved; it displays an overall horseshoe shape able to accommodate ribonuclease within its central hole. Each repeat of 25 to 28 amino acids contributes to a structural brick made of a β strand and an α helix connected by a loop. Sixteen of such elements with β strand forming the inner and α helices the outer circumference of the horseshoe forms the overall structure. Several models have been built up based on this template for gonadoreceptors (12Kajava, A. V., Vassart, G., and Wodack, S. J.Structure3, 867–877Google Scholar, 13Jiang X. Dreano N. Buckler D.R.

Endocrinol. 1996; 125: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such models must however be taken with some caution, because pertactin, another member of the LRR family, displays a triangular prism structure only made of β strands (33Emsley P. Charles I.G. Fairweather N.F. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). LRR proteins therefore could adopt very different overall topologies. Experiments displayed in this paper allowed us to obtain for the first time some structural information about one member of the glycoprotein hormone receptor family; circular dichroism analysis suggested the presence of more than 25% α helices in the soluble hormone-receptor ECD complex, and this might be more in favor of a pRI-like structure than an only β strand structure for the hCG/LH receptor N-terminal domain. A few number of G-protein-coupled receptors have been shown to be able to form homologous or heterologous dimers (34Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar); although cooperative binding of glycoprotein hormones might be possible, receptor dimerization has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, multimers of higher order than one hormone for one receptor were never observed either by non-denaturing size separation chromatography or by surface plasmon resonance studies with well defined monoclonals. The possibility of multimerization cannot however be excluded for larger forms of ECDs (containing the C-terminal cysteine clusters) or for the membrane receptors. According to the data presented here, mass production of ectodomain-ligand complexes seems to be a realistic strategy if one aims at structural study of glycoprotein hormone receptors, as it has been shown for other receptors (36Banner D.W.

Biochemical characterization suggested that CHO-CGR produced a soluble and stable complex that can be easily purified to homogeneity and seems to behave as a unique monodisperse protein entity. This strategy might therefore meet all quantitative and qualitative requirements for biophysical studies and can be implemented to aim at solving a glycoprotein hormone-receptor complex 3D structure.

https://openalex.org/W2156096932,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaePrp19p protein is an essential splicing factor and a spliceosomal component. It is not tightly associated with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) but is associated with a protein complex consisting of at least eight proteins. We have identified two novel components of the Prp19p-associated complex, Ntc30p and Ntc20p. Like other identified components of the complex, both Ntc30p and Ntc20p are associated with the spliceosome in the same manner as Prp19p immediately after or concurrently with dissociation of U4, indicating that the entire complex may bind to the spliceosome as an intact form. Neither Ntc30p nor Ntc20p directly interacts with Prp19p, but both interact with another component of the complex, Ntc85p. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed an ordered interactions of these components in formation of the Prp19p-associated complex. Although null mutants of NTC30 or NTC20 showed no obvious growth phenotype, deletion of both genes impaired yeast growth resulting in accumulation of precursor mRNA. Extracts prepared from such a strain were defective in pre-mRNA splicing in vitro, but the splicing activity could be restored upon addition of the purified Prp19p-associated complex. These results indicate that Ntc30p and Ntc20p are auxiliary splicing factors the functions of which may be modulating the function of the Prp19p-associated complex.

Spliceosome assembly is a multistep process that involves sequential binding of snRNAs to the pre-mRNA in an order of U1, U2, then U4/U6 and U5 as a preformed tri-snRNP particle. A subsequent conformational rearrangement results in dissociation of U1 and U4, accompanied by new base pair formation between U2 and U6 and between U6 and the 5′ splice site, leading to the formation of the active spliceosome on which the catalytic reactions take place. Functional studies of snRNAs have revealed their important roles in recognition and alignment of splice sites mediated through base pair interactions between snRNAs and the intron sequences during spliceosome assembly. Although numerous protein splicing factors have been identified, their functional roles are not well understood. The DEx(D/H) box proteins are among the best characterized protein factors and have been shown RNA unwindase activity (6Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 7Wang Y. Wagner J.D.O. Guthrie C. Curr.

It is generally believed that these proteins play essential roles in modulating structural change of the spliceosome during spliceosome assembly by either unwinding RNA base pairing or by hydrolyzing ATP to provide energy required for conformational rearrangement (6Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In addition, a U5 protein with strong sequence similarity to ribosomal translocase EF-2 was demonstrated to have GTP binding activity and implicated in the structural rearrangement of RNA (11Fabrizio P. Laggerbauer B. Lauber J. Lane W.S. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1997; 13: 4092-4106Crossref Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prp19p protein is an essential splicing factor and is associated with a protein complex consisting of at least eight protein components (12Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Prp19p is not tightly associated with snRNAs but is associated with the spliceosome immediately following or concurrent with dissociation of U4 from the spliceosome, suggesting a possible role in mediating conformational rearrangement or stabilizing the rearranged structure of the spliceosome during U4 dissociation (13Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two components of the Prp19p-associated complex have been identified. Ntc85p was identified by sequencing the components of the affinity purified complex (Ntc stands for PRP nineteencomplex) (14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I. Jan S.-P. Kuo N.-Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Cheng S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9455-9462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is essential for pre-mRNA splicing and may play a role in promoting binding of the Prp19p-associated complex to the spliceosome. Snt309p was identified by screening synthetic lethal mutants to the prp19 mutation (Snt stands for synthetic lethal to PRPnineteen) (15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the SNT309gene is not required for yeast growth, Snt309p, through interaction with Prp19p, plays an important role in modulating interactions of Prp19p with other associated components to stabilize the Prp19p-associated complex (16Chen H.-R. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Tsai W.-Y. Her L.-S. Hsu M.-T. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both proteins are associated with the spliceosome immediately after or simultaneously with dissociation of U4. We report here the identification of genes complementing synthetic lethal mutants snt304 and snt384. We show that these two genes encode two other components of the Prp19p-associated complex, Ntc30p and Ntc20p, respectively. Both Ntc30p and Ntc20p are also associated with the spliceosome in the same manner as Prp19p, indicating that the entire complex may bind to the spliceosome as an intact unit.

The construction of plasmids was as follows. pCC30: the 4-kb ScaI DNA fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of plasmid vector pRS416. pCC31: the 1-kb DNA fragment containing the NTC30 open reading frame (ORF) and a 300-bp downstream sequence retrieved from the yeast genome by PCR using primers 30-3 and 30-4 was digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid vector pGEM-1. pCC311: the 1-kb BamHI fragment from pCC31 was inserted into plasmid vector pEG202. pCC312: the 1-kb BamHI fragment from pCC31 was inserted into plasmid vector pACT2. pCC301: the PCR product with primers 30-1 and 30-2 using pCC30 as a template was digested with NruI and then self-ligated. pCC302: the 1.8-kb fragment containing the His3 gene was end-repaired and inserted into the NruI site of pCC301. pWT20: the 1.2-kb DNA fragment containing the NTC20 ORF and 400-bp upstream and 450-bp downstream sequences retrieved from the yeast genome by PCR with oligonucleotides 20-1 and 20-2 was ligated with the EcoRI- and BamHI-digested pRS416. pWT21: the 870-bp DNA fragment containing the NTC20 ORF and 450-bp downstream sequence retrieved from the yeast genome by PCR with oligonucleotides 20-2 and 20-3 was digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid vector pGEM-1. pWT201: the 170-bp SacI-XhoI fragment with the NTC20 gene was replaced with the 2-kb LEU2fragment. pWT211: the 870-bp BamHI DNA fragment from pWT21 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid vector pEG202. pWT212: the 870-bp BamHI DNA fragment from pWT21 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid vector pACT2. The SNT304 and SNT384 genes were isolated by complementation of the synthetic lethal phenotype of the snt304 and snt384 mutants with a YCp50-based Sau3A genomic library obtained from M. Rose and P. Novick as described (15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ends of the isolated DNA fragments were sequenced and compared with the yeast genome data base to identify the regions of the fragments in the genome. DNA fragments containing speculated ORFs were then subcloned for complementation analysis. The ntc30::HIS3 allele was created by replacing the entire ORF of NTC30 with a 1.8-kb DNA fragment of the His3 gene. The ORF was deleted by reverse PCR with primers 30-1 and 30-2 using plasmid pCC30 as a template. The resulting plasmid pCC301 was digested with NruI and ligated with a blunt-ended 1.8-kb HIS3 fragment. This action yielded plasmid pCC302, which was digested with XbaI and XhoI to isolate the ntc30::HIS3 fragment for transformation into a diploid strain SEY6210.5. Correct integration was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The ntc20::LEU2 was created by replacing the SacI-XhoI fragment of plasmid pWT20 with a 2-kb DNA fragment of the LEU2 gene. The resulting plasmid pWT201 was digested with EcoRI and BamHI to isolate the ntc20::LEU2 fragment for transformation into SEY6210.5. Haploid strains harboring disrupted NTC30 or NTC20 genes were isolated by sporulation of the heterozygous dipolid strains followed by dissection of tetrads. Splicing assays were performed according to Lin et al. (17Lin R.-J. Newman A.J. Cheng S.-C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14780-14792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using uncapped actin pre-mRNA as the substrate. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described by Tarn et al. (18Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total yeast RNA was isolated as described by Vijayraghavan et al. (19Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). RNA was electrophoresed in 5% polyacrylamide-8M urea gels and then electroblotted onto GeneScreen membranes in 25 mmNaPO4 (pH 6.5) at 4 °C overnight. Northern hybridization was performed according to Vijayraghavan et al. (19Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) using the CRY1 gene as a probe. The NTC30, NTC20, NTC85, PRP19, and SNT309 genes were fused to the LexA-DNA binding domain in plasmid pEG202 and the GAL4-activation domain in plasmid pACT2, and each pair of plasmids was transformed into yeast strain EGY48 together with the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pSH18–34. Two-hybrid assays were carried out according to procedures described in the manual for the Matchmaker system (CLONTECH). To identify components of the Prp19p-associated complex, we performed a screen for mutants that showed synergistic effects to a temperature-sensitive allele of prp19 using the ade2/ade3 sectoring system, isolating 15 such mutants (15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cloning of the gene complementing the snt309 mutant phenotype identified Snt309p as Ntc25p of the Prp19p-associated complex (15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We further cloned genes conferring mutations snt304 and snt384 by complementation of their nonsectoring phenotype. SNT304 and SNT384 were found to correspond to ORFs YJR050w and YBR188c, respectively. YJR050w was recently reported by two-hybrid screening to be Isy1p as a protein interacting with Syf1p (20Dix I. Russell C.S. Yehuda S.B. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is a protein of 235 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 28,024. YBR188c is a previously unidentified gene containing 140 amino acid residues of molecular weight 15,968. Neither protein sequence contains any discernible motif. To see whether SNT304 and SNT384 encode components of the Prp19p-associated complex, we raised antibodies against recombinant His-tagged Snt304p and Snt384p for immunoblot analysis. The Prp19p-associated complex was isolated by affinity chromatography (12Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Snt304p and anti-Snt384p antibodies. Fig.1 shows that the anti-Snt304p antibody reacted with Ntc30p (lane 3), and the anti-Snt384p antibody reacted with Ntc20p (lane 6) of the Prp19p-associated complex. Preincubation of individual antibody with recombinant Snt304p or Snt384p abolished such reactions (lanes 4 and 7). Pre-immune sera from both rabbits also gave no reaction (lanes 2 and 5). These results indicate that Snt304p is Ntc30p and Snt384p is Ntc20p of the Prp19p-associated complex. In fact, Ntc20p was also identified to be ORF YBR188c by independent sequencing of the components of the affinity-purified Prp19p-associated complex. We previously showed that Prp19p is not tightly associated with spliceosomal snRNPs, but is associated with the spliceosome during or after dissociation of U4 from the spliceosome (13Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two other components of the Prp19p-associated complex, Snt309p and Ntc85p/Cef1p, also associate with the spliceosome in the same manner, suggesting that the Prp19p-associated complex may bind to the spliceosome as an integral complex (14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I. Jan S.-P. Kuo N.-Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Cheng S.-C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To see whether Ntc30p and Ntc20p also associate with the spliceosome during the splicing reaction, anti-Ntc30p and anti-Ntc20p antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation of the spliceosome. Splicing reactions were carried out under normal conditions, and the reaction mixtures were precipitated with the anti-Ntc30p or anti-Ntc20p antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 2 A, precursor RNA, splicing intermediates, and the intervening sequence, but only a small amount of the mature message, were precipitated by the anti-Ntc30p antibody (lane 4), indicating precipitation of the spliceosome. In the absence of the antibody (lane 2) or with the pre-immune serum (lane 3), no RNA was precipitated. Preincubation of the antibody with the recombinant Ntc30p protein also resulted in no precipitation of RNA (lane 5). Fig.2 B shows the same result when immunoprecipitation was carried out with the anti-Ntc20p antibody. These results indicate that both Ntc30p and Ntc20p are also spliceosomal components. To see whether Ntc30p and Ntc20p also bind to the spliceosome at the same time as Prp19p, we performed the ATP titration experiment as before (14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I. Jan S.-P. Kuo N.-Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Cheng S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9455-9462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the scheme of spliceosome assembly. We previously demonstrated that dissociation of U4 from the spliceosome is very sensitive to ATP concentration (13Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions (1–2 mm ATP), U4 is dissociated from the spliceosome rapidly after binding of the tri-snRNPs. As a consequence, only very small amount of the U4 containing splicing complex A2-1 is detected. Dissociation of U4 is blocked at lower ATP concentrations with increasing amounts of A2-1 accumulated on decreasing ATP concentrations. It was demonstrated before that Prp19p is not associated with the spliceosome at low concentrations of ATP and is not present in A2-1 (13Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this feature to analyze the steps of spliceosome assembly with which Ntc30p and Ntc20p are associated. In this experiment, we constructed a strain in which Prp19p is tagged with the c-Myc epitope, and Prp4p is tagged with HA. Prp4p was shown to bind to the 5′ portion of U4 (21Xu Y. Petersen-Bjørn S. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and to be dissociated from the spliceosome with U4. Therefore, the anti-HA antibody could be used to follow U4 and anti-Myc antibody to follow Prp19p. Splicing reactions were carried out in extracts prepared from such a strain at different ATP concentrations, and the reaction mixtures were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-Ntc30p, and anti-Ntc20p antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the extract showed high splicing activity at 1 mm (lane 1) and 0.5 mm ATP (lane 7), low activity at 0.1 mm ATP (lane 13), but gave no spliced products or intermediates at 0.05 mm ATP (lane 19). The anti-Myc antibody precipitated the spliceosome efficiently from the reaction mixtures at 1 and 0.5 mm ATP (lanes 3and 9). At 0.1 mm ATP, less splicing intermediates and products but more pre-mRNA were precipitated (lane 15). The pre-mRNA precipitated presumably reflects complex A1. At 0.05 mm ATP, no significant amount of the RNA was precipitated (lane 21). This finding is consistent with our previous results of precipitation using the anti-Prp19p antibody or the anti-HA antibody when Prp19p was tagged with HA (13Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I. Jan S.-P. Kuo N.-Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Cheng S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9455-9462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, the anti-HA antibody, binding to Prp4p-HA, precipitated only residual amounts of pre-mRNA at 1 mmATP (lane 4), more at 0.5 mm ATP (lane 10), and much larger amounts at 0.1 and 0.05 mm ATP (lanes 16 and 22). In all cases, no splicing intermediates or products were precipitated, reflecting the fact that U4 is dissociated prior to catalytic steps of the splicing reaction. Precipitation with anti-Ntc30p and anti-Ntc20p antibodies gave a similar pattern as with the anti-Myc antibody. Spliceosome-associated RNAs were precipitated with higher efficiency at high ATP concentrations (lanes 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, and 18), but negligible amounts were precipitated at 0.05 mm ATP (lanes 23 and 24). This indicates that like Prp19p, both Ntc30p and Ntc20p are associated with the spliceosome immediately after or concurrently with dissociation of U4. Among the two previously identified Prp19p-associated components, even though SNT309 was not required for cell viability (15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), NTC85 was essential for yeast growth and for pre-mRNA splicing (14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I.

To see whether NTC30 and NTC20 are required for cellular growth, null alleles of NTC30 (ΔNTC30) and NTC20 (ΔNTC20) were constructed. In these constructs, the entire ORF of NTC30was replaced with a DNA fragment of the HIS3 gene, and a 170-bp fragment within the ORF of NTC20 was replaced with a DNA fragment of the LEU2 gene. Tetrad dissection of diploid strains containing one copy of the wild type and one copy of ΔNTC30 or ΔNTC20 revealed that neither NTC30 nor NTC20 was essential for yeast growth, although ΔNTC30 grew slightly less well than NTC20 or the wild-type cells (data not shown). However, deletion of both NTC30 and NTC20resulted in severe growth defect as shown in Fig.4 A. Dissection of a diploid strain containing one copy of the wild-type and one copy of ΔNTC30 and ΔNTC20 yielded two types of spores. One type, accounting for approximately 70% of dissected spores, grew normally. The other type gave slow growth phenotype and yielded minute colonies, which were all leucine and histidine prototrophy on replica plating. This result suggests that cells from which both NTC30 and NTC20 genes were deleted (ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20), although still viable, were impaired in growth. Because both Ntc30p and Ntc20p are spliceosomal components, growth defect of ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 cells may be a consequence of splicing deficiency. To understand whether pre-mRNA splicing is defective in ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 cells, RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis using the CRY1 gene as a probe. Fig. 4 B shows that as in the prp2 mutant (lanes 9 and 10), accumulation of pre-mRNA was seen in ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 cells (lanes 7 and 8) and, to a much lesser extent, in ΔNTC30 cells at 25 and 37 °C (lanes 3 and 4). Pre-mRNA accumulation was not seen in the wild type (lanes 1 and 2) and barely detected in ΔNTC20 cells (lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that Ntc30p and Ntc20p, although not essential for pre-mRNA splicing, may play auxiliary roles in the splicing reaction. As Ntc30p and Ntc20p are components of the Prp19p-associated complex, a splicing deficiency in ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 cells may reflect a deficiency in the function of the Prp19p-associated complex. To test that assumption, extracts were prepared from ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 cells and assayed for splicing. As shown in Fig. 4 C, extracts prepared from ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 cells gave very low splicing activity (lane 2). However, the splicing activity was restored to almost the wild-type level (lane 1) upon addition of the purified Prp19p-associated complex (lane 3). This indicates that the splicing deficiency of the ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 extract was caused by a malfunction of the Prp19p-associated complex and that Ntc30p and Ntc20p may play roles in sustaining the full activity of the Prp19p-associated complex. Two previously identified components of the Prp19p-associated complex, Snt309p and Ntc85p, were shown to interact directly with Prp19p (14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I.

Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To reveal the interactions between Ntc30p, Ntc20p, and other components of the Prp19p-associated complex, we performed two-hybrid assays. Prp19p, Snt309p, Ntc85p, Ntc30p, and Ntc20p were fused to both the LexA-DNA binding domain and the GAL4 activation domain, and interactions between each pair of proteins were analyzed by assaying the β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 5, neither Ntc30p nor Ntc20p interacted with Prp19p or Snt309p. Neither did they interact with each other. However, they both interacted with Ntc85p. The interaction of Ntc85p with Ntc20p was seen only when Ntc20p was fused to the DNA binding domain and Ntc85p was fused to the activation domain but was not detected when fusion was in an opposite way. Ntc30p showed very strong self-interaction similar to Ntc85p and Prp19p (12Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I. Jan S.-P. Kuo N.-Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Cheng S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9455-9462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). No self-interaction of Ntc20p was detected. We have previously demonstrated that Snt309p plays a role in modulating interaction of Prp19p with other associated components (16Chen H.-R. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Tsai W.-Y. Her L.-S. Hsu M.-T. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the absence of Snt309p, Prp19p becomes only loosely associated with other components. In addition, the association of Ntc85p with Ntc30p and Ntc20p was also weakened, but association between Ntc30p and Ntc20p was not affected (16Chen H.-R. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Tsai W.-Y. Her L.-S. Hsu M.-T. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This indicates that Snt309p, although not interacting directly with Ntc85p, affects interactions between Ntc85p and Ntc30p and between Ntc85p and Ntc20p. A possible explanation for such a distant effect is that formation of the Prp19p-associated complex may involve sequential interactions of the Prp19p-associated components in an order of binding of Snt309p to Prp19p, followed by the binding of Ntc85p, and then Ntc30p and Ntc20p. In this case, depletion of Ntc30p or Ntc20p or both should have no effect on the association of Prp19p with Snt309p and Ntc85p. To test this theory, we prepared splicing extracts from ΔNTC30, ΔNTC20, and ΔNTC30/ΔNTC20 strains. These extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Ntc85p antibody followed by Western blotting to reveal components associated with Ntc85p. As shown in Fig. 6, the anti-Ntc85p antibody precipitated both Prp19p and Snt309p in all of these extracts regardless of the absence of Ntc30p and/or Ntc20p, indicating that association of Ntc85p with Prp19p and Snt309p was not affected by Ntc30p or Ntc20p or their combination. This result is in contrast to that of depleting Snt309p, which greatly destabilizes the association of Prp19p with all other associated components. These results suggest that association of Prp19p with Snt309p and Ntc85p may be a prerequisite for the stable association of Ntc30p and Ntc20p with the Prp19p-associated complex. By screening synthetic lethal mutants to the temperature-sensitive alleles of PRP19, we have identified three genes,SNT309, NTC30, and NTC20, that encode components of the Prp19p-associated complex. None of these genes is essential for cell viability. Yeast strains deleted of the SNT309 gene gave a temperature-sensitive phenotype and accumulated pre-mRNA at the nonpermissive temperature (15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Deletion of the NTC30 or NTC20 gene alone did not show obvious growth phenotype. It is possible that Ntc30p or Ntc20p may play a less important role than Snt309p in the splicing reaction or in maintaining the integrity of the Prp19p-associated complex. Alternatively, NTC30 and NTC20 might be functionally redundant to other yeast genes. The genome of S. cerevisiae is thought to have undergone a duplication event some 100 million years ago, immediately followed by random deletion of individually duplicated genes from one or the other chromosome (22Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Fifty-five duplicated regions were identified in the whole yeast genome as a consequence of such duplication and deletion events (22Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Among them, the COR region of chromosome 10, on which NTC30 resides, is ancestrally related to the ARC region of chromosome 5 (23Melnick L. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 372-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NTC30, originally named UTR3as an unidentified transcribed region, is related to UTR5 in the ARC region (23Melnick L. Sherman F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 372-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the protein sequences of these two genes do not share high homology, the possibility that they are functionally redundant cannot be ruled out. By tagging Utr5p with the HA epitope, we tested the possibility of whether Utr5p is a spliceosomal component or a component of the Prp19p-associated complex. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed no association of Utr5p with Prp19p or with the spliceosome during the splicing reaction (data not shown). Thus, Utr5p is unlikely to be a functional homolog of Ntc30p. On the other hand, NTC30 and NTC20 could be functionally redundant to each other based on the following observations. First, despite the fact that deletion of either the NTC30 or NTC20 gene showed a negligible growth phenotype, deletion of both genes severely impaired cellular growth. Furthermore, Ntc30p and Ntc20p showed similar patterns of interaction with other identified components of the Prp19p-associated complex. Both proteins interact with Ntc85p (Fig. 5) and Ntc40p, 2C.-H. Chen, W.-Y. Tsai, and S.-C. Cheng, unpublished results. but neither interacts with Prp19p or Snt309p. Detailed biochemical analyses of these proteins are required for a direct proof. We showed previously that Snt309p interacts strongly with Prp19p, and through this interaction, it modulates interactions of Prp19p with other associated components to form a stable complex. In the absence of Snt309p, the association of Prp19p or Ntc85p with other components is impaired, and the complex is dissociated into at least three parts, one containing Prp19p, one containing Ntc85p, and one containing Ntc30p and Ntc20p (16Chen H.-R. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Tsai W.-Y. Her L.-S. Hsu M.-T. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Neither Ntc30p nor Ntc20p interacts directly with Prp19p or Snt309p, but both interact with Ntc85p. It is interesting that although Snt309p does not interact with Ntc85p, Ntc30p, or Ntc20p, it affects the interactions between these components and between Ntc85p and Prp19p. In contrast, neither Ntc30p nor Ntc20p affects association of Ntc85p with Prp19p and Snt309p. This finding suggests that formation of the Prp19p-associated complex may involve sequential interactions of the components in the following order: Snt309p binds to Prp19p first, followed by binding of Ntc85p, then Ntc30p and Ntc20p. The fact that Ntc30p and Ntc20p do not interact with each other but remain associated even after dissociation from Ntc85p (16Chen H.-R. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Tsai W.-Y. Her L.-S. Hsu M.-T. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggests that they may interact with another factor(s) to form a subcomplex regardless of the presence of Ntc85p. A scheme of interactions between the known components of the Prp19p-associated complex is shown in Fig.7. Like other components of the Prp19p-associated complex, both Ntc30p and Ntc20p are also associated with the spliceosome during the splicing reaction (14Tsai W.-Y. Chow Y.-T. Chen H.-R. Huang K.-T. Hong R.-I. Jan S.-P. Kuo N.-Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.-H. Cheng S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9455-9462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they also associate with the spliceosome in the same manner as Prp19p and other associated components. These results strongly suggest that the Prp19p-associated complex is added to the spliceosome as an integral complex and that the associated components may function in a coordinate fashion. Ntc30p has recently been reported as Isy1p from the two-hybrid screening of Syf1p-interacting proteins (20Dix I. Russell C.S. Yehuda S.B. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A sequence search identified Isy1p homologs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe,Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and human (20Dix I. Russell C.S. Yehuda S.B. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein is conserved between the lower and higher eukaryotes. A similar search identified a protein with only a limited homology to Ntc20p in S. pombe. Two human EST sequences were also found to share homology with Ntc20p but only at low level. Thus, Ntc20p appears to be less conserved than Ntc30p throughout its evolution and may be functionally less important, although neither is essential for vegetative growth; this is consistent with the observed phenotype that ΔNTC20 cells showed no detectable growth defect or pre-mRNA accumulation, whereas ΔNTC30 cells grew slightly slower and accumulated a small amount of pre-mRNA (Fig.4 B). In the report by Dix et al. (20Dix I. Russell C.S. Yehuda S.B. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), Isy1p, when fused to protein A, was demonstrated to be associated with the spliceosome by precipitation of the splicing reaction mixture with IgG-agarose. This finding is consistent with our result that anti-Ntc30p antibody also precipitated the spliceosome from the reaction mixture. A similar immunoprecipitation analysis revealed association of Isy1p-protein A with a small fraction of U5 and U6 snRNAs in the splicing extract in the absence of splicing (20Dix I. Russell C.S. Yehuda S.B. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These authors suggest that only a small portion of Isy1p was associated with U5 and U6, which may be the product of disruption of U4/U6 base pairing stimulated by Brr2p (20Dix I. Russell C.S. Yehuda S.B. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1999; 5: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody using Prp19p-HA extracts, we have previously shown that Prp19p, and likely its associated complex, is not tightly associated with spliceosomal snRNAs (18Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As a component of the Prp19p-associated complex, it seems unlikely that Ntc30p is associated with snRNAs. Nevertheless, Ntc30p may be associated with distinct complexes other than Prp19p. We therefore performed an immunoprecipitation analysis with the anti-Ntc30p and anti-HA antibodies using Ntc30p-HA extracts. However, no precipitation of snRNAs was detected (data not shown). Similar experiments with the anti-Ntc20p antibody also detected no co-precipitation of snRNAs (data not shown). A possible explanation for the discrepancy between our results and those of Dix et al.is the use of different derivatives of Ntc30p. We used both native and HA-tagged Ntc30p, whereas they used a fusion form with protein A. A fusion protein may have a subtle difference from the native form and exhibit slightly different properties, e.g. increased affinity with certain proteins. We thank S. Elledge and R.

https://openalex.org/W2036058546,"In analyzing cis-regulatory elements important for cell cycle control of the replication-dependent hamster histone H3.2 gene, we discovered a binding site for the transcription factor YY1 embedded within GC-rich sequences between the two tandem CCAAT repeats proximal to the TATA element. Base mutations that specifically eliminated YY1 binding resulted in suppression of the S phase induction of the H3.2 promoter. In addition, we discovered that YY1 is an interactive partner of AP-2, which also binds the H3.2 promoter and regulates its cell cycle-dependent expression. The critical domains for YY1 and AP-2A interaction are mapped, revealing that the N-terminal portion of YY1 (amino acids 1–300) and the DNA-binding/dimerization region of AP-2A are required. Our results suggest that YY1, acting as a transcription factor binding to its site on the promoter, or through protein-protein interaction with AP-2, may be part of a regulatory network including key cell cycle regulators such as c-Myc and Rb in controlling growth- and differentiation-regulated gene expression.

Yin Yang 1 glutathione S-transferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay polymerase chain reaction Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis human thymidine kinase The sequence motif CCAT for binding of the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1)1occurs in a large number of cellular and viral genes, and YY1 is known to mediate the response to a variety of cell signal pathways (1Shrivastava A.

YY1 is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor highly conserved among animal species and is ubiquitously expressed in growing, differentiated, and growth-arrested cells. Although it has been established that YY1 is a multifunctional protein that can act as a transcriptional initiator, repressor, and activator, with the ability to induce DNA-bending and association with the nuclear matrix, its functional role in cell growth and differentiation is just emerging. The YY1 protein is phosphorylated with a relatively short half-life (3Austen M. Luscher B. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In differentiating F9, 70Z/3, or U937 cells, no changes in the mRNA or protein levels of YY1 were detected (3Austen M. Luscher B. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol.

Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The decrease in YY1 activity during myogenesis correlates with changes in the expression of two YY1-dependent genes. The gene for α-actin is activated and c-myc is repressed when YY1 levels fall, implying that YY1 represses α-actin transcription and activates c-myc transcription (5Lee T.C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 6Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar, 7Riggs K.J.

Targeted disruption of mouse YY1 results in embryonic lethality, and some heterozygote embryos exhibit neurulation defects (8Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence point to the involvement of YY1 in the regulation of growth-dependent genes. It has been reported that the YY1 level increases rapidly in quiescent NIH 3T3 cells in response to serum and insulin-like growth factor 1 treatment (9Flanagan J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 185-190PubMed Google Scholar). YY1 binding sites are found in the cell cycle-regulated genes such as those for E2F1 (10Hsiao K.M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), dihydrofolate reductase (11Farnham P.J. Means A.L. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6679-6697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), known to be target genes of E2F. However, the presence of the E2F site is necessary but not sufficient for S phase induction. Utilizing the E2F-1 minimal promoter to test the contribution of various transactivation domains, it was found that CCAAT, YY1 sites, and certain GC boxes cloned upstream of the E2F1 minimal promoter displayed E2F site-dependent regulation, suggesting these specific transcription factors are able to cooperate with E2F to activate S phase transcription (13van Ginkel P.R. Hsiao K.M. Schjerven H. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18367-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For the FO108 human H4 gene, multiple YY1 sites exist within the regulatory elements associated with its growth-dependent expression and YY1 stimulates transcription of reporter genes linked to H4 gene segments (14Last T.J. van Wijnen A.J. Birnbaum M.J. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In another example, the replication-dependent mouse histone H3.2 gene contains a coding region activating sequence referred to as the α element involved in its up-regulation during the G1/S transition (15Kaludov N.K. Bowman T.L. Sikorski E.M. Hurt M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The nuclear activity that interacts with the α element contained within the protein-encoding sequence of the mouse H3.2 gene has been identified as YY1 (16Eliassen K.A. Baldwin A. Sikorski E.M. Hurt M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7106-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). YY1 DNA binding to this coding regulatory region is cell cycle-regulated with most pronounced binding observed in late G1 cells (15Kaludov N.K. Bowman T.L. Sikorski E.M. Hurt M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Further, cyclin D1-dependent kinases may play a role in the phosphorylating events that regulate the YY1 DNA binding activity. In examining the cell cycle regulation of the hamster H3.2 promoter, we have previously shown that AP-2, through its binding to the H3.2 promoter and physical interaction with Rb, may contribute to the transcriptional regulation of the H3.2 gene (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to the AP-2 site located at around 230 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site, the H3.2 promoter contains two CCAAT elements proximal to TATA element (18Artishevsky A. Wooden S. Sharma A. Resendez Jr., E. Lee A.S. Nature. 1987; 328: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We report here that an inverted CCAT motif, which binds YY1, was located within GC-rich sequence between the two tandem CCAAT repeats. Mutation of the YY1 binding site suppressed the cell cycle-dependent activation of the H3.2 gene. In addition, we discovered that YY1 is a novel interactive partner of AP-2, suggesting that through protein-protein interaction, YY1 could also affect the activity of cell cycle transcriptional regulatory complexes. The construction of the wild-type pH3[−254]Luc was as follows; a subfragment of H3.2 promoter spanning −254 to −6 was amplified by PCR using specific wild-type primers. The wild-type 5′ primer was overhung with a XhoI site (5′-ctagctcgAGCAGAACCTTGGCGAGTCAGC-3′) and the 3′ primer with a HindIII site (5′-ctagaagcttAGACGGAAGTCACCAAGACG-3′). The PCR-amplified fragment was digested with XhoI and HindIII and inserted into a pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the pH3[−254]Luc. The pH3[−254AP2m]Luc construct was generated by PCR amplification with an AP-2 mutant primer (5′-ctagctcgAGCAGAACCTTGGCGAGTCAGaataattataatattaACAAGGGGGCGG-3′) and subcloned into pGL3 vector as the wild-type promoter pH3[−254]Luc. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate pH3[−254YY1m]Luc was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector, were designed and synthesized for introducing specific mutation in YY1 site as shown in Table I. The orientation and sequence of the wild-type and mutated promoter constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.Table IDNA sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides NF-Y YY1 NF-YH3.2 (−188/−131)CGGGTCCAAGCCAATGGGCGAGGCGGGATGGGTGACGCCCGGGCCAATGACCGGACAGGCCCAGGTTCGGTTACCCGCTCCGCCCTACCCACTGCGGGCCCGGTTACTGGCCTGTCH3.2 YY1 (−173/−144) GGGCGAGGCGGGATGGGTGACGCCCGGGCC CCCGCTCCGCCCTACCCACTGCGGGCCCGGH3.2 YY1m GGGCGAGGCGGG c T c GGTGACGCCCGGGCC CCCGCTCCGCCC g A g CCACTGCGGGCCCGG NF-Y YY1Consensus YY1 site ctagaGCCGCTTCGAATCGGCAGCGGCCATCTTGGTGGCATa —– tCGGCGAAGCTTAGCCGTCGCCGGTAGAACCACCGTAtgatc —– AP-2Consensus AP-2 site ctagaGATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGTa tCTAGCTTGACTGGCGGGCGCCGGGCAtgatc X AP-2H3 core (−253/−214) ctagaGCAGAACCTTGGCGAGTCAGCCAGCCGCGGGGCTGGACAA tCGTCTTGGAACCGCTCAGTCGGTCGGCGCCCCGACCTGTTgatc ctagaGCAGAACCTT ttaagcttct CCAGCCGCGGGGCTGGACAAH3 corem tCGTCTTGGAA aattcgaaga GGTCGGCGCCCCGACCTGTTgatcThe NF-Y, YY1 and X factor binding sites are underlined.

K12 Chinese hamster fibroblast cells were grown in DMEM with 10% bovine calf serum (Gemino, Calabasas, CA) and 1% antibiotics (consisting of 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 100 μg/ml neomycin). For cell synchronization, subconfluent cultures were growth arrested by serum deprivation in low glucose DMEM containing 0.5% serum for 48–72 h. The cells were released from the G0/G1 phase by addition of fresh high glucose DMEM with 10% serum and harvested at various time points in the cell cycle, up to 24 h. Progression of synchronized populations was monitored as a function of DNA synthesis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis or by [3H]thymidine incorporation (18Artishevsky A. Wooden S. Sharma A. Resendez Jr., E. Lee A.S. Nature. 1987; 328: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines harboring the wild-type or mutant H3.2 promoter driving luciferase reporter gene were established by cotransfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (19Resendez Jr., E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A total of 10 μg of test plasmid DNAs with 2 μg of neomycin expressing vector under the control of the SV40 promoter (pSV40-Neo3) were used for both reporter constructs. The transfectants was selected for resistance to G418 (250 μg/ml) for about 4 weeks. The resistant colonies harboring the respective constructs were pooled and maintained as stable cell lines. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activities using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The luciferase activities of the stable transfectants were determined from the same number of cells throughout the cell cycle. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled and purified, and conditions for EMSAs have been described previously (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The anti-AP-2A N-terminal peptide rabbit polyclonal antibody is a gift of Dr. M. Tainsky (University of Texas, Houston, TX). The anti-YY1 monoclonal antibody, anti-ATF-1, and anti-IRF-1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). GST or GST-fusion proteins were induced in Escherichia coli with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified by affinity chromatography. Protein yields were quantitated by Coomassie Blue staining in comparison with bovine serum albumin after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Protein-protein interactions were assayed with equal amounts of in vitrotranslated and 35S-labeled proteins and purified GST proteins bound onto beads as described (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Proteins bound onto beads were released and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Subconfluent K12 hamster fibroblasts or 293T human kidney fibroblast cells were transiently co-transfected with various expression plasmids or their empty vectors (20 μg total in each transfection mixture) using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cells were then lysed in ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) in situ at 4 °C for 10 min, and used for immunoprecipitation as described previously (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by a 10% SDS-PAGE and transblotted to Immunobilon-PVDF membrane. The blots were preincubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, containing 2% bovine serum albumin, at 4 °C overnight. The individual primary antibodies were diluted at 1:500 to 1:2000 and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted at 1:10,000. The protein band was visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The promoter sequence of the hamster histone H3.2 gene spanning −254 to +3 is shown in Fig. 1. Located within this sequence are the canonical TATA sequence, two CCAAT binding sites for NF-Y binding, an AP-2 binding site, and an AP-1 like binding site termed X. An ATGG sequence motif, which represents the inverted CCAT sequence found to be a predictor of high affinity YY1 binding site (20Yant S.R. Zhu W. Millinoff D. Slightom J.L. Goodman M. Gumucio D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4353-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was found between the NF-Y binding sites and is embedded within GC-rich motifs resembling that of the Sp1 binding site. To test for YY1 binding to the ATGG motif, synthetic oligonucleotides encompassing the YY1 site (spanning from −188/−131) of H3.2 promoter were used as probe in EMSAs (Fig. 2). The sequence and size of the binding sites used in EMSAs are shown in TableI. With HeLa nuclear extract, two predominant complexes were observed. Both complexes are specific for the H3.2 sequence as revealed by self-competition with molar excess of the unlabeled probe and by the failure of competition with a heterologous AP-2 sequence (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). The slower electrophoretic mobility complex represented NF-Y binding to the probe, since this complex was abolished by competition with a NF-Y consensus site. 2F. Wu and A. S. Lee, data not shown. (Wu and Lee, data not shown). Likewise, the faster electrophoretic mobility complex contained YY1, whose binding was completely abolished with molar excess of a consensus YY1 site (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6and 7). Since the consensus YY1 oligomer used also contains a low affinity NF-Y binding site CGAAT (21Foti D.M. Welihinda A. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30402-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), partial competition for the NF-Y complex was also observed.Figure 2In vitro binding of YY1 to the H3.2 promoter (−188 to −131). A, EMSAs were performed with 2 μg of HeLa nuclear extract, 1 ng of the H3.2 (−188/−131) as probe (asterisk), and 200 ng of poly(dI·dC) as nonspecific competitor. Lane 1, no competitor;lanes 2–7, a 25- or 50-fold molar excess of the various binding site competitors as indicated on top was used. The sequences of the competitor oligomers are shown in Table I.B, EMSAs were performed using 2 ng of bacterially expressed GST-YY1 protein, 1 ng of H3.2 (−188/−131) as probe, and 200 ng of poly(dI·dC) as nonspecific competitor.

The positions of NF-Y and YY1 complexes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of YY1 to bind directly to the H3.2 promoter sequence was demonstrated by using the bacterially expressed GST-YY1 protein in EMSAs (Fig. 2 B). The YY1 site within the H3.2 sequence was established to reside within the ATGG sequence since a two-base mutation within the oligomer converting the sequence motif to CTCG (Table I) resulted in the failure of mutated sequence to compete for YY1 binding (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and 7). The functional importance of the YY1 binding site was tested by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant H3.2 promoter is identical to the wild-type promoter with the exception of the two-base change converting the ATGG sequence to CTCG, thereby destroying specifically the YY1 binding site (Fig. 1). Both wild-type and mutated promoter sequences were linked to a luciferase reporter gene, and stably transfected into K12 cells by cotransfection with a neomycin resistance gene. The promoter activities during the cell cycle after serum release were determined by luciferase assays in the synchronized cells established from several independent pools of stable transfectants (Fig.3). At the time of serum release, the promoter activity of the mutated construct was only slightly lower than that of the wild-type promoter, thus the basal promoter activity was not affected significantly by the mutation. As the cells progressed into late G1 and entered early S phase at 12 h after serum release, the wild-type H3.2 promoter showed a gradual increase and reached a 15-fold increase at around 22 h. The kinetics of S phase induction was considerably delayed when the YY1 binding site was mutated (Fig. 3). The final induction level was reduced to about 6-fold. In contrast, mutation in a previously identified AP-2 binding site of H3.2 promoter resulted in increased promoter activity several hours prior to the onset of the S phase (Fig. 3). These results showed that, although the AP-2 site appears to be required for promoter repression during G1 phase prior to the G1/S transition, the YY1 site is required for optimal transcriptional activation of the H3.2 promoter during G1/S transition. AP-2 has been shown to be an interactive protein of Rb (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Batsche E. Muchardt C. Behrens J. Hurst H.C. Cremisi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3647-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Further, we identified AP-2 as a major transcription factor binding to the cell cycle regulatory domain of the H3.2 promoter referred here as the H3 core (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The H3 core is located about 70 base pairs upstream of the YY1 binding site (Fig. 1). Since both YY1 and AP2 appear to be regulators of the S phase induction of the H3.2 promoter, we tested the interaction between these two transcription factors. Using GST pull-down assays with [35S]methionine-labeled AP-2A protein and various GST fusion proteins, we confirmed that AP-2A can form homodimeric complexes (Fig.4 A, lane 3). In addition, we showed that AP-2A can interact with both GST-YY1 and GST-YY1Δ with C-terminal domain deleted (Fig.4 A, lanes 4 and 5), but not with GST alone or GST-Ha-Ras (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 6). Thus, the YY1 domain interacting with AP-2 lies in its N-terminal portion outside the C-terminal repression and zinc finger DNA-binding domain (Fig.5 B).Figure 5Mapping the interaction domain of AP-2 with YY1. A, in vitro translated5S-labeled full-length or truncated AP-2A was used. The input AP-2A protein samples (10%) were shown on the left panel. The positions of the protein size markers (in kDa) ran in parallel are indicated. At the right panel, GST pull-down assays were performed with the various35S-labeled AP-2A proteins (full-length or subfragments as indicated on top) and with bacterial expressed and purified GST-YY1. The proteins bound onto the GST-YY1 were eluted, applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. B, schematic drawing of the functional domains of AP-2 protein and a summary of the AP-2 domains required for YY1 binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further map the interaction domains of AP-2A with YY1, full-length and various truncated forms of AP-2A (N262, ΔN165, ΔN227, ΔC390) were in vitro transcribed and translated and GST pull-down assays were performed with GST-YY1. The radiolabeled AP-2A proteins, as shown in Fig. 5 A, were mixed with equal amounts of GST-YY1 and subjected to GST pull-down assays as described above. Strong interaction with YY1 was observed with both AP-2A (ΔN165) and full-length AP-2A. In contrast, little interaction was detected with N262, which is devoid of the dimerization domain; ΔN227, which has deleted part of the basic DNA binding domain; and ΔC390, which has lost part of its dimerization domain and is not be able to bind DNA (Fig. 5 B). These results show that AP-2 binding to YY1 requires an intact DNA binding and dimerization domain of AP-2. To determine whether YY1 and AP-2 can associate in vivo, two independent approaches were taken. First, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Two mammalian cell lines, K12 and 293T cells, were used. Because AP-2A was present in low abundance in mammalian cells, to enhance detection between AP-2A and YY1, expression vectors for AP-2A and YY1 were transfected either singly or in combination into K12 and 293T cells. After transfections, whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti-AP-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-YY1 antibody. For both K12 (Fig.6 A) and 293T (Fig.6 B) cells, YY1 were immunoprecipitated by the anti-AP-2 antibody (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 2 and 4). The expression of AP-2A in cells transfected with the AP-2A expression vector was confirmed by immunoblotting the cell lysates with the anti-AP-2A antibody (Fig. 6,C and D, lanes 3 and 4). In the second approach to determine for AP-2 and YY1 association in vivo, we investigated the composition of a novel multiprotein complex (X′), which was formed in EMSAs using K12 nuclear extract and a H3 core (−253 to −214) as probe (Fig.7 A). The X′ complex was observed when highly concentrated cell lysates were used. The H3 core (−254 to −214) contains the AP-2 binding site and the X binding site (Table I). Previously we have shown that mutation of site X and the first G residue of the AP-2 site severely diminished the ability of AP-2 to bind to the H3 core (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Likewise, the H3 core mutation resulted in the reduction of its ability to compete for X′ binding (Fig. 7 A). In determining the components of the X′ complex, the K12 nuclear extract was pre-incubated with antibodies against a large number of transcription factors prior to addition of the H3 core probe. As expected, one component of X′ is AP-2A (Fig. 7 B). We discovered X′ also contains YY1 since antibody against YY1 was also able to inhibit the formation of X′ (Fig. 7 C). Other antibodies such as those directed against ATF-1, IRF-1 and other transcription factors were without effect (Fig. 7, B and C, and data not shown). These results demonstrated that YY1 and AP-2 can associate in vivo and are components of a multiprotein complex binding to the cell cycle regulatory domain of the H3.2 promoter. Through deletion mutation analysis, the critical region for S phase induction of the hamster H3.2 promoter has been mapped to a region between −241 and −210, which contains a conserved AP-1-like site (X) adjacent to an AP-2 binding site (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Artishevsky A. Wooden S. Sharma A. Resendez Jr., E. Lee A.S. Nature. 1987; 328: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Naeve G.S. Zhou Y. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although the promoter sequence downstream of this region by itself is not sufficient to confer cell cycle regulation to the H3.2 gene (18Artishevsky A. Wooden S. Sharma A. Resendez Jr., E. Lee A.S. Nature. 1987; 328: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it may contain sequences that are necessary for optimal induction of the H3.2 gene during G1/S transition. By DNA sequence comparison between H3.2 and the replication-dependent human thymidine kinase (htk) promoter, a YY1 binding site core (5′-ATGG-3′) was discovered between the two tandem CCAAT repeats in both promoters (15Kaludov N.K. Bowman T.L. Sikorski E.M. Hurt M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).2 Similar to the H3.2 promoter, the two CCAAT motifs of the htk promoter are downstream of the cell cycle regulatory region and bind NF-Y (24Li L.J. Naeve G.S. Lee A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3554-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25Kim E.C. Lau J.S. Rawlings S. Lee A.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1329-1338PubMed Google Scholar). The YY1 binding site within the htk promoter is also immediately adjacent to GC-rich motifs resembling the Sp1 binding site. This high degree of conservation within the promoter organization of H3.2 and htk, both of which are replication-dependent, suggests functional significance. This prediction was borne out through mutation analysis of the YY1 binding site on the H3.2 promoter. In this report, we showed that the ATGG motif represents an inverted binding site for YY1. The binding of YY1 to this sequence motif does not require other nuclear proteins as purified recombinant YY1 is able to bind this site. Further, mutation of the YY1 site by two base changes eliminated YY1 binding and suppressed the S phase induction of the H3.2 promoter. These results suggest that a simple mode of action by YY1 toward regulation of the H3.2 promoter is through direct binding to its site and activate transcription (Fig.8 A). This mechanism may also be employed for the activation of the histone H4 promoter by YY1 through its multiple binding sites on the histone H4 regulatory elements (14Last T.J. van Wijnen A.J. Birnbaum M.J. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since the binding motif of YY1 is widely distributed in a large number of genes, specific regulation conferred by YY1 is likely related to its ability to associate with other proteins. The ability of YY1 to interact with components of the basal transcription machinery such as TATA-binding protein, transcription factor IIB, and TATA binding protein associated factor (TAF) II 55 suggest that YY1 could act as a bridging protein between the upstream regulatory elements and the core polymerase complex binding to the TATA element (2Shi Y. Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The interactions between YY1, c-myc, and E1A strongly imply the importance of YY1 as a transcriptional regulator in growth and differentiation. It has been proposed that one mechanism for YY1 action is through the recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes such as histone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases, leading to chromatin alteration (26Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Both cyclin E/cdk2 kinase and the viral oncoprotein E1A have been shown to associate with and activate the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300 during the mammalian G1/S transition (27Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This could lead to alteration in chromatin topology at specific cell cycle stages. Additionally, YY1 has been shown to associate with the nuclear matrix, which is known to play a role in defining the higher order structure of chromatin (28Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10526-10530Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, YY1 activity might be altered and the transcription of YY1 target genes could be affected. In this study, we discovered that AP-2 is a novel interactive protein of YY1. Previously, we have identified that AP-2 can bind to the cell cycle control region of H3.2 promoter (17Wu F. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More interestingly, AP-2 physically interacts with the important growth suppressing region of Rb C-terminal domain (17 and data not shown). In addition, AP-2 has been shown to associate with both c-Myc and E1A oncoproteins. These observations raise a possibility that AP-2 and YY1 function at overlapping regulatory pathways. To explore this possibility, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-existence within a multiprotein complex that AP-2 and YY1 physically associate with each other in vivo. The important domains for their interactions have been mapped to the C-terminal basic and dimerization domain of AP-2 and a larger N-terminal portion of YY1 outside most of the zinc finger regions. Although the exact region of the YY1 N-terminal portion (amino acids 1–330) required for AP-2 interaction remained to be determined, since this portion of YY1 is devoid of repression or DNA binding activities, it is most likely that the modulation of AP-2 activity by YY1 is mediated through physical interaction. In an attempt to analysis the effect of overexpression of YY1, either alone and in combination with AP-2A, on the native H3.2 promoter, we found that the promoter activity was repressed (data not shown). The mechanism for the repression is currently unclear and could be due to direct or indirect effects associated with overexpression, such as squelching of basal factors or interference of other critical factors such as proteins binding to the GC-rich sequence adjacent to the YY1 site (29Lee T. Bradley M.E. Walowitz J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here we show, through direct mutation of the YY1 binding site, that YY1 acts as an activator within the context of the H3.2 promoter. In case of the AP-2 binding site, its mutation resulted in increase in H3.2 promoter activity prior to the G1/S transition, suggesting functional consequence of the interaction between AP-2 and Rb as proposed in Fig. 8 B. In summary, the discovery of a functional YY1 binding site required for optimal S phase induction of a replication-dependent gene such as H3.2 provides direct evidence for YY1 involvement in the regulation of a replication-dependent gene promoter. Our study predicts that other growth-regulated genes bearing YY1 binding site around transcriptional control region (11Farnham P.J. Means A.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) may also be targets for YY1 regulation. The identification of interaction between YY1 and AP-2 and their interactive network with c-Myc and Rb suggests that YY1 and AP-2 may play important roles in mediating the pleiotrophic effects of c-Myc and Rb on cell growth and differentiation (Fig. 8 B). In support, targeted disruption of the mouse YY1 gene results in pre-implantation lethality, strongly implying that YY1 may regulate genes essential for rapid proliferation and differentiation of mouse embryos in early development (8Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Similar to AP-2 gene disruption (30Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn- Dujowich D. McMahon A.P. Flavell R.A. Williams T. Nature. 1996; 381: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), YY1 heterozygotes exhibit severe developmental abnormalities and neurulation defects, supporting the notion that the two factors through their functional interaction may converge upon similar developmental regulatory pathways. Future investigations into the possible role of YY1 in the control of other growth- and differentiation-regulated genes will put these hypotheses to test. We thank Drs. D.

To increase our knowledge of the mechanism involved, we have analyzed the ability of several serine/threonine kinases to phosphorylate CDC25Mm in vivoand in vitro. We could demonstrate the involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in the phosphorylation of CDC25Mm in fibroblasts overexpressing this RasGEF as well as in mouse brain synaptosomal membranes. In vitro, PKA was found to phosphorylate multiple sites on purified CDC25Mm, in contrast to protein kinase C, calmodulin kinase II, and casein kinase II, which were virtually inactive. Eight phosphorylated serines and one threonine were identified by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. Most of them were clustered around the Ras exchanger motif/PEST motifs situated in the C-terminal moiety (residues 631–978) preceding the catalytic domain. Ser745 and Ser822 were the most heavily phosphorylated residues and the only ones coinciding with PKA consensus sequences. Substitutions S745D and S822D showed that the latter mutation strongly inhibited the exchange activity of CDC25Mm on Ha-Ras.

They control a series of physiological and pathological events associated with growth and differentiation of the cell. Their activity is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 that enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity and by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that accelerate the very slow intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange, favoring thus the regeneration of the active form of Ras. The nucleotide exchange mechanism catalyzed by GEFs has been intensively studied and characterized at a three-dimensional structural level (for review, see Ref. 2Cherfils J. Chardin P.

CDC25Mm, a protein of 1262 amino acid residues, shows the following sequence of domains/motifs: pleckstrin homology 1 (PH1), coiled-coil (CC), ilimaquinone (IQ), Dbl homology (DH), pleckstrin homology 2 (PH2), Ras exchanger motif (REM), and PEST. The RasGEF domain, represented by the conserved catalytic CDC25 domain, is situated in the C-terminal region.Results in vitro with CDC25Mm (13Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol.

Several reports have shown that activation of CDC25Mm is coupled with Ca2+influx, as well as with formation of a complex with calmodulin and phosphorylation (8Farnsworth C. Freshney N. Rosen L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), showing that this protein is an important element for cross-regulation of Ras and Rac-dependent pathways (19Innocenti M.

Biol. 1998; 8: 935-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results illustrate the complexity of the upstream activation of CDC25Mm, as well as the many aspects that remain to be clarified.In order to deepen our information on the specific action(s) of kinases on CDC25Mm, in this work we have carried out a series of experiments analyzing the phosphorylation of this GEF by several serine/threonine kinases. PKA was found to be a very efficient phosphotransfer enzyme for CDC25Mm in vivo and in vitro, leading to the phosphorylation of multiple residues that were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. Functional modifications induced by phosphorylation of full-length CDC25Mm and by substitutions of single serine residues are also reported.DISCUSSIONProtein phosphorylation is one of the most important mechanisms of regulation of signal transmission in the cell. It has been object of intensive investigations in the many GEFs of the Rho family, and it has recently evoked a renewed interest in the RasGEF of the CDC25Mm/GRF1 type. Even if the phosphorylation of this neuronal RasGEF and its association with the activation have been known for several years (8Farnsworth C. Freshney N. Rosen L. Ghosh A. Greenberg M. Feig L. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,6Mattingly R. Macara I. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), our knowledge of the phosphorylation sites and the biochemical mechanisms involved therein is as yet unclear. However, since treatment of the isolated exchange factor with protein phosphatase 1, specific for serine/threonine residues, abolished the ligand-induced increase in exchange activity (6Mattingly R. Macara I. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), serine/threonine kinases can be expected to participate, at least in part, in the regulation of the CDC25Mm activity. This problem has been approached in this work by analyzing various serine/threonine kinases. Observations are reported, demonstrating in vivo and in vitro the selective participation of PKA in the phosphorylation of CDC25Mm and the in vitro identification of the PKA-dependent phosphorylation sites located in the C-terminal moiety.A possible involvement of CDC25Mm in a PKA-dependent Ras activation had been proposed previously on the basis of the observation that in cortical neurons the level of active Ras (Ras·GTP) was strongly enhanced in response to treatment with forskolin (26Ambrosini A. Tininini S. Barassi A. Racagni G. Sturani E. Zippel R. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with H89, a specific inhibitor of PKA, reduced this activation. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that Mattingly (16Mattingly R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37379-37384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) has recently reported from in vivo and in vitroexperiments that phosphorylation of serine 916 was in part dependent on PKA. Phosphorylation of CDC25Mm by PKA has been shown in our work to take place in the neuronal tissue, using synaptosomal membranes from mouse brain that contain PKA, PKC, and CaMKII (24Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Sihra T.S. Aderem A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2253-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Sturani E. Abbondio A. Branduardi P. Ferrari C. Zippel R. Martegani E. Vanoni M. Denis-Donini S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that, in fibroblasts overexpressing CDC25Mm, thein vitro phosphorylation of CDC25Mm was decreased by 50%, following in vivo phosphorylation with PKA. These results strongly suggest that PKA unequivocally phosphorylates this RasGEFin vivo, and that the sites that are phosphorylated in vitro are in large part coincident with those in vivo.Our in vivo data satisfactorily agree with those obtainedin vitro using well characterized purified components, which indicate that several serine and threonine residues are the targets for CDC25Mm phosphorylation by PKA. The plateau value of phosphate incorporation in CDC25Mm in the presence of PKA corresponded to a stoichiometry of 4 mol of phosphate groups covalently attached/mol of full-length CDC25Mm. In buffer conditions that are optimal for the activity of PKC, CaMKII, and CKII, these kinases failed to significantly phosphorylate the full-length CDC25Mm. The catalytic C-terminal domain (285 amino acids) of CDC25Mm as well as isolated domains of the N-terminal region did not appear to contain phosphorylation sites. Accordingly, the region encompassing residues 631–978 was shown to bear most of the PKA phosphorylation sites on the exchange factor. These results were confirmed by the structural analysis of the isolated phosphopeptides by MALDI mass spectrometry and Edman degradation, which identified nine phosphorylated sites corresponding to serines 643, 691, 745, 793/794, 822, 849, 1123/1124, and 1146 and threonine 798 in the primary structure of CDC25Mm. Most of the Ser/Thr residues were clustered in the C-terminal half of the protein, in a region containing the REM (fragment 639–686) and the PEST (fragment 798–853) motifs. This region, preceding the RasGEF catalytic domain with the conserved CDC25 homology, is not well characterized as yet.Of the nine PKA-specific phosphorylation sites identified in the present work, only two (Ser745 and Ser822) coincided with the PKA consensus sites that we have deduced from the analysis of the CDC25Mm primary structure. The fact that these two residues were the most strongly phosphorylated made them priority candidates for site-directed mutagenesis (see below). The two weakly labeled Ser1123/Ser1124 and Ser1146, identified in the catalytic region of CDC25Mm, were not found phosphorylated in the isolated C-terminal catalytic domain, suggesting that their accessibility to PKA can be influenced by the presence of the other domains. Ser1146 is not conserved in human GRF1, whereas both Ser1123 and Ser1124are conserved in murine, rat, and human GRF1. In CDC25Mm, substitution of Ser1124 has been reported to influence the GEF activity (27Carrera V. Moroni A. Martegani E. Volponi C. Cool R.H. Alberghina L. Vanoni M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The adjacent Ser1123 is homologous to SOS Ala877, which in the three-dimensional model hydrogen-bonds Gln70 of Ha-Ras (28Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), a residue situated on α-helix 2 of the switch 2 region that is essential for the exchange reaction (29Crechet J.B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,30Quilliam L.A. Hisaka M.M. Zhong S. Lowry A. Mosteller R.D. Han J. Drugan J.K. Broek D. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11076-11082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A phosphorylated residue, Ser643, was identified in the REM sequence, a conserved stretch essential for the function and structural integrity of the RasGEF family. Ser643 is homologous to SOS residue Leu609, which, in the three-dimensional model, interacts with the RasGEF domain of SOS (28Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The other phosphorylated serines (residues 691, 745, 793/794, 798, 822, and 849) are clustered around the PEST motifs in the most divergent region of GRF1 and GRF2, in which the weak homology is associated with a variable extension of the PEST motifs. Of these residues, serine 798 is not conserved whereas residues 793/794 and 822 are conserved in all known GRF1 but not in GRF2, like Ser916. It is possible that they have a regulatory function specific for GRF1. Worth mentioning, GRF1 and GRF2 are very similar in the primary structure, but different in tissue specificity. Even though residues 691, 745, and 849 are located in a very diverging region, they are serines or threonines in CDC25/GRF1Mm, GRF1rat, GRF1Hs, GRF2Mm, and GRF2Hs. This observation makes it likely that these residues play a functional role such as the interaction with as yet unidentified ligands.PEST motifs are known in a number of cases to constitute targets of signals for proteolytic events (31Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). In the case of CDC25Mm, itsin vitro treatment with the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain was found to lead to the production of C-terminal fragments cleaved in the region of the REM/PEST motifs (13Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, so far, no data have been reported about the half-life of CDC25Mm in the neuronal cell. In this regard, we would like to mention that a newly discovered subclass of evolutionary conserved Ras-like protein, κB-Ras, has recently been shown to interact specifically with a PEST region of the protein ligand IκBβ, decreasing its proteolytic degradation (32Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Noteworthy is also the observation that S. cerevisiae GEFs Cdc25p and Sdc25p display short half-lives in the yeast cell (33Kaplon T. Jacquet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20742-20747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of Ser916, which is in part dependent on the action of PKA (16Mattingly R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37379-37384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), has not been identified in our study. The PKA-dependent phosphorylation of this residue was reported not to induce any relevant effect on the RasGEF activity, whereas the carbachol-dependent phosphorylation of the same residue by an as yet unidentified kinase was necessary for full activation of the exchange factor in vivo. It is probable that the minor importance of the PKA action together with differences in the in vitro approach (in the case of Mattingly (Ref. 16Mattingly R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37379-37384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a short GRF1 fragment of 83 amino acid residues was used) justifies the discrepancy.An important point, that remains to be assessed, is the effect of the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the RasGEF activity of CDC25Mm. From the results in vivo reported by Mattingly and Macara (16Mattingly R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37379-37384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we were expecting a stimulation of the GEF activity of CDC25Mm. However, we could only observe that in vitrophosphorylation of CDC25Mm induces a slight inhibition of the GDP dissociation rate from the Ha-Ras·GDP complex. As already mentioned, this result could be, at least in part, the consequence of the lower phosphorylation efficiency obtained under the conditions required for the functional test. More impressive was the 70% inhibition that we detected by substituting Ser822 with aspartate, a mutation mimicking the negative charge of the phosphate. In contrast, no effect was obtained by replacing Ser745 with aspartate. One should here stress that our analysis, as in most reports dealing with the functional analysis of RasGEF residues, was limited to the function leading to the stimulation of the exchange on Ras proteins. It is possible that Ser745 is involved in other functions not identified as yet. We would like to mention that CDC25Mm has been involved in the mechanisms of long term memory (34Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 35Orban P.C. Chapman P.F. Brambilla R. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 38-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be an important postnatal regulator of the synthesis and release of growth hormone (36Itier J.M. Tremp G.L. Leonard J.F. Multon M.C. Ret G. Schweighoffer F. Tocque B. Bluet-Pajot M.T. Cormier V. Dautry F. Nature. 1998; 393: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The detailed analysis of all the combinations of residues susceptible of phosphorylation in vitro would doubtless contribute to a better comprehension of their functions.Recently, Kiyono et al. (18Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have shown that GRF1 can also be phosphorylated by the nonreceptor kinase Src. This modification slightly enhanced the exchange activity on Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases. In contrast, no effect on the RasGEF activity of GRF1 was observed. Altogether, these observations suggest a very complex situation for the regulation of CDC25Mm/GRF1 activity(ies) by phosphorylating events, in which more than one kind of kinases and several pathways are likely to be involved. The fine tuning of switch molecules like Ras proteins, which are central elements of pathway networks, makes reasonable the existence of several regulatory mechanisms, in which GEF, the factor responsible for the regeneration of the active form of Ras, can be expected to be one of the most important component involved. Ras proteins are molecular switches cycling between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound forms (1Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). They control a series of physiological and pathological events associated with growth and differentiation of the cell. Their activity is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)1 that enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity and by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that accelerate the very slow intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange, favoring thus the regeneration of the active form of Ras. The nucleotide exchange mechanism catalyzed by GEFs has been intensively studied and characterized at a three-dimensional structural level (for review, see Ref. 2Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Diverse RasGEFs have been identified: SOS1 and SOS2, RasGRP, CDC25Mm/GRF1, and GRF2. SOS1 and SOS2 are ubiquitary GEFs and their activation depends on signals from tyrosine kinase receptors (for review, see Ref. 3Schlessinger J. Harvey Lect. 1993; 89: 105-123PubMed Google Scholar). RasGRP is a neuronal RasGEF involved in diacylglycerol and calcium regulation of Ras (4Ebinu J. Bottorff D. Chan E. Stang S. Dunn R. Stone J.

CDC25Mm/GRF1 has been shown to be activated by heterotrimeric G protein coupled receptors, such as muscarinic receptors (6Mattingly R. Macara I.

To define the disulfide bond pattern of this enzyme, we analyzed a soluble form by chemical fragmentation, enzymatic digestion, and mass spectrometry and a full-length form by site-directed mutagenesis. All Cys residues of the lumenal domain of GM2 synthase are disulfide bonded with Cys429 and Cys476 forming a disulfide-bonded pair while Cys80 and Cys82 are disulfide bonded in combination with Cys412 and Cys529. Partial reduction to produce monomers converted Cys80 and Cys82 to free thiols while the Cys429 to Cys476 disulfide remained intact. CNBr cleavage at amino acid 330 produced a monomer-sized band under nonreducing conditions which was converted upon reduction to a 40-kDa fragment and a 24-kDa myc-positive fragment. Double mutation of Cys80 and Cys82 to Ser produced monomers but not dimers. In summary these results demonstrate that Cys429 and Cys476 form an intrasubunit disulfide while the intersubunit disulfides formed by both Cys80 and Cys82 with Cys412 and Cys529 are responsible for formation of the homodimer.

In summary these results demonstrate that Cys429 and Cys476 form an intrasubunit disulfide while the intersubunit disulfides formed by both Cys80 and Cys82 with Cys412 and Cys529 are responsible for formation of the homodimer. This disulfide bond arrangement results in an antiparallel orientation of the catalytic domains of the GM2 synthase homodimer.

The simple gangliosides GM3,1 GD3, and GT3 are the precursors of the a-, b-, and c-series of gangliosides, respectively, and are synthesized by the addition of 1, 2, or 3 molecules of sialic acid to lactosylceramide (LacCer). Complex gangliosides are formed by the addition of GalNAc to simple gangliosides by the action of UDP-GalNAc:lactosylceramide/GM3/GD3 β-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GM2 synthase) followed by the attachment of Gal and additional sialic acid residues (1Van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5341-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GM2 synthase is a key enzyme in ganglioside biosynthesis, controlling the balance between the expression of simple and complex gangliosides (4Van Echten-Deckert G. Sandhoff K. Pinto B.M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. Pergamon, Elsevier Science, New York1998: 87-106Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of GM2 synthase in mice resulted in male sterility (5Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Zhao J.M. Fukumoto S. Yamashiro S. Okada M. Haraguchi M. Shin M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Liu Y.J. Kawai H. Crawford T.O. Proia R.L. Griffin J.W. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7532-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that GM2 synthase is a homodimer formed by disulfide bond(s) in the lumenal domain (7Jaskiewicz E. Zhu G. Bassi R. Darling D.S. Young Jr., W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26395-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The importance of Cys residues of glycosyltransferases has been shown in several functional and structural studies (8Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Holmes E.H. Yen T. Thomas S. Joshi R. Nguyen A. Long T. Gallet F. Maftah A. Julien R. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and also by the fact that the Cys residues of each glycosyltransferase family are conserved in spacing (10Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Clausen H. Bennett E.P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition a few glycosyltransferases have been shown to be disulfide bonded dimers although the majority are monomeric (see “Discussion”). In this report we have utilized protein chemistry experiments, coupled with mass spectrometric analyses, to determine: 1) that all Cys of the soluble form of GM2 synthase are involved in disulfide bonds; and 2) which disulfides are responsible for dimer formation. These results demonstrate that in the dimer the NH2 terminus of one subunit is close to the COOH terminus of the other subunit in space. CHO cell clone GTm1 which stably expresses a soluble form of myc-tagged GM2 synthase was described previously (12Zhu G. Allende M.L. Jaskiewicz E. Qian R. Darling D.S. Worth C.A. Colley K.J. Young Jr., W.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Large scale cell culture was achieved in roller bottles using the serum-free medium CHO-S-SFM II (Life Technologies) according to Kolhekar et al. (13Kolhekar A.S. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Quon A.S.W. Eipper B.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10901-10909Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and in bioreactors at the National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN. The soluble form of GM2 synthase was partially purified from culture supernatants by SP-Sepharose chromatography using a 0–0.25 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mmMnCl2. A sample of the concentrated soluble form of GM2 synthase (0.05 nmol) was treated with a 20-fold molar excess of PEO-maleimide-activated biotin and immediately denatured with 8 m urea. The sample was incubated for 60 min in the dark at room temperature. The concentration of urea in the sample was reduced to 2 m by adding water followed by the addition of trypsin (1/10 ratio, w/w, of trypsin/protein), and the mixture (50 μl) was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Oligosaccharides were released from GM2 synthase by PNGase F treatment. PNGase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm EDTA at pH 7.2 at a concentration of 200 units/ml. PNGase F digestion was performed on tryptic digests of GM2 synthase by adding PNGase F to a final concentration of 20 units/ml and incubating overnight at 37 °C. GM2 synthase digests were separated using a capillary C18 column (150 × 0.18 mm; Nucleosil, 5-μm particle size) and analyzed on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) with a modified electrospray ionization (ESI) source. A detailed scheme of the experimental setup for the LC/ESI-MS/MS analyses is described elsewhere (14Yen T. Joshi R.K. Yan H. Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Macher B.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, a positive voltage of 3 kV was applied to the electrospray needle, and a N2 sheath flow (65 scale) was applied to stabilize the ESI signal. The LC/MS analysis was conducted using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 HPLC system (Palo Alto, CA) coupled to the LCQ. The mobile phase was split before the injector by a Tee-connector, and a flow rate of 2 μl/min was established through the capillary C18 column. The enzymatically digested peptides were eluted from the column using 0.5% formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B) with a three-step linear gradient of 5 to 10% B in the first 10 min, 10 to 35% B in the next 40 min, and 35 to 40% B in the last 5 min. The LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis was accomplished using an automated data acquisition procedure, in which a cyclic series of three different scan modes were performed. Data acquisition was conducted using the full scan mode (m/z300–2000) to obtain the most intense peak (signal > 1.5 × 105 counts) as the precursor ion, followed by a high resolution zoom scan mode to determine the charge state of the precursor ion and an MS/MS scan mode (with a relative collision energy of 38%) to determine the structural fragment ions of the precursor ion. The resulting MS/MS spectra were then searched against a protein data base (Owl) by Sequest to confirm the sequence of tryptic peptides. After analyzing for free Cys-containing peptides, a fraction of the digested protein (40 pmol) was reduced with DTT (dithiothreitol, 200-fold molar excess over protein) at 65 °C for 20 min and alkylated with iodoacetamide (500-fold molar excess) in the dark for 30 min to detect peptides with disulfide-linked Cys residues. The soluble form of GM2 synthase (0.25 nmol) was incubated with 100 mm DTT in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA under nitrogen for 2 h at room temperature after which a 10-fold excess of iodoacetamide (in 0.4 m Tris, pH 8.0) over the DTT content was added, and incubation was continued under nitrogen for an additional 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, Western blotted with anti-myc or stained with Coomassie Blue, bands cut out, and analyzed by in-gel digestion as described below. Coomasssie Blue-stained regions from SDS-PAGE were cut from the gel in ∼1-mm3sections and were taken for tryptic hydrolysis using a modification of the method of Jensen et al. (15Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel was washed using NH4HCO3 and CH3CN, then proteins were reduced where indicated with DTT and alkyated where indicated with iodoacetamide. After washing, proteins were hydrolyzed using modified trypsin (Promega). Differences from the method of Jensenet al. (15Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar) were the use of higher (20 mm) DTT concentration, larger volume (0.1 ml) washes following alkylation and exclusion of calcium from the trypsin mixture. Where indicated samples following trypsin in-gel digestion were deglycosylated with PNGase F (Calbiochem 362185, 2.5 milliunits/μl). PNGase F was diluted to 0.2 milliunits/μl with 50 mmNH4HCO3, added to in-gel digests at a ratio of 1 to 4 (v/v), and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were then taken for thin film spotting for MALDI using α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid as matrix and a nitrocellulose film on stainless steel targets with 1–2 μl spots. Mass spectral data were obtained using a Tof-Spec 2E (Micromass) and a 337-nm N2 laser at 20–35% power in the positive ion linear or reflectron mode, as appropriate. Spectral data were obtained by averaging 10 spectra each of which was the composite of 10 laser firings. Mass axis calibration was accomplished using peaks from tryptic autohydrolysis. Data were analyzed using MassLynx ProteinProbe software and the EMBL SwissProt data base. The soluble form of GM2 synthase (0.1 nmol) was organic-solvent precipitated (16Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3188) Google Scholar). The dried protein pellet was resuspended in 0.04 ml of cleavage solution (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, 0.2% SDS) with or without CNBr (0.5 mstock, Aldrich; final 1.2 mm which was at least a 50-fold molar excess over the Met content) followed by flushing of the reaction tubes with nitrogen, and incubation overnight in the dark at room temperature. Cleavage reactions were diluted 10-fold with water, frozen, and solvent removed by sublimation in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator. The remaining residue was solubilized in nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer by heating at 100 °C for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions, and stained with Coomassie Blue or Western blotted with anti-myc. Bands of interest were cut out and subjected to in-gel digestion and analysis by MALDI-TOF. Bands from nonreducing gels were also cut out of the gel, minced, boiled in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the suspension of gel pieces loaded in the wells of new SDS-PAGE gels. Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length GM2 synthase was performed on a pcDNA3 plasmid containing GM2 synthase/myc cDNA using the Transformer™ Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the mutated construct at the mutation sites was confirmed by DNA sequencing (EPSCoR Sequencing Center, University of Louisville and Biomolecular Research Facility, University of Virginia). Prior to cell transfection, the construct was tested for production of full-length GM2 synthase in vitro using the TnT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Wild-type CHO cells were transfected, and cells stably expressing mutated GM2 synthase/myc were analyzed by anti-myc immunofluorescence screening as described previously (7Jaskiewicz E. Zhu G.

Zwanzig Jr., G.E. Young Jr., W.W. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with anti-GM2 and cholera toxin for in vivo GM2 synthase activity, and cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-myc and in vitro assay for GM2 synthase activity as described elsewhere (7Jaskiewicz E. Zhu G. Bassi R. Darling D.S. Young Jr., W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26395-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Jaskiewicz E. Zhu G. Taatjes D.J. Darling D.S. Zwanzig Jr., G.E. Young Jr., W.W. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The strategy for determining the oxidation state of Cys residues was to alkylate all free Cys with a biotinylated form of maleimide under denaturing conditions, reduce and alkylate with iodoacetamide all other Cys, digest with trypsin and PNGase F, and analyze by LC/MS (14Yen T. Joshi R.K. Yan H. Seto N.O.L. Palcic M.M. Macher B.A. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 990-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When the soluble form of GM2 synthase was analyzed in this way, no biotinylated peptides were found, suggesting that no Cys residues with free thiol groups were present. Instead, five peptides were identified which contained alkylated Cys, and the sequence of each tryptic peptide was validated by MS/MS analysis. Thus, the following peptides were identified with reduced and alkylated Cys residues (all residue numbers refer to the position in full-length GM2 synthase): amino acids 69–95 containing Cys residues 80 and 82, 398–414 containing Cys residue 412, 418–442 containing Cys residue 429, 473–486 containing Cys residue 476, and 527–533 (plus the residues P and EQK of the myc tag) containing Cys residue 529. Fig. 1 shows the MS/MS spectrum for the reduced and alkylated peptide 398–414 as an example. As shown in this figure, fragment ions were produced at various sites along the peptide via peptide bond cleavage. Both COOH-terminal yn (n = 8–15) and NH2-terminal bn (n = 3, 5, 6, and 12) ions can clearly be identified in the spectrum. Fragment ion assignments are shown in the peptide structure of Fig. 1.Figure 3Partial reduction studies of the disulfide-coupled peptides 418–442 and 473–486.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) are shown, confirming the sequence (amino acids 398–414) and Cys412 alkylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) LC/MS analysis of a tryptic digest of unreduced GM2 synthase produced a triply charged ion at m/z 1373.5 and a quadruply charged ion atm/z 1030.8 (Fig. 2 A). These ions correspond to a disulfide-bonded tryptic dipeptide containing amino acids 418–442 and 473–486. The observed ion (4118.4) is equal to the mass of these two peptides minus the mass of two protons which are lost as the result of the disulfide bond formed, divided by the charge state (i.e. 3 or 4) of the ion. Thus, the molecular weight of peptide 418–442 is equal to 2718.1, and that of peptide 473–486 is 1402.6. Linking these peptides via a disulfide bond generates a dipeptide with an average mass of 4118.7, in good agreement with the measured mass of 4118.4. MS/MS analysis of the triply charged ion atm/z 1373.5 (Fig. 2 B) produced a spectrum with dominant fragments of (Y14y16)2+ atm/z = 1548.7, (Y13y22)2+ atm/z = 1838.9, (Y13y19)2+ atm/z = 1649.9, and y9 atm/z = 1022.6. These ions were either generated from the COOH terminus of the peptide containing amino acids 418–442 (denoted as y9), or from the COOH terminus of the peptide 418–442 (denoted as y16, y19, and y22) in combination with amino acids 473–486 at the COOH terminus of the peptide (denoted as Y13 and Y14). The observed fragment peaks atm/z 1367.9 and 1305.7 in Fig. 2 B also matched well with the calculated masses for the fragments (M +3H − 18)3+ and (Y14y23)3+, respectively. These data provided a complete verification of the proposed disulfide-bonded tryptic peptide pair. To confirm this disulfide assignment, the GM2 synthase dimer separated on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel was cut from the gel, in-gel digested with trypsin followed by PNGase F, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The dipeptide containing the Cys429-Cys476disulfide was detected at 4118 (Fig. 3 A). In addition a small peak consistent with a free thiol for the peptide containing Cys412 was also detectable (data not shown). However, that ion could be explained by the report of Patterson and Katta (18Patterson S.D. Katta V. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3727-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that disulfide-linked peptides could be fragmented to reduced forms of peptides during MALDI-TOF. To prove that point, the sample was alkylated with iodoacetamide and reanalyzed. The same small peak for free thiol at Cys412 was still present indicating that it was not present prior to MALDI-TOF but instead was generated during MALDI-TOF. Thus, Cys429 and Cys476 form one disulfide bond. Evidence for a second disulfide bonded set of tryptic peptides came from the presence of ions with 3 and 4 positive charges atm/z 1950.2 and 1462.8 (average (M + H)+ ion at 5848.6) (Fig. 4 A). These ions are consistent with the presence of a tripeptide composed of peptides linked via disulfide bonds, containing amino acids 69–95 (Mr = 2835.2), 398–414 (Mr = 1724.0), and 527–533 plus the Pro and EQK of the myc epitope at the C terminus (Mr = 1291.5 for LQCMTSQPEQK) with a calculated (M + H) = 5847.7. MS/MS analysis of the quadruply charged ion atm/z = 1462.8 (Fig. 4 B) showed that the dominant triply charged fragments, (Bx11B17b22)3+, (Yx11B16y22)3+, and (Bx11B17b23)3+ were generated from the COOH or NH2 terminus of amino acids 527–533 plus PEQK (denoted as Yx11 and Bx11), the NH2 terminus of amino acids 398–414 (denoted as B16 and B17), and the COOH or NH2terminus of amino acids 69–95 (denoted as y22, b22, and b23) consistent with the proposed disulfide-bonded tripeptide structure. The results presented in these figures support the proposed tripeptide structure in which Cys80 and Cys82 are disulfide bonded to Cys412 and Cys529. Haraguchiet al. (19Haraguchi M. Yamashiro S. Furukawa K. Takamiya K. Shiku H. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) found that all three potentialN-glycosylation sites of GM2 synthase were utilized duringin vitro transcription/translation. Similarly, our data indicate that all three sites are occupied in the soluble form of GM2 synthase. Specifically, the measured mass (M + H) for the doubly charged ion at m/z 1475.1 and triply charged ion at m/z 983.9 of the peptide (containing alkylated Cys residues 80 and 82 amino acids 69–95) was 2950 (Fig. 5 A), rather than 2949 demonstrating that Asn79 was converted to Asp79by PNGase F. Moreover, the MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged ion atm/z 1475.1 (Fig. 5 B) for this peptide confirmed that Asn79 had been converted to Asp since the difference between the mass of the NH2-terminal fragments b10 at m/z 1110.7 (containing amino acids 69–78) and b11 at m/z 1225.6 (containing amino acids 69–79) is 114.9 (mass for Asp) rather than 114 (mass for Asn). In addition, MALDI-TOF analyses after PNGase F treatment also demonstrated the appearance of peptides containing Asn179 and Asn274, indicating that those residues were glycosylated (Fig. 6). Moreover, in the reflectron mode the detected mass for the latter peptide was 2503.28 rather than the calculated mass of 2502.36 demonstrating that Asn274 was converted to Asp274 by PNGase F (data not shown).Figure 6Glycosylation sites are occupied.Peptides generated from in-gel tryptic digests of the GM2 synthase dimer band were further treated with PNGase F to demonstrate sites of glycosylation. MALDI-TOF (linear) spectra show peptides at 6109.5 Da (containing Asn179) and 2504.4 Da (containing Asn274) after hydrolysis (panel B), but not before (panel A). In addition the mass at 4118 Da consists of the Cys429 to Cys476 dipeptide shown also in Figs. 2 and 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the disulfide pairs identified above, there are seven possible models for the intersubunit disulfide bonds responsible for dimer formation. These models include the following combinations of intersubunit bonds: 1) Cys429 to Cys476; 2) one or both of the disulfides connecting Cys80 and Cys82 with Cys412 and Cys529; or 3) both 1 and 2. To distinguish inter- from intrasubunit disulfides, initially we tested specific proteases to generate diagnostic fragments such as caspase 3 cleavage at residue 315 and furin cleavage at 414, but neither protease cleaved GM2 synthase (data not shown). Therefore, we resorted to two alternative strategies, partial reduction and CNBr cleavage. Our rationale for partial reduction was to reduce GM2 synthase without denaturation so that the more accessible intersubunit disulfide(s) would be reduced whereas the less accessible intrasubunit disulfide(s) would remain intact. Treatment with 100 mm DTT followed by alkylation converted all of the GM2 synthase dimer to the monomer (Fig. 7 E). LC/MS of the tryptic digest of this partially reduced sample (data not shown) revealed the triply charged ion at m/z 1373.5 (monoisotopic (M + H)+ ion at 4117.3) described above (Fig. 2 A) which is the result of a disulfide-bonded tryptic dipeptide containing amino acids 418–442 and 473–486. MS/MS analysis of this species (data not shown) verified the structure of this tryptic peptide pair as described above (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, we cut out the monomer band produced by partial reduction and performed in-gel digestion followed by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 3 B). The Cys 429–476 dipeptide was detected at 4118.8 in agreement with the LC/MS data. Following complete reduction, this dipeptide band disappeared (Fig. 3 C). In the partially reduced sample there were also ions at 4175.7 and 4232.8. Since these differed from the dipeptide peak and from each other by an average of 57 atomic mass unit, they are due to addition of acetamide. Since these two peptides contain three His, it is likely that these bands are due to alkylation of these His as described previously (20Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2413-2420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Aspray T.E. Riihimaki G.M. Wolfe R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1576-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at least a portion of the disulfide bond between Cys429 and Cys476remained intact under conditions in which dimer was converted to monomer, meaning that the Cys429–476 disulfide must be an intrasubunit bond. LC/MS of the partially reduced and alkylated sample also detected a doubly charged ion at m/z 1475.4 (monoisotopic (M + H)+ ion at 2948.4) which is the tryptic peptide containing amino acids 69–95 as verified by MS/MS analysis (data not shown; the results were identical to those shown in Fig. 5,A and B). Thus, Cys80 and Cys82 were both reduced and alkylated by the partial reduction conditions, indicating the likelihood that both participate in intersubunit disulfide bonds. Ions for peptides containing alkylated Cys412 and Cys529 were not detected following partial reduction and alkylation. In summary based on the partial reduction experiments, we eliminated any models for GM2 synthase intersubunit disulfide bonds that included Cys429 to Cys476 disulfides as intersubunit bonds. We next used cleavage with CNBr to further identify the intersubunit disulfide bonds. The soluble form of GM2 synthase contains three Met residues at positions 330, 515, and 530 (numbers refer to the position in the full-length enzyme with the amino terminus of the soluble form corresponding to residue 21 of the full-length enzyme). Treatment with CNBr when analyzed under nonreducing conditions produced a monomer-sized band while considerable dimer remained (Fig. 7 B, lane 3). When the sample was run under reducing conditions (Fig. 7 B, lane 6), considerable monomer remained indicating that cleavage with CNBr had not been efficient. The low efficiency of cleavage may have been due to the unusual conditions used for fragmentation which were originally chosen to ensure retention of a photoaffinity probe used for other studies. 2J. Li, manuscript in preparation. CNBr cleavage when analyzed under reducing conditions should produce fragments of GM2 synthase of about 40 kDa (amino acids 21–330, with the precise molecular mass depending on the actual Asn-linked oligosaccharide structures attached at residues 79, 179, and 274), 20.5 kDa (amino acids 331–515), 1.9 kDa (amino acids 516–530), and 1.6 kDa (amino acids 531–544 which includes the myc epitope). However, if CNBr only cut at residue 330, then amyc-positive, 24-kDa fragment consisting of residues 331–544 plus a 40-kDa fragment consisting of residues 21–330 would be present under reducing conditions. In fact CNBr did produce a set of bands ranging from about 20 to 24 kDa plus a 40-kDa band when analyzed under reducing conditions (Fig. 7 B, lane 6). However, the most abundant band among the set of 20–24-kDa fragments was the 24-kDa fragment which was myc-positive (Fig. 7 C, lane 3) by Western blotting indicating that in fact it contained an intact COOH terminus. It was this 24-kDa myc-positive fragment that resulted from single cleavage at 330 that enabled us to define the intersubunit disulfide pattern as described below. We should also note that we attribute the preferential CNBr cleavage at residue 330 to the generally inefficient cleavage conditions that we used as well as to the documented sluggish cleavage that occurs at Met-Thr (23Lea"

DNase footprinting has revealed the presence of another region of interaction with nuclear factors (named F2) immediately downstream of the Sp1 sites. This region has been found to be functional since it is capable of stimulating the minimal promoter. The F2 protection is completely and specifically competed by an AP2 consensus oligonucleotide that has been proved to bind AP2α exclusively. However, the AP2α recombinant protein was unable to bind the F2 region directly, thus suggesting that AP2α may participate in F2 protection by protein-protein interactions with other nuclear factors. The minimal promoter has been shown to be stimulated by two additional regions, one located downstream of F2 and the other upstream of the minimal promoter itself. In neuronal cells, the combined stimulatory activities of these three regions have synergistic effects, whereas in non-neuronal cells, there is a negative interference between the upstream and downstream regions. These opposite transcriptional effects may account for at least part of the neuro-specific expression profile of the α3gene.

Neuronal cholinergic-nicotinic receptors consist of subunits whose anatomical distribution and developmental regulation represent an attractive model for addressing such crucial questions (1Gotti C.

Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 213-246Crossref Google Scholar). These molecules form a family of acetylcholine-gated cation channels, expressed in the autonomic and sensory ganglia, the adrenal medulla, and in distinct areas of the central nervous system, with a quaternary structure consisting of five transmembrane subunits assembled around a central channel. Eleven distinct neuronal nicotinic subunits have been cloned so far and classified into two subfamilies of eight α (α2–α9) and three β subunits (β2–β4) (1Gotti C. Fornasari D. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. ( New York ). 1997; 53: 199-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 4Lindstrom J. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 101-162Crossref Google Scholar). In heterologous expression systems, α7, α8, and α9 are the subunits that can form homomeric receptors, whereas α2, α3, α4, and α6 always need to be coexpressed with β2, β3, or β4 in order to generate functional channels. The α3 subunit is abundantly expressed in the post-ganglionic neurons of the autonomic nervous system (5Cimino M. Marini P. Fornasari D. Cattabeni F. Clementi F. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Sargent P.B. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 163-192Crossref Google Scholar) where it participates as a ligand-binding subunit in the formation of the ganglionic type nicotinic receptor, whose activation generates the fast excitatory post-synaptic potential (7Berg D.K.

By means of computer-assisted analysis, multiple putative Sp1-binding sites were localized upstream of the cluster of transcription initiation sites, in a very GC-rich region that did not contain any TATA or CAAT box (Fig. 1).Figure 1Sequence of the 0.35-kbBglII-NcoI region containing the human α3 promoter.

In the field of nicotinic receptors, all of the promoters characterized so far (12Fornasari D. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Arneric S.P. Brioni J.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15131-15137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).It is generally believed that in TATA-less promoters and in the absence of functionally equivalent structures such as the initiator, the recruitment of the TATA box-binding protein and consequent formation of the preinitiation complex may be mediated by Sp1 (16Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, the specific functional role and contribution of a given Sp1 site in this kind of promoter is often unpredictable a priori. For instance, in the bovine α5 nicotinic receptor subunit gene promoter, multiple functionally equivalent Sp1 sites cooperate to ensure basal functions (17Campos-Caro A. Carrasco-Serrano C. Valor L.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4693-4701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas the rat α3 promoter contains a unique Sp1 site whose mutation does not abolish the transcriptional activity of the regulatory region (18Yang X. Fyodorov D. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).One crucial aspect of neuronal gene promoter functions concerns the mechanisms of neuro-specific and regional specific expression. The identification of REST/NRSF silencing factor supported the hypothesis that the repression of transcription in non-neuronal tissues is an essential step in the first global restriction of gene expression to neuronal tissues (19Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However REST/NRSF could be proved to regulate or potentially regulate only a subset of neuronal genes (20Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), including the β2 subunit of the nicotinic receptor (21Bessis A. Salmon A.M. Zoli M Le Novere N. Picciotto M. Changeux J.P. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice, the mutation of the REST/NRSF cognatecis-acting element in the context of the β2promoter modifies the expression profile of this gene in the central nervous system but does not switch on its transcription in non-neuronal tissues (22Bessis A. Champtiaux N. Chatelin L. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5906-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), pointing out the role of positive transcriptional mechanisms specifically operating in neuronal cells.In the present study, we define the human α3 minimal promoter, and we demonstrate the essential role of the members of the Sp family in its activity and the contribution of AP2α factor in its regulation. We also present evidence that the neuro-specific expression of the α3 gene relies on the complex synergistic interactions of three regulatory regions with the minimal promoter, although none of the individual regions nor the minimal promoter have an intrinsic tissue-specific activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study we describe the characterization of a 60-bp sequence (BsiWI-AccIII) in the 5′-flanking region of the human α3 nicotinic receptor subunit gene, which has the features of a minimal promoter. Its removal dramatically affected the transcriptional activity of a previously characterized 350-bpBglII-NcoI construct, as well as that of a construct containing the entire β4–α3intergenic region (data not shown), whereas it retained some transcriptional activity and could be independently stimulated by the upstream and downstream regions, thus indicating that it contains the basal elements required for transcription initiation.DNase protection and EMSA analyses of theBsiWI-AccIII region led to the identification of two sites (A and B) that are both capable of binding Sp1 and Sp1-related factors, although with apparently different affinity. However, mutation analyses revealed that the site A was essential for the activity of the entire BglII-NcoI region and probably accounted for the critical role of the 60-bp region in this context, whereas the mutation of the site B, which actually reduced thein vitro binding of Sp1 factors to the 60-bp region, did not affect the functional activity of the promoter. Site B therefore seems to be dispensable under the basal conditions under which we tested the effects of its mutation, but it may play a role under stimulated conditions, when other factors may be recruited at the promoter and interact with Sp1 or Sp1-related factors on site B.The data obtained with site A confirmed that Sp1 plays a critical role in the transcription initiation of GC-rich TATA-less multistart site promoters such as the human α3 nicotinic receptor subunit gene. The regulation of these promoters is poorly understood. Sp1 is known to interact with multiple components of the transcriptional machinery, such as TATA box-binding protein (16Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), TAF55 (28Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G.

Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and may therefore play a critical role in the formation/recruitment of the pre-initiation complex on these promoters. Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor; its activity is generally constitutive, but it can be directly regulated byO-glycosylation (33Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation (34Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25879-25884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or by interactions with others factors. A number of transcription factors have been documented as acting in combination with Sp1 or promoting its displacement from an overlapping site (35Chen T.T. Wu R.L. Castro-Munozledo F. Sun T.T. Mol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Among these, Sp3 and Sp4 belong to the same family as Sp1 and are closely related to it (42Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 43Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 share a highly homologous DNA binding domain that recognizes the same sequences in vitro with identical affinities. Sp3 is ubiquitously expressed and generally acts as a repressor by competing with Sp1 binding to the same sequence (44Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 45Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L.

Sp4 is found in many cell lines, but in vivo, its mRNA is abundant in the brain and barely detectable in other organs. It generally acts as an activator, but it can also repress Sp1-activated transcription in the same way as Sp3 (47Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edemberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 48Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the cell content of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 is a critical factor influencing the transcription of Sp1-dependent promoters, such as the housekeeping gene promoters (47Kwon H.S. Kim M.S. Edemberg H.J. Hur M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both the A and B Sp1-binding sites identified in the α3 promoter also bind to Sp3 and Sp4 in vitro, and so these factors might participate in the regulation of the α3 promoter by competing or cooperating with Sp1.By using DNase protection assays, we identified another region of interaction with nuclear factors (F2), which is located immediately downstream of sites A and B. The F2-protected region directly activates the minimal promoter and also participates in its regulation in the context of the 0.35-bp BglII-NcoI region. Competitive footprinting showed that the F2-protected region was entirely and specifically competed by an AP2 consensus oligonucleotide that exclusively binds the AP2α nuclear factor. However, unexpectedly, the AP2α recombinant protein could not directly bind the F2 region in footprinting experiments, and no binding of nuclear AP2α to the F2 sequence was detected by EMSA.These findings suggest a model in which AP2α participate in F2 protection by means of an indirect mechanism involving protein-protein interactions with other nuclear factors.AP2α was originally isolated as a sequence-specific transcription factor binding to the enhancer regions of SV40 and human metallothionein IIA genes (49Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). It is expressed in neural crest lineages, in which it plays fundamental functions during mammalian embryogenesis and, specifically, in the morphogenesis of the peripheral nervous system (50Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby W.J. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is also known to be activated by treatment with phorbol esters and agents that increase cAMP levels, thus suggesting that external stimuli can influence its functions (51Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar).Functional AP2-binding sites have been described in many viral and cellular regulatory regions (52Park K. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17811-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Johnson W. Albanese C. Handwerger S. Williams T. Pestell R. Jameson J.L. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that AP2α can regulate gene expression independently from DNA binding by means of heteromerization with other transcription factors. These interactions can lead to the inhibition (55Gaubatz S. Imhof A. Dosch R. Werner O. Mitchell P. Buettner R. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1508-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 56Somasundaram K. Jayaraman G. Williams T. Moran E. Frisch S. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1402-1416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the interacting factor, thus suggesting that AP2α is capable of regulating gene transcription either as a sequence-specific regulator or as a cofactor that controls the activity of other nuclear proteins.It is interesting that the binding sites identified by the AP2α recombinant protein did not seem to interact with the endogenous nuclear AP2α factor. This may be due to competition with other sequence-specific factors recognizing overlapping elements; however, mechanisms involving the sequestering of endogenous AP2α by other nuclear proteins or post-translational modifications affecting its DNA binding specificity might also be considered, as already suggested in the literature (49Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 51Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).In order to understand how the ubiquitous activity of the 60-bp minimal promoter is re-directed in such a way that the expression of the α3 gene is mainly confined to the neural phenotype, we studied the effects exerted by the upstream (100-bpBglII-BsiWI) and downstream regions (20-bpAccIII-SacII, essential for F2 protection, and 180-bp SacII-NcoI) on the activity of theBsiWI-AccIII region in SY5Y and HeLa cells. In both cell lines, all three regions independently activated the minimal promoter, whereas different results were obtained when more than one region was present. In SY5Y cells, the combined stimulatory effects of the upstream and downstream regions were greater than the sum of the transcriptional activities conferred by the individual regions. This synergistic activation of the minimal promoter seemed to depend on the presence of all three regions, since each downstream region alone appeared to produce only additive effects in combination with the upstream sequence.In HeLa cells, the activity exerted by the upstream and downstream regions together was less than the sum of their activities; this was apparently due to negative interference between theSacII-NcoI and the upstream region, since together their activity was even lower than that of each sequence alone. These findings indicate that opposite interactions occur between the regions upstream and downstream of the minimal promoter in SY5Y and HeLa cells. The synergistic interactions described in SY5Y have also been found in SK-N-BE, another neuroblastoma cell line, but not in any of the other cell lines analyzed so far: those not expressing the α3 endogenous gene, HeLa TE671 (8Fornasari D. Battaglioli E. Flora A. Terzano S. Clementi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), K562 (24Battaglioli E. Gotti C. Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 7: 1261-1270Google Scholar), DAOY, 2E. Battaglioli, unpublished results. or non-neuronal cells expressing the α3 endogenous gene, such as the MOLT4 T-lymphocyte cell line (24Battaglioli E. Gotti C. Terzano S. Flora A. Clementi F. Fornasari D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 7: 1261-1270Google Scholar). This may therefore be a specific mechanism for controlling α3 gene expression in neurons, which may rely on a neuro-specific TAF/cofactor that mediates the synergistic activation of the α3 minimal promoter by non-tissue-specific activators bound upstream and downstream of it. HeLa cells may simply lack this cofactor or may even contain a specific corepressor mediating a negative interference occurring between the two regulatory regions.Sequence-specific transcription factors can make direct contacts with different components of the transcriptional machinery (in particular with specific TAFIIs) thus allowing the TFIID complex to integrate multiple signals from different regulators (59Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 60Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). TAFIIs are core promoter-selective and can be expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, so that they can account for tissue-specific gene regulation. Recent studies indicate that a sequence-specific regulator can interact with both coactivator and corepressor complexes which in turn either stimulate or inhibit the formation or the activity of the pre-initiation complex (61Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 62Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The alternative binding of non-tissue-specific transcription factors to tissue-specific coactivators or corepressors may therefore provide a simple and flexible mechanism for restricting gene expression to specific cell types.We propose as a working hypothesis that this kind of mechanism might be responsible for the specific expression of the human α3nicotinic receptor subunit gene in neuronal cells. The identification of the genetic mechanisms underlying the expression of neural genes is rapidly becoming an invaluable approach for developing our understanding of the generation and maintenance of distinct neural phenotypes. Neuronal cholinergic-nicotinic receptors consist of subunits whose anatomical distribution and developmental regulation represent an attractive model for addressing such crucial questions (1Gotti C. Fornasari D. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. ( New York ). 1997; 53: 199-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 2Zoli M. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 13-30Crossref Google Scholar, 3Zoli M. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 213-246Crossref Google Scholar). These molecules form a family of acetylcholine-gated cation channels, expressed in the autonomic and sensory ganglia, the adrenal medulla, and in distinct areas of the central nervous system, with a quaternary structure consisting of five transmembrane subunits assembled around a central channel. Eleven distinct neuronal nicotinic subunits have been cloned so far and classified into two subfamilies of eight α (α2–α9) and three β subunits (β2–β4) (1Gotti C. Fornasari D. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. ( New York ). 1997; 53: 199-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 4Lindstrom J. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 101-162Crossref Google Scholar). In heterologous expression systems, α7, α8, and α9 are the subunits that can form homomeric receptors, whereas α2, α3, α4, and α6 always need to be coexpressed with β2, β3, or β4 in order to generate functional channels. The α3 subunit is abundantly expressed in the post-ganglionic neurons of the autonomic nervous system (5Cimino M. Marini P. Fornasari D. Cattabeni F. Clementi F. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Sargent P.B. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 163-192Crossref Google Scholar) where it participates as a ligand-binding subunit in the formation of the ganglionic type nicotinic receptor, whose activation generates the fast excitatory post-synaptic potential (7Berg D.K. Shoop R.D. Chang K.T. Cuevas J. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 144: 247-267Crossref Google Scholar). In a previous characterization of the 5′-regulatory sequences of the human α3 nicotinic receptor subunit gene, we identified a 350-bp1 region immediately upstream of the start codon that had the structural features of a multiple start site promoter and consistent transcriptional activity in neuronal cell lines (8Fornasari D.

By means of computer-assisted analysis, multiple putative Sp1-binding sites were localized upstream of the cluster of transcription initiation sites, in a very GC-rich region that did not contain any TATA or CAAT box (Fig. 1). A growing body of information on promoter structures has strengthened the idea that these features are common to several genes expressed in the nervous system (9Bai G. Norton D.D. Prenger M.S.

It is generally believed that in TATA-less promoters and in the absence of functionally equivalent structures such as the initiator, the recruitment of the TATA box-binding protein and consequent formation of the preinitiation complex may be mediated by Sp1 (16Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, the specific functional role and contribution of a given Sp1 site in this kind of promoter is often unpredictable a priori. For instance, in the bovine α5 nicotinic receptor subunit gene promoter, multiple functionally equivalent Sp1 sites cooperate to ensure basal functions (17Campos-Caro A. Carrasco-Serrano C.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 2Trybus K.M. Naroditskaya V. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which inhibition of activity is obtained is thought to involve numerous interactions within the molecule, including interactions between the two heads (4Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and between the heads and the myosin rod (5Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Within the heads, the nature of the RLC itself is important, as substitution of the skeletal RLC for the smooth RLC completely locks the system “off” (6Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the motor domain is important for regulation, because we have shown that not all motor domains can be regulated simply by attachment of the smooth muscle neck and light chains (2Trybus K.M. Naroditskaya V. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18423-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, we have suggested that smooth muscle-specific sequences near the motor domain may contribute to the proper positioning of the light chains that is critical to facilitate the RLC-rod-head interactions necessary for achieving a completely off state in the absence of RLC phosphorylation (2Trybus K.M. Naroditskaya V. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18423-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, creation of the fully inhibited state of smooth muscle myosin likely begins with interactions that are facilitated by the two native dephosphorylated RLCs, which are then stabilized by interactions between the myosin rod and both heads. The observation that proteolytically prepared single-headed myosin does not achieve the enzymatically off state in the absence of RLC phosphorylation established that head-head interactions are needed for regulation (4Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, this study did not address the issue of which part of the head is involved in the interactions. A number of lines of evidence have led to the proposal that there must be interactions between the two light chain binding domains of the heads (3Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Kar S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Katoh T. Morita F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 233: 123-131Google Scholar). If these are the most important interactions for regulation, then it might be possible to preserve regulation by eliminating one of the two smooth muscle myosin motor domains, while retaining one or both of the light chain binding domains of that head, as well as the complete second head. In contrast, the recently published structure of the smooth muscle HMM regulatory complex derived from two-dimensional crystals reveals interactions between the motor domains but not between the two light chain binding domains (8Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether interactions between the light chain binding domains can confer a high degree of regulation, we constructed a series of asymmetric HMMs and assessed the degree of regulation conferred on these constructs by RLC phosphorylation. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the asymmetric HMM constucts that were created. In each case, the expression involved co-expression of two different heavy chain constructs, derived from the chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin cDNA (9Yanagisawa M. Hamada Y. Katsuragawa Y. Imamura M. Mikawa T. Masaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The first construct, which was co-expressed in all cases, began at amino acid 1 and ended at amino acid 1112, without a FLAG tag appended to the end. The other heavy chain constructs deleted the motor domain but preserved the coding sequence for both light chain binding sequences (designed to create an asymmetric HMM with a single intact head and an essential light chain and regulatory light chain in place of the second head, designated as SH(ER), i.e. single-headed HMM with binding sites for the ELC and the RLC), the regulatory light chain only (to create SH(R), i.e. single-headed HMM with binding sites for theRLC), or deleted the entire head (used to create SH,i.e. single-headed HMM). The amino acid position that followed the start codon of each of the N-terminal truncations were as follows: Arg788 for SH(ER), Phe812 for SH(R), and Pro849 for SH (complete removal of second head). Following the codon for amino acid 1112 of each of the three N-terminal truncated heavy chains, a FLAG tag was inserted before the stop. Thus the following three different HMM species resulted from co-expression: (a) a two-headed homodimer without a FLAG tag; (b) a homodimer containing no motor domains (i.e. no actin binding) but with two FLAG tags; and (c) the desired asymmetric heterodimer, containing one complete head capable of binding actin, and one heavy chain with a truncated head and FLAG tag at the C terminus. Thus sequential purification involving actin binding followed by binding to an anti-FLAG affinity column could be used to purify the asymmetric species. The HMM-like constructs were used to produce recombinant baculoviruses, as described previously (10Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Stein L. Sellers J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were co-infected with recombinant virus containing chicken smooth ELC (LC17a) and RLC cDNAs and with recombinant viruses coding for the truncated myosin heavy chains. Three days after infection, Sf9 cells were lysed in a high ionic strength buffer containing ATP, dithiothreitol, Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors. This was followed by low-speed centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and overnight dialysis at 4 °C in the presence of F-actin, and hexokinase and glucose to remove ATP. Dialysis was followed by centrifugation at 500,000 × gfor 20 min, which pelleted the F-actin-HMM complexes. The pellet was washed and then resuspended in a buffer containing 1 mmMgATP to dissociate the HMM. The F-actin was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed and passed through an anti-FLAG epitope antibody affinity column. In this manner, only HMM that bound and released from actin and that contained a C-terminal FLAG epitope bound to the column. The HMM was eluted via FLAG peptide competition. Actin was purified from rabbit back and leg skeletal muscles, following the procedure of Spudich and Watt (11Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) method of assay. Purity of all myosin and actin preparations was confirmed on 10% discontinuous SDS polyacrylamide gels (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). Single-headed myosin was prepared by limited papain digestion of chicken gizzard myosin prepared from tissue, as described in Tyska et al. (14Tyska M.J. Dupuis D.E. Guilford W.H. Patlak J.B. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4402-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Data from such a preparation is included for comparison to the expressed single-headed HMM, SH. Myosin was incubated with 2 μm calmodulin, 100 μm CaCl2, and 0.15 μm skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase in the presence of 1 mm MgATP for 30 min. This achieved high levels of regulatory light chain phosphorylation (>90%). Levels of HMM phosphorylation for each preparation were determined using glycerol/urea gels (15Perrie W. Smillie L. Perry S. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The actin-activated ATPase assays involved the measurement of the rate of radioactive P32 generation from γ-phosphate-labeled ATP, by the method of Pollard (16Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The conditions of the assay were 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP at 25 °C.Vmax and KATPase were determined from Lineweaver-Burke plots. The actin concentration used was over the range of 0–150 μm. Assays for determination of the potassium EDTA-ATPase activity followed the methodology of Pollard (16Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rotary-shadowed platinum images were obtained in 0.5 m ammonium aceteate, 66% glycerol and observed with a Philips EM301 electron microscope operated at 60 kV (17Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The motility assay was performed at 30 °C in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% methylcellulose, using monoclonal antibody S2.2 for attachment of the HMM (18Trybus K.M. Henry L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2879-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For single-headed myosin, the conditions were 30 °C in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.7% methylcellulose, with the myosin directly attached to the nitrocellulose. Acto-HMM or acto-SH(ER) was mixed with 50 or 100 μm ADP in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. The actin concentration prior to mixing was 5 μm, and the SH(ER) concentration was 2 μm. For experiments with HMM, the actin concentration was increased to 10 μm, and the HMM concentration was 1 μm. The acto-HMM.ADP (or acto-SH(ER).ADP) was rapidly mixed with a 2 mm MgATP using stopped-flow techniques (10Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Stein L. Sellers J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The rate of dissociation of acto-HMM by ATP as measured by light scattering was assumed to be rate-limited by the rate of ADP dissociation from the active site. Three asymmetric variants of HMM, shown diagramatically in Fig. 1, were produced by expression using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Each construct contains one intact heavy chain and one truncated heavy chain. No construct has two motor domains. Depending on the nature of the truncated heavy chain (see “Materials and Methods” for details), there is either no light chain binding domain, a truncated light chain binding domain that binds only the RLC, or a light chain binding domain that binds both ELC and RLC. These three constructs are referred to as SH (single-headed HMM), SH(R) (single-headed HMM with an RLC binding site), or SH(ER) (single-headed HMM with an ELC and RLC binding site), respectively. The gel shown of SH(ER) (Fig. 2 A, right lane) illustrates that the expression and purification scheme described under “Materials and Methods” resulted in the production of an asymmetric HMM, with one intact and one truncated heavy chain, which differ in molecular weight by the expected amount. Rotary shadowing confirmed that the asymmetric constructs contained only one intact myosin head (Fig. 2 B). The potassium EDTA-ATPase revealed that all consturcts had the same extent of intrinsic ATPase activity (TableI). The actin-activated ATPase activities revealed that none of the asymmetric constructs were fully regulated by RLC phosphorylation. As reported in Table I, the dephosphorylated species all had significant activity at actin concentrations between 5 and 50 μm actin. At 50 μm actin, SH(ER) shows approximately a 2-fold increase in activity as a consequence of RLC phosphorylation. However, the KATPase values for all of the single-headed constructs were significantly elevated compared with the two-headed construct and precluded determination of theVmax values for the actin-activated ATPase activity. Thus we only can conclude that there is not complete regulation of any of the asymmetric constructs as assessed by ATPase activity but cannot determine what, if any, degree of regulation is maintained at high actin concentrations. This same increase in KATPase was seen for a single-headed construct ofDictyostelium myosin II (the full-length myosin equivalent of our SH construct) (19Ito K. Liu X. Katayama E. Uyeda T.Q.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 985-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which prevented an accurate determination of the ATPase Vmax of the single-headed myosin in that study. Those authors suggested that this was indicative of cooperativity between the myosin heads that is lost in the one-headed constuct.Table IKinetic parameters for HMM-like constructs with and without RLC phosphorylationHMM-like construct (± RLC phosphorylation)K(EDTA) ATPaseActin-activated ATPase (50 μm actin)Rate of ADP release from actomyosins−1 per heads−1 per heads−1HMM − RLC phos.1.9 ± 0.30.0180 ± 4HMM + RLC phos.2.0 ± 0.41.26 ± 0.1282 ± 6SH(ER) − RLC phos.1.8 ± 0.40.34 ± 0.0829 ± 6 1-aDerived from slower rate of a two-exponential fit (see Fig. 4).SH(ER) + RLC phos.1.9 ± 0.50.70 ± 0.0784 ± 8SH(R) − RLC phos.1.5 ± 0.40.45 ± 0.06NDSH(R) + RLC phos.1.7 ± 0.50.50 ± 0.09NDSH − RLC phos.1.5 ± 0.60.57 ± 0.08NDSH + RLC phos.1.5 ± 0.70.65 ± 0.14NDPhos., phosphorylation; ND, not determined.1-a Derived from slower rate of a two-exponential fit (see Fig. 4). Open table in a new tab Phos., phosphorylation; ND, not determined. In vitro motility provides another way to quantify the degree of regulation that is maintained in each of our asymmetric constructs. The in vitro motility values summarized in Fig. 3 reveal that only SH(ER) did not support actin filament movement in the absence of RLC phosphorylation. The average in vitro motility value of the phosphorylated SH(ER) was approximately 30–40% of that obtained with double-headed HMM. The lowered motility of the single-headed species was also observed with single-headed myosin that was prepared by proteolysis of tissue-purified myosin. Phosphorylated single-headed myosin moved actin at ∼40% the rate of the phosphorylated double-headed myosin (0.49 ± 0.13 μm/sec versus 1.30 ± 0.16 for the control; note that these data were obtained at slightly higher salt conditions where movement is faster; see “Materials and Methods”). This is also consistent with previous studies of single-headed, full-length myosin II species that have shown between a 50 (Dictyostelium myosin II; Ref. 19Ito K. Liu X. Katayama E. Uyeda T.Q.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 985-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and 30% (smooth muscle myosin II; Ref. 4Cremo C.R. Sellers J.R. Facemyer K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2171-2175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) decrease in in vitro motility. Furthermore, the single-headed Dictyostelium myosin II results in severely impaired in vivo function (20Burns C.G. Larochelle D.A. Erickson H. Reedy M. DeLozanne A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8244-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fact that the single-headed asymmetric molecules display reduced in vitro motility suggests that either the rod provides residual inhibition in the absence of a complete second head or that cooperative interactions between the heads are necessary for maximal motility. A decreased motility for single-headed myosin is not seen for skeletal muscle myosin (21Harada Y. Noguchi A. Kishino A. Yanagida T. Nature. 1987; 326: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be a property of regulated myosins. How can one reconcile the apparent differences in the degree of regulation obtained with ATPase assays versus motility assays in the case of SH(ER)? First, it is more likely that the lowered actin-activated ATPase activity and motility of all of the single-headed constructs represent a partial inhibition because of head-rod interactions, rather than a loss of cooperativity. This assertion is based on the fact that smooth muscle myosin S1 has the same actin-activated ATPase activity (per head) and nearly the same motility as HMM. Thus it is likely that residual partial inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity and motility exists in the single-headed constructs with and without phosphorylation. What is the physical meaning of this partial regulation? Partial regulation of the asymmetric mutants may result from either simply slowing the rate of the weak to strong transition on actin, or, more likely, it may result from shifting the equilibrium of an off state and an “on” state transition that precedes the weak to strong transition on actin. That is to say that complete regulation of intact smooth muscle myosin is achieved by trapping 100% of the molecules in an off state in the absence of phosphorylation (preventing transition 1 in Scheme 1), and RLC phosphorylation shifts the equilibium to 100% in the on state. Thus the activity (per head) is identical between S1 and phosphorylated HMM. In the current study, and likely in other instances where structural modifications have resulted in partially regulated molecules, partial regulation may consist of creating an equilibrium distribution between a completely off and fully on state in which both states are significantly populated, rather than modulating the rate of the weak to strong transition and Pirelease. Applying this logic to the current study, one derives insight from the work of Warshaw et al. (22Warshaw D.M. Derosiers J.M. Work S.S. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), in which motility was determined as a function of the ratio of phosphorylated (on) to dephosphorylated (off) smooth muscle myosin. For motility to be stopped, approximately 85% of the myosin had to be dephosphorylated. Such a mixture would generate an ATPase activity of 15% of fully phosphorylated HMM, which may help explain our observation; no motility of dephophorylated HMM(ER) but with an actin-activated ATPase activity that was 25% of phosphorylated HMM. Additional slowing of dephosphorylated SH(ER) motility may come from a reduction in the rate of ADP release; see below. Thus with SH(ER), the apparent dichotomy in the regulation of ATPase activity versus motility might be explained by 25% of the heads being on at any given time in the absence of RLC phosphorylation and the instantaneous value increasing to 55% (based on the actin-activated ATPase activity) with RLC phosphorylation. An equilibrium distribution between off and on molecules could be the underlying mechanism of the partial regulation by RLC phosphorylation that is normally seen in a variety of myosin II molecules, such asDictyostelium myosin II (19Ito K. Liu X. Katayama E. Uyeda T.Q.P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 985-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Burns C.G. Larochelle D.A. Erickson H. Reedy M. DeLozanne A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8244-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this model may underlie the partial regulation that has been reported for a variety of mutations in smooth muscle myosin, including truncations in the rod (5Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and more recently, phosphorylation of only one head of intact HMM (23Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the case of both Dictyostelium myosin II and smooth muscle HMM with one phosphorylated RLC, the molecules appeared to be more regulated when assessed by motility assays than by actin-activated ATPase activity. In the case of the smooth muscle HMM with one phosphorylated RLC, single-turnover studies were attempted to clarify the nature of the partial regulation (23Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the results of those measurements may not be meaningful if the single RLC-phosphorylated species has a significantly higher KATPase than the doubly phosphorylated species, as is the case for our one-headed versus two-headed constructs. (High actin concentrations cannot be used in single-turnover experiments because of interference from light scattering.) This study demonstrates that full regulation of both ATPase activity and motility can only be obtained with two intact heads, suggesting a role for motor domain interactions in stabilizing the inhibited conformation. This conclusion agrees with recent structural evidence obtained from two-dimensional crystals of smooth muscle HMM, which directly shows interactions between the two motor domains of HMM in the dephosphorylated but not in the phosphorylated state (8Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, we observed significant modulation of activity in the construct with all four light chains and one motor domain (SH(ER)). While this study was under review, another study appeared that assessed the regulation of a smooth muscle myosin construct that is similar to our SH(ER) construct (24Li X.D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The conclusion of that paper was quite different from that in this paper, in that full regulation was claimed for the SH(ER) construct. However, close examination of the data reveals that like our asymmetric constructs, their SH(ER) has decreased actin-activated ATPase and motility compared with wild type. Furthermore, the conditions of their actin-activated ATPase assays depress all values to the extent that it is difficult to distinguish completely off from a low level of on. In reality their SH(ER) construct displayed a 3-fold regulation of actin-activated ATPase activity by phosphorylation, as compared with the 2-fold regulation that we report herein. Phosphorylation-dependent regulation is thought to exert itself by preventing Pi release and the so-called weak to strong transition upon binding to actin. This is the rate-limiting step for steady state actin-activated ATPase activity. Unlike double-headed HMM, the SH(ER) does not prevent this transition in the absence of RLC phosphorylation. On the other hand, the motility of the SH(ER) construct was inhibited by RLC dephosphorylation. The rate-limiting step for in vitro motility is ADP release (10Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Stein L. Sellers J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Siemankowski R.F. White H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5045-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is possible to have a situation where individual, dephosphorylated asymmetric myosin molecules are cycling as measured by ATPase activity but that their rate of ADP release is slowed to the point that movement driven by large numbers of heads attached to an actin filament is greatly reduced. This in vitro scenario is similar to what has been proposed to happen in smooth muscle during a phenomenon termed “latch” (26Cremo C.R. Neuron J.M. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Hai C.M. Murphy R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nishiye E. Somlyo A.V.

A. 1997; 94: 7655-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Latch occurs in some smooth muscles under conditions of low levels of myosin RLC phosphorylation. It is manifested by slowly cycling cross-bridges that support high force isometric contractions but with greatly reduced shortening velocity when the tissue is unloaded. Based on this reasoning, we measured the rate of ADP release from both HMM and SH(ER) bound to actin, with and without RLC phosphorylation. Surprisingly, we saw more than a 3-fold decrease in the rate of ADP release from 84 ± 8 s−1 when SH(ER) was phosphorylated to 29 ± 6 s−1 in the dephosphorylated state. A representative record showing that there is an alteration of the rate of ADP release as a function of the phosphorylation state of SH(ER) is depicted in Fig. 4. Whereas the dissociation from actin of the phosphorylated SH(ER) is best fit by a single exponential, the dephosphorylated species gave rise to two exponential processes, 247 and 28/s. The amplitude of the fast process was approximately 35% at 50 μm ADP and fell to approximately 20% in the presence of 100 μm ADP. The fast process represents heads without ADP bound that are rapidly dissociated by ATP. The slower rate represents ADP dissociation, which must occur before ATP can bind and dissociate the heads from actin. Thus the dephosphorylated SH(ER) displays a slower ADP release and a lower affinity for ADP (because the heads are not saturated with ADP at 50–100 μm ADP). The rate achieved when SH(ER) is phosphorylated was the same as the rate seen for the two-headed HMM in either a phosphorylated or dephosphorylated state (Table I). Although a 3-fold reduction in ADP release rate is not sufficient to explain the lack of motility of the dephosphorylated SH(ER), it certainly will contribute to a slowing of motility. Perhaps the lack of motility in the absence of RLC phosphorylation is because of a combination of drag contributed by heads that are in an off state and heads that are slow to release ADP. This modulation of the rate of ADP release via RLC phosphorylation has a number of important implications for the regulation and function of smooth muscle myosin. First, it suggests that the presumably weak interactions involving the light chain domains in the absence of RLC phosphorylation are sufficiently strong to prevent the transition from a state that releases ADP with a reduced rate to a state where the ADP off rate is accelerated. This possibly could correspond to the structural transition between an ADP-bound position of the powerstroke to the nucleotide-free position that has been seen using cryo-electron microscopy (31Whitaker M. Faust L. Smith J. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). If such a movement is necessary to release ADP, or at least to accelerate ADP release, it provides a highly strain-dependent ADP release step for smooth muscle myosin. Such a mechanism has been proposed (31Whitaker M. Faust L. Smith J. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 32Gollub J. Cremo C.R. Cooke R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and would be well suited for smooth muscle, in which economic maintenance of force is a specialized feature of the tissue. By slowing ADP release under an imposed load, the duty cycle would be increased and the economy of force production enhanced (i.e. latch). Why would the phosphorylation-dependent slowing of ADP release be manifested in the asymmetric construct but not in the native double-headed construct? We have proposed that the coiled-coil immediately following the heads of smooth muscle myosin is sufficiently weak that it could melt when both heads are bound to actin (5Trybus K.M. Freyzon Y. Faust L.Z. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and it may be necessary for this to occur for both heads of HMM to bind to actin strongly. If both heads were bound strongly, then interactions involving the light chain domains would likely be broken, regardless of whether the RLCs are phosphorylated. Thus the rate of ADP release would be independent of the state of phosphorylation. Rosenfeld et al. (3Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. Brown F. Kar S. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28682-28690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) noted that the rate of ADP release from dephosphorylated HMM is slower than that of phosphorylated HMM if one begins the reaction with HMM.ADP not bound to actin. Under those conditions, the two heads may initially have interactions between the heads involving the light chain domains that must be broken before both heads can attach to actin and release ADP. We are proposing that RLC phosphorylation modulates at least two separate steps in the actin-smooth HMM kinetic cycle. The absence of RLC phosphorylation prevents the weak to strong transition on actin (controlled by Pi release) by trapping the two heads of a molecule in an off complex. However, if one head of a molecule is strongly attached to actin, the absence of RLC phosphorylation allows the detached head to slow the ADP release of the attached head. Thus under in vivo conditions, where one myosin head is attached to actin and the second head is detached, the interactions involving the dephosphorylated light chain domains of the two heads may slow ADP release. Although the slowing of the weak to strong transition would simply reduce the number of strongly attached cross-bridges, slowing the ADP release rate would increase the amount of time a cross-bridge spends in the force-generating states (i.e. increase the duty cycle). This would increase the economy of force generation and could contribute to the phenomenon of latch. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that attainment of the complete off state of smooth muscle myosin involves interactions between two intact heads, consistent with the recent structure from two-dimensional crystals (8Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interactions involving the light chain domains can confer modulation of the ADP release step, thus prolonging the strongly attached state in the absence of RLC phosphorylation. Whether the interactions that achieve this slowing of ADP release are a subset of interactions used to achieve the off state or whether they involve a different set of interactions between the light chain domains themselves is unknown."

The retroviral oncoprotein v-ErbA, a member of the zinc finger transcription factor superfamily, is a mutated form of thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1)1 that is virtually incapable of binding T3 (3Sap J.

Nature. 1986; 324: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). v-ErbA is a dominant negative repressor in avian and mammalian cells; however, its mechanisms of action and molecular targets remain unknown (4Sharif M.

Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). v-ErbA and TR belong to the ErbA superfamily of nuclear receptors. Other members of this family include glucocorticoid receptor, retinoic acid receptors, retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and the vitamin D receptor (6Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). These receptors interact with specific DNA sequences, called response elements, in the promoter region of target genes and thereby regulate diverse aspects of cellular development and homeostasis (6Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). TR and v-ErbA can bind as homodimers or heterodimers to response elements arranged as everted, direct, and inverted repeats (7Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). The heterodimerization with RXR enhances the DNA binding of these receptors to their respective response elements (8Yen P.M. Ikeda M. Brubaker J.H. Forgione M. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 903-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kliewer S. Umesono K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

We recently described the DNA binding affinity of v-ErbA homodimers and v-ErbA-RXR heterodimers to differently oriented core motifs (11Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We found that v-ErbA homodimers bind with the highest affinity to an imperfect everted repeat with a 5- or 6-bp spacer. Also, v-ErbA homodimers and v-ErbA-RXR heterodimers bind to direct repeats with different spacers (11Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At least two regions within the nuclear receptors are involved in the heterodimerization with RXR. One region is located within the DNA-binding domain (DBD). This region confers a weak dimerization interface; however, it dictates the spacing preference of direct repeat response elements (12Zechel C. Shen X. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Mader S. Chen J. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

In contrast to this weak dimerization interface of the DBD, a second region located in the C-terminal domain confers a strong dimerization interface (Fig. 1). This region, named the I box, encompasses helices 10 and 11 in TR and v-ErbA (17Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the dimerization interface that forms between DBDs, the C-terminal region is capable of mediating dimerization in solution that would account for the high degree of cooperativity between dimeric partners on response elements. The highly conserved ninth heptad located within helix 11 has been shown to play a critical role in TR heterodimerization with RXR (18Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15766-15771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another region located toward the N-terminal side of the ligand-binding domain is involved in dimerization. It consists of 20 amino acids that are highly conserved among the majority of nuclear receptors (20O'Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region of TRβ1, vitamin D receptor, and retinoic acid receptor impair heterodimerization with RXR on direct and inverted repeat response elements (20O'Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Rosen E.D. Beninghof E. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11534-11541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of this region in homodimerization on direct and inverted repeats or in heterodimerization or homodimerization on everted repeats. The crystal structures of the dimerization interfaces for several nuclear receptors have been published (22Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 23Zhao Q. Chasse S.A. Devarakonda S. Sierk M.L. Ahvazi B. Rastinejad F. J. Mol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). However, in two of them, the studies were done with truncated DBDs in the presence of DNA (22Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 23Zhao Q. Chasse S.A. Devarakonda S. Sierk M.L. Ahvazi B. Rastinejad F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 18: 509-520Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas in others, the experiments were performed with the C-terminal region of the receptors in the absence of DNA (24Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 25Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Therefore, crystal structures of the full-length nuclear receptors in the presence of differently oriented core motifs are not available at this time. Although it has not been entirely understood how these receptors dimerize on these different elements, it is believed that the presence of a flexible hinge located between the DBD and the ligand-binding domain allows the DBD to rotate with respect to a common C-terminal interface (7Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 17Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kurokawa R., Yu, V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, recent data on the role of the ninth heptad repeat in the dominant negative activity of TR variant α2 suggest that there are different dimerization interfaces as the half-site orientation changes (27Yang Y-Z. Burgos-Trinidad M. Wu Y. Koenig R.J. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 28235-28242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Reginato M.J. Zhang J.S. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28199-28205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was unknown whether the domain(s) responsible for homodimerization and heterodimerization are identical. To obtain a better understanding of the dimerization interfaces involved, we studied, by mutational analysis, the role of the I box and the 20-amino acid region of v-ErbA in the formation of v-ErbA homodimers and v-ErbA-RXR heterodimers on everted, direct, and inverted repeats. The data described below indicate that different dimerization interfaces in the C-terminal domain are used in v-ErbA homodimers and v-ErbA-RXR heterodimers as well as within dimers on differently oriented core motifs. The Promega Altered Sites kit was used to create point mutations in v-ErbA. For deletions, the polymerase chain reaction-based splice overlap extension technique was employed (29Cai Z. Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant products were sequenced to confirm the mutations and to exclude errors. Wild type and mutant v-ErbAs (lacking gag sequences), and the mouse RXRα cDNAs (11Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Leid M.

Koenig R.J. Moore D.D. Larsen P.R. Whalen R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid precipitable-protein counts per minute were determined. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography were performed to demonstrate that all proteins were of the appropriate size. Protein-DNA binding reactions were performed in 35 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 1.4 μg of poly(dI·dC), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40,32P-labeled DNA, and the protein(s) of interest. The double-stranded DNAs were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. An EMSA was performed with 40,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA/sample. The amounts of [3H]leucine v-ErbA proteins used were between 2,500 and 10,000 cpm for homodimer binding and between 1,250 and 5,000 cpm for heterodimer binding. On each core motif, the amounts of in vitro translated v-ErbA proteins used were equal as assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation, taking into consideration the number of leucines in the specific proteins. For experiments involving heterodimerization, 2,500 cpm of RXRα were employed. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 45 min prior to electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was carried out on 0.25× TBE (22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) 6% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at room temperature. Gels were fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to film with an intensifying screen for 6–24 h at −70 °C. The DNA-protein complexes were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Experiments were performed at least twice using two different batches of rabbit reticulocyte lysates.

Wild type v-ErbA and mouse RXRα were produced inEscherichia coli using the vector pMAL (New England Biolabs) as described previously (32Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

This vector produces a fusion protein of maltose binding protein followed by a cleavage site for factor Xa and the receptor of interest. The MBP-RXRα and MBP-v-ErbA fusion proteins were adsorbed onto a series of 1-ml amylose resin columns. MBP was similarly adsorbed as a control. The columns were washed with 60 ml of EMSA buffer, and then 1,200,000 cpm of [35S]methionine-labeled v-ErbAs were loaded onto the columns (taking into consideration the number of methionines in the specific proteins). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the columns were washed with 20 ml of EMSA buffer. Radiolabeled v-ErbAs that remained bound were eluted with 10 mm maltose and quantified by scintillation counting. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of aliquots confirmed that the eluted v-ErbAs were of appropriate sizes. JEG-3 cells were grown in 90% Eagle's minimum essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected using standard calcium phosphate precipitation (34Koenig R.J. Warne R.L. Brent G.A.

Mouse TRα1 and rat RXRβ, were expressed from the vector pCDM (34Koenig R.J. Warne R.L. Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfections included 100 ng of pCDMTRα1, which represents a nonsaturating dose of this expression plasmid; 1 μg of pCDMRXRβ, and different amounts of pRSV-v-ErbAs (or vector). The amount of pRSV-v-ErbA used was 300 ng in experiments containing the everted repeat ER5; 600 ng and 1.5 μg, in experiments containing the direct repeat DR4; 1 and 3 μg in experiments involving the inverted repeat IR0. Vector pRSV was added to achieve a total of 3 μg of pRSV-based plasmid per transfection. Expression of v-ErbA mutants was confirmed by Western blot of nuclear cell extracts (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit) with v-ErbA antibody (gift from M. Privalsky). Cotransfections included 1 μg of a human growth hormone (GH) expressing vector (pTKGH)/60-mm Petri dish to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were transfected in the presence of 10% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum and 100 nm dexamethasone. Cells were cultured ± 10 nm T3 for 2 days prior to harvest. CAT and hGH assays were performed as described previously (34Koenig R.J. Warne R.L. Brent G.A. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5031-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). v-ErbA suppression of CAT reporter gene expression was calculated as CAT/hGH for cells cultured with v-ErbA divided by CAT/hGH for cells cultured without v-ErbA in the presence or absence of ligand. Results are presented as the means ± S.E. for four to six independent transfections per assay condition. v-ErbA mutants were made by deleting the entire 20-amino acid region (Δ20AA, amino acids 218–237), helix 10 (ΔH10, amino acids 322–342), helix 11 proximal to the ninth heptad (ΔH11A, amino acids 346–352), the ninth heptad (Δ9 heptad, amino acids 353–360), and the helix 11 distal to the ninth heptad (ΔH11B, amino acids 361–366). Also, a mutant containing a stop codon prior to the ninth heptad was created (stop codon 352). In addition, point mutations were made within these regions in amino acids that are highly conserved throughout the superfamily of nuclear receptors. Most of these mutations were chosen to result in substantial alterations of charge or polarity. Mutations were also made outside the dimerization regions as controls (D254A, E258A, and L372R). These proteins were translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [3H]leucine as shown in Fig. 2. Recently, we demonstrated that v-ErbA homodimers bind with the highest affinity to an imperfect everted repeat with a 5-bp spacer (ER5) (11Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine the dimerization interfaces involved in this process, the ability of the v-ErbA mutants to dimerize on this core motif was tested by EMSA. In experiments involving v-ErbA-RXR heterodimers, we intentionally used a dose of v-ErbA that gives weak homodimer binding. As shown in Fig. 3 A and TableI, deletion of the 20-amino acid region significantly decreased homodimer and heterodimer formation with RXR. Among the point mutations tested, the v-ErbA mutants D232A and A219D significantly interfered with v-ErbA homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR. The mutant P229R modestly decreased v-ErbA homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR. The control mutants outside this region (D254A and E258A) did not affect v-ErbA dimerization. Deletion of helix 10 and mutant Y338L within this region significantly decreased the formation of v-ErbA homodimers and v-ErbA-RXR heterodimers on this core motif (Fig. 3 B and Table I).Table IRelative binding of v-ErbA mutants as homodimers and heterodimers with RXRα to everted repeats (ER5)v-ErbA mutantRelative binding of v-ErbA homodimer 1-aBinding of v-ErbA mutants as homodimers or as heterodimers with RXRα were determined relative to wild type v-ErbA, which was arbitrarily designated as 1.00.

Open table in a new tab Deletions within the helix 11 of v-ErbA (ΔH11A, ΔH11B, and Δ9 heptad) and the point mutations within the ninth heptad (L353R and L360R) significantly decreased and disrupted homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR, respectively. The control mutant outside this region, L372R, did not affect dimerization (Fig. 3 C and Table I). In summary, the 20-amino acid region and helices 10 and 11 are all involved in v-ErbA homodimerization and v-ErbA-RXR heterodimerization on the everted repeat with a 5-bp spacer. Similar results were obtained when the studies were performed on the everted repeat with a 6-bp spacer (ER6) (data not shown). EMSA analysis of the v-ErbA mutants on the direct repeat with a 4-bp spacer was next tested. In experiments involving v-ErbA-RXR heterodimers, we intentionally used a dose of v-ErbA that gives minimal homodimer binding. As shown in Fig. 4 Aand Table II, deletion of the entire 20-amino acid region significantly decreased and disrupted v-ErbA homodimer and v-ErbA-RXR heterodimer formation, respectively, on this site. Among the point mutations tested within this region, P229R and D232A significantly interfered with homodimer formation. The mutant D232A but not P229R also decreased v-ErbA-RXR heterodimer formation on this core motif. The control mutants D254A and E258A did not affect dimerization.Table IIRelative binding of v-ErbA mutants as homodimers and heterodimers with RXRα to direct repeats (DR4)v-ErbA mutantRelative binding of v-ErbA homodimer 2-aBinding of v-ErbA mutants as homodimers or as heterodimers with RXRα were determined relative to wild type v-ErbA, which was arbitrarily designated as 1.00.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the deletion of helix 10 did not affect v-ErbA homodimer formation. However, the same mutant disrupted heterodimer formation with RXR (Fig. 4 B and Table II). Deletions within helix 11, especially a deletion of the ninth heptad, affected homodimerization. Point mutations within the ninth heptad (L353R and L360R) significantly affected homodimerization as well. Heterodimerization with RXR was disrupted with deletions of the proximal portion of helix 11 (ΔH11 A) and of the ninth heptad. However, a deletion within the I box distal to the ninth heptad (Δ H 11 B) did not significantly affect heterodimerization on this site. The control mutant L372R outside the I box did not affect homodimerization or heterodimerization (Fig. 4 C and Table II). Higher amounts of v-ErbA were required on IR0 than on ER5. This is in agreement with our previous data, which indicated that v-ErbA homodimers bind with lower affinity to IR0 than to ER5 (11Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1380-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 and TableIII, deletions and point mutations within the 20-amino acid region and helices 10 and 11 did not affect the homodimer formation of v-ErbA on the inverted repeat IR0. In fact, deletions of helices 10 and 11, and the mutant carrying a stop codon prior to the ninth heptad (stop codon 352) significantly increased homodimer formation on this core motif.Table IIIRelative binding of v-ErbA mutants as homodimers and heterodimers with RXRα to inverted repeats (IR0)v-ErbA mutantRelative binding of v-ErbA homodimer 3-aBinding of v-ErbA mutants as homodimers or as heterodimers with RXRα were determined relative to wild type v-ErbA, which was arbitrarily designated as 1.00.

Open table in a new tab In contrast, the heterodimerization of v-ErbA with RXR was disrupted with deletions of either the 20-amino acid region, helix 10, or helix 11. Also, point mutations within these regions, particularly D232A, Y338L, L353R, and L360R, significantly decreased the formation of heterodimers. The control mutants, D254A, E258A, and L372R, did not affect homodimerization or heterodimerization with RXR on IR0. It was important to consider the independent occupancy of two half-sites by two protein molecules rather than protein-protein interactions on DNA because none of the v-ErbA mutants tested affect the formation of v-ErbA homodimers on the inverted repeat IR0. However, this possibility was very unlikely, because in dose-response curves, homodimer is the predominant complex observed bound to DNA (there is minimal evidence of a monomeric intermediate). Nevertheless, “spacing” mutants of the inverted repeat with a 6-bp spacer (IR6) and with a 9-bp spacer (IR9) were created. As seen in Fig. 6, v-ErbA binding was not observed on IR6 or IR9, confirming that the v-ErbA-DNA complex seen with IR0 was due to homodimer formation rather than to the independent occupancy of two half-sites by two molecules.
