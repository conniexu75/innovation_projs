https://openalex.org/W2738173133,"It has been proposed that the hypothalamus helps to control ageing, but the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here we develop several mouse models in which hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that co-express Sox2 and Bmi1 are ablated, as we observed that ageing in mice started with a substantial loss of these hypothalamic cells. Each mouse model consistently displayed acceleration of ageing-like physiological changes or a shortened lifespan. Conversely, ageing retardation and lifespan extension were achieved in mid-aged mice that were locally implanted with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that had been genetically engineered to survive in the ageing-related hypothalamic inflammatory microenvironment. Mechanistically, hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells contributed greatly to exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cerebrospinal fluid, and these exosomal miRNAs declined during ageing, whereas central treatment with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cell-secreted exosomes led to the slowing of ageing. In conclusion, ageing speed is substantially controlled by hypothalamic stem cells, partially through the release of exosomal miRNAs. Ablation of hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells in mice leads to ageing-related decreases in physiological parameters and lifespan, and the speed of ageing is partially controlled by these cells through the release of exosomal miRNAs. Dongsheng Cai and colleagues previously showed that the hypothalamus has a critical role in systemic ageing. Here they observe a substantial loss of hypothalamic stem cells in middle-aged mice. They show in several mouse models that ablation of these cells results in ageing-like physiological changes and a shortened lifespan. Conversely, ageing could be slowed and lifespan extended by transplantation of healthy hypothalamic stem cells into middle aged mice. Hypothalamic stem cells secrete exosomal miRNAs, contributing to a pool of circulating miRNAs in the cerebrospinal fluid that declines with age. These secreted exosomes contribute, at least in part, to a deceleration of ageing. The authors conclude that the speed of ageing is partially controlled by hypothalamic stem cells and their exosomal miRNAs in the cerebrospinal fluid."

https://openalex.org/W2737675606,"Many retinal diseases lead to the loss of retinal neurons and cause visual impairment. The adult mammalian retina has little capacity for regeneration. By contrast, teleost fish functionally regenerate their retina following injury, and Müller glia (MG) are the source of regenerated neurons. The proneural transcription factor Ascl1 is upregulated in MG after retinal damage in zebrafish and is necessary for regeneration. Although Ascl1 is not expressed in mammalian MG after injury, forced expression of Ascl1 in mouse MG induces a neurogenic state in vitro and in vivo after NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) damage in young mice. However, by postnatal day 16, mouse MG lose neurogenic capacity, despite Ascl1 overexpression. Loss of neurogenic capacity in mature MG is accompanied by reduced chromatin accessibility, suggesting that epigenetic factors limit regeneration. Here we show that MG-specific overexpression of Ascl1, together with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, enables adult mice to generate neurons from MG after retinal injury. The MG-derived neurons express markers of inner retinal neurons, synapse with host retinal neurons, and respond to light. Using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), we show that the histone deacetylase inhibitor promotes accessibility at key gene loci in the MG, and allows more effective reprogramming. Our results thus provide a new approach for the treatment of blinding retinal diseases."

Toehold riboswitches are designer hairpin motifs inserted into RNA transcripts to hide ribosome binding sequences. This ensures that protein synthesis is minimal until a separate regulatory RNA species binds to and opens the hairpin. Peng Yin and colleagues combine several toehold riboswitches and antisense RNA species to implement complex Boolean regulatory logic, placing a single gene under up to 12 inputs with 5 clauses. The computation takes place in a single physical locus, making the design much more compact and efficient than existing synthetic biology approaches in which signals are encoded by DNA-binding proteins in complex regulatory networks. The work expands in vitro DNA origami concepts to in vivo RNA nanotechnology and synthetic biology. Synthetic biology aims to develop engineering-driven approaches to the programming of cellular functions that could yield transformative technologies1. Synthetic gene circuits that combine DNA, protein, and RNA components have demonstrated a range of functions such as bistability2, oscillation3,4, feedback5,6, and logic capabilities7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. However, it remains challenging to scale up these circuits owing to the limited number of designable, orthogonal, high-performance parts, the empirical and often tedious composition rules, and the requirements for substantial resources for encoding and operation. Here, we report a strategy for constructing RNA-only nanodevices to evaluate complex logic in living cells. Our ‘ribocomputing’ systems are composed of de-novo-designed parts and operate through predictable and designable base-pairing rules, allowing the effective in silico design of computing devices with prescribed configurations and functions in complex cellular environments. These devices operate at the post-transcriptional level and use an extended RNA transcript to co-localize all circuit sensing, computation, signal transduction, and output elements in the same self-assembled molecular complex, which reduces diffusion-mediated signal losses, lowers metabolic cost, and improves circuit reliability. We demonstrate that ribocomputing devices in Escherichia coli can evaluate two-input logic with a dynamic range up to 900-fold and scale them to four-input AND, six-input OR, and a complex 12-input expression (A1 AND A2 AND NOT A1*) OR (B1 AND B2 AND NOT B2*) OR (C1 AND C2) OR (D1 AND D2) OR (E1 AND E2). Successful operation of ribocomputing devices based on programmable RNA interactions suggests that systems employing the same design principles could be implemented in other host organisms or in extracellular settings."
https://openalex.org/W2738015524,"Concomitant activation of the Wnt pathway and suppression of Mapk signalling by two small molecule inhibitors (2i) in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (hereafter termed 2i/L) induces a naive state in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that resembles the inner cell mass (ICM) of the pre-implantation embryo. Since the ICM exists only transiently in vivo, it remains unclear how sustained propagation of naive ES cells in vitro affects their stability and functionality. Here we show that prolonged culture of male mouse ES cells in 2i/L results in irreversible epigenetic and genomic changes that impair their developmental potential. Furthermore, we find that female ES cells cultured in conventional serum plus LIF medium phenocopy male ES cells cultured in 2i/L. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the inhibition of Mek1/2 is predominantly responsible for these effects, in part through the downregulation of DNA methyltransferases and their cofactors. Finally, we show that replacement of the Mek1/2 inhibitor with a Src inhibitor preserves the epigenetic and genomic integrity as well as the developmental potential of ES cells. Taken together, our data suggest that, although short-term suppression of Mek1/2 in ES cells helps to maintain an ICM-like epigenetic state, prolonged suppression results in irreversible changes that compromise their developmental potential."
https://openalex.org/W2737735855,"Inhibitors of Mek1/2 and Gsk3β, known as 2i, enhance the derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells and promote ground-state pluripotency in rodents. Here we show that the derivation of female mouse ES cells in the presence of 2i and leukaemia inhibitory factor (2i/L ES cells) results in a widespread loss of DNA methylation, including a massive erasure of genomic imprints. Despite this global loss of DNA methylation, early-passage 2i/L ES cells efficiently differentiate into somatic cells, and this process requires genome-wide de novo DNA methylation. However, the majority of imprinting control regions (ICRs) remain unmethylated in 2i/L-ES-cell-derived differentiated cells. Consistently, 2i/L ES cells exhibit impaired autonomous embryonic and placental development by tetraploid embryo complementation or nuclear transplantation. We identified the derivation conditions of female ES cells that display 2i/L-ES-cell-like transcriptional signatures while preserving gamete-derived DNA methylation and autonomous developmental potential. Upon prolonged culture, however, female ES cells exhibited ICR demethylation regardless of culture conditions. Our results provide insights into the derivation of female ES cells reminiscent of the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2738561712,"A report of high-depth, short-read sequencing and de novo assemblies for 150 individuals from 50 parent–offspring trios as part of establishing a population reference genome for the GenomeDenmark project. Genome sequencing of individuals across a population is an important component of precision medicine initiatives, and can be used to characterize genetic variation and in association mapping for diseases and complex traits. Mikkel Schierup and colleagues report efforts to establish a population reference genome for the Danish population as part of the GenomeDenmark project. The authors report high-depth short-read sequencing and de novo assemblies for 150 individuals from 50 parent–offspring trios. They demonstrate that this approach provides similar quality metrics to long-read approaches and helps to resolve structural variation and complex genomic regions. This provides a cost-effective way to establish a population reference genome that will be useful for association mapping and precision medicine initiatives. Hundreds of thousands of human genomes are now being sequenced to characterize genetic variation and use this information to augment association mapping studies of complex disorders and other phenotypic traits1,2,3,4. Genetic variation is identified mainly by mapping short reads to the reference genome or by performing local assembly2,5,6,7. However, these approaches are biased against discovery of structural variants and variation in the more complex parts of the genome. Hence, large-scale de novo assembly is needed. Here we show that it is possible to construct excellent de novo assemblies from high-coverage sequencing with mate-pair libraries extending up to 20 kilobases. We report de novo assemblies of 150 individuals (50 trios) from the GenomeDenmark project. The quality of these assemblies is similar to those obtained using the more expensive long-read technology4,8,9,10,11,12,13. We use the assemblies to identify a rich set of structural variants including many novel insertions and demonstrate how this variant catalogue enables further deciphering of known association mapping signals. We leverage the assemblies to provide 100 completely resolved major histocompatibility complex haplotypes and to resolve major parts of the Y chromosome. Our study provides a regional reference genome that we expect will improve the power of future association mapping studies and hence pave the way for precision medicine initiatives, which now are being launched in many countries including Denmark."
https://openalex.org/W2738496305,"During multicellular development, specification of distinct cell fates is often regulated by the same transcription factors operating differently in distinct cis-regulatory modules, either through different protein complexes, conformational modification of protein complexes, or combinations of both. Direct visualization of different transcription factor complex states guiding specific gene expression programs has been challenging. Here we use in vivo FRET-FLIM (Förster resonance energy transfer measured by fluorescence lifetime microscopy) to reveal spatial partitioning of protein interactions in relation to specification of cell fate. We show that, in Arabidopsis roots, three fully functional fluorescently tagged cell fate regulators establish cell-type-specific interactions at endogenous expression levels and can form higher order complexes. We reveal that cell-type-specific in vivo FRET-FLIM distributions reflect conformational changes of these complexes to differentially regulate target genes and specify distinct cell fates."
https://openalex.org/W2737637732,"Most studies rely on cross-sectional retrospective reports from adult samples to collect information about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) to examine relationships with adult outcomes. The problems associated with these reports have long been debated, with only a few studies determining their reliability and validity and fewer still reaching consensus on the matter. This paper uses repeat prospective and retrospective reports of adverse childhood experiences from two respondent sources in the South African Birth to Twenty Plus (Bt20+) cohort to explore agreement and concordance in the prospective reporting of ACEs by caregivers and respective children as adolescents and then as young adults. The findings demonstrate little overall agreement between prospective and retrospective accounts of childhood experiences, with 80% of kappa values below the moderate agreement cutoff (k = .41). The highest levels of agreement were found between prospective and retrospective reporting on parental and household death (kappas ranging from .519 to .944). Comparisons between prospective caregiver reports and retrospective young adult reports yielded high concordance rates on sexual and physical abuse and exposure to intimate partner violence (91.0%, 87.7% and 80.2%, respectively). The prevalence of reported ACEs varied with the age of the respondent, with adolescents reporting much higher rates of exposure to violence, physical and sexual abuse than are reported retrospectively or by caregivers. This variation may partly reflect actual changes in circumstances with maturation, but may be influenced by developmental stage and issues of memory, cognition and emotional state more than has been considered in previous analyses. More research, across disciplines, is needed to understand these processes and their effect on recall. Long-term prospective studies are critical for this purpose. In conclusion, methodological research that uses a range of information sources to establish the reliability and validity of both retrospective and prospective reports ‒ recognizing that the two approaches may fundamentally answer different questions ‒ should be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W2738348227,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with a median lifespan of 2–3 years after diagnosis. There are few meaningful treatments that alter progression in this disease. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that neuroinflammation may play a key role in the progression rate of ALS. Despite this, there are no validated biomarkers of neuroinflammation for use in clinical practice or clinical trials. Biomarkers of neuroinflammation could improve patient management, provide new therapeutic targets, and possibly help stratify clinical trial selection and monitoring. However, attempts to identify a singular cause of neuroinflammation have not been successful. Here, we performed multi-parameter flow cytometry to comprehensively assess 116 leukocyte populations and phenotypes from lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in a cohort of 80 ALS patients. We identified 32 leukocyte phenotypes that were altered in ALS patients compared to age and gender matched healthy volunteers (HV) that included phenotypes of both inflammation and immune suppression. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis of ALS and HV immunophenotypes revealed two distinct immune profiles of ALS patients. ALS patients were clustered into a profile distinct from HVs primarily due to differences in a multiple T cell phenotypes, CD3+CD56+ T cells and HLA-DR on monocytes. Patients clustered into an abnormal immune profile were younger, more likely to have a familial form of the disease, and survived longer than those patients who clustered similarly with healthy volunteers (344 weeks versus 184 weeks; p = 0.012). The data set generated from this study establishes an extensive accounting of immunophenotypic changes readily suitable for biomarker validation studies. The extensive immune system changes measured in this study indicate that normal immune homeostatic mechanisms are disrupted in ALS patients, and that multiple immune states likely exist within a population of patients with ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2737749063,"Clinical intervention for patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) remains challenging due to the inevitable recurrence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Cancer stem cells (CSCs) with serial tumor-propagating capacity are considered to be the driving force for PCa progression and recurrence. In this study, we report that the miR-302/367 cluster, a previously identified potent pluripotency regulator, is upregulated in prostate tumors. Specifically, the forced expression of the miR-302/367 cluster accelerates the in vitro and in vivo growth of PCa cells and their resistance to androgen ablation, whereas the knockdown of the miR-302/367 cluster using anti-sense RNA suppresses the incidence of formation, growth rate and endpoint weight of PCa cell tumors. Mechanistically, we find that LATS2, a key component of the tumor-suppressive Hippo signaling pathway, acts as a direct target of the miR-302/367 cluster in PCa cells. The downregulation of LATS2 by the miR-302/367 cluster reduces the phosphorylation and enhances the nuclear translocation of the YAP oncoprotein. Conversely, the restoration of LATS2 expression abrogates the tumor-promoting effects of forced miR-302/367 cluster expression. Collectively, the potent pluripotency regulator-triggered miR-302/367/LATS2/YAP pathway is essential for prostate tumor-propagating cells and promotes castration resistance. Thus, targeting this signaling axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W2738962050,"Certain antibiotics detected in urine are associated with childhood obesity. In the current experimental study, we investigated two representative antibiotics detected in urine, florfenicol and azithromycin, for their early effects on adipogenesis, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and bile acids in mice. Thirty C57BL/6 mice aged four weeks were randomly divided into three groups (florfenicol, azithromycin and control). The two experimental groups were administered florfenicol or azithromycin at 5 mg/kg/day for four weeks. Body weight was measured weekly. The composition of the gut microbiota, body fat, SCFAs, and bile acids in colon contents were measured at the end of the experiment. The composition of the gut microbiota was determined by sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The concentration of SCFAs and bile acids was determined using gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The composition of the gut microbiota indicated that the two antibiotics altered the gut microbiota composition and decreased its richness and diversity. At the phylum level, the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes increased significantly in the antibiotic groups. At the genus level, there were declines in Christensenella, Gordonibacter and Anaerotruncus in the florfenicol group, in Lactobacillus in the azithromycin group, and in Alistipes, Desulfovibrio, Parasutterella and Rikenella in both the antibiotic groups. The decrease in Rikenella in the azithromycin group was particularly noticeable. The concentration of SCFAs and secondary bile acids decreased in the colon, but the concentration of primary bile acids increased. These findings indicated that florfenicol and azithromycin increased adipogenesis and altered gut microbiota composition, SCFA production, and bile acid metabolism, suggesting that exposure to antibiotics might be one risk factor for childhood obesity. More studies are needed to investigate the specific mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2736566931,"WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in plant resistance responses to pathogens. Wheat stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. In this study, the two WRKY genes TaWRKY49 and TaWRKY62 were originally identified in association with high-temperature seedling-plant resistance to Pst (HTSP) resistance in wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 by RNA-seq. Interestingly, the expression levels of TaWRKY49 and TaWRKY62 were down- and up-regulated, respectively, during HTSP resistance in response to Pst. Silencing of TaWRKY49 enhanced whereas silencing TaWRKY62 reduced HTSP resistance. The enhanced resistance observed on leaves following the silencing of TaWRKY49 was coupled with increased expression of salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes TaPR1.1 and TaAOS, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated genes TaCAT and TaPOD; whereas the ethylene (ET)-responsive gene TaPIE1 was suppressed. The decreased resistance observed on leaves following TaWRKY62 silencing was associated with increased expression of TaPR1.1 and TaPOD, and suppression of TaAOS and TaPIE1. Furthermore, SA, ET, MeJA (methyl jasmonate), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments increased TaWRKY62 expression. On the other hand, MeJA did not affect the expression of TaWRKY49, and H2O2 reduced TaWRKY49 expression. In conclusion, TaWRKY49 negatively regulates while TaWRKY62 positively regulates wheat HTSP resistance to Pst by differential regulation of SA-, JA-, ET and ROS-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2738064745,"Saliency-based models of visual attention postulate that, when a scene is freely viewed, attention is predominantly allocated to those elements that stand out in terms of their physical properties. However, eye-tracking studies have shown that saliency models fail to predict gaze behavior accurately when social information is included in an image. Notably, gaze pattern analyses revealed that depictions of human beings are heavily prioritized independent of their low-level physical saliency. What remains unknown, however, is whether the prioritization of such social features is a reflexive or a voluntary process. To investigate the early stages of social attention in more detail, participants viewed photographs of naturalistic scenes with and without social features (i.e., human heads or bodies) for 200 ms while their eye movements were being recorded. We observed significantly more first eye movements to regions containing social features than would be expected from a chance level distribution of saccades. Additionally, a generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed that the social content of a region better predicted first saccade direction than its saliency suggesting that social features partially override the impact of low-level physical saliency on gaze patterns. Given the brief image presentation time that precluded visual exploration, our results provide compelling evidence for a reflexive component in social attention. Moreover, the present study emphasizes the importance of considering social influences for a more coherent understanding of human attentional selection."
https://openalex.org/W2737074681,"The antiandrogen bicalutamide is widely used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) in many countries, but its effect on castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) is limited. We previously showed that resistance to bicalutamide results from activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Interestingly, clinical trials testing combinations of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 with bicalutamide were effective in bicalutamide-naïve CRPC patients, but not in bicalutamide-pretreated ones. Here we investigate causes for their difference in response. Evaluation of CRPC cell lines identified resistant vs sensitive in vitro models, and revealed that increased eIF4E(S209) phosphorylation is associated with resistance to the combination. We confirmed using a human-derived tumor xenograft mouse model that bicalutamide pre-treatment is associated with an increase in eIF4E(S209) phosphorylation. Thus, AR suppressed eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) phosphorylation, while the use of antiandrogens relieved this suppression, thereby triggering its increase. Additional investigation in human prostatectomy samples showed that increased eIF4E phosphorylation strongly correlated with the cell proliferation marker Ki67. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown (k/d) of eIF4E-sensitized CRPC cells to RAD001+bicalutamide, whereas eIF4E overexpression induced resistance. Inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation by treatment with CGP57380 (an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting serine-threonine kinases MAP kinase-interacting kinase 1 (Mnk1/2), the eIF4E upstream kinase) or inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), the upstream kinase-regulating Mnk1/2, also sensitized CRPC cells to RAD001+bicalutamide. Examination of downstream targets of eIF4E-mediated translation, including survivin, demonstrated that eIF4E(S209) phosphorylation increased cap-independent translation, whereas its inhibition restored cap-dependent translation, which could be inhibited by mTOR inhibitors. Thus, our results demonstrate that while combinations of AR and mTOR inhibitors were effective in suppressing tumor growth by inhibiting both AR-induced transcription and mTOR-induced cap-dependent translation, pre-treatment with AR antagonists including bicalutamide increased eIF4E phosphorylation that induced resistance to combinations of AR and mTOR inhibitors by inducing cap-independent translation. We conclude that this resistance can be overcome by inhibiting eIF4E phosphorylation with Mnk1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2737180131,"Metastatic cancer cells acquire energy-intensive processes including increased invasiveness and chemoresistance. However, how the energy demand is met and the molecular drivers that coordinate an increase in cellular metabolic activity to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the first step of metastasis, remain unclear. Using different in vitro and in vivo EMT models with clinical patient's samples, we showed that EMT is an energy-demanding process fueled by glucose metabolism-derived adenosine triphosphate (ATP). We identified angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) as a key player that coordinates an increase in cellular energy flux crucial for EMT via an ANGPTL4/14-3-3γ signaling axis. This augmented cellular metabolic activity enhanced metastasis. ANGPTL4 knockdown suppresses an adenylate energy charge elevation, delaying EMT. Using an in vivo dual-inducible EMT model, we found that ANGPTL4 deficiency reduces cancer metastasis to the lung and liver. Unbiased kinase inhibitor screens and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that ANGPTL4 regulates the expression of 14-3-3γ adaptor protein via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways that culminate to activation of transcription factors, CREB, cFOS and STAT3. Using a different mode of action, as compared with protein kinases, the ANGPTL4/14-3-3γ signaling axis consolidated cellular bioenergetics and stabilized critical EMT proteins to coordinate energy demand and enhanced EMT competency and metastasis, through interaction with specific phosphorylation signals on target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2737177975,"Food insecurity contributes to poor health outcomes among people living with HIV. In Latin America and the Caribbean, structural factors such as poverty, stigma, and inequality disproportionately affect women and may fuel both the HIV epidemic and food insecurity.We examined factors contributing to food insecurity among women living with HIV (WLHIV) in the Dominican Republic (DR). Data collection included in-depth, semi-structured interviews in 2013 with 30 WLHIV with indications of food insecurity who resided in urban or peri-urban areas and were recruited from local HIV clinics. In-person interviews were conducted in Spanish. Transcripts were coded using content analysis methods and an inductive approach to identify principal and emergent themes.Respondents identified economic instability as the primary driver of food insecurity, precipitated by enacted stigma in the labor and social domains. Women described experiences of HIV-related labor discrimination in formal and informal sectors. Women commonly reported illegal HIV testing by employers, and subsequent dismissal if HIV-positive, especially in tourism and free trade zones. Enacted stigma in the social domain manifested as gossip and rejection by family, friends, and neighbors and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by intimate partners, distancing women from sources of economic and food support. These experiences with discrimination and abuse contributed to internalized stigma among respondents who, as a result, were fearful and hesitant to disclose their HIV status; some participants reported leaving spouses and/or families, resulting in further isolation from economic resources, food and other support. A minority of participants described social support by friends, spouses, families and support groups, which helped to ameliorate food insecurity and emotional distress.Addressing food insecurity among WLHIV requires policy and programmatic interventions to enforce existing laws designed to protect the rights of people living with HIV, reduce HIV-related stigma, and improve gender equality."
https://openalex.org/W2738911959,"The thyroid gland secretes primarily tetraiodothyronine (T4), and some triiodothyronine (T3). Under normal physiological circumstances, only one-fifth of circulating T3 is directly released by the thyroid, but in states of hyperactivation of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors (TSHRs), patients develop a syndrome of relative T3 toxicosis. Thyroidal T4 production results from iodination of thyroglobulin (TG) at residues Tyr5 and Tyr130, whereas thyroidal T3 production may originate in several different ways. In this study, the data demonstrate that within the carboxyl-terminal portion of mouse TG, T3 is formed de novo independently of deiodination from T4. We found that upon iodination in vitro, de novo T3 formation in TG was decreased in mice lacking TSHRs. Conversely, de novo T3 that can be formed upon iodination of TG secreted from PCCL3 (rat thyrocyte) cells was augmented from cells previously exposed to increased TSH, a TSHR agonist, a cAMP analog, or a TSHR-stimulating antibody. We present data suggesting that TSH-stimulated TG phosphorylation contributes to enhanced de novo T3 formation. These effects were reversed within a few days after removal of the hyperstimulating conditions. Indeed, direct exposure of PCCL3 cells to human serum from two patients with Graves' disease, but not control sera, led to secretion of TG with an increased intrinsic ability to form T3 upon in vitro iodination. Furthermore, TG secreted from human thyrocyte cultures hyperstimulated with TSH also showed an increased intrinsic ability to form T3. Our data support the hypothesis that TG processing in the secretory pathway of TSHR-hyperstimulated thyrocytes alters the structure of the iodination substrate in a way that enhances de novo T3 formation, contributing to the relative T3 toxicosis of Graves' disease.

In normal humans, classic studies have estimated that only ∼21% of daily T3 production is derived from thyroidal secretion (the rest coming from deiodination of T4 to T3 by deiodinases D1 and D2) (7Larsen P.R. Thyroidal triiodothyronine and thyroxine in Graves' disease: correlation with presurgical treatment, thyroid status, and iodine content.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1975; 41: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in patients with untreated Graves' disease (a disease of thyroidal hyperstimulation by TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies (8Smith T.J. Hegedüs L. Graves' disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375: 1552-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar)), thyroid tissue is markedly enriched in T3 concurrent with increased T3 in the circulation (9Schimmel M. Utiger R.D. Thyroidal and peripheral production of thyroid hormones: review of recent findings and their clinical implications.Ann. Intern. Med. 1977; 87: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 10Woeber K.A. Triiodothyronine production in Graves' hyperthyroidism.Thyroid. 2006; 16: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although some increased thyroidal T3 production in Graves' disease might be derived from intrathyroidal deiodination of T4 to T3 (11Laurberg P. Mechanisms governing the relative proportions of thyroxine and 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine in thyroid secretion.Metabolism. 1984; 33: 379-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the aforementioned study of untreated Graves' patients reported increased thyroid tissue T3 only after Pronase digestion (7Larsen P.R. Thyroidal triiodothyronine and thyroxine in Graves' disease: correlation with presurgical treatment, thyroid status, and iodine content.J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1975; 41: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice with whole body D1/D2-double knock-out (DKO) nevertheless maintain normal circulating T3 levels (12Galton V.A. Schneider M.J. Clark A.S. St Germain D.L. Life without thyroxine to 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine conversion: studies in mice devoid of the 5′-deiodinases.Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 2957-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings strongly imply that the thyroid gland has the capability to contribute importantly to circulating T3 via a mechanism involving de novo T3 formation, and this may be particularly important in Graves' disease. The role of TG (a large homodimeric glycoprotein with a monomer molecular mass of 330 kDa and containing >2745 residues) in thyroid hormone synthesis is initiated upon its iodination (13Targovnik H.M. Citterio C.E. Rivolta C.M. Thyroglobulin gene mutations in congenital hypothyroidism.Horm. Res. Paediatr. 2011; 75: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Di Jeso B. Arvan P. Thyroglobulin from molecular and cellular biology to clinical endocrinology.Endocr. Rev. 2016; 37: 2-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Iodination is catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase, which provides the necessary oxidation to form diiodotyrosine (DIT) and monoiodotyrosine (MIT) within TG. Favored by these same oxidizing conditions, a coupling reaction involving a DIT acceptor residue and a corresponding DIT donor residue allows for the formation of T4 within the TG polypeptide; similarly, coupling of an MIT donor with a DIT acceptor allows for de novo T3 formation (15Dunn J.T. Dunn A.D. Update on intrathyroidal iodine metabolism.Thyroid. 2001; 11: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Taurog A.M.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 61-85Google Scholar). Classic studies report that thyroid peroxidase shows no marked specificity in its ability to catalyze TG iodination and coupling over that of lactoperoxidase or myeloperoxidase (16Taurog A.M. Hormone synthesis: thyroid iodine metabolism.in: Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner and Ingbar's the Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 8th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 61-85Google Scholar), whereas efficient T4 and T3 formation requires the TG substrate in its native conformation (17Lamas L. Taurog A. The importance of thyroglobulin structure in thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed conversion of diiodotyrosine to thyroxine.Endocrinology. 1977; 100: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite ∼70 Tyr residues distributed broadly along the length of the protein, T4 and T3 formation are restricted to relatively few sites in TG, including an evolutionarily preferred DIT-DIT coupling of Tyr130–Tyr5 to yield T4 at position 5 (1Holzer G. Morishita Y. Fini J.B. Lorin T. Gillet B. Hughes S. Tohmé M. Deléage G. Demeneix B. Arvan P. Laudet V. Thyroglobulin represents a novel molecular architecture of vertebrates.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 16553-16566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a preferred T3 formation site at position 2746 of human TG (2744 of mouse TG, although the MIT coupling partner in either species remains unclear) (18Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Fassler C.A. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. The sites of thyroid hormone formation in rabbit thyroglobulin.J. Biol.

Revisiting iodination sites in thyroglobulin with an organ-oriented shotgun strategy.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 259-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). During its complex trafficking through the intracellular transport pathway of thyrocytes, TG undergoes considerable post-translational processing prior to its secretion and iodination (20Xavier A.C. Maciel R.M. Vieira J.G. Dias-da-Silva M.R. Martins J.R. Insights into the posttranslational structural heterogeneity of thyroglobulin and its role in the development, diagnosis, and management of benign and malignant thyroid diseases.Arch. Endocrinol. Metab. 2016; 60: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Many of these post-translational modifications are regulated indirectly by TSH-induced changes in the gene expression and activity of TG processing enzymes (21Rousset B. Dupuy C. Miot F. Dumont J. Chapter 2: Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion.in: De Groot L.J. Chrousos G. Dungan K. Feingold K.R. Grossman A. Hershman J.M. Koch C. Korbonits M. McLachlan R. New M. Purnell J. Rebar R. Singer F. Vinik A. Endotext. MDText.com, Inc., South Dartmouth, MA2000Google Scholar). Herein, we have examined de novo T3 formation within TG analyzed both from in vivo samples and after iodination in vitro. We directly demonstrate de novo T3 formation in TG and establish that this ability is directly related to the degree to which thyrocytes have been exposed to prior TSHR stimulation. We developed a simple assay to detect the presence of T3 formation within thyroidal protein of euthyroid mice by immunoblotting using a mAb that recognizes T3 when contained within the TG protein backbone, in parallel with immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against TG. The addition of free T3 (half-maximal concentration ∼75 ng/ml) eliminated the immunoblotted mouse TG band with mAb anti-T3, whereas the addition of free T4 had little effect (Fig. 1A, blots at left; quantitation at right). Thyroidal immunofluorescence from euthyroid mice with mAb anti-T3 was distributed primarily in the follicle lumen where extracellular TG resides in “colloid”; this immunofluorescent signal was fully blocked by the addition of free T3 at 500 ng/ml but was only slightly diminished by free T4 even at 2000 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). Routinely, we added 500 ng/ml of free T4 in all immunoblotting experiments designed to detect T3 in TG, to ensure specificity. The data in Fig. 1 indicate that a basal level of T3 in TG is present under euthyroid (i.e. not TSH-hyperstimulated) conditions. The primary sequence of mouse TG encodes a single predicted site for Factor Xa cleavage that excises the N-terminal one-third of the protein from the C-terminal two-thirds. As Dunn et al. (18Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Fassler C.A. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. The sites of thyroid hormone formation in rabbit thyroglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16948-16952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the majority of T3 synthesized within TG is located in its C-terminal portion, we extracted mouse thyroid tissue and found by immunoblotting that a single band of intact Tg was cleaved to two fragments of the expected molecular mass after incubation with Factor Xa (Fig. 1C, left). Of these, the larger fragment corresponding to the C-terminal portion of TG was selectively enriched in T3 (Fig. 1C, right). There are strong cell biological arguments to suggest that T3 contained within the TG protein does not result as a consequence of deiodination of T4 contained within TG. Specifically, almost all of the hormone-containing-TG is localized to the extracellular thyroid follicular lumen (Fig. 1B) (22Sellitti D.F. Suzuki K. Intrinsic regulation of thyroid function by thyroglobulin.Thyroid. 2014; 24: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas the catalytic activities of the two enzymes responsible for T4 to T3 conversion (deiodinases D1 and D2) are topologically facing the cytosol (23Bianco A.C. Larsen P.R. Cellular and structural biology of the deiodinases.Thyroid. 2005; 15: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Indeed, we examined the T3 content of TG in the thyroids of animals devoid of D1 and D2 (12Galton V.A. Schneider M.J. Clark A.S. St Germain D.L. Life without thyroxine to 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine conversion: studies in mice devoid of the 5′-deiodinases.Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 2957-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and found that D1/D2-DKO mice had as much or more T3 contained within TG than in that from a wild-type reference animal (Fig. 2, left). All of the detected signal was derived from bona fide protein-bound T3 as it was completely blocked by the addition of free T3 added to the immunoblotting conditions (Fig. 2, right). As a negative control, TG obtained from PTU-treated mice contained no detectable T3 (Fig. 2 left). Together, these data provide strong support that de novo T3 formation within TG is independent of T4 deiodination. Iodination of TG is enhanced by TSH stimulation of the thyroid gland (21Rousset B. Dupuy C. Miot F. Dumont J. Chapter 2: Thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion.in: De Groot L.J. Chrousos G. Dungan K. Feingold K.R. Grossman A. Hershman J.M. Koch C. Korbonits M. McLachlan R. New M. Purnell J. Rebar R. Singer F. Vinik A. Endotext. MDText.com, Inc., South Dartmouth, MA2000Google Scholar). However, independent of effects on sodium iodide symport activity, dual-function oxidase activity, or thyroid peroxidase activity, it has been hypothesized that the intrinsic ability of TG to form T3 may be modulated through prior thyroidal stimulation by TSH on its receptor (thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) (24Fassler C.A. Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. Kim P.S. Thyrotropin alters the utilization of thyroglobulin's hormonogenic sites.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17366-17371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). To test this, we subjected the TG obtained from thyroids of TSHR-KO mice, and from PTU-treated WT mice (that develop hypothyroidism and a compensatory increase in TSH leading to stimulated TSHRs) to iodination under fixed conditions in vitro. In addition to eliminating any effects of TSHR stimulation on thyrocyte enzymes that promote TG iodination in vivo, the in vitro iodination method also normalizes for TG protein, and total protein, within each iodination reaction. Prior to the in vitro iodination reaction, neither thyroids from TSHR-KO nor PTU-treated mice exhibited detectable T3 within TG, as judged both by mAb anti-T3 immunofluorescence and immunoblotting (Fig. 3, A and B). This is precisely why, for this experiment, we did not examine TG from control mouse thyroid glands. After iodination in vitro, TG from TSHR-KO consistently exhibited less de novo T3 formation within TG (Fig. 3B, quantified in C). To directly test the effect of thyrocyte stimulation by TSH on the ability of TG to facilitate de novo T3 formation, we collected secretion from the rat thyrocyte cell line, PCCL3. Ordinarily, these cells are grown in the presence of TSH at a concentration of 1–10 milliunits/ml (25Palmero C.Y. Miranda-Alves L. Sant'Ana Barroso M.M. Souza E.C. Machado D.E. Palumbo-Junior A. Santos C.A. Portilho D.M. Mermelstein C.S. Takiya C.M. Carvalho D.P. Hochman-Mendez C. Coelho-Sampaio T. Nasciutti L.E. The follicular thyroid cell line PCCL3 responds differently to laminin and to polylaminin, a polymer of laminin assembled in acidic pH.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2013; 376: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 26Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A. Coon H.G. Culture of hormone-dependent functional epithelial cells from rat thyroids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Under standard cell culture conditions, PCCL3 cells cannot iodinate their own secreted proteins; however, upon collection of the secretion followed by iodination in vitro, de novo T3 formation was readily detectable within TG (Fig. 4A). We cultured PCCL3 cells for several days in two concentrations of TSH that differed by an order of magnitude (10 and 100 milliunits/liter). TG secreted from PCCL3 cells after exposure to the higher TSH concentration consistently exhibited greater potential for T3 formation upon iodination in vitro (Fig. 4B, quantified in graph below the blot). Recently, a specific small molecule agonist of the TSHR, MS437, was described to activate Gαs, which mimics TSH in turning on downstream target genes (27Latif R. Ali M.R. Ma R. David M. Morshed S.A. Ohlmeyer M. Felsenfeld D.P. Lau Z. Mezei M. Davies T.F. New small molecule agonists to the thyrotropin receptor.Thyroid. 2015; 25: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Upon growth of PCCL3 cells in the presence of MS437, in vitro iodination of secreted TG led to a marked increase in de novo T3 formation (Fig. 4C, quantified in graph above the blot). Stimulatory G proteins in thyrocytes activate adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes cAMP synthesis (28Kleinau G. Biebermann H. Constitutive activities in the thyrotropin receptor: regulation and significance.Adv. Pharmacol. 2014; 70: 81-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of PCCL3 cells in the presence of dibutyryl cAMP, in vitro iodination of secreted TG again demonstrated increased de novo T3 formation (Fig. 4D, quantified in the graph above the blot). These data strongly suggest that TSH, working through TSHR, stimulatory G proteins, and cAMP production, alters the intrinsic ability of TG to form T3 upon TG iodination. There are several significant post-translational modifications that may have structural consequences on TG synthesized in TSH-stimulated thyrocytes, which may impact its hormonogenic potential, including de novo T3 formation. These include the following: increased N-linked glycosylation (29Desruisseau S. Franc J.L. Gruffat D. Chabaud O.

Valette A. Franc J.L. Chabaud O. Thyrotropin controls dolichol-linked sugar pools and oligosaccharyltransferase activity in thyroid cells.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 122: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and up-regulation of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (31Suban D. Zajc T. Renko M. Turk B. Turk V. Dolenc I.

Formisano S. Consiglio E. Presence of dityrosine bridges in thyroglobulin and their relationship with iodination.BBRC. 1994; 202: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) that can form non-disulfide-linked covalent TG dimers (36Haeberli A. Kneubuehl F. Studer H. Changes in the polypeptide assembly of guinea pig thyroglobulin induced by thyrotropin-regulated thyroid activity.Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and also increased TG phosphorylation (37Consiglio E. Acquaviva A.M. Formisano S. Liguoro D. Gallo A. Vittorio T. Santisteban P. De Luca M. Shifrin S. Yeh H.J. Characterization of phosphate residues on thyroglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10304-10314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can occur within TG carbohydrate, phosphotyrosine, and phosphoserine residues. Recently, Fam20C was identified as a secretory pathway kinase that phosphorylates hundreds of secreted proteins, with a marked preference for Ser residues within the consensus sequence Ser-X-Glu/phospho-Ser (38Tagliabracci V.S. Wiley S.E. Guo X. Kinch L.N. Durrant E. Wen J. Xiao J. Cui J. Nguyen K.B. Engel J.L. Coon J.J. Grishin N. Pinna L.A. Pagliarini D.J. Dixon J.E. A single kinase generates the majority of the secreted phosphoproteome.Cell. 2015; 161: 1619-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We observed a TSH dose-dependent 3-fold stimulation of Fam20C mRNA levels in PCCL3 cells (Fig. 5A). To examine the potential contribution of increased Fam20C mRNA on de novo T3 formation in TG, we eliminated this increase using siRNA knockdown of Fam20C in TSH-stimulated PCCL3 cells (Fig. 5B). Upon in vitro iodination of secreted TG, TSH-stimulated cells with knockdown of Fam20C showed significantly less de novo T3 formation (Fig. 5C, quantified in D). Moreover, treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase to dephosphorylate TG secreted from TSH-stimulated PCCL3 cells decreased de novo T3 formation in TG by 26% (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that TG phosphorylation (37Consiglio E. Acquaviva A.M. Formisano S. Liguoro D. Gallo A. Vittorio T. Santisteban P. De Luca M. Shifrin S. Yeh H.J. Characterization of phosphate residues on thyroglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10304-10314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is one of the TSH-stimulated post-translational modifications that contribute to altering the structure of TG to increase de novo T3 formation within TG. Graves' disease involves thyroidal overactivity leading to thyrotoxicosis, with a particular predilection to increased circulating T3, i.e. relative T3 toxicosis (9Schimmel M. Utiger R.D. Thyroidal and peripheral production of thyroid hormones: review of recent findings and their clinical implications.Ann. Intern. Med. 1977; 87: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine whether a TSHR-stimulating immunoglobulin could also promote enhanced de novo T3 formation, PCCL3 cells were cultured for 5 days in the presence or absence of KSAb1, a strong TSHR-stimulating immunoglobulin (39Gilbert J.A. Gianoukakis A.G. Salehi S. Moorhead J. Rao P.V. Khan M.Z. McGregor A.M. Smith T.J. Banga J.P. Monoclonal pathogenic antibodies to the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor in Graves' disease with potent thyroid-stimulating activity but differential blocking activity activate multiple signaling pathways.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5084-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After the culture period, serum-free secretion from PCCL3 cells was collected for the ensuing 24 h and the secreted proteins were iodinated in vitro. From the results shown in Fig. 6A, left (quantified at right), it was clear that TG secreted from PCCL3 cells that had been previously incubated with KSAb1 showed significantly increased de novo T3 formation. Thyrotoxicosis and complications of Graves' disease have been found to improve when the elevated concentrations of circulating TSHR-stimulating immunoglobulins are reversed, for example, by plasmapheresis (40Prummel M.F. Wiersinga W.M. Immunomodulatory treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy.Thyroid. 1998; 8: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine reversibility of enhanced de novo T3 formation in TG, we washed out the KSAb1 and collected TG secreted over the next 24 h, or the subsequent 48 h thereafter. Upon iodination in vitro, it was apparent that beyond 24 h after washout of KSAb1, the subsequent secretion contained TG that had reverted back to a decreased ability for de novo T3 formation (Fig. 6B, left, quantified at right). One clinical assay to screen for TSHR-stimulating immunoglobulins involves measuring responses to antibodies contained within the sera of human Graves' patients, in a cultured rat thyrocyte cell line (41Kasagi K. Konishi J. Iida Y. Tokuda Y. Arai K. Endo K. Torizuka K. A sensitive and practical assay for thyroid-stimulating antibodies using FRTL-5 thyroid cells.Acta Endocrinol. 1987; 115: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we cultured PCCL3 cells for 5 days in the presence of control sera from 5 individuals without Graves' disease or from 2 patients with Graves' disease. After exposure to the human sera, serum-free secretion from PCCL3 cells was collected for the ensuing 24 h and the secreted proteins were iodinated in vitro. From the results shown in Fig. 7, culture with each of the 5 control sera resulted in subsequent TG secretion with approximately the same potential for de novo T3 formation. By contrast, culture with unpurified sera from two Graves' disease patients both suggested an increase in the ability of the subsequently secreted TG to form T3 upon iodination. Finally, we collected secretion from cultured primary human thyrocytes that were obtained from normal thyroid tissue of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for localized thyroid cancer. In monolayer culture in TSH-containing medium to which additional iodide was not added, there was no detectable T3 found within TG secreted into the culture medium, regardless of the TSH dose (Fig. 8A). However, when the TSH concentration in the culture medium was increased by an order o"

During pregnancy, many women experience sleep problems and anxiety that require treatment. The long-term safety for the child of maternal benzodiazepine (BZD) and z-hypnotic use during pregnancy remains controversial.


Method 
We conducted a cohort and a sibling control study using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Data on use of BZD and z-hypnotics, internalizing and externalizing outcomes, and covariates were collected from mothers at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and when children were 0.5, 1.5, and 3 years of age. The total sample consisted of 71,996 children (19,297 siblings) at 1.5 years and 55,081 children (13,779 siblings) at 3 years. Short-term use was defined as use in one pregnancy period only. Long-term use was defined as use in two or more pregnancy periods. Linear full cohort random-effect and sibling-matched fixed-effect regression models were used to compare internalizing and externalizing behavior in children prenatally exposed compared to those unexposed in the full cohort of pregnancies accounting for family clusters, as well as within sibling clusters comparing pregnancies with discordant exposures. Propensity score (PS) adjustment included variables on indication for use (sleep problems, symptoms of anxiety and depression) and other potential confounding factors.


Results 
Long-term prenatal exposure to BZD or z-hypnotics was associated with increased internalizing behavior in crude cohort analyses and at age 1.5 years after PS adjustment in sibling-matched fixed-effect models [β 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.17–0.95]. Analyses on specific drug groups showed that prenatal exposure to BZD-anxiolytics was associated with increased internalizing problems at both 1.5 years [β 0.25, 0.01–0.49] and 3 years [β 0.26, 0.002–0.52] while exposure to z-hypnotics was not associated with any adverse outcomes after adjustment.


Conclusion 
The findings suggest a moderate association between BZD-anxiolytic exposure and child internalizing problems that is not likely due to stable familial confounding factors."

Incorporating drought tolerance and late blight resistance in the same genotypes will enable the development of cultivars with high and stable yield potential under erratic rainfall conditions. The objectives of this study were to assess combining ability effects and gene action for tuber yield and traits related to drought tolerance in the International Potato Centre’s (CIP’s) advanced clones from the late blight resistant breeding population B group ‘B3C2’ and to identify promising parents and families for cultivar development. Sixteen advanced clones from the late blight resistant breeding population were crossed in two sets using the North Carolina Design II. The resulting 32 families were evaluated together with five checks and 12 parental clones in a 7 x 7 lattice design with two water regimes and two replications. The experiment was carried out at Adet, in northwest Ethiopia under well-watered and water stressed conditions with terminal drought imposed from the tuber bulking stage. The results showed highly significant differences between families, checks, and parents for growth, physiological, and tuber yield related traits. Traits including marketable tuber yield, marketable tuber number, average tuber weight and groundcover were positively correlated with total tuber yield under both drought stressed and well-watered conditions. Plant height was correlated with yield only under drought stressed condition. GCA was more important than SCA for total tuber yield, marketable tuber yield, average tuber weight, plant height, groundcover, and chlorophyll content under stress. This study identified the parents with best GCA and the combinations with best SCA effects, for both tuber yield and drought tolerance related traits. The new population is shown to be a valuable genetic resource for variety selection and improvement of potato’s adaptation to the drought prone areas in northwest Ethiopia and similar environments."

In Chile, eradication of PRRS virus (PRRSV) was successfully achieved in 2009 as a result of the combined efforts of producers and the animal health authorities. In October 2013, after several years without detecting PRRSV under surveillance activities, suspected cases were confirmed on a commercial swine farm. Here, we describe the PRRS epidemic in Chile between October 2013 and April 2015, and we studied the origins and spread of PRRSV throughout the country using official surveillance data and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Our results indicate that the outbreaks were caused by a PRRSV closely related to viruses present in swine farms in North America, and different from the strain that circulated in the country before 2009. Using divergence time estimation analysis, we found that the 2013-2015 PRRSV may have been circulating in Chile for at least one month before the first detection. A single strain of PRRSV spread into a limited number of commercial and backyard swine farms. New infections in commercial systems have not been reported since October 2014, and eradication is underway by clearing the disease from the few commercial and backyard farms that remain positive.

MC3T3-E1 cells were pretreated with 0–400 μg/mL tanshinol, and then cell viability, apoptosis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expressions of Collagen Type I Alpha 1 (Col1A1), Runt Related Transcription Factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (OCN) were respectively detected. Rats underwent OVX surgery was intervened with 5 mg/kg tanshinol or 25 μg/kg β-estradiol (E2) for 12 weeks. The triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C and LDL-C), ALP, OCN and Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b) contents were measured. Besides, the expressions of main factors in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway were detected. The results showed that tanshinol significantly promoted MC3T3-E1 cells viability and ALP activity, while inhibited apoptosis (P < 0.05); Col1A1, Runx2 and OCN were all up-regulated by tanshinol (P < 0.05). In OVX rats, the contents of TG, TC, LDL-C, ALP, OCN and TRACP-5b were all increased (P < 0.05), while HDL-C was decreased (P < 0.05). Tanshinol significantly alleviated these aberrant regulations (P < 0.05). Inhibitory subunit of NF-κB (IκBα) and p65 were both remarkably phosphorylated by OVX, while this phosphorylation was partially neutralized by tanshinol (P < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrated that tanshinol exerted a bone-protective function by modulating the markers of bone turnover possibly via blocking NF-κB pathway. This study will provide new evidence that tanshinol is a potential therapeutic option for the relief of estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2738927346,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive and TKI-resistant mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutants were previously shown to exhibit ligand-independent activation. We have previously demonstrated that pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D, SFTPD) suppressed wild-type EGFR signaling by blocking ligand binding to EGFR. We herein demonstrate that SFTPD downregulates ligand-independent signaling in cells harboring EGFR mutations such as TKI-sensitive exon 19 deletion (Ex19del) and L858R mutation as well as TKI-resistant T790M mutation, subsequently suppressing cellular growth and motility. Lectin blotting and ligand blotting in lung cancer cell lines suggested that EGFR mutants express oligomannose-type N-glycans and interact with SFTPD directly. Cross-linking assay indicated that SFTPD inhibits ligand-independent dimerization of EGFR mutants. We also demonstrated that SFTPD reduced dimerization-independent phosphorylation of Ex19del and T790M EGFR mutants using point mutations that disrupted the asymmetric dimer interface. It was confirmed that SFTPD augmented the viability-suppressing effects of EGFR-TKIs. Furthermore, retrospective analysis of 121 patients with lung adenocarcinoma to examine associations between serum SFTPD levels and clinical outcome indicated that in TKI-treated patients with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations, including Ex19del or L858R, high serum SFTPD levels correlated with a lower number of distant metastases and prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival. These findings suggest that SFTPD downregulates both TKI-sensitive and -resistant EGFR mutant signaling, and SFTPD level is correlated with clinical outcome. These findings illustrate the use of serum SFTPD level as a potential marker to estimate the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs."
https://openalex.org/W2736859319,"Precise knowledge about the extent of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; c. 26.5-19 cal. ka BP) is important in order to 1) improve paleo-ice sheet reconstructions, 2) provide a robust empirical framework for calibrating paleo-ice sheet models, and 3) locate potential shelf refugia for Antarctic benthos during the last glacial period. However, reliable reconstructions are still lacking for many WAIS sectors, particularly for key areas on the outer continental shelf, where the LGM-ice sheet is assumed to have terminated. In many areas of the outer continental shelf around Antarctica, direct geological data for the presence or absence of grounded ice during the LGM is lacking because of post-LGM iceberg scouring. This also applies to most of the outer continental shelf in the Amundsen Sea. Here we present detailed marine geophysical and new geological data documenting a sequence of glaciomarine sediments up to ~12 m thick within the deep outer portion of Abbot Trough, a palaeo-ice stream trough on the outer shelf of the Amundsen Sea Embayment. The upper 2-3 meters of this sediment drape contain calcareous foraminifera of Holocene and (pre-)LGM age and, in combination with palaeomagnetic age constraints, indicate that continuous glaciomarine deposition persisted here since well before the LGM, possibly even since the last interglacial period. Our data therefore indicate that the LGM grounding line, whose exact location was previously uncertain, did not reach the shelf edge everywhere in the Amundsen Sea. The LGM grounding line position coincides with the crest of a distinct grounding-zone wedge ~100 km inland from the continental shelf edge. Thus, an area of ≥6000 km2 remained free of grounded ice through the last glacial cycle, requiring the LGM grounding line position to be re-located in this sector, and suggesting a new site at which Antarctic shelf benthos may have survived the last glacial period."

https://openalex.org/W2737759991,"The beta-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) is a promising therapeutic target intrinsically involved in the cognitive deficits and pathological features associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Evidence indicates that ADRB1 plays an important role in regulating neuroinflammatory processes, and activation of ADRB1 may produce neuroprotective effects in neuroinflammatory diseases. Novel small molecule modulators of ADRB1, engineered to be highly brain permeable and functionally selective for the G protein with partial agonistic activity, could have tremendous value both as pharmacological tools and potential lead molecules for further preclinical development. The present study describes our ongoing efforts toward the discovery of functionally selective partial agonists of ADRB1 that have potential therapeutic value for AD and neuroinflammatory disorders, which has led to the identification of the molecule STD-101-D1. As a functionally selective agonist of ADRB1, STD-101-D1 produces partial agonistic activity on G protein signaling with an EC50 value in the low nanomolar range, but engages very little beta-arrestin recruitment compared to the unbiased agonist isoproterenol. STD-101-D1 also inhibits the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) both in vitro and in vivo, and shows high brain penetration. Other than the therapeutic role, this newly identified, functionally selective, partial agonist of ADRB1 is an invaluable research tool to study mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2739432980,"The main aim of this study was to provide evidence of the broad employability of the NEQ with patients of different gender and age with cancer in different phases of the disease and care process, using an Item Response Theory (IRT) approach and investigating Differential Item Functioning (DIF).The NEQ was completed by 762 patients visiting, consecutively, outpatient clinics or admitted to oncology wards. Patients included in the study had different primary tumor sites and were in different phases of the disease and care process. The properties of the questionnaire were analyzed by applying IRT to test how well each item of the scale concurs in measuring unmet needs, how reliable the whole scale is, and whether the scale was metrically invariant across gender, age, and phase of the disease.Results showed that the NEQ performed well in measuring unmet needs and measurement equivalence of the scale across gender, age, and phase of the disease was verified.The current study supports the utility and broad employability of the NEQ, thus providing empirical evidence that it is psychometrically sound and metrically equivalent across different groups of cancer patients. As such, the scale could be an effective tool when planning psychosocial interventions to improve the care process and patients' quality of life."

Nevertheless, the effects of E. prolifera on microbial ecology remain unknown. In this study, for the first time, an Illumina sequencing analysis was used to investigate bacterial communities in source water, aquaculture ponds with E. prolifera, and an aquaculture pond in which E. prolifera -free. Principal coordinate and phylogenic analyses revealed obvious differences among the bacterial communities in the pond water with and without E. prolifera. Abundant bacterial taxa in the E. prolifera-containing pond were generally absent from the pond without E. prolifera. Interestingly, pond water with E. prolifera was dominated by Actinomycetales (> 50%), as well as by anaerobic bacteria in the underlying sediment (Desulfobacterales and Desulfuromonadales (> 20%). Pond water in which E. prolifera-free was dominated by Rhodobacterales (58.19%), as well as aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in the sediment. In addition, the ecological functions of other dominant bacteria, such as Candidatus Aquiluna, Microcella spp., and Marivita spp., should be studied in depth. Overall, massive growth of E. prolifera will have serious effects on bacterial communities, and, thus, it will have an important impact on the environment. The novel findings in this study will be valuable for understanding green tides."
https://openalex.org/W2739151653,"Myoferlin, a member of ferlin family of proteins, was first discovered as a candidate gene for muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Recently, myoferlin was shown to be also expressed in endothelial and cancer cells where it was shown to modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by enhancing their stability and recycling. Based on these reports, we hypothesized that myoferlin might be regulating IL-6 signaling by modulating IL-6R stabilization and recycling. However, in our immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments, we did not observe myoferlin binding with IL-6R. Instead, we made a novel discovery that in resting cells myoferlin was bound to EHD2 protein and when cells were treated with IL-6, myoferlin dissociated from EHD2 and binds to activated STAT3. Interestingly, myoferlin depletion did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation, but completely blocked STAT3 translocation to nucleus. In addition, inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by phosphorylation-defective STAT3 mutants or JAK inhibitor blocked STAT3 binding to myoferlin and nuclear translocation. Myoferlin knockdown significantly decreased IL-6-mediated tumor cell migration, tumorsphere formation and ALDH-positive cancer stem cell population, in vitro. Furthermore, myoferlin knockdown significantly decreased IL-6-meditated tumor growth and tumor metastasis. Based on these results, we have proposed a novel model for the role of myoferlin in chaperoning phosphorylated STAT3 to the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2737015479,"The lineage of the Bar-backed Partridge (Arborophila brunneopectus) was investigated to determine the phylogenetic relationships within Arborophila as the species is centrally distributed within an area covered by the distributions of 22 South-east Asian hill partridge species. The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of A. brunneopectus was determined and compared with four other hill partridge species mitogenomes. NADH subunit genes are radical in hill partridge mitogenomes and contain the most potential positive selective sites around where variable sites are abundant. Together with 44 other mitogenomes of closely related species, we reconstructed highly resolved phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses and calculated the divergence and dispersal history of Arborophila using combined datasets composed of their 13-protein coding sequences. Arborophila is reportedly be the oldest group in Phasianidae whose ancestors probably originated in Asia. A. rufipectus shares a closer relationship with A. ardens and A. brunneopectus compared to A. gingica and A. rufogularis, and such relationships were supported and profiled by NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5). The intragenus divergence of all five Arborophila species occurred in the Miocene (16.84~5.69 Mya) when there were periods of climate cooling. We propose that these cooling events in the Miocene forced hill partridges from higher to lower altitudes, which led to geographic isolation and speciation. We demonstrated that the apparently deleterious +1 frameshift mutation in NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) found in all Arborophila is an ancient trait that has been eliminated in some younger lineages, such as Passeriformes. It is unclear of the biological advantages of this elimination for the relevant taxa and this requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2739449347,"While Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent one of the best characterized innate immune pathways, evidence suggests that TLRs are not restricted to innate leukocytes and some epithelial cells, but are also expressed in T cells. Specifically, published evidence focusing on FoxP3+ regulatory T cells demonstrate that they express functional TLR2, which is already known among the TLR family for its association with immune suppression; however, little is known about the relationship between T cell-intrinsic TLR2 binding and cytokine production, T cell differentiation, or T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that TCR and TLR2 co-stimulation provides a T cell-intrinsic signal which generates a dramatic, synergistic cytokine response dominated by IL-10. Importantly, the response was not seen in either CD4+CD25+ or CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs, yet resulted in the expansion of a suppressive CD4+CD25+CD62L-CD44+CD45Rbhi effector/memory T cell subset not typically associated with immune inhibition. This study reveals the striking ability of a prototypical innate immune receptor to trigger a potent and suppressive IL-10 response in effector/memory T cells, supporting the notion that TLR2 is a co-regulatory receptor on T cells."

Thus we engineered a novel transgenic mouse line expressing the human Ki-Ras bearing an activating mutation (Ki-Ras(G12V)) selectively in the mammary epithelium after lactation. These mice develop invasive ductal adenocarcinomas with 100% incidence within 3–9 months after Ki-Ras(G12V) induction. Immunophenotyping revealed that the mammary tumors express luminal markers, are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, negative for HER2 and have a low proliferation index. Moreover, cell lines derived from such tumors are estrogen-responsive and, when transplanted into nude mice, form tumors that respond to the antiestrogen ICI 182780. In conclusion, the mammary tumors of these transgenic mice and the derived cell lines exhibit key features of the major form of human breast cancer, that is, luminal A subtype and thus have a high potential for breast cancer research and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2737445983,"The identification and characterization of germ cell-specific genes are essential if we hope to comprehensively understand the mechanisms of spermatogenesis and fertilization. Here, we searched the mouse UniGene databases and identified 13 novel genes as being putatively testis-specific or -predominant. Our in silico and in vitro analyses revealed that the expressions of these genes are testis- and germ cell-specific, and that they are regulated in a stage-specific manner during spermatogenesis. We generated antibodies against the proteins encoded by seven of the genes to facilitate their characterization in male germ cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that one of these proteins was expressed only in testicular germ cells, three were expressed in both testicular germ cells and testicular sperm, and the remaining three were expressed in sperm of the testicular stages and in mature sperm from the epididymis. Further analysis of the latter three proteins showed that they were all associated with cytoskeletal structures in the sperm flagellum. Among them, MORN5, which is predicted to contain three MORN motifs, is conserved between mouse and human sperm. In conclusion, we herein identify 13 authentic genes with male germ cell-specific expression, and provide comprehensive information about these genes and their encoded products. Our finding will facilitate future investigations into the functional roles of these novel genes in spermatogenesis and sperm functions."

At low tree densities, single trees in these systems represent habitat islands for epiphytic cryptogams. Here, we focused on sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) wooded pastures in the northern European Alps. We assessed per tree species richness of bryophytes and lichens on 90 sycamore maple trees distributed across six study sites. We analysed the effects of a range of explanatory variables (tree characteristics, environmental variables and isolation measures) on the richness of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens and various functional subgroups (based on diaspore size, habitat preference and red list status). Furthermore, we estimated the effect of these variables on the occurrence of two specific bryophyte species (Tayloria rudolphiana, Orthotrichum rogeri) and one lichen species (Lobaria pulmonaria) of major conservation concern. Bryophytes and lichens, as well as their subgroups, were differently and sometimes contrastingly affected by the variables considered: tree diameter at breast height had no significant effect on bryophytes but negatively affected many lichen groups; tree phenological age positively affected red-listed lichens but not red-listed bryophytes; increasing isolation from neighbouring trees negatively affected lichens but not bryophytes. However, the high-priority bryophyte species T. rudolphiana was also negatively affected by increased isolation at small spatial scales. Orthotrichum rogeri was more frequent on young trees and L. pulmonaria was more frequent on trees with thin stems and large crowns. The results indicate that local dispersal is important for lichens, whereas long distance dispersal seems to be more important for colonisation by bryophytes. Furthermore, our study highlights that different conservation measures need to be taken depending on the taxonomic and functional species group or the individual species that is addressed. In practice, for the conservation of a high overall richness in sylvo-pastoral systems, it is crucial to sustain not only old and large trees but rather a wide range of tree sizes and ages."
https://openalex.org/W2739060379,"The current understanding of the specificity of the bacterial class I release factors (RFs) in decoding stop codons has evolved beyond a simple tripeptide anticodon model. A recent molecular dynamics study for deciphering the principles for specific stop codon recognition by RFs identified Arg-213 as a crucial residue on Escherichia coli RF2 for discriminating guanine in the third position (G3). Interestingly, Arg-213 is highly conserved in RF2 and substituted by Ile-196 in the corresponding position in RF1. Another similar pair is Leu-126 in RF1 and Asp-143 in RF2, which are also conserved within their respective groups. With the hypothesis that replacement of Arg-213 and Asp-143 with the corresponding RF1 residues will reduce G3 discrimination by RF2, we swapped these residues between E. coli RF1 and RF2 by site-directed mutagenesis and characterized their preference for different codons using a competitive peptide release assay.

Peptide release during translation termination is the end of protein synthesis on the ribosome (for review see Ref. 1.Youngman E.M. McDonald M.E. Green R. Peptide release on the ribosome: mechanism and implications for translational control.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 353-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Translation termination begins when one of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is translocated into the ribosomal A site, and the peptidyl tRNA is translocated into the P site. The ester bond between the P site tRNA and polypeptide chain must be hydrolyzed for the release of the nascent peptide. In bacteria, class I release factors RF1 3The abbreviations used are: RF, release factor; RC, release complex; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; IF, initiation factor. 3The abbreviations used are: RF, release factor; RC, release complex; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; IF, initiation factor. and RF2 recognize overlapping sets of three different termination signals (stop codons). Both factors recognize UAA, whereas UAG is read specifically by RF1 and UGA by RF2 (2.Scolnick E. Tompkins R. Caskey T. Nirenberg M. Release factors differing in specificity for terminator codons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1968; 61: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic protein synthesis, eRF1 is the single class I RF, facilitating peptide release at all three stop codons. It is an open question why bacteria have two RFs acting in a semispecific manner, whereas eukaryotes have only one RF. The accuracy with which RFs discriminate against the other 61 (sense) codons in bacteria is remarkably high. The reported error rate is 1 in 104 in vivo (3.Jørgensen F. Adamski F.M. Tate W.P. Kurland C.G. Release factor-dependent false stops are infrequent in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); the frequency of error for all single mismatches relative to stop codons ranges from 1 in 103 to 106 in vitro (4.Freistroffer D.V.

Principles of stop-codon reading on the ribosome.Nature. 2010; 465: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) proposed that the following residues are involved: Gly-120, Glu-123, Leu-126, Gln-185, and Ile-196 on RF1 and Gly-137, Glu-140, Asp-143, Val-192, and Arg-213 on RF2 (Escherichia coli numbering, used throughout in this work) in specific reading of the second and third positions of the stop codon. Differential reading of the third position of a stop codon by RFs attracts considerable interest because it underpins the specificity of RF2 for the UGA codon. RF1 accepts both an adenine and a guanine at the third position (A3 and G3, respectively), whereas RF2 has to discriminate against G3 reading, which would otherwise lead to misreading of the tryptophan codon (UGG) as a stop codon. Recent MD-free energy perturbation simulation (using the available structures of termination complexes) revealed that a water molecule is possibly introduced into the decoding site during RF1 binding to the UAG and UAA stop codons, which facilitates further hydrogen-bonding between G3 of the stop codon and U531 of rRNA, essential for G3 reading (10.Sund J. Andér M. Aqvist J. Principles of stop-codon reading on the ribosome.Nature. 2010; 465: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of RF2, however, a conserved residue, Arg-213, prevents the water molecule from entering the codon recognition site due to its long side chain, thereby preventing G3 reading by RF2 (10.Sund J. Andér M. Aqvist J. Principles of stop-codon reading on the ribosome.Nature. 2010; 465: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When RF1 and RF2 amino acid sequences from various bacteria are aligned together focusing mainly on the stop codon reading elements, a high degree of homology was observed between the two groups with some exceptions, which are moderately well conserved within the group. These include the PXT motif on RF1 and the SPF motif on RF2. Similarly, Ile-196 on RF1 and Arg-213 on RF2 were found in the corresponding positions (Fig. 1). Because Arg-213 was proposed to play a crucial role for RF2's discrimination for G3 from MD simulation (10.Sund J. Andér M. Aqvist J. Principles of stop-codon reading on the ribosome.Nature. 2010; 465: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that exchanging Arg-213 with isoleucine (Ile) as in RF1 or with alanine (Ala), an even smaller side chain might allow RF2 to read G3 better than the WT because the water-blocking effect of Arg-213 would be removed. Alternatively, changing Ile-196 to Arg in RF1 might increase its discrimination against G3, whereas replacing Ile-196 with Ala would be less discriminative of G3 compared with the WT RF1. Other than the residues discussed above, Leu-126 in RF1 and Asp-143 in RF2 were also found in the corresponding positions, which are highly conserved in their respective groups (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, these residues are located in the α-helix, supporting the stop codon recognition loop (Fig. 1, B and C). Even though these residues may not be directly involved in stop codon recognition, they play supporting roles for the major residues. Thus, we reasoned that exchanging Asp-143 with Leu will also reduce RF2's discrimination for G3 and changing Leu-126 in RF1 to Asp would increase discrimination for G3. Mutational analyses of the key residues on RF1/RF2, although crucial for complementing the available structural data, are limited. Mutations of the PXT and SPF motifs of RF1 and RF2 first illustrated the crucial role of these tripeptide motifs in specific reading of the stop codons (12.Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Polypeptide release at sense and non-cognate stop codons by localized charge-exchange alterations in translational release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1819-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Besides those, biochemical data are available for the alanine mutants of few conserved residues within the decoding region of RF1 (Gln-185, Arg-186, Thr-190, His-197, and Thr-198) (13.Field A.

Thermodynamic and kinetic insights into stop codon recognition by Release Factor 1.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e94058Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These mutations showed a modest decrease in the maximal rate of peptide release (kcat) but resulted in a large 100-fold increase in the dissociation constant (kD) when bound to the ribosome with a cognate stop codon in the A site. However, similar mutational analysis of RF2 is not available to date. Based on a fitness compensatory mutation (E167K) in the RF1 knock-out background, Glu-167 was suggested to play a crucial role in UAG reading by RF2 (12.Uno M. Ito K. Nakamura Y. Polypeptide release at sense and non-cognate stop codons by localized charge-exchange alterations in translational release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ito K. Nakamura Y. Polypeptide release at sense and non-cognate stop codons by localized charge-exchange alterations in translational release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Also, no mutational studies are available for Asp-143 in RF2. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated several E. coli RF1/RF2 variants (RF1 I196A, RF1 I196R, RF1 L126D, RF2 R213A, RF2 R213I, and RF2 D143L) and characterized those in a competition assay for single-round peptide release (19.Bouakaz L.

These include UAG and UGA stop codons and UGG (Trp), UCA (Ser), and AAA (Lys) codons. Among all the mutants tested, the R213I mutant RF2 showed the highest degree of improvement (5-fold) in UAG reading relative to UAA during translation termination while maintaining discrimination against UCA and UGG codons. To understand the basis of the altered sensitivity of the R213I mutant, we characterized it further with fast kinetic analysis for reading UAA and UAG codons and also in full-length protein synthesis assay using a reconstituted transcription-translation system. Ribosomal RCs were prepared with fMet-tRNAfMet in the P site and various codons in the A site (see the list of codons in Table 1). The fMet in the RCUAA was radioactively labeled with 3H. Other RCs (RCXXX) contained one of the five different codons (UAG, UGA, UGG, UCA, or AAA) in the A site, and [35S]fMet-tRNAfMet in the P site. All RF proteins RF1 and RF2 WT and mutants RF1 I196A, RF1 I196R, RF1 L126D, RF2 R213A, RF2 R213I, and RF2 D143L were prepared using standard laboratory protocols.Table 1A values (as defined in Equation 1) determined from the competition assays using [35S]fMet-RCUAA versus [3H]fMet-RCXXX, where XXX represents the codon specified in the first row of the tableUAGUGAUCAUGGAAARF1 WT0.929.529.532.5–*Beyond the detection limit.RF1 I196A127.768.2135–*Beyond the detection limit.RF1 I196R1.468.936.831.3–*Beyond the detection limit.RF1 L126D1.39.216.112.1–*Beyond the detection limit.RF2 WT33136.733.9–*Beyond the detection limit.RF2 R213A22.41.15966.3–*Beyond the detection limit.RF2 R213I6.51.461.520.2–*Beyond the detection limit.RF2 D143L12.21.110.352.2–*Beyond the detection limit.* Beyond the detection limit. Open table in a new tab In the competition experiments, equal amounts of RCUAA carrying [3H]fMet-tRNAfMet and RCXXX carrying [35S]fMet-tRNAfMet were mixed together. To this mix, RF variants were added in increasing concentrations, and the amounts of [3H]fMet and [35S]fMet released in a single round reaction were measured (Fig. 2). From these data, a discrimination parameter A, reflecting the relative preference of the RFs for UAA over the other codon was determined as described under “Experimental procedures.” The higher the value of A, the higher is the discrimination against the competing codon with respect to UAA. Thus, decrease in the A value for a particular codon due to any mutation in a RF will indicate relatively improved reading of that codon by the mutant RF. The A values are listed in Table 1. All RF mutants recognized UAA and the respective cognate codons of their WT counterparts (UAG for RF1 or UGA for RF2 mutants) with similar efficiency (A values ranging from 0.9 to 1.4), thereby demonstrating no discrimination between UAA and the specific cognate codon (Fig. 2, A and B, Table 1). In contrast, no peptide release was detected with RCs with a sense codon AAA coding for lysine; consequently, the slope of the discrimination curve was infinite, and the A value could not be determined (Table 1). None of the RF1 variants displayed an improved reading of UGA respective to UAA while maintaining substantial levels of discrimination on other non-cognate codons tested here. The RF1 I196A produced a WT-like A value for the non-cognate UGA codon but showed 4- and 2-fold higher discriminations against UGG and UCA codons, respectively. The I196R mutant, on the other hand, showed a 2-fold increased discrimination against UGA but WT-like A values for UCA and UGG codons. Interestingly, the L126D mutation showed an ∼2-fold improved reading of UGA, but at the same time it also lost discrimination against UGG and UCA codons. Based on these results, we excluded all RF1 mutants from further investigation, as none of those showed improvement in omnipotent reading of the stop codons. For RF2 mutants the same screening process was applied; in contrast to RF1, all RF2 variants showed a moderate to significant decrease in discrimination against RF1-specific UAG codon. The R213A mutation showed a 1.5× smaller A value for the UAG codon but ∼2-fold higher A values for both UCA and UGG codons. The D143L mutant showed a 3-fold smaller A value for the UAG codon, but it also lost discrimination against the UCA codon to the same extent, whereas its discrimination against UGG codon increased 1.5×. The most interesting mutant was RF2 R213I, as it displayed 5× less discrimination against the UAG codon than the RF2 WT (Fig. 2C) while having an almost 2-fold higher discrimination against UCA and a moderate (1.5×) loss of discrimination against UGG codon. Thus, our competition assay identified RF2 R213I as a promising candidate toward making an omnipotent release factor. Therefore, RF2 R213I was selected for further in-depth kinetic analysis. The competition assays were limited only to three sense codons. Thus, to test the ability of RF2 R213I to discriminate against a variety of sense codons in a cellular scenario, we performed an in vitro full-length protein synthesis experiment using a fully reconstituted transcription (T7 based)-translation system with individually purified components from E. coli (20.Mandava C.S. Peisker K. Ederth J. Kumar R. Ge X. Szaflarski W. Sanyal S. Bacterial ribosome requires multiple L12 dimers for efficient initiation and elongation of protein synthesis involving IF2 and EF-G.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recognition of any sense codon by RF2 R213I would lead to peptide release and, thus, would generate truncated products due to premature translation termination. Alternatively, a full-length protein band of expected size would signify its capacity in recognizing the stop codon accurately. E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was used as the reporter protein as it contains a broad range of sense codons (all except ACG, TCC, AGG) and UAA as the stop codon. As shown in Fig. 3, a single clear band of the full-length DHFR protein was seen with RF1 WT and RF2 WT as well as RF2 R213I (Fig. 3, lanes A, B, and C, respectively). The negative control reaction without RFs showed only a faint spot in the same place (Fig. 3, lane D). In addition, we evaluated the amount of synthesized protein by measuring radioactive count. The same counts per mm2 were noted for RF1 WT and RF2 WT samples (8600 and 8700 counts/mm2, respectively), whereas it was somewhat lower for RF2 R213I samples (7700 counts/mm2). The value for the negative control was ∼600 counts/mm2. The experiment was done in duplicates with similar outcomes. Because we did not detect any truncated products of DHFR with either RF2 WT or R213I mutant, we conclude that similar to RF2 WT, the RF2 R213I mutant does not induce a discrete premature peptide release or translation termination on any sense codon within the limits of this assay. It also means that RF2 R213I retains the specificity against the sense codons at the same level as the RF2 WT. To investigate the kinetic properties of the RF2 R213I, we performed a single turnover fMet (peptide) release assay using fast kinetics (Fig. 4). RCUAA and RCUAG presenting UAA and UAG codons in the A site, respectively, were produced by binding [3H]fMet to AUG-UAA/UAG mRNA-programmed 70S ribosomes. RF variants at different concentrations were rapidly mixed with the RCs in the quench-flow, and the rate of [3H]fMet release was measured by plotting the amount of released [3H]fMet against time. The rates, when plotted against RF concentration, generated hyperbolic curves, from which Michaelis-Menten parameters, namely kcat (the maximal rate of peptide release) and Km (the RF concentration at half-maximal rate), were estimated (Fig. 4). At UAA codons, the RF2 WT released [3H]fMet with a kcat of 12.1 ± 1.1 s−1 and a Km of 123 ± 29 nm (Fig. 4A), leading to a translational efficiency (kcat/Km) of 98.2 × 10−6 μm−1 s−1, in good agreement with published results (4.Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21.Indrisiunaite G. Pavlov M.Y. Heurgué-Hamard V. Ehrenberg M. On the pH dependence of class-1 RF-dependent termination of mRNA translation.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 1848-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In comparison, RF2 R213I showed a 3-fold smaller kcat (3.8 ± 0.03 s−1) than WT, whereas the Km was similar to the WT (102 ± 3.5 nm); this resulted in a translational efficiency of 37.2 × 10−6 μm−1 s−1. At the non-cognate UAG stop codon, the RF2 WT showed a kcat equal to 1.49 ± 0.16 s−1 and a Km of 1045 ± 342 nm, resulting in kcat/Km values of 1.4 × 10−6 μm−1 s−1, almost 70× less than the UAA codon. For UAG reading by RF2 R213I, kcat was 0.79 ± 0.13 s−1, and Km was 875 ± 282 nm; thus, kcat/Km was 0.9 × 10−6 μm−1 s−1, ∼40 times less than the cognate UAA codon. When compared with the WT, the translation termination efficiency (kcat/Km) of the RF2 R213I mutant was found to be 2.6× less at the cognate UAA codon but quite similar for the non-cognate UAG codon. Thus, the relatively improved UAG reading by RF2 R213I with respect to UAA in the competition assay (Fig. 2C) is essentially not due to its increased efficiency of UAG reading but, rather, due to its reduced efficiency in UAA reading. We also note that the reduced efficiency of RF2 R213I in UAA reading originated from the 3-fold decrease in the kcat value compared with the WT. However, on non-cognate UAG codon, a 2-fold decrease in the kcat value for RF2 R213I relative to the WT was partially compensated by a decrease in Km, thereby leading to termination efficiency at UAG codon comparable with the WT. During the last decade, it was shown that stop codon recognition by the class I release factors is far more complex than the simple tripeptide anticodon theory (22.Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. A tripeptide “anticodon” deciphers stop codons in messenger RNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The tRNA mimicry hypothesis is certainly valid from the structural viewpoint, as the RFs span from the decoding center to the peptidyl transferase center, like the tRNAs, and the tripeptide motifs PXT in RF1 and SPF in RF2 appear in the similar positions as the tRNA anticodons, but it oversimplifies the mechanism of stop codon recognition. Computational, biochemical, and structural studies unraveled a complex network (including, but not limited to the tripeptide anticodon) of hydrogen bonds between the RFs, the stop codon, and the ribosome, which are now believed to be essential for accurate recognition of the stop codons (5.Korostelev A.

Visualization of codon-dependent conformational rearrangements during translation termination.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this context, an early observation that a single point mutation E167K in RF2, acquired at the prfA-deleted background, enables it to read all three stop codons is worth mentioning (15.Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Single amino acid substitution in prokaryote polypeptide release factor 2 permits it to terminate translation at all three stop codons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8165-8169Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the basis of RF2 E167K to be an omnipotent RF in vivo is not well understood. This is not only because Glu-167 is located far from the decoding center but also because it showed significant loss of its activity for reading the cognate UAA codon. Thus, there could be additional fitness compensatory mutations (within the ribosome or elsewhere) in the RF2 E167K strain, which were not checked or characterized. Thus, in the current study we decided to try the reverse approach by incorporating mutations in the RFs based on structural and computational studies, which would direct us toward rational design of an omnipotent release factor. The first step of designing a RF that would read both UAG and UGA codons other than UAA codon is either to reduce the discrimination for G3 by RF2 or for G2 by RF1. In the current study we focused mainly on modifying RF2 for improved G3 reading; for that we closely inspected the analysis of the third position reading by Sund et al. (10.Sund J. Andér M. Aqvist J. Principles of stop-codon reading on the ribosome.Nature. 2010; 465: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using MD simulation based on high-resolution crystal structures of the RFs on the ribosome (7.Laurberg M.

Within ADHD, some individuals experience difficulty with positive/approach emotions, negative/withdrawal emotions, or both. These problems may reflect differences in emotional reactivity, emotion regulation, or a combination, and the neurophysiological correlates remain unclear. Event-related potentials were collected from 109 adolescents (49 with ADHD) while they completed an emotional go/no-go task with three conditions: happy (positive/approach), fear (negative/withdrawal), and neutral. The P1 and N170 were used as a marker of early emotional processing and the P3b and late positive potential (LPP) were used as markers of later elaborative emotional processing. Emotional response style was assessed with parent and adolescent report on the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. There were no effects of emotion or group for the P1. Typically-developing adolescents exhibited a larger N170 to emotional vs. neutral faces while adolescents with ADHD showed the opposite pattern. All adolescents exhibited a larger P3b to fearful versus other faces and a larger LPP to emotional vs. non-emotional faces. Within the ADHD group, N170 responses to happy faces predicted parent ratings of positive/approach emotions. Findings highlight the importance of considering within-group heterogeneity when studying clinical populations and help clarify the time-locked neurophysiological correlates of emotion dysregulation."

Primary stroke prevention is effective using transcranial Doppler (TCD) scans to measure intracranial blood velocities, and regular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide when these are abnormal. Inadequate TCD scans occur when it is not possible to measure velocities in all the main arteries. We have investigated the prevalence and significance of this in a retrospective audit of 3915 TCD scans in 1191 children, performed between 2008 and 2015. 79% scans were normal, 6.4% conditional, 2.8% abnormal and 12% inadequate. 21.6% of 1191 patients had an inadequate scan at least once. The median age of first inadequate scan was 3.3 years (0.7-19.4), with a U-shaped frequency distribution with age: 28% aged 2-3 years, 3.5% age 10 years, 25% age 16 years. In young children reduced compliance was the main reason for inadequate TCDs, whereas in older children it was due to a poor temporal ultrasound window. The prevalence of inadequate TCD was 8% in the main Vascular Laboratory at King's College Hospital and significantly higher at 16% in the outreach clinics (P<0.0001), probably due to the use of a portable ultrasound machine. Inadequate TCD scans were not associated with underlying cerebrovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2735908423,"Exposure to CO causes early afterdepolarization arrhythmias. Previous studies in rats have indicated that arrhythmias arose as a result of augmentation of the late Na+ current. The purpose of the present study was to examine the basis for CO-induced arrhythmias in guinea pig myocytes in which action potentials (APs) more closely resemble those of human myocytes. Whole-cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings were made from isolated guinea pig myocytes as well as from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells that express wild-type or a C723S mutant form of ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG; Kv11.1). We also monitored the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in HEK293 cells fluorimetrically. CO-applied as the CO-releasing molecule, CORM-2-prolonged the APs and induced early afterdepolarizations in guinea pig myocytes. In HEK293 cells, CO inhibited wild-type, but not C723S mutant, Kv11.1 K+ currents. Inhibition was prevented by an antioxidant, mitochondrial inhibitors, or inhibition of NO formation. CO also raised ONOO- levels, an effect that was reversed by the ONOO- scavenger, FeTPPS [5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphyrinato-iron(III)], which also prevented the CO inhibition of Kv11.1 currents and abolished the effects of CO on Kv11.1 tail currents and APs in guinea pig myocytes. Our data suggest that CO induces arrhythmias in guinea pig cardiac myocytes via the ONOO--mediated inhibition of Kv11.1 K+ channels.-Al-Owais, M. M., Hettiarachchi, N. T., Kirton, H. M., Hardy, M.

https://openalex.org/W2736614820,"Lung cancer arises through the acquisition of a number of genetic lesions, with a preponderance of activating mutations in the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK). BrafV600E expression induces benign lung adenomas that fail to progress to adenocarcinoma because of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). BrafV600E expression, coupled with simultaneous p53 ablation, permits bypass of senescence and progression to lung adenocarcinoma. However, spontaneous human tumors sustain mutations in a temporally separated manner. Here, we use a mouse lung cancer model where oncogene activation (BrafV600E expression) and tumor suppressor loss (p53 ablation) are independently controlled through the actions of Flp and Cre recombinase, respectively. We show that p53 loss before OIS is permissive for the transition from lung adenoma to adenocarcinoma. In contrast, p53 loss after senescence is established fails to enable escape from senescence and disease progression. This study demonstrates that BrafV600E induced senescence is irreversible in vivo and suggests that therapy-induced senescence would halt further tumor progression."

The effect of DRB could not be explained by inhibition of DNA replication per se or loading of RNA polymerase II to late promoters and subsequent reduction of transcription. Instead, DRB reduces accumulation of γ2 late mRNA in the cytoplasm. In addition, we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of the transcription factor SPT5, but not NELF-E, also gives rise to a specific inhibition of HSV-1 late gene expression. Finally, addition of DRB reduces co-immunoprecipitation of ICP27 using an anti-SPT5 antibody. Our results suggest that efficient expression of replication-dependent γ2 late genes is, at least in part, regulated by CDK9 dependent co- and/or post-transcriptional events involving SPT5 and ICP27.

Viruses are under strong selection to produce new infectious particles in cells. To achieve this goal, viruses coordinate synthesis of new genomes with synthesis of capsid proteins and assembly of the virion. The infectious cycle of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) illustrates this phenomenon. The expression of γ2 late genes, encoding e.g. capsid proteins and glycoproteins, is either strictly dependent on or strongly stimulated by viral DNA synthesis (1Honess R.W. Roizman B.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinating DNA replication and gene expression are poorly understood. The molecular mechanisms underlying the tightly regulated program for gene expression executed during lytic infection by HSV-1 have been extensively studied for several decades. In the classical version three classes of genes are expressed in a coordinated fashion (1Honess R.W. Roizman B. Regulation of herpesvirus macromolecular synthesis. I. Cascade regulation of the synthesis of three groups of viral proteins.J. Virol. 1974; 14: 8-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Honess R.W. Roizman B.

U.S.A. 1975; 72: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) during the HSV-1 infectious life cycle. First, a complex of the viral VP16, OCT1, and other host cell transcription factor acts on TAATGARAT elements upstream of promoters for immediate early genes (α genes) (4Wysocka J. Herr W. The herpes simplex virus VP16-induced complex: the makings of a regulatory switch.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 294-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Second, transcription of early genes (β genes) encoding enzymes required for DNA synthesis is activated by the immediate early gene product ICP4. Finally, the late genes (γ genes), which also require ICP4, are turned on when DNA replication starts (5Weir J.P. Regulation of herpes simplex virus gene expression.Gene. 2001; 271: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Some late genes, the γ1 genes, are not completely dependent on DNA synthesis, whereas the expression of γ2 genes is drastically reduced by suppression of HSV-1 DNA synthesis. An influential report has demonstrated that trans-acting factors present before or during replication are not enough to support γ2 gene expression indicating the existence of cis-acting mechanisms tightly associated with viral DNA synthesis (3Mavromara-Nazos P. Roizman B. Activation of herpes simplex virus 1 γ2 genes by viral DNA replication.Virology. 1987; 161: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Detailed analyses of early and late promoters suggest that upstream sequences govern expression of early genes and that downstream regulatory elements are important for expression of late genes (6McKnight S.L.

The importance of downstream regulatory elements in late gene expression is further demonstrated by an observation that RNA polymerase II can be loaded on HSV-1 late promoters in the presence of a DNA synthesis inhibitor without supporting gene expression, which suggests additional regulatory mechanisms acting downstream of promoter recognition (13Sampath P. Deluca N.A. Binding of ICP4, TATA-binding protein, and RNA polymerase II to herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early, early, and late promoters in virus-infected cells.J.

Such mechanisms might include the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) 3The abbreviations used are: P-TEFbpositive transcription elongation factor bDSIFDRB sensitivity-inducing factorDRB5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazolem.o.i.multiplicity of infectionh.p.i.hours postinfectiongglycoproteinqPCRquantitative PCRCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseRNA-SeqRNA-sequencing. and involve release of transcription complexes from promoter-proximal stalling as well as control of elongation checkpoints further downstream of gene promoter and close to polyadenylation signals (14Zhou Q.

Further evidence of CDK9 involvement in HSV-1 gene expression was supported by the observation that the transcription factor SPT5, which together with SPT4 is a part of DRB-sensitive inducing factor (DSIF), was localized to HSV-1 DNA near the viral replication fork (20Dembowski J.A.

In cells, DSIF becomes associated with RNA polymerase II after initiation of transcription and, together with the negative elongation factor NELF, acts to stall transcription in a promoter proximal position (14Zhou Q.

Here, we have embarked on a series of experiments aimed at identifying factors essential for expression of HSV-1 DNA replication-dependent genes. To start, by using ChIP technology we examined the kinetics and genetic requirements of RNA polymerase II binding to immediate early, early, and late promoters. In agreement with previous observations, we found that loading of RNA polymerase II on the late UL38 promoter requires the ICP4 transcription factor but was independent of DNA replication (13Sampath P. Deluca N.A. Binding of ICP4, TATA-binding protein, and RNA polymerase II to herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early, early, and late promoters in virus-infected cells.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that co- and post-transcriptional mechanisms play a significant role in regulating HSV-1 late gene expression. We also observed that DRB selectively affected the synthesis of γ2 late gene products with a much lower IC50 value than early gene expression. A direct role of CDK9 on γ2 late gene expression was then demonstrated by an experiment in which addition of DRB 7 h post-infection caused a drastic and specific inhibition of synthesis of HSV-1 late proteins. We also found that knockdown of SPT5 led to a profound reduction of synthesis of the late gene product glycoprotein C. In contrast, knockdown of NELF-E did not specifically affect late gene expression. Finally, we observed that ICP27 could be immunoprecipitated by an antibody directed against SPT5 and that this interaction was affected by DRB. We speculate that this finding may, at least partially, explain the reduced accumulation of late mRNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells induced by DRB and less efficient translation of viral mRNAs (29Smith R.W.P. Anderson R.C. Larralde O. Smith J.W.S. Gorgoni B. Richardson W.A. Malik P. Graham S.V. Gray N.K.

U.S.A. 2017; 114: 6310-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To establish a starting point, we reinvestigated the kinetics as well as the genetic requirements for loading of RNA polymerase II on the promoters controlling expression of the immediate early transcriptional regulator ICP4, the early gene encoding thymidine kinase UL23 and the late gene UL38 encoding a capsid protein. Regulation dependent on cis-acting elements for these genes has previously been examined in some detail (9Guzowski J.F. Singh J. Wagner E.K.

Mutational analysis of the herpes simplex virus type 1 strict late UL38 promoter/leader reveals two regions critical in transcriptional regulation.J.

We made use of two temperature-sensitive mutants: first, tsK, affecting the transcription factor ICP4, and second, tsS, affecting the UL9 origin-binding protein, required for initiation of DNA synthesis (33Davison M.J. Preston V.G. McGeoch D.J. Determination of the sequence alteration in the DNA of the herpes simplex virus type 1 temperature-sensitive mutant ts K.J. Gen.

Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 3119-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We examined binding of RNA polymerase II to viral promoters using ChIP analyses. The experiments were performed at the non-permissive temperatures for the temperature-sensitive mutants, 39 °C, at an m.o.i. of 7. The results were normalized to the value obtained for binding of RNA polymerase II to immediate early, early, and late promoters, respectively, at 1 h after addition of virus to the medium. In the text and in the figures this time point is defined as 1 hour post-infection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 1). For wild-type virus the results showed efficient loading of RNA polymerase II on immediate early ICP4, early UL23, and late UL38 promoters (Fig. 1, upper panel). We also noted that the occupancy of RNA polymerase II on immediate early promoters changed little over time. In contrast, binding of RNA polymerase II to the UL23 and UL38 promoters increased substantially at 4 h.p.i. At 7 h.p.i., when DNA synthesis had started, the promoter occupancy began to decrease. Infection with the tsK mutant revealed binding of RNA polymerase II to the immediate early promoter but not to a significant extent to the early and the late promoters (Fig. 1, middle panel). In contrast, infection with the tsS mutant led to a pronounced accumulation of RNA polymerase II at both early and late promoters at 4 and 7 h.p.i. (Fig. 1, lower panel). The results show, in agreement with a previous study, that ICP4 and not DNA replication is required to recruit RNA polymerase II to both early and late promoters (13Sampath P. Deluca N.A. Binding of ICP4, TATA-binding protein, and RNA polymerase II to herpes simplex virus type 1 immediate-early, early, and late promoters in virus-infected cells.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the decrease in promoter occupancy for the wild-type virus at 7 h.p.i. indicated that DNA replication and the increasing amounts of viral DNA led to reduced average occupancy of RNA polymerase II on virus DNA. On the basis of the results presented above, we reasoned that differential regulation of early and late gene expression might involve control mechanisms operating downstream of loading of RNA polymerase II on promoters. CDK9 is a well-known regulator of gene transcription downstream of promoter loading (14Zhou Q. Li T. Price D.H. RNA polymerase II elongation control.Annu. Rev.

Cell. 2006; 21: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that DRB, a specific inhibitor of CDK9, reduces the expression of the UL38 gene (19Durand L.O. Roizman B. Role of cdk9 in the optimization of expression of the genes regulated by ICP22 of herpes simplex virus 1.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A pilot study was therefore performed to characterize the distribution of RNA polymerase II over two neighboring genes, the late gene UL38 and the early gene UL39, at 2, 4, and 7 h.p.i. using ChIP-qPCR (supplemental Fig. 1). Guided by our results, we then made a more detailed study looking at the effects of DRB on RNA polymerase II distribution on these genes. Cells were infected with HSV-1, in the presence and absence of 25 μm DRB, at an m.o.i. of 10 and harvested at 2–4 h.p.i. (Fig. 2). In the absence of DRB, RNA polymerase II already found its way to the early UL39 gene 2 h.p.i., but only later, at 3 h.p.i., it bound efficiently to the UL38 gene (Fig. 2a). At 4 h.p.i. the distribution of RNA polymerase II on the UL38 and UL39 genes was similar. In the presence of DRB, we found that the series of events observed in the absence of the drug was delayed by about 1 h (Fig. 2b). In fact, the overall signal to noise ratio for RNA polymerase II distribution at 2 h.p.i. in the presence of DRB was too low at some positions to allow reliable calculations. At 3 and 4 h.p.i., the pattern observed was similar to the patterns observed at 2 and 3 h.p.i. in the absence of DRB. The effect of DRB on HSV-1 DNA synthesis was addressed with qPCR (supplemental Fig. 2). It shows that the amount of virus DNA increased 10-fold between 4 and 7 h.p.i., and that DRB caused a delay in the onset of DNA replication. However, once started, the rate of DNA synthesis was unaffected by DRB (Fig. 3c). The combined effects of DRB on the expression of some early and late genes was examined in a time-course experiment. A previous study reported that DRB reduced expression of the UL38 gene but not the UL44 gene encoding glycoprotein C (19Durand L.O. Roizman B. Role of cdk9 in the optimization of expression of the genes regulated by ICP22 of herpes simplex virus 1.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These genes were therefore included in this study. Here, the experiments were performed at 37 °C using an m.o.i. of 1 to avoid over-riding possible regulatory events. The kinetics of expression of an early protein ICP8 (the single-strand DNA-binding protein) and the late proteins gB, gC, gD, gE, and UL38 were examined in the absence or presence of 25 μm DRB (Fig. 3, a and b). We noted that the time course for accumulation of ICP8 was only slightly altered by the addition of DRB. In contrast, we found that expression of the γ2 genes, gC, gD, gE, and UL38, was strongly inhibited by addition of the drug. Expression of gB, which has previously been found to have intermediate characteristics (35Homa F.L. Glorioso J.C. Levine M. A specific 15-bp TATA box promoter element is required for expression of a herpes simplex virus type 1 late gene.Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 40-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Pederson N.E.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6226-6232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not as dramatically affected by DRB. To make sure we were observing a specific effect on late gene expression, we determined the apparent IC50 value for inhibition of gene expression by DRB (Fig. 4a). We found that expression from the late genes, UL38 and gC, were efficiently inhibited with an estimated IC50 of 5 μm. Significant effects on early gene expression, ICP8, was only seen at concentrations approaching 50 μm (Fig. 4b). We also looked at the effects of DRB at an m.o.i. of 10, to facilitate a comparison with the ChIP analyses (supplemental Fig. 3). Here, we found an IC50 for gC of 7 μm, and the IC50 was more than 80 μm for ICP8. Importantly, the IC50 value observed for late gene expression is close to the estimated value for inhibiting HIV transcription (37Biglione S. Byers S.A. Price J.P. Nguyen V.T. Bensaude O. Price D.H. Maury W. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by P-TEFb inhibitors DRB, seliciclib and flavopiridol correlates with release of free P-TEFb from the large, inactive form of the complex.Retrovirology. 2007; 4: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely to reflect a specific inhibition of CDK9. We also examined effects of flavopiridol, a CDK9 inhibitor used in clinical trials, on HSV-1 gene expression and observed a specific inhibition of late gene expression with an IC50 of 40 nm (Fig. 4c). The IC50 for ICP8 was >200 nm. The molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of DRB on late gene expression was analyzed in siRNA knockdown experiments directed toward CDK9, SPT5, and NELF-E. The efficiency of knockdown and HSV-1 gene expression was assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 5). The residual amounts of CDK9, SPT5, and NELF-E obtained in three independent experiments varied between 2 and 30%. Knockdown of CDK9 reduced the expression of gC by 70%. A more modest reduction of 30% for the expression of ICP8 was observed. At the same time, HSV-l DNA synthesis was largely unaffected (Fig. 5a). Knockdown of CDK9 by siRNA primarily affects the inactive 7SK small nuclear RNP complexes, and the addition of DRB is therefore likely to cause a more complete inhibition of the kinase activity of CDK9 (38Yu M.

https://openalex.org/W2736669723,"Background In South Africa, roughly half of the drug-resistant TB cases diagnosed are reported to have been started on treatment. We determined the proportion of persons diagnosed with rifampicin resistant (RR-) TB who initiated treatment in Johannesburg after the introduction of decentralized RR-TB care in 2011. Methods We retrospectively matched adult patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed RR-TB in Johannesburg from 07/2011-06/2012 with records of patients initiating RR-TB treatment at one of the city’s four public sector treatment sites (one centralized, three decentralized). Patients were followed from date of diagnosis until the earliest of RR-TB treatment initiation, death, or 6 months’ follow-up. We report diagnostic methods and outcomes, proportions initiating treatment, and median time from diagnosis to treatment initiation. Results 594 patients were enrolled (median age 34 (IQR 29–42), 287 (48.3%) female). Diagnosis was by GenoType MTBDRplus (Hain-Life-Science) line probe assay (LPA) (281, 47.3%), Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) (258, 43.4%), or phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) (30, 5.1%) with 25 (4.2%) missing a diagnosis method. 320 patients (53.8%) had multi-drug resistant TB, 158 (26.6%) rifampicin resistant TB by Xpert MTB/RIF, 102 (17.2%) rifampicin mono-resistance, and 14 (2.4%) extensively drug-resistant TB. 256/594 (43.0%) patients initiated treatment, representing 70.7% of those who were referred for treatment (362/594). 338/594 patients (57.0%) did not initiate treatment, including 104 (17.5%) who died before treatment was started. The median time from sputum collection to treatment initiation was 33 days (IQR 12–52). Conclusion Despite decentralized RR-TB treatment, fewer than half the patients diagnosed in Johannesburg initiated appropriate treatment. Offering treatment at decentralized sites alone is not sufficient; improvements in linking patients diagnosed with RR-TB to effective treatment is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2737026356,"Methylglyoxal (MG) is a natural metabolite derived from glycolysis, and this 2-oxoaldehyde has been implicated in some diseases including diabetes. However, the physiological significance of MG for cellular functions is yet to be fully elucidated. We previously reported that MG activates the Mpk1 (MAPK) cascade in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To gain further insights into the cellular functions and responses to MG, we herein screened yeast-deletion mutant collections for susceptibility to MG. We found that mutants defective in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) are more susceptible to MG. PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels increased following MG treatment, and vacuolar morphology concomitantly changed to a single swollen shape. MG activated the Pkc1–Mpk1 MAPK cascade in which a small GTPase Rho1 plays a crucial role, and the MG-induced phosphorylation of Mpk1 was impaired in mutants defective in the PtdIns(3,5)P2 biosynthetic pathway. Of note, heat shock-induced stress also provoked Mpk1 phosphorylation in a Rho1-dependent manner; however, PtdIns(3,5)P2 was dispensable for the heat shock-stimulated activation of this signaling pathway. Our results suggest that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is specifically involved in the MG-induced activation of the Mpk1 MAPK cascade and in the cellular adaptation to MG-induced stress."
https://openalex.org/W2739320285,"Objective Cytomegaloviruses (CMV) can have a significant impact on the prognosis of immunocompromised patients. Unlike in the transplantation and AIDS fields, only a few studies on CMV infections have been published in the field of autoimmunity. In this study, we examined the clinical outcomes of CMV infections in patients with autoimmune diseases at a single tertiary medical institution. Methods A retrospective study was performed to identify the mortality risk factors associated with CMV infections in patients with autoimmune diseases. We reviewed the medical records of patients with autoimmune diseases who were diagnosed with CMV infections using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction between December 2005 and March 2016. Clinical and laboratory parameters as well as treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results Seventy-three CMV infected patients were separated into survivors and non-survivors. Non-survivors had significantly higher median CMV-DNA copy numbers than survivors (95,500 vs 6,700 copies/mL, p = 0.005) and demonstrated significantly more frequent incidents of CMV pneumonitis (69.2 vs 36.2%, p = 0.007). After adjusting for multiple confounding covariates, the log CMV-DNA copies/mL (hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.92; p = 0.003) and the presence of concurrent infections (hazard ratio, 22.00; 95% confidence interval, 2.75–175.97, p = 0.004) were identified as independent mortality risk factors. Furthermore, patients with high CMV copy numbers (> 60,000 copies/mL) had higher in-hospital mortality than those with low CMV copy numbers (p < 0.05). Conclusions CMV-DNA copy numbers and concurrent infections are predictors of in-hospital mortality in CMV-infected patients with autoimmune diseases. Therefore, serial measurements of CMV-DNA copy numbers and close observation for signs of other infections are recommended for patients with autoimmune diseases who have concurrent CMV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2736816967,"Factor H-binding protein (fHbp) is an important meningococcal vaccine antigen. Native outer membrane vesicles with over-expressed fHbp (NOMV OE fHbp) have been shown to induce antibodies with broader functional activity than recombinant fHbp (rfHbp). Improved understanding of this broad coverage would facilitate rational vaccine design. We performed a pair-wise analysis of 48 surface-exposed amino acids involved in interacting with factor H, among 383 fHbp variant group 1 sequences. We generated isogenic NOMV-producing meningococcal strains from an African serogroup W isolate, each over-expressing one of four fHbp variant group 1 sequences (ID 1, 5, 9, or 74), including those most common among invasive African meningococcal isolates. Mice were immunised with each NOMV, and sera tested for IgG levels against each of the rfHbp ID and for ability to kill a panel of heterologous meningococcal isolates. At the fH-binding site, ID pairs differed by a maximum of 13 (27%) amino acids. ID 9 shared an amino acid sequence common to 83 ID types. The selected ID types differed by up to 6 amino acids, in the fH-binding site. All NOMV and rfHbp induced high IgG levels against each rfHbp. Serum killing from mice immunised with rfHbp was generally less efficient and more restricted compared to NOMV, which induced antibodies that killed most meningococci tested, with decreased stringency for ID type differences. Breadth of killing was mostly due to anti-fHbp antibodies, with some restriction according to ID type sequence differences. Nevertheless, under our experimental conditions, no relationship between antibody cross-reactivity and variation fH-binding site sequence was identified. NOMV over-expressing different fHbp IDs belonging to variant group 1 induce antibodies with fine specificities against fHbp, and ability to kill broadly meningococci expressing heterologous fHbp IDs. The work reinforces that meningococcal NOMV with OE fHbp is a promising vaccine strategy, and provides a basis for rational selection of antigen sequence types for over-expression on NOMV."
https://openalex.org/W2737736403,"In mammals, Prion pathology refers to a class of infectious neuropathologies whose mechanism is based on the self-perpetuation of structural information stored in the pathological conformer. The characterisation of the PrP folding landscape has revealed the existence of a plethora of pathways conducing to the formation of structurally different assemblies with different biological properties. However, the biochemical interconnection between these diverse assemblies remains unclear. The PrP oligomerisation process leads to the formation of neurotoxic and soluble assemblies called O1 oligomers with a high size heterodispersity. By combining the measurements in time of size distribution and average size with kinetic models and data assimilation, we revealed the existence of at least two structurally distinct sets of assemblies, termed Oa and Ob, forming O1 assemblies. We propose a kinetic model representing the main processes in prion aggregation pathway: polymerisation, depolymerisation, and disintegration. The two groups interact by exchanging monomers through a disintegration process that increases the size of Oa. Our observations suggest that PrP oligomers constitute a highly dynamic population."
https://openalex.org/W2736649919,"During lytic infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA is replicated by a mechanism involving DNA recombination. For instance, replication of the HSV-1 genome produces X- and Y-branched structures, reminiscent of recombination intermediates. HSV-1's replication machinery includes a trimeric helicase-primase composed of helicase (UL5) and primase (UL52) subunits and a third subunit, UL8. UL8 has been reported to stimulate the helicase and primase activities of the complex in the presence of ICP8, an HSV-1 protein that functions as an annealase, a protein that binds complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and facilitates its annealing to duplex DNA. UL8 also influences the intracellular localization of the UL5/UL52 subunits, but UL8's catalytic activities are not known. In this study we used a combination of biochemical techniques and transmission electron microscopy. First, we report that UL8 alone forms protein filaments in solution. Moreover, we also found that UL8 binds to ssDNAs >50-nucletides long and promotes the annealing of complementary ssDNA to generate highly branched duplex DNA structures. Finally, UL8 has a very high affinity for replication fork structures containing a gap in the lagging strand as short as 15 nucleotides, suggesting that UL8 may aid in directing or loading the trimeric complex onto a replication fork. The properties of UL8 uncovered here suggest that UL8 may be involved in the generation of the X- and Y-branched structures that are the hallmarks of HSV replication."
https://openalex.org/W2736656217,"We study a trial-offer market where consumers may purchase one of two competing products. Consumer preferences are affected by the products quality, their appeal, and their popularity. While the asymptotic convergence or stationary states of these, and related dynamical systems, has been vastly studied, the literature regarding the transitory dynamics remains surprisingly sparse. To fill this gap, we derive a system of Ordinary Differential Equations, which is solved exactly to gain insight into the roles played by product qualities and appeals in the market behavior. We observe a logarithmic tradeoff between quality and appeal for medium and long-term marketing strategies: The expected market shares remain constant if a decrease in quality is followed by an exponential increase in the product appeal. However, for short time horizons, the trade-off is linear. Finally, we study the variability of the dynamics through Monte Carlo simulations and discover that low appeals may result in high levels of variability. The model results suggest effective marketing strategies for short and long time horizons and emphasize the significance of advertising early in the market life to increase sales and predictability."
