https://openalex.org/W2991283206,"Enhancer elements in the human genome control how genes are expressed in specific cell types and harbor thousands of genetic variants that influence risk for common diseases1-4. Yet, we still do not know how enhancers regulate specific genes, and we lack general rules to predict enhancer-gene connections across cell types5,6. We developed an experimental approach, CRISPRi-FlowFISH, to perturb enhancers in the genome, and we applied it to test >3,500 potential enhancer-gene connections for 30 genes. We found that a simple activity-by-contact model substantially outperformed previous methods at predicting the complex connections in our CRISPR dataset. This activity-by-contact model allows us to construct genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene connections in a given cell type, on the basis of chromatin state measurements. Together, CRISPRi-FlowFISH and the activity-by-contact model provide a systematic approach to map and predict which enhancers regulate which genes, and will help to interpret the functions of the thousands of disease risk variants in the noncoding genome."

Davidson et al. and Kim et al. now show that in the presence of the NIPBLMAU2 protein complex, the human cohesin complex can function as a molecular motor that extrudes DNA loops with high speed in vitro. In contrast to how it mediates sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin does not appear to entrap DNA topologically during loop extrusion. The results provide direct evidence for the loop extrusion model of chromatin organization and suggest that genome architecture is highly dynamic. Science , this issue p. 1338 , p. 1345"
https://openalex.org/W2990382732,"Neuronal types in the central nervous system differ dramatically in their resilience to injury or other insults. Here we studied the selective resilience of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC), which severs their axons and leads to death of ∼80% of RGCs within 2 weeks. To identify expression programs associated with differential resilience, we first used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of 46 RGC types in adult retina. We then tracked their survival after ONC; characterized transcriptomic, physiological, and morphological changes that preceded degeneration; and identified genes selectively expressed by each type. Finally, using loss- and gain-of-function assays in vivo, we showed that manipulating some of these genes improved neuronal survival and axon regeneration following ONC. This study provides a systematic framework for parsing type-specific responses to injury and demonstrates that differential gene expression can be used to reveal molecular targets for intervention."

Lindsey et al. measured acoustic vibrations collected by attaching a laser to the Monterey Accelerated Research System's subsea optical fiber during a maintenance period (see the Perspective by Jousset). Acoustic waves were monitored by changes in laser light along the cable. The observations from just a few days allowed mapping of an unknown fault system and detection of several dynamic processes in the water column above. Science , this issue p. 1103 ; see also p. 1076"
https://openalex.org/W2990052415,"B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing is a powerful tool for interrogating immune responses to infection and vaccination, but it provides limited information about the antigen specificity of the sequenced BCRs. Here, we present LIBRA-seq (linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing), a technology for high-throughput mapping of paired heavy- and light-chain BCR sequences to their cognate antigen specificities. B cells are mixed with a panel of DNA-barcoded antigens so that both the antigen barcode(s) and BCR sequence are recovered via single-cell next-generation sequencing. Using LIBRA-seq, we mapped the antigen specificity of thousands of B cells from two HIV-infected subjects. The predicted specificities were confirmed for a number of HIV- and influenza-specific antibodies, including known and novel broadly neutralizing antibodies. LIBRA-seq will be an integral tool for antibody discovery and vaccine development efforts against a wide range of antigen targets."

Stein-Thoeringer et al. performed a large-scale analysis of more than 1300 patients treated with allo-HCT across four clinical centers (see the Perspective by Zitvogel and Kroemer). High levels of bacteria from the Enterococcus genus were associated with greater incidence of GVHD and mortality. Lactose appears to provide a substrate for Enterococcus growth, and patients with a lactose-malabsorption genotype had a greater abundance of Enterococcus. A lactose-free diet limited Enterococcus growth, reduced the severity of GVHD, and improved survival in gnotobiotic mouse models. Science , this issue p. 1143 ; see also p. 1077"

We generated the complete first-order AAV2 capsid fitness landscape, characterizing all single-codon substitutions, insertions, and deletions across multiple functions relevant for in vivo delivery. We discovered a frameshifted gene in the VP1 region that expresses a membrane-associated accessory protein that limits AAV production through competitive exclusion. Mutant biodistribution revealed the importance of both surface-exposed and buried residues, with a few phenotypic profiles characterizing most variants. Finally, we algorithmically designed and experimentally verified a diverse in vivo targeted capsid library with viability far exceeding random mutagenesis approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2991566591,"Elastocaloric cooling, which exploits the latent heat released and absorbed as stress-induced phase transformations are reversibly cycled in shape memory alloys, has recently emerged as a frontrunner in non-vapor-compression cooling technologies. The intrinsically high thermodynamic efficiency of elastocaloric materials is limited only by work hysteresis. Here, we report on creating high-performance low-hysteresis elastocaloric cooling materials via additive manufacturing of Titanium-Nickel (Ti-Ni) alloys. Contrary to established knowledge of the physical metallurgy of Ti-Ni alloys, intermetallic phases are found to be beneficial to elastocaloric performances when they are combined with the binary Ti-Ni compound in nanocomposite configurations. The resulting microstructure gives rise to quasi-linear stress-strain behaviors with extremely small hysteresis, leading to enhancement in the materials efficiency by a factor of five. Furthermore, despite being composed of more than 50% intermetallic phases, the reversible, repeatable elastocaloric performance of this material is shown to be stable over one million cycles. This result opens the door for direct implementation of additive manufacturing to elastocaloric cooling systems where versatile design strategy enables both topology optimization of heat exchangers as well as unique microstructural control of metallic refrigerants."

https://openalex.org/W2991577390,"Femtochemistry techniques have been instrumental in accessing the short time scales necessary to probe transient intermediates in chemical reactions. Here we take the contrasting approach of prolonging the lifetime of an intermediate by preparing reactant molecules in their lowest ro-vibronic quantum state at ultralow temperatures, thereby drastically reducing the number of exit channels accessible upon their mutual collision. Using ionization spectroscopy and velocity-map imaging of a trapped gas of potassium-rubidium molecules at a temperature of 500~nK, we directly observe reactants, intermediates, and products of the reaction $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb + $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb $\rightarrow$ K$_2$Rb$^*_2$ $\rightarrow$ K$_2$ + Rb$_2$. Beyond observation of a long-lived energy-rich intermediate complex, this technique opens the door to further studies of quantum-state resolved reaction dynamics in the ultracold regime."

Having five of these domains is relatively common, but how these fivefold twins form is still a mystery. Song et al. combined in situ transmission electron microscope observations with simulations to find two different pathways for forming fivefold twins in gold, platinum, and palladium nanoparticles. This combination provides a key insight into the twin-forming process, which might be exploited for developing nanoparticles suitable for a variety of applications. Science , this issue p. 40"
https://openalex.org/W2990802419,"Widespread applications of magnetic devices require an efficient means to manipulate the local magnetization. One mechanism is the electrical spin-transfer torque associated with electron-mediated spin currents; however, this suffers from substantial energy dissipation caused by Joule heating. We experimentally demonstrated an alternative approach based on magnon currents and achieved magnon-torque-induced magnetization switching in Bi2Se3/antiferromagnetic insulator NiO/ferromagnet devices at room temperature. The magnon currents carry spin angular momentum efficiently without involving moving electrons through a 25-nanometer-thick NiO layer. The magnon torque is sufficient to control the magnetization, which is comparable with previously observed electrical spin torque ratios. This research, which is relevant to the energy-efficient control of spintronic devices, will invigorate magnon-based memory and logic devices."

https://openalex.org/W2990196905,"Core regulatory transcription factors (CR TFs) orchestrate the placement of super-enhancers (SEs) to activate transcription of cell-identity specifying gene networks, and are critical in promoting cancer. Here, we define the core regulatory circuitry of rhabdomyosarcoma and identify critical CR TF dependencies. These CR TFs build SEs that have the highest levels of histone acetylation, yet paradoxically the same SEs also harbor the greatest amounts of histone deacetylases. We find that hyperacetylation selectively halts CR TF transcription. To investigate the architectural determinants of this phenotype, we used absolute quantification of architecture (AQuA) HiChIP, which revealed erosion of native SE contacts, and aberrant spreading of contacts that involved histone acetylation. Hyperacetylation removes RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) from core regulatory genetic elements, and eliminates RNA Pol II but not BRD4 phase condensates. This study identifies an SE-specific requirement for balancing histone modification states to maintain SE architecture and CR TF transcription. High levels of histone acetylation at rhabdomyosarcoma SEs, including SOX8, are detrimental to transcription via exclusion of RNA Pol II, but not BRD4, from phase condensates."
https://openalex.org/W2991007524,"Summary Classical and modern ethological studies suggest that animal behavior is organized hierarchically across timescales, such that longer-timescale behaviors are composed of specific shorter-timescale actions. Despite progress relating neuronal dynamics to single-timescale behavior, it remains unclear how different timescale dynamics interact to give rise to such higher-order behavioral organization. Here, we show, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, that a behavioral hierarchy spanning three timescales is implemented by nested neuronal dynamics. At the uppermost hierarchical level, slow neuronal population dynamics spanning brain and motor periphery control two faster motor neuron oscillations, toggling them between different activity states and functional roles. At lower hierarchical levels, these faster oscillations are further nested in a manner that enables flexible behavioral control in an otherwise rigid hierarchical framework. Our findings establish nested neuronal activity patterns as a repeated dynamical motif of the C. elegans nervous system, which together implement a controllable hierarchical organization of behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2990499363,"A sharp boundary in the cuprates Many physicists working on cuprate superconductors believe that the so-called strange metal phase in the cuprate phase diagram is associated with a quantum critical point. Within this picture, the quantum critical point gives rise to a V-shaped region in the doping-temperature phase diagram of the cuprates: the strange metal phase. Chen et al. used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in the cuprate family Bi2212 to challenge this view. By taking comprehensive measurements as a function of doping and temperature—and making sure that the signal was not affected by environmental conditions—they found an incoherent strange metal phase that was sharply separated from a conventional phase by a temperature-independent vertical line in the phase diagram.

https://openalex.org/W2991349291,"NRXN1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, and non-recurrent heterozygous deletions in NRXN1 are strongly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. We establish that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons well represent the diversity of NRXN1α alternative splicing observed in the human brain, cataloguing 123 high-confidence in-frame human NRXN1α isoforms. Patient-derived NRXN1+/- hiPSC-neurons show a greater than twofold reduction in half of the wild-type NRXN1α isoforms and express dozens of novel isoforms from the mutant allele. Reduced neuronal activity in patient-derived NRXN1+/- hiPSC-neurons is ameliorated by overexpression of individual control isoforms in a genotype-dependent manner, whereas individual mutant isoforms decrease neuronal activity levels in control hiPSC-neurons. In a genotype-dependent manner, the phenotypic impact of patient-specific NRXN1+/- mutations can occur through a reduction in wild-type NRXN1α isoform levels as well as the presence of mutant NRXN1α isoforms."

Understanding the basic biological processes within neurons that actively retard or enhance axon regrowth is becoming increasingly important (Curcio and Bradke, 2018Curcio M. Bradke F.

Injured neurons require a large supply of lipids for membrane formation as they grow long axons during regeneration (Bradke et al., 2012Bradke F. Fawcett J.W. Spira M.E.

The synthesis and transport of lipids for axonal growth and nerve regeneration.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Many classes of lipids exist in neurons with various functions, and not necessarily all lipids are crucial for axon growth. Thus, axon regrowth requires coordinated changes in lipid homeostasis in injured neurons. The metabolism of lipids such as fatty acids and cholesterol has been actively studied in the brain (Bazinet and Layé, 2014Bazinet R.P. Layé S. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites in brain function and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 771-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011Pfrieger F.W. Ungerer N. Cholesterol metabolism in neurons and astrocytes.Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Recent studies in Drosophila larvae sensory neurons indicate that neuronal lipid biosynthesis regulates dendritic complexity (Meltzer et al., 2017Meltzer S. Bagley J.A. Perez G.L. O’Brien C.E.

However, relatively little is known about how lipid metabolism is intrinsically regulated in neurons to control axon elongation and regeneration. Glycerolipids are abundant cellular lipids, including triglycerides (TGs) for energy storage and phospholipids (PLs) for membrane structure. Although TG molecules help organisms survive starvation, they are not regarded as a major direct source of energy for the brain (Schönfeld and Reiser, 2013Schönfeld P. Reiser G. Why does brain metabolism not favor burning of fatty acids to provide energy? Reflections on disadvantages of the use of free fatty acids as fuel for brain.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2013; 33: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence suggests that neuronal TG lipases are very active and that TGs undergo constant turnover in adult neurons (Inloes et al., 2014Inloes J.M. Hsu K.L. Dix M.M. Viader A. Masuda K. Takei T. Wood M.R. Cravatt B.F. The hereditary spastic paraplegia-related enzyme DDHD2 is a principal brain triglyceride lipase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 14924-14929Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). TG lipase hydrolyzes a TG to one fatty acid and one diglyceride (DG). DGs are also a precursor of TGs and PLs. Because PLs and TGs share common precursors, neurons likely utilize this strategy to direct the flow of lipids toward membrane production or energy storage depending on needs. The glycerol phosphate pathway (glycerol 3-phosphate pathway) is an important mechanism for controlling the glycerolipid levels in cells by regulating a series of enzymatic reactions. Lipin1 protein, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) enzyme, plays a central role in the penultimate step of the glycerol phosphate pathway and catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to DG (Han et al., 2006Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Lipin homolog is a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, Han et al., 2007Han G.S. Siniossoglou S. Carman G.M. The cellular functions of the yeast lipin homolog PAH1p are dependent on its phosphatidate phosphatase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37026-37035Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, lipin1 can also regulate gene expression independent of its catalytic function by relocating to the nucleus and acting as a coregulator with transcription factors (Finck et al., 2006Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Lipin 1 is an inducible amplifier of the hepatic PGC-1alpha/PPARalpha regulatory pathway.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Mutation of lipin1 causes lipodystrophy with almost complete loss of fat (Harris and Finck, 2011Harris T.E. Finck B.N. Dual function lipin proteins and glycerolipid metabolism.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 22: 226-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Reue and Zhang, 2008Reue K. Zhang P. The lipin protein family: dual roles in lipid biosynthesis and gene expression.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the glycerol phosphate pathway, the final and only committed step is to form a TG by covalently joining a fatty acyl-CoA and a DG molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by two acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes, DGAT1 and DGAT2, both of which have been implicated in modulating TG homeostasis (Yen et al., 2008Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Koliwad S. Harris C. Farese Jr., R.V. Thematic review series: glycerolipids. DGAT enzymes and triacylglycerol biosynthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2283-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The glycerol phosphate pathway is well characterized in tissues specialized for energy storage or lipid turnover, such as adipose tissue and liver. The function of this metabolic pathway in neuronal response to injury and morphological change, especially in regard to axon growth, has not been explored. Neurons acquire lipid supplies either through uptake from the external environment or de novo biosynthesis. Regardless of where they are from, lipid building blocks must undergo metabolic processes before they can be utilized by neurons for various functions. We hypothesized that coordinated lipid metabolism plays a role in axon regeneration. Here, we report that neuronal lipin1 depletion promoted axon regeneration by regulating glycerolipid metabolism. Axotomy elevated lipin1 in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and this upregulation contributed to regeneration failure. Lipin1 depletion promoted axon regrowth by regulating TG hydrolysis and PL synthesis. Directly suppressing TG biosynthesis also promoted axon regeneration and reprogrammed glycerolipid metabolism in the same direction as lipin1 depletion. In contrast to RGCs, peripheral neurons downregulated DGAT1 upon axotomy, and TG hydrolysis was required for axon regeneration after sciatic nerve injury. Thus, we propose that TGs may provide lipid precursors to generate PLs for membrane biosynthesis during axon regeneration and that the glycerol phosphate pathway is a potential target for neural repair. To investigate the role of neuronal lipid metabolism in axon regrowth, we systematically knocked down essential genes individually using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in cultured adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (Weng et al., 2018Weng Y.L. Wang X. An R. Cassin J. Vissers C. Liu Y. Liu Y. Xu T. Wang X.

We tested candidates regulating the fatty acid metabolic process, cholesterol synthesis, and glycerol phosphate pathway. Fatty acids in the brain come from fatty acid uptake and synthesis. Fatty acid translocase (CD36) transports long-chain fatty acids through plasma membrane and has relatively high expression level in the brain (Husemann et al., 2002Husemann J. Loike J.D. Anankov R. Febbraio M. Silverstein S.C. Scavenger receptors in neurobiology and neuropathology: their role on microglia and other cells of the nervous system.Glia. 2002; 40: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzymes of fatty acid synthesis are acetyl CoA carboxylases (ACC1 and ACC2) (Wakil, 1989Wakil S.J. Fatty acid synthase, a proficient multifunctional enzyme.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In the cholesterol synthesis pathway, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS) is the most upstream enzyme. It catalyzes the reaction from acetyl CoA to hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) (Bloch, 1965Bloch K. The biological synthesis of cholesterol.Science. 1965; 150: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, Bloch, 1992Bloch K. Sterol molecule: structure, biosynthesis, and function.Steroids. 1992; 57: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting and reversible step in cholesterol synthesis is the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (Bloch, 1965Bloch K. The biological synthesis of cholesterol.Science. 1965; 150: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, Bloch, 1992Bloch K. Sterol molecule: structure, biosynthesis, and function.Steroids. 1992; 57: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Another critical gene in the pathway is squalene synthase (FDFT1). A previous report has shown that Fdft1 is required for the neural development (Tozawa et al., 1999Tozawa R. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yagyu H. Oka T. Chen Z. Ohashi K. Perrey S. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. et al.Embryonic lethality and defective neural tube closure in mice lacking squalene synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30843-30848Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway, glycerol3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) first converts glycerol-3-phosphate to lysophosphatidic acid. Then 1-acylglycerol-3- phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) catalyzes the conversion from lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid. In the following reaction, lipin converts phosphatidic acid to DG (Weiss et al., 1960Weiss S.B. Kennedy E.P. Kiyasu J.Y. The enzymatic synthesis of triglycerides.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 40-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that most shRNAs did not affect axon regrowth in vitro (Figure S1B). Only lipin1 shRNA enhanced axon elongation by 20% (Figures 1A and 1B ). Then, we used the optic nerve injury model to assess the effect in vivo as previously described (Leon et al., 2000Leon S. Yin Y. Nguyen J. Irwin N. Benowitz L.I. Lens injury stimulates axon regeneration in the mature rat optic nerve.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4615-4626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). We injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying lipin1 shRNA (shLipin1) into the eyes of adult wild-type (WT) mice to knock down lipin1 in RGCs (Figure S1C). Then, we performed optic nerve crush and examined axon regeneration 2 weeks later. The RGC survival rates were comparable between the two groups (Figures S1D and S1E). Cholera toxin β subunit (CTB) labeling of the optic nerves showed significantly more regenerated axons in mice injected with AAV-shLipin1 than in mice injected with scrambled shRNA (shCtrl) (Figures 1C and 1D), suggesting that lipin1 plays an inhibitory role in axon regeneration in vivo. We next utilized the CRISPR technique to knock out lipin1 in RGCs and assessed the effect. We designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting lipin1 and CRISPR-induced genome editing was verified in Neuro2A cells (Figure S1F). We injected AAV-expressing sgRNAs targeting lipin1 (sgLipin1) with mCherry tag into the eyes of mice constitutively expressing the Cas9 enzyme (Platt et al., 2014Platt R.J. Chen S. Zhou Y. Yim M.J. Swiech L. Kempton H.R. Dahlman J.E. Parnas O. Eisenhaure T.M. Jovanovic M. et al.CRISPR-Cas9 knockin mice for genome editing and cancer modeling.Cell. 2014; 159: 440-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The efficiency of in-vivo gene editing was validated by qRT-PCR using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated mCherry-positive retinal cells (Table S2). We found that AAV-sgLipin1 but not AAV-expressing sgRNA targeting LacZ (sgCtrl) promoted axon regeneration after injection into Cas9 mice (Figures 1E and 1F). AAV-sgLipin1 knocked out lipin1 in approximately 50% of RGCs (Figures S1G and S1H). Consistent with the shRNA experiment, RGC survival was not affected by lipin1 knockout (KO) (Figure S1I). We asked whether lipin2, another member of the lipin protein family, plays a role in the axon regeneration. By doing qRT-PCR in sorted RGCs, we showed that lipin2 mRNA was not significantly changed after lipin1 knockdown (KD) (Figure S1J). Then, we used CRISPR to knock out lipin2 in RGCs and assessed the growth effect after optic nerve crush. We found that lipin2 KO did not promote significant regrowth and did not further enhance axon regeneration induced by lipin1 KD (Figures S1K and S1L). Our results suggest that lipin2 does not compensate for the loss of lipin1 in mediating axon regeneration. Furthermore, combining AAV-shLipin1 with AAV expressing ciliary neurotrophic factor (AAV-CNTF) (Pernet et al., 2013Pernet V. Joly S. Dalkara D. Jordi N. Schwarz O. Christ F. Schaffer D.V. Flannery J.G. Schwab M.E. Long-distance axonal regeneration induced by CNTF gene transfer is impaired by axonal misguidance in the injured adult optic nerve.Neurobiol. Dis. 2013; 51: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) achieved much more robust growth (Figures 1G and 1H). Some axons even reached the optic chiasm within 2 weeks, which was rare after either treatment alone. Lipin1 KD may accelerate the speed of CNTF-induced regeneration. Lipin1 KD also enhanced the axon regeneration induced by Pten KO (Figures S1M and S1N). To examine whether the extent of lipin1 KD is correlated with the extent of axon regeneration, we made another AAV-expressing lipin1 shRNA2, different from the lipin1 shRNA we used above. Lipin1-shRNA2 showed less KD efficiency compared to the lipin1-shRNA (Figure S1O). The axon regeneration induced by AAV-lipin1-shRNA2 was also consistently less (Figure S1P). Thus, through two approaches in vivo, we demonstrated that neuronal lipin1 functions as an intrinsic suppressor of axon regeneration. Both aging and response to injury may mediate the intrinsic growth decline of CNS neurons (Belin et al., 2015Belin S. Nawabi H. Wang C. Tang S. Latremoliere A. Warren P. Schorle H. Uncu C. Woolf C.J.

We postulated that lipid metabolism could be involved in the decline and examined lipin1 expression in RGCs at different ages and after optic nerve injury. By performing immunostaining, we found that lipin1 protein in RGCs could hardly be detected in young mice but was elevated in adults (Figures 2A and 2B ), suggesting that maturation may upregulate lipin1. Interestingly, the vast majority of the αRGCs marked by the SMI32 antibody were lipin1+. Over 80% of αRGCs expressed a lower level of lipin1 (low lipin1+), while the rest had a high expression level (high lipin1+). After optic nerve crush, the percentage of high lipin1+ αRGCs increased over 3-fold at 3 days post crush (dpc) (Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, we did not detect an evident change in the lipin1 level in M1–M3 intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) by using Opn4-GFP mice (Figures S2A and S2B) (Li et al., 2016Li S. Yang C. Zhang L. Gao X. Wang X. Liu W. Wang Y. Jiang S. Wong Y.H. Zhang Y. Liu K. Promoting axon regeneration in the adult CNS by modulation of the melanopsin/GPCR signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or RGCs labeled by TBR2 antibody (Figures S2C and S2D). Tbr2 is expressed in a subset of RGC types that project to non-image-forming areas (Mao et al., 2014Mao C.A. Li H. Zhang Z. Kiyama T. Panda S. Hattar S. Ribelayga C.P. Mills S.L. Wang S.W.

Tbr2 is required to generate a neural circuit mediating the pupillary light reflex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 5447-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, maturation and axonal injury selectively regulate lipin1 levels in RGCs Based on the results, we examined whether the selective regulation of lipin1 in injured αRGCs correlates with axon regeneration. αRGCs have been shown to regenerate their axons after Pten KO (Duan et al., 2015Duan X. Qiao M. Bei F. Kim I.J. He Z. Sanes J.R. Subtype-specific regeneration of retinal ganglion cells following axotomy: effects of osteopontin and mTOR signaling.Neuron. 2015; 85: 1244-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To identify RGCs with axon regeneration induced by lipin1 KD, we injected fluorogold (FG) into the optic nerve distal to the lesion site. Over 89% of the FG-labeled RGCs were αRGCs with SMI32 staining (Figure S2E). Furthermore, we found that lipin1 elevation in injured αRGCs was suppressed by either deleting Pten in RGCs or overexpressing AAV-CNTF in the retina (Figures S2F and S2G), consistent with the notion that lipin1 functions as an intrinsic inhibitor for RGCs to regenerate the axons. Lipin1 has both PAP and transcription coactivator functions (Finck et al., 2006Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Lipin 1 is an inducible amplifier of the hepatic PGC-1alpha/PPARalpha regulatory pathway.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), and we tested whether both functions were involved in lipin1-dependent growth. The PAP catalytic motif (DxDxT) is present in the C-LIP domain of lipin1, and conversion of the first or second aspartate residue in the DxDxT motif to glutamate completely abolishes PAP activity (Finck et al., 2006Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Lipin 1 is an inducible amplifier of the hepatic PGC-1alpha/PPARalpha regulatory pathway.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The coactivator function can be decoupled from PAP function because mutations in the DxDxT motif abolish PAP activity but do not affect coactivator function (Finck et al., 2006Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Lipin 1 is an inducible amplifier of the hepatic PGC-1alpha/PPARalpha regulatory pathway.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Thus, through AAVs, we expressed human WT lipin1 (lipin1-WT), lipin1 with a PAP catalytic motif mutation (lipin1-PAPm), and lipin1 lacking a nuclear localization signal (lipin1-ΔNLS) in RGCs with lipin1 depletion (Figure 3A; Figure S3A). We designed shRNA to specifically KD mouse lipin1 and spare exogenous human lipin1. Lipin1-WT but not lipin1-PAPm suppressed axon regeneration to the level of control (Figures 3B and 3C), indicating that PAP activity rather than transcription coactivator function was essential. The result also confirmed that lipin1 shRNA-induced regeneration was not due to potential off-target effects. Consistently, lipin1-ΔNLS also significantly inhibited the growth effect caused by lipin1 depletion (Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting that its nuclear function was not required. RGC survival was not significantly affected in the different groups (Figure S3B). To examine the rescue effect in isolated neurons, we also performed an experiment using adult DRG culture. Lipin1-WT and lipin1-ΔNLS but not lipin1-PAPm inhibited axon elongation in neurons induced by lipin1 KD (Figure S3C), consistent with our in vivo results. Thus, through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, we were able to conclude that the PAP activity of lipin1 plays a major role in inhibiting axon regeneration. Because PAP activity is critical for lipin1-dependent axon growth, we hypothesized that lipin1 may control axon regrowth by regulating glycerolipid synthesis in neurons. In budding yeast and mammalian metabolic cells including adipocytes and hepatocytes, lipin1, as a PAP enzyme, plays a major role in lipid homeostasis, especially in the balanced synthesis of TGs and PLs (Pascual and Carman, 2013Pascual F. Carman G.M. Phosphatidate phosphatase, a key regulator of lipid homeostasis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1831: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Siniossoglou, 2013Siniossoglou S.

Lipin proteins and glycerolipid metabolism: Roles at the ER membrane and beyond.Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr. 2017; 1859: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whether this lipid homeostasis is similarly regulated in neurons is not known. We tested the hypothesis in vitro. AAV-shLipin1 or AAV-shCtrl was added to cultured cortical neurons to achieve high KD efficacy (Table S1). We directly measured glycerolipid levels after eliminating glial cells by adding cytosine arabinoside (AraC) to the culture (Figure S3D). To assess the change in the lipid profile in neurons after lipin1 KD, we cultured E18 cortical neurons with AAV-shCtrl or AAV-shLipin1. Lipid extraction of cortical neurons was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) system. We employed a non-targeted approach to identify all the molecules that differ between the two groups. Data were then analyzed by orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) (Bylesjo et al., 2006Bylesjo M. Rantalainen M. Cloarec O. Nicholson J.K. Holmes E. Trygg J. OPLS discriminant analysis: combining the strengths of PLS-DA and SIMCA classification.J. Chemometr. 2006; 20: 341-351Crossref Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Among all the differential molecules, 57 molecules were identified as differential lipid species (p < 0.05 and variable importance for projection [VIP] >1) using lipid databases (Figure 3D). DGs/TGs and PLs comprised 26% and 40% of all the differential lipids, respectively, showing that the two metabolic pathways were highly regulated by lipin1 in neurons. After lipin1 depletion, the levels of TG(41:2) and TG(48:0), which were the most abundant among the eight identified TGs, decreased 18% and 28%, respectively (Figure S3E). The levels of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids PC(30:4) and PC(33:5), which were the most abundant among the nine identified PCs, increased 17% and 15%, respectively (Figure S3F). The levels of the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids PE(36:4) and PE(37:3), which were the most abundant among the four identified PEs, increased 110% and 151%, respectively (Figure S3G). Cholesterol and free fatty acid were not significantly affected (Figure S3H). Because UPLC-MS might not identify all lipid molecular species, we further measured the total TG and PC levels by performing enzymatic hydrolysis assays. We found that TG levels were decreased by 40% after lipin1 depletion (Figure 3E). Interestingly, PC levels were elevated by 26% (Figure 3F). Thus, the two lipid assay methods consistently demonstrated that, upon lipin1 depletion, storage lipids were lower and membrane lipids were higher in neurons. Because injury triggers lipin1 elevation in RGCs, the data on lipid changes after lipin1 KD indicate that axotomy may program lipid metabolism to increase TG and decrease PL production. This injury-triggered bias in lipid synthesis may contribute to the declined axon growth in CNS neurons. By depleting lipin1, injured neurons may redirect two arms of the branch and shift lipid storage to membrane lipid production for axon regrowth. Given that lipin1 regulates the amount of TG in neurons, we asked whether neuronal TG metabolism was important for axon growth induced by lipin1 depletion. TGs are often stored in lipid droplets, which can rarely be detected in neurons. The TG level in the brain is usually much lower than in other tissues (Csaki et al., 2013Csaki L.S. Dwyer J.R. Li X. Nguyen M.H. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Lusis A.J. Yoshinaga Y. de Jong P. Fong L. et al.Lipin-1 and lipin-3 together determine adiposity in vivo.Mol. Metab. 2013; 3: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two TG lipases, adipose TG lipase (ATGL) and DDHD2, are active in the brain (Etschmaier et al., 2011Etschmaier K. Becker T.

https://openalex.org/W2991264362,"The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel is a voltage-gated cation channel that mediates neuronal and cardiac pacemaker activity. The HCN channel exhibits reversed voltage dependence, meaning it closes with depolarization and opens with hyperpolarization. Different from Na+, Ca2+, and Kv1-Kv7 channels, the HCN channel does not have domain-swapped voltage sensors. We introduced a reversible, metal-mediated cross bridge into the voltage sensors to create the chemical equivalent of a hyperpolarized conformation and determined the structure using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Unlike the depolarized HCN channel, the S4 helix is displaced toward the cytoplasm by two helical turns. Near the cytoplasm, the S4 helix breaks into two helices, one running parallel to the membrane surface, analogous to the S4-S5 linker of domain-swapped voltage-gated channels. These findings suggest a basis for allosteric communication between voltage sensors and the gate in this kind of channel. They also imply that voltage sensor movements are not the same in all voltage-gated channels."
https://openalex.org/W2990950320,"Summary Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders with symptoms including social deficits, anxiety, and communication difficulties. However, ASD pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Mutations of CUL3, which encodes Cullin 3 (CUL3), a component of an E3 ligase complex, are thought of as risk factors for ASD and schizophrenia (SCZ). CUL3 is abundant in the brain, yet little is known of its function. Here, we show that CUL3 is critical for neurodevelopment. CUL3-deficient mice exhibited social deficits and anxiety-like behaviors with enhanced glutamatergic transmission and neuronal excitability. Proteomic analysis revealed eIF4G1, a protein for Cap-dependent translation, as a potential target of CUL3. ASD-associated cellular and behavioral deficits could be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of the eIF4G1 function and chemogenetic inhibition of neuronal activity. Thus, CUL3 is critical to neural development, neurotransmission, and excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance. Our study provides novel insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD and SCZ."
https://openalex.org/W2991283955,"Summary During neonatal development, sensory cortices generate spontaneous activity patterns shaped by both sensory experience and intrinsic influences. How these patterns contribute to the assembly of neuronal circuits is not clearly understood. Using longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging in un-anesthetized mouse pups, we show that spatially segregated functional assemblies composed of interneurons and pyramidal cells are prominent in the somatosensory cortex by postnatal day (P) 7. Both reduction of GABA release and synaptic inputs onto pyramidal cells erode the emergence of functional topography, leading to increased network synchrony. This aberrant pattern effectively blocks interneuron apoptosis, causing increased survival of parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons. Furthermore, the effect of GABA on apoptosis is mediated by inputs from medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived but not caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE)-derived interneurons. These findings indicate that immature MGE interneurons are fundamental for shaping GABA-driven activity patterns that balance the number of interneurons integrating into maturing cortical networks."
https://openalex.org/W2991384483,"The processing of RNA transcripts from mammalian genes occurs in proximity to their transcription. Here, we describe a phenomenon affecting thousands of genes that we call exon-mediated activation of transcription starts (EMATS), in which the splicing of internal exons impacts promoter choice and the expression level of the gene. We observed that evolutionary gain of internal exons is associated with gain of new transcription start sites (TSSs) nearby and increased gene expression. Inhibiting exon splicing reduced transcription from nearby promoters, and creation of new spliced exons activated transcription from cryptic promoters. The strongest effects occurred for weak promoters located proximal and upstream of efficiently spliced exons. Together, our findings support a model in which splicing recruits transcription machinery locally to influence TSS choice and identify exon gain, loss, and regulatory change as major contributors to the evolution of alternative promoters and gene expression in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2991525008,"The limitations of classical drugs have spurred the development of covalently tethered photoswitchable ligands to control neuromodulatory receptors. However, a major shortcoming of tethered photopharmacology is the inability to obtain optical control with an efficacy comparable with that of the native ligand. To overcome this, we developed a family of branched photoswitchable compounds to target metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). These compounds permit photo-agonism of Gi/o-coupled group II mGluRs with near-complete efficiency relative to glutamate when attached to receptors via a range of orthogonal, multiplexable modalities. Through a chimeric approach, branched ligands also allow efficient optical control of Gq-coupled mGluR5, which we use to probe the spatiotemporal properties of receptor-induced calcium oscillations. In addition, we report branched, photoswitch-fluorophore compounds for simultaneous receptor imaging and manipulation. Finally, we demonstrate this approach in vivo in mice, where photoactivation of SNAP-mGluR2 in the medial prefrontal cortex reversibly modulates working memory in normal and disease-associated states."

Reproducible spike patterns may be obscured on single trials by uncontrolled temporal variability in behavior and cognition and may not be time locked to measurable signatures in behavior or local field potentials (LFP). To overcome these challenges, we describe a general-purpose time warping framework that reveals precise spike-time patterns in an unsupervised manner, even when these patterns are decoupled from behavior or are temporally stretched across single trials. We demonstrate this method across diverse systems: cued reaching in nonhuman primates, motor sequence production in rats, and olfaction in mice. This approach flexibly uncovers diverse dynamical firing patterns, including pulsatile responses to behavioral events, LFP-aligned oscillatory spiking, and even unanticipated patterns, such as 7 Hz oscillations in rat motor cortex that are not time locked to measured behaviors or LFP."

https://openalex.org/W2990446959,"The developmental journey of cortical interneurons encounters several activity-dependent milestones. During the early postnatal period in developing mice, GABAergic neurons are transient preferential recipients of thalamic inputs and undergo activity-dependent migration arrest, wiring, and programmed cell-death. Despite their importance for the emergence of sensory experience and the role of activity in their integration into cortical networks, the collective dynamics of GABAergic neurons during that neonatal period remain unknown. Here, we study coordinated activity in GABAergic cells of the mouse barrel cortex using in vivo calcium imaging. We uncover a transient structure in GABAergic population dynamics that disappears in a sensory-dependent process. Its building blocks are anatomically clustered GABAergic assemblies mostly composed by prospective parvalbumin-expressing cells. These progressively widen their territories until forming a uniform perisomatic GABAergic network. Such transient patterning of GABAergic activity is a functional scaffold that links the cortex to the external world prior to active exploration. VIDEO ABSTRACT."

Because hippocampal outputs affect not only cortical but also subcortical targets, we examined the impact of SPW-Rs on the firing patterns of lateral septal (LS) neurons in behaving rats. A large fraction of SPW-Rs were temporally locked to high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (120–180 Hz) in LS, with strongest coupling during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, followed by waking immobility. However, coherence and spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling between the two structures were low, suggesting that HFOs are generated locally within the LS GABAergic population. This hypothesis was supported by optogenetic induction of HFOs in LS. Spiking of LS neurons was largely independent of the sequential order of spiking in SPW-Rs but instead correlated with the magnitude of excitatory synchrony of the hippocampal output. Thus, LS is strongly activated by SPW-Rs and may convey hippocampal population events to its hypothalamic and brainstem targets.

Although it is clear that hippocampal SPW-Rs co-occur with brain-wide fluctuations in activity (Logothetis et al., 2012Logothetis N.K. Eschenko O. Murayama Y. Augath M. Steudel T. Evrard H.C. Besserve M. Oeltermann A. Hippocampal-cortical interaction during periods of subcortical silence.Nature. 2012; 491: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), most of these regions do not have strong monosynaptic connections with the hippocampal formation. We reasoned that such coupling relationships likely emerge through multi-synaptic brain circuits and sought to examine which brain regions may serve as a conduit, receiving direct hippocampal inputs, thus allowing for SPW-R propagation out of the hippocampus. A major target of the hippocampal system is the lateral septum (LS), where the density of hippocampal afferents is ∼20-fold higher when compared to entorhinal regions or ∼180-fold higher when compared to prefrontal targets (Tingley and Buzsáki, 2018Tingley D. Buzsáki G. Transformation of a spatial map across the hippocampal-lateral septal circuit.Neuron. 2018; 98: 1229-1242.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This makes the LS the recipient of massive convergent excitation from the hippocampal-subicular-entorhinal population. This major anatomical connection may convey hippocampal activity to its hypothalamic, mesencephalic, and brainstem projections (Leroy et al., 2018Leroy F. Park J. Asok A. Brann D.H. Meira T.

The connections of the septal region in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 186: 621-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these anatomical connections, we set out to examine the hippocampal-LS circuit by simultaneously recording activity patterns of the hippocampus and LS in the behaving rat. Using silicon probes, we simultaneously recorded neurons in the hippocampus (HPC; both CA1 and CA3) and LS while animals slept and performed behavioral tasks. Behavioral paradigms consisted of traversing one of three different linear track mazes. Further details of the surgical procedures and behavioral experiments have been published (Tingley and Buzsáki, 2018Tingley D. Buzsáki G. Transformation of a spatial map across the hippocampal-lateral septal circuit.Neuron. 2018; 98: 1229-1242.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During initial recordings in LS (N = 6 rats), we observed transient high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the 120–180 Hz frequency range in each animal (Figures 1A and 1B ) and an associated robust increase in the firing probability of LS neurons (Figure 1C). On average, 16% of LS neurons participated in any given event, firing an average of 0.23 spikes per event (Figures S1A and S1B). Across entire recordings, the vast majority of LS neurons (1,840 of 1,989; 92%) were significantly phase locked to the 120–200 Hz frequency band, with a strong unimodal phase preference for the trough of each cycle (Figures 1D and 1E). These events were significantly shorter in duration (27 ± 9 versus 31 ± 14 ms) and slower in frequency (147 ± 5.7 versus 159 ± 8 Hz) than CA1 ripples recorded from the same animals (Figures 1F and 1G; rank-sum test; p < 0.01). However, they showed no significant correlation between event amplitude and peak frequency (Figure 1H). We only observed HFO events at recording sites that were confined to the LS (Figures 2A–2C). Across recordings in each animal, we adjusted the electrode sites to record from progressively deeper regions within LS (Figure 2D). Both the power of HFOs and the proportion of phase-locked neurons were highest in the intermediate LS and tapered off as recordings approached either the dorsal or ventral border of LS (Figures 2E, 2F, S1C, and S1D). We also observed consistent temporal lags in LS HFOs between recording sites, suggesting a stereotyped direction of propagation common to all such events (Figures 3A and 3B ). Across four animals where recording sites spanned the anterior-posterior axis, we observed temporal offsets with the posterior recording sites leading more anterior recording sites (Figure 3C). Temporal offsets could also be observed on electrode pairs aligned to the medial-lateral axis and the dorsal-ventral axis (Figure 3C). With these temporal offsets and the known distances between each pair of recording sites, we estimated that the travel speed was 1.01 m per second in the posterior-to-anterior direction (N = 4 animals), 0.53 m per second in the medial-to-lateral direction (N = 1 animal), and 2.19 m per second in the dorsal-to-ventral direction (N = 4 animals). Together, these data suggest that the LS HFO is a traveling wave that propagates along a vector that largely aligns with the hippocampal afferent projections into the LS and efferent projections toward hypothalamic regions (Risold and Swanson, 1997Risold P.Y.

Right: LS HFOs are traveling waves in the dorsal-to-ventral direction. Next, we examined whether pairs of simultaneously recorded LS neurons (across different shanks) exhibited a pre-existing temporal structure during HFOs and whether these temporal correlations were modified by waking experience on familiar mazes. Three cross-correlograms for each pair of LS neurons (N = 7,172; 53 sessions) were calculated from spikes occurring during HFOs in the home cage prior to maze traversal (PRE), during maze traversal (BEHAV), and during HFOs after maze traversal (POST; Figure 4A). These cross-correlograms were first examined for changes in co-activation strength using an “excess” correlation method (see STAR Methods; Cheng and Frank, 2008Cheng S. Frank L.M. New experiences enhance coordinated neural activity in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2008; 57: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We extended the original analysis to examine whether neuron pairs showed fast timescale co-activation that exceeded what would be expected by chance. By randomly jittering each spike by ±200 ms, we found that the excess correlations for HFOs during the PRE and POST epochs were much greater than expected by chance, and excess correlations during the BEHAV epoch were also slightly greater than chance levels (Figure S3A; rank-sum test; p < 0.01). This analysis also revealed that, during LS HFOs, there is a higher degree of co-activation than observed during behavior or expected given LS firing rates (rank-sum test; p < 0.001 for PRE versus BEHAV and BEHAV versus POST), possibly reflecting joint hippocampal excitation. It also suggested that the degree of co-activation observed is not modulated by waking experience in a familiar environment (Figure 4B; rank-sum test; p = 0.36; PRE versus POST). At the level of single sessions, we did not observe any consistent change in co-activation from the PRE to the POST epochs. Only 7 out of 53 sessions had significantly different excess-correlation values for PRE and POST epochs (rank-sum test; p < 0.01): three where PRE was less than POST and four where PRE was greater than POST. We also assessed the temporal ordering of spike pairs during HFOs in relation to the temporal ordering observed during maze traversal (Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996Skaggs W.E. McNaughton B.L. Replay of neuronal firing sequences in rat hippocampus during sleep following spatial experience.Science. 1996; 271: 1870-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Across recordings, the spiking structure during HFOs prior to and after maze performance showed correlations with the spike ordering during maze traversal that were similar (Figure 4C; N = 53 recordings; two-way t test; p = 0.85). Finally, we examined temporal compression of spiking activity, defined as the correlation between the cross-correlogram from the behavior epoch (±120 ms; Figure 4A, lower middle) and a temporally warped cross-correlogram from HFOs (PRE or POST). These warped cross-correlograms ranged from ±120 ms (compression factor = 1) to ±2.4 ms (compression factor = 50; Figure S3B). We found correlations significantly higher than chance (up to ∼20-fold compression; p < 0.01) of cross-correlograms calculated between maze traversal and HFOs that occurred in the PRE and POST sessions (Figure 4D). However, the strength of this compression was similar for HFOs recorded prior to and after maze traversal (p > 0.01 for all compression factors). These analyses favor the interpretation that co-activation and temporal structure of LS spike pairs observed during LS HFOs reflect a pre-existing dynamic and not prior experience in highly familiar environments. Additionally, we observed a systematic increase in firing rates during post-behavior NREM sleep in CA1, as well as CA3 and LS populations (Figures S2A and S2B; Pavlides and Winson, 1989Pavlides C. Winson J. Influences of hippocampal place cell firing in the awake state on the activity of these cells during subsequent sleep episodes.J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When controlling for this change in overall rate—both by down-sampling to rate match (Giri et al., 2019Giri B. Miyawaki H. Mizuseki K. Cheng S. Diba K. Hippocampal reactivation extends for several hours following novel experience.J. Neurosci. 2019; 39: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or increasing bin size—we did not observe fast timescale reactivation of LS-LS cell pairs that exceeded what would be expected by chance, given the observed changes in firing rate (Figure S2C). We found similar results for HPC and HPC-LS pairs, consistent with prior reports that the magnitude of reactivation decreases as environments become familiar (Giri et al., 2019Giri B. Miyawaki H. Mizuseki K. Cheng S. Diba K. Hippocampal reactivation extends for several hours following novel experience.J. Neurosci. 2019; 39: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Only HPC cell pairs had a significant difference between PRE and POST epochs when examining the correlation of temporally compressed cross-correlograms (Figure S3D). Although these results may differ from the impact experience has on HPC firing patterns, the alignment of these traveling waves with the innervation pattern of hippocampal fibers and the fact that the hippocampus provides the main excitatory drive to LS (Risold and Swanson, 1997Risold P.Y. Swanson L.W. Connections of the rat lateral septal complex.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 24: 115-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, Tingley and Buzsáki, 2018Tingley D. Buzsáki G. Transformation of a spatial map across the hippocampal-lateral septal circuit.Neuron. 2018; 98: 1229-1242.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that these events may be coupled in some way with hippocampal activity. Across recordings with sleep and behavioral sessions, we primarily observed HFO events during NREM sleep (Figure 5A). Although this is similar to the state-dependent occurrence of hippocampal SPW-Rs (Buzsáki et al., 1983Buzsáki G. Leung L.W. Vanderwolf C.H. Cellular bases of hippocampal EEG in the behaving rat.Brain Res. 1983; 287: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), the overall rates of LS HFOs were significantly lower than hippocampal SPW-Rs (Figure 5B). We also examined the finer timescale relationship between hippocampal SPW-Rs and LS HFOs (Figure 5C). Although some events were observed to occur independently (Figure 5C, left two examples), many LS HFOs occurred in close temporal proximity to dorsal hippocampal SPW-Rs (Figure 5C, right two examples). Across recordings, we observed a reliable coupling of events across structures (Figure 5D) with a median peak-to-peak temporal lag of 6.4 ± 4.2 ms (CA1 leading LS). Additionally, the strength of coupling between hippocampal SPW-Rs and LS HFOs was dependent on the brain state of the animals. HPC-LS coupling was significantly stronger during NREM sleep than during the waking immobile state (two-way t test with Bonferroni correction; p < 0.001; Figures 5D and 5E). This state-dependent coupling could also be observed when examining the percentage of LS HFO events that occurred within ±25 ms of a CA1 ripple (NREM = 0.3; WAKE = 0.15; p < 6.6e−6 two-way t test; Figure 5E, inset) and in the SPW-R triggered LS firing rates (two-way t test with Bonferroni correction; p < 0.001; Figure 5F). There are at least two potential underlying mechanisms to explain the presence of HFOs in the lateral septum given the current data. First, LS HFOs may be “inherited” from the hippocampus, such that the ripple oscillation itself is transferred to the LS wave by wave. Alternatively, the spiking output from the hippocampus, during SPW-Rs, provides the necessary level of excitatory drive for the induction of a locally generated oscillation in LS. Three observations argue in favor of local origin of LS HFOs. First, LS HFOs were significantly shorter than hippocampal SPW-Rs (Figure 1F) and were accompanied by a suppression of firing immediately following the population burst (Figures 1C and 5F). A direct inheritance of the hippocampal SPW-R would predict similar duration and firing patterns. Second, LS spiking activity was not phase locked to individual waves of hippocampal SPW-Rs, and phase coherence between HFOs and SPW-Rs was not significantly different from a shuffled distribution (Figure 5F, inset). Third, optogenetic activation of the LS GABAergic population induced HFOs, reminiscent of the spontaneous events (Figure 6). Using a GABAergic specific promoter, we expressed ChR2 in a majority of the LS population (Figures 6A and 6B; Dimidschstein et al., 2016Dimidschstein J. Chen Q. Tremblay R. Rogers S.L. Saldi G.A. Guo L. Xu Q. Liu R. Lu C. Chu J. et al.A viral strategy for targeting and manipulating interneurons across vertebrate species.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 1743-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using a Gaussian waveform of blue light (450 nm), mimicking the envelope of SPW-R-induced hippocampal excitation, local oscillations of ∼140 Hz could be reliably induced (Figures 6C–6E and S2). These findings suggest that LS populations can integrate hippocampal SPW-R activity and transmit shorter duration but highly synchronized population bursts to its hypothalamic and brainstem targets. Therefore, we examined which features of the hippocampal SPW-R best predicted responses of LS neurons. The experimental paradigm and data collected (Figures 7A–7C) allowed for the extraction of several candidate features for every hippocampal SPW-R (Figure 7D). The first feature we examined was the number of action potentials elicited by the hippocampal population during SPW-Rs. For many LS neurons (38%), this measure significantly predicted the number of action potentials elicited in the postsynaptic LS neuron (Figures 7D and 7E). The next feature we examined was the average anatomical depth of neurons participating in a SPW-R, within the CA1 cell body layer (i.e., deep to superficial). For a set of LS neurons (23%), the recording depth of the active CA1 population correlated significantly with the number of action potentials elicited (Figures 7D and 7E). The brain state of the animal (wake/NREM) within which the SPW-R occurred was yet another factor. As expected from the data presented in Figure 5, the rate of spiking for some LS neurons (26%) was significantly predicted by brain state (Figure 7E). The duration of hippocampal events could also be used to significantly predict firing rates for ∼20% of the LS neurons (Figure 7E). Neuronal sequences that occur during active experience are thought to be replayed during hippocampal SPW-Rs (Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996Skaggs W.E. McNaughton B.L. Replay of neuronal firing sequences in rat hippocampus during sleep following spatial experience.Science. 1996; 271: 1870-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether LS neurons can specifically “read out” this precise temporally organized spiking. As different analytical approaches emphasize different aspects of neural data (Tingley and Peyrache, 2019Tingley D. Peyrache A. On the methods for reactivation and replay analysis.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2019.0231Crossref Google Scholar), we used three common replay quantification methods that have been previously developed: (1) the rank-order correlation between spiking order during each ripple with the firing rate maps from maze traversal (Diba and Buzsáki, 2007Diba K.

Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar; replay score 1); (2) the maximized integral under the line of best fit (i.e., the discrete approximation of the Radon transform; Toft, 1996Toft P.A. The Radon Transform - Theory and Implementation. Technical University of Denmark, 1996Google Scholar) of the posterior probability matrix calculated with a Bayesian approach (Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F. Wilson M.A. Hippocampal replay of extended experience.Neuron. 2009; 63: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar; replay score 2); and (3) the normalized linear weighted correlation of the posterior probability matrix calculated with a Bayesian approach (Grosmark and Buzsáki, 2016Grosmark A.D. Buzsáki G. Diversity in neural firing dynamics supports both rigid and learned hippocampal sequences.Science. 2016; 351: 1440-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; replay score 3). The firing rates of only a minority of LS neurons—7.9%, 6.6%, and 7.1%, respectively—could be significantly predicted by the sequential structure of hippocampal events captured by these methods (Figures 7D and 7E). As the proportion of hippocampal SPW-Rs that can be decoded as replay events is small in the hippocampus (5%–20%; Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F.

Long-range neuronal circuits underlying the interaction between sensory and motor cortex.Neuron. 2011; 72: 111-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Compared to other excitatory cell types in the neocortex, L5PTs have relatively sparse local axon projections (Narayanan et al., 2015Narayanan R.T. Egger R. Johnson A.S. Mansvelder H.D. Sakmann B. de Kock C.P. Oberlaender M. Beyond columnar organization: cell type- and target layer-specific principles of horizontal axon projection patterns in rat vibrissal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25: 4450-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that they contribute only little to cortical computations. In turn, L5PTs project long-range axons to several subcortical brain areas. The subcortical targets typically depend on the cortical area the L5PTs reside in but vary substantially from cell to cell even within the same cortical area (Economo et al., 2018Economo M.N.

Relationships between structure, in vivo function and long-range axonal target of cortical pyramidal tract neurons.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 870Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). L5PTs are hence considered as the major output cell type of the neocortex, whose function is to integrate feedforward thalamocortical (TC) excitation, with recurrent intracortical (IC) and top-down corticocortical (CC) inputs, and to broadcast the results of this integration to the relevant ensembles of downstream targets (reviewed in Harris and Shepherd, 2015Harris K.D. Shepherd G.M. The neocortical circuit: themes and variations.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Here, we study the origins of the L5PTs’ general ability to respond with action potentials (APs) to a much wider range of stimuli compared to their TC and IC input neurons (Brecht et al., 2003Brecht M.

The onset latencies of these broadly tuned output patterns can rival and even precede those in the major input layer 4 (Ito, 1992Ito M.

Glazewski S. The origin of cortical surround receptive fields studied in the barrel cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8380-8391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that such fast onsets of cortical output patterns are driven directly by sensory-evoked synaptic inputs from the thalamus (Constantinople and Bruno, 2013Constantinople C.M. Bruno R.M. Deep cortical layers are activated directly by thalamus.Science. 2013; 340: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence that input from primary TC afferents is sufficient to reliably drive sensory-evoked APs in L5PTs has not been provided so far. Moreover, the broadly tuned characteristics of the fast onset responses were shown to require (additional) inputs from IC sources, which could, for example, originate from horizontally projecting neurons in the superficial layers (Wright and Fox, 2010Wright N. Fox K. Origins of cortical layer V surround receptive fields in the rat barrel cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, conclusive answers to the question—What are the cellular and/or circuit mechanisms underlying the transformation of sensory-evoked TC input into fast and broadly tuned cortical output?—remain presently unknown. One major challenge for answering this question arises from the fact that activity patterns in L5PTs will in general reflect synaptic inputs from highly heterogeneous local and long-range populations. Moreover, L5PTs are among the biophysically most complex cell types of the mammalian brain. These neurons possess a large variety of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (Hay et al., 2011Hay E. Hill S. Schürmann F. Markram H. Segev I. Models of neocortical layer 5b pyramidal cells capturing a wide range of dendritic and perisomatic active properties.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1002107Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)—some of which are expressed exclusively in specific dendritic subdomains (Larkum et al., 1999aLarkum M.E. Kaiser K.M. Sakmann B. Calcium electrogenesis in distal apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells at a critical frequency of back-propagating action potentials.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 14600-14604Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The resultant non-linear intrinsic physiology thereby renders an additional challenge when trying to infer causality between activity patterns in populations that are presynaptic to a L5PT and its AP responses. Consequently, the logic and information content underlying responses in the major output cell type of the neocortex may only be revealed if the cellular origins, dendritic locations, and time points of synaptic input are known, and integration of these spatiotemporal input patterns could be studied with respect to the complex properties of the L5PTs’ dendrites. Here, we resolve these challenges by developing an approach that can disentangle how the interplay between synaptic, cellular, and network properties shapes sensory-evoked APs in L5PTs. We generated a multi-scale model of the TC and IC circuitry for the vibrissal-related part of rat primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) (i.e., barrel cortex; reviewed in Feldmeyer et al., 2013Feldmeyer D. Brecht M. Helmchen F. Petersen C.C. Poulet J.F. Staiger J.F. Luhmann H.J. Schwarz C. Barrel cortex function.Prog. Neurobiol. 2013; 103: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The model is constrained at each scale by empirical data that were acquired consistently for animals of the same strain and age range, for morphologically identified cell types, and for one set of in vivo conditions (a link to download the model is provided in the STAR Methods). We demonstrate that the model allows performing simulations that mimic the sensory-evoked synaptic input patterns that impinge onto L5PTs during deflections of different individual whiskers. We show that the simulations allow investigating how active L5PT dendrites could in principle integrate and transform synaptic inputs, as evoked by different sensory stimuli, into AP output. The simulations thereby revealed experimental strategies for testing empirically the mechanistic origins underlying the transformation of sensory-evoked TC input into cortical output. Consistent with the in silico predictions, we find in vivo that layer 6 corticocortical neurons relay sensory-evoked TC excitation horizontally across the entire cortical area and thereby provide virtually all L5PTs within vS1 with similarly strong and near-simultaneous synaptic input. We show that the spatiotemporal properties of this common drive, in conjunction with the intrinsic properties of the dendrites, function to amplify synaptic inputs that impinge additionally onto L5PTs at the time of stimulation. We had previously reported the AP activity of excitatory neurons that were recorded systematically across the depth of vS1 in anesthetized young adult rats (de Kock et al., 2007de Kock C.P. Bruno R.M. Spors H. Sakmann B. Layer- and cell-type-specific suprathreshold stimulus representation in rat primary somatosensory cortex.J. Physiol. 2007; 581: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, supra-threshold (i.e., AP) whisker receptive fields (wRFs) of individual neurons were determined at sub-millisecond precision with respect to stimulus onset by deflecting the somatotopically aligned principal whisker (PW), and of each of its eight surrounding whiskers (SWs), along the rostral-caudal axis with a piezoelectric bimorph (Figure 1A). The recorded neurons were filled in vivo with biocytin, which allowed for post hoc reconstruction of the neurons’ precise columnar and laminar soma positions, dendrite morphologies, and IC axon projection patterns (Egger et al., 2012Egger R. Narayanan R.T. Helmstaedter M. de Kock C.P. Oberlaender M. 3D reconstruction and standardization of the rat vibrissal cortex for precise registration of single neuron morphology.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002837Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies (Narayanan et al., 2015Narayanan R.T. Egger R. Johnson A.S. Mansvelder H.D. Sakmann B. de Kock C.P. Oberlaender M. Beyond columnar organization: cell type- and target layer-specific principles of horizontal axon projection patterns in rat vibrissal cortex.Cereb.

Cell type-specific three-dimensional structure of thalamocortical circuits in a column of rat vibrissal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2012; 22: 2375-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we had used these reconstructions to establish classification criteria (Figure S1) for assigning in vivo recorded neurons from rat vS1 to the major axo-dendritic excitatory cell types of the neocortex (reviewed in Harris and Shepherd, 2015Harris K.D. Shepherd G.M. The neocortical circuit: themes and variations.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, Narayanan et al., 2017Narayanan R.T. Udvary D. Oberlaender M. Cell type-specific structural organization of the six layers in rat barrel cortex.Front. Neuroanat. 2017; 11: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we combine the recording, reconstruction, and classification results and report wRFs with respect to objectively determined cell types (Figure 1B). Whisker RFs were closely related to a neuron’s axo-dendritic cell type (Figure 1C). In the superficial layers, the class of layer 2 pyramids (L2PYs) remained largely unresponsive to whisker deflections, whereas layer 3 pyramids (L3PYs) responded reliably with APs to the PW. In layer 4, spiny neurons (L4SPs) responded to the PW and the caudal SW within the same whisker row. Neurons of the rare class of L4PYs did not respond to the PW but to several SWs. In the deep layers, slender-tufted intratelencephalic (L5ITs) and corticothalamic neurons (L6CTs) had no reliable APs responses to whisker deflections. In contrast, L5PTs and corticocortical neurons in layer 6 (L6CCs) showed the most reliabe AP responses of all cell types. L5PTs had the broadest wRFs, responding to the PW and several SWs. L6CCs had wRFs that were similar to those of L4SPs. Under the present experimental conditions, whisker-evoked AP responses are hence dominated by four axo-dendritic cell types (L3PY, L4SP, L5PT, and L6CC), even though the somata of these neurons intermingle with those of the less reliably responding cell types within and across layers (i.e., L2PY, L4PY, L5IT, and L6CT). Neurons across all layers responded similarly fast to PW and SW stimuli (median/25th/75th percentile of latency to first sensory-evoked AP: 14.3/13.3/18.4 ms). However, PW-evoked APs in L6CCs were the fastest (11.2/10.3/12.4 ms), followed by L4SPs (13.1/12.0/14.7 ms), L5PTs (14.3/13.6/16.2 ms), and L3PYs (14.8/13.7/20.1 ms). PW- and SW-evoked APs occurred near simultaneously in the deep-layer cell types (L6CC median: 10.3 versus 10.5 ms; L5PT: 13.6 versus 13.4 ms). In contrast, SW responses in layer 4 were significantly delayed compared to those evoked by the PW (L4SP: 12.0 versus 15.8 ms; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; difference: −4.4; 95% CI [−6.3, −2.1]; W = 168.5; p = 0.002). To estimate the number and spatiotemporal distributions of synaptic inputs that impinge onto the dendrites of L5PTs during single whisker deflections, we used the cell-type-specific physiological and morphological data described above to generate and constrain an anatomically detailed model of the TC and IC excitatory networks in rat vS1. The network model is based on precise reconstructions of the geometry and somatotopic organization of cortical barrel columns (Egger et al., 2012Egger R. Narayanan R.T. Helmstaedter M. de Kock C.P. Oberlaender M. 3D reconstruction and standardization of the rat vibrissal cortex for precise registration of single neuron morphology.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8: e1002837Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that represent the 24 major facial whiskers (i.e., macro vibrissae A1–E4; α-δ), measurements of the numbers and 3D distributions of all somata within the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM) and vS1 (Meyer et al., 2013Meyer H.S.

Commun. 2017; 8: 870Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The network model provides predictions of connection probabilities between L5PTs and IC cell types, as well as with VPM neurons, which match previously reported empirical data (Table S1). We embedded the morphology of an in vivo labeled L5PT into the network model. The embedding provided realistic structural constraints about which neurons, depending on their respective cell type and soma location within VPM and vS1, can in principle form synaptic connections with the L5PT and where along its dendrites (Figure 2A). We combined the wRFs measurements for the major excitatory cell types of vS1 with those reported previously for VPM neurons (Brecht and Sakmann, 2002Brecht M. Sakmann B. Whisker maps of neuronal subclasses of the rat ventral posterior medial thalamus, identified by whole-cell voltage recording and morphological reconstruction.J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 495-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which were acquired under the same experimental conditions. The cell-type-specific TC and IC wRFs were convolved with the respective number of neurons per cell type and cortical barrel column (or VPM barreloid) in the network model. Depending on the identity of the stimulated whisker, the convolutions provided functional constraints about which of the structurally possible connections to the L5PT could in principle provide functional input during each millisecond of the first 25 ms after whisker deflection (Figure 2B). We sampled from the space of structurally and functionally plausible input neurons and generated 1,800 statistically possible spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns for each of the 24 major facial whiskers. The composition of input that impinges onto the L5PTs’ dendrites is predicted to vary substantially, depending on the identity of the stimulated whisker, but to comprise in general neurons from all cell types and locations throughout VPM and vS1 (Figure 2C). Compared to periods preceding a stimulus (i.e., ongoing activity), the temporal profile post-stimulus of synaptic inputs to L5PTs shows an increase at time points that are largely independent of the identity of the stimulated whisker (Figure 2D). The hence predicted spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns display a degree of heterogeneity with respect to the identity of the stimulated whisker that is consistent with empirically determined synaptic wRFs (Varga et al., 2011Varga Z. Jia H. Sakmann B. Konnerth A. Dendritic coding of multiple sensory inputs in single cortical neurons in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 15420-15425Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), as reported for Ca2+ imaging of dendritic hotspots in mouse vS1 (Figure 2E). We converted the network-embedded L5PT morphology into a biophysically detailed multi-compartmental model (Hay et al., 2011Hay E. Hill S. Schürmann F. Markram H. Segev I. Models of neocortical layer 5b pyramidal cells capturing a wide range of dendritic and perisomatic active properties.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2011; 7: e1002107Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The biophysical parameters were tuned until numerical simulations reproduced current injection-evoked somatic and/or dendritic sub- and supra-threshold responses that are characteristic for L5PTs (Table S2). The objectives for optimization were several properties of the membrane potential (Figure 3A) that parameterize Na+ channel-based APs, back-propagating APs (bAPs), Ca2+ channel-based APs, and AP bursts, referred to as back-propagating action potential activated Ca(2+) spike (BAC) firing (Larkum et al., 1999bLarkum M.E. Zhu J.J. Sakmann B. A new cellular mechanism for coupling inputs arriving at different cortical layers.Nature. 1999; 398: 338-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The resultant optimal set of biophysical models yielded simulations in which the objectives were, on average, within 1.18 SDs of the respective empirical data (Table S3). From this optimal set, we selected a biophysical model that supported increasing AP frequencies when increasing the amplitude of sustained somatic current injections (Figure 3B). Synapses along the dendrites were converted into conductance-based models, containing both AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDARs. For each cell type, the peak conductance of the synapses was tuned until the respective differences between simulated and empirically determined somatic unitary postsynaptic potential (PSP) distributions were minimized (Figure 3C; Table S4). The multi-scale design of these L5PT models allows simulating how the locations and time points of synaptic inputs—as evoked by different sensory stimuli—are integrated by the complex intrinsic physiology of the dendrites and transformed into AP output at the soma (Video S1). These simulations may be considered to realistically mimic the specific in vivo conditions of single whisker deflections at subcellular, cellular, and network levels, if the anatomical, functional, biophysical, and synaptic model parameters are sufficiently constrained by the respective empirical data. To test whether this is the case, we simulated the integration of the structurally and functionally plausible synaptic input patterns without further optimization of any of the model parameters (Figure 3D). During periods of ongoing activity, the simulations predicted somatic membrane potentials (−65.4 ± 4.1 mV) and AP rates (1.6 ± 1.4 Hz) that were within the respective ranges reported for L5PTs in vivo (Constantinople and Bruno, 2013Constantinople C.M.

During periods of sensory-evoked activity, the predicted response probabilities and AP latencies for deflections of the PW and any of the eight SWs were indistinguishable from the respective in vivo data (Figure 3E). Consequently, the shape of the average in silico wRF correlated well (Pearson’s r = 0.88; 95% CI [0.52, 0.97]; t = 4.9; degrees of freedom [dof] = 7; p = 0.002) with its in vivo counterpart (Figure 3F).

Examples of In Silico wRF Mappings in L5PT Model, Related to Figure 3 The similarities between the in silico predicted and in vivo recorded wRFs provided an opportunity to deconstruct AP responses into its constituent parameters or parameter combinations. We performed a principal component analysis of the dendritic locations, time points of activation, and cell-type-specific origins of the synaptic inputs that impinge onto the L5PT models during 0–25 ms after the stimulus onsets. The first principal component (PC1) of these spatiotemporal synaptic input statistics separated well (Z score = 0.65) between simulation trials with and without AP responses (Figure 4A). 92% of PC1 reflected the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses that were active between 8 and 16 ms post-stimulus and whose respective path length distances to the soma were less than 500 μm. The remaining 8% reflected inputs to more distal dendritic compartments, indicating that the non-linear properties of the apical dendrite contribute only little to the fast AP responses evoked by single whisker deflections. To test this interpretation, we extracted the net excitatory input (i.e., number of active excitatory minus inhibitory synapses) to the proximal dendrites within the 8- to 16-ms time window for each simulation trial and combined these properties into a single parameter (Figure 4B), which we defined as synchronous proximal drive (SPD). Consistent with the principal-component analysis, SPD was an almost perfect predictor for AP responses in the L5PT models (i.e., area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC] equals 1) during simulations of both PW and SW deflections (AUROC = 0.83 ± 0.03). To explore the general relationships between the properties of SPD input and AP output, we performed additional simulations in which we systematically varied the number and synchrony of excitatory synaptic inputs that impinge onto the p"

We present what we believe to be the first neuronal mechanism for timing intervals longer than a few seconds. The activation and gradual relaxation of calcium-independent CaMKII measure a 6-min time window to coordinate two male-specific events during Drosophila mating: sperm transfer and a simultaneous decrease in motivation. We localize these functions to four neurons whose electrical activity is necessary only to report the conclusion of the decline in CaMKII’s activity, not for the measurement of the interval. The computation of elapsed time is therefore largely invisible to standard methods of monitoring neuronal activity. Its broad conservation, ubiquitous expression, and tunable duration of activity suggest that CaMKII may time a wide variety of behavioral and cognitive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2990258101,"Insoluble, hyperubiquitylated TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in the central nervous system characterizes frontotemporal dementia and ALS in many individuals with these neurodegenerative diseases. The causes for neuropathological TDP-43 aggregation are unknown, but it has been suggested that stress granule (SG) formation is important in this process. Indeed, in human embryonic kidney HEK293E cells, various SG-forming conditions induced very strong TDP-43 ubiquitylation, insolubility, and reduced splicing activity. Osmotic stress–induced SG formation and TDP-43 ubiquitylation occurred rapidly and coincided with colocalization of TDP-43 and SG markers. Washout experiments confirmed the rapid dissolution of SGs, accompanied by normalization of TDP-43 ubiquitylation and solubility. Surprisingly, interference with the SG process using a protein kinase R–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase inhibitor (GSK2606414) or the translation blocker emetine did not prevent TDP-43 ubiquitylation and insolubility. Thus, parallel pathways may lead to pathological TDP-43 modifications independent of SG formation. Using a panel of kinase inhibitors targeting signaling pathways of the osmotic shock inducer sorbitol, we could largely rule out the stress-activated and extracellular signal–regulated protein kinase modules and glycogen synthase kinase 3β. For arsenite, but not for sorbitol, quenching oxidative stress with N -acetylcysteine did suppress both SG formation and TDP-43 ubiquitylation and insolubility. Thus, sodium arsenite appears to promote SG formation and TDP-43 modifications via oxidative stress, but sorbitol stimulates TDP-43 ubiquitylation and insolubility via a novel pathway(s) independent of SG formation. In conclusion, pathological TDP-43 modifications can be mediated via multiple distinct pathways for which SGs are not essential."
https://openalex.org/W2991809858,"Seasonal variation in the availability of floral hosts or pollinators is a key factor influencing diversity in plant-pollinator communities. In seasonally dry Neotropical habitats, where month-long periods of extreme drought are followed by a long rainy season, flowering is often synchronized with the beginning of precipitation, when environmental conditions are most beneficial for plant reproduction. In the Brazilian Cerrado, a seasonally dry ecosystem considered one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots for angiosperms, plants with shallow root systems flower predominantly during the rainy season. Foraging activity in social bees however, the major pollinators in this biome, is not restricted to any particular season because a constant supply of resources is necessary to sustain their perennial colonies. Despite the Cerrado’s importance as a center of plant diversity, the influence of its extreme cycles of drought and precipitation on the dynamics and stability of plant-pollinator communities is not well understood. We sampled plant-pollinator interactions of a Cerrado community weekly for one year and used network analyses to characterize intra-annual seasonal variation in community structure. We also compared seasonal differences in community robustness to species loss by simulating extinctions of plants and pollinators. We find that the community shrinks significantly in size during the dry season, becoming more vulnerable to disturbance due to the smaller pool of floral hosts available to pollinators during this period. Major changes in plant species composition but not in pollinators has led to high levels of turnover in plant-pollinator associations across seasons, indicated by in interaction dissimilarity (<3% of shared interactions). Aseasonal pollinators, which mainly include social bees and some solitary specialized bees, functioned as keystone species, maintaining robustness during periods of drastic changes in climatic conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2993178747,"Gastric cancers comprise molecularly heterogeneous diseases; four molecular subtypes were identified in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) study, with implications in patient management. In our efforts to devise a clinically feasible means of subtyping, we devised an algorithm based on histology and five stains available in most academic pathology laboratories. This algorithm was used to subtype our cohort of 107 gastric cancer patients from a single institution (St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada), which was divided into 3 cases of EBV-positive, 23 of MSI, 27 of GS and 54 of CIN tumours. 87% of the tumours with diffuse histology were classified as GS subtype, which was notable for younger age. Examining for characteristic molecular features, aberrant p53 immunostaining was seen most frequently in the CIN subtype (43% in CIN vs. 6% in others), whereas ARID1A loss was rarely seen (6% vs. 35% in others). HER2 overexpression was seen exclusively in CIN tumours (17% of CIN tumours). PD-L1 positivity was seen predominantly in the EBV and MSI tumours. As with the TCGA study, no survival differences were seen between the subtypes. A similar strategy was employed to approximate the Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) molecular subtyping, with the addition of p53 IHC to the algorithm. We observed rates of ARID1A loss and HER2 overexpression that were comparable to the ACRG study. In summary, our algorithm allowed for clinically feasible means of subtyping gastric carcinoma that recapitulated the key molecular features reported in the large scale studies."
https://openalex.org/W2992804355,"Objective Macmoondongtang has been used as a traditional medicine to treat pulmonary disease in Korea. However, the mechanism underlying its therapeutic effect has yet to be reported. In the present study, the role of macmoondongtang as a respiratory medicine, especially as an anti-asthmatic agent, has been attributed to the down-regulation of interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Materials & methods BALB/c mice were divided into five groups: control, asthma-induced control, dexamethasone treatment, treatment with 150 mg/kg macmoondongtang, and treatment with 1500 mg/kg macmoondongtang. To evaluate the anti-asthmatic effect of macmoondongtang, we investigated its suppressive or inhibitory effects against typical asthmatic changes such as differential cell count in bronchioalveolar fluid (BALF), serum IgE levels, lung morphology, expression of Th1/Th2 cell transcription factors such as T-bet and GATA-3, and Th1-/Th2-/Th17-related cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-12p40, IL-4, -5, -13, TNF-α, and IL-6. The active ingredients in macmoondongtang were further analyzed. Results Macmoondongtang treatment down-regulated serum IgE level, a very important marker of hyper-responsiveness. It reversed typical morphological changes such as mucous hypersecretion, lung epithelial cell hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration near bronchioalveolar space and veins. Macmoondongtang significantly decreased neutrophil count in BALF, as well as reduced T-bet, IFN-γ, and TNF-α expression in the lung. It also showed a dose-dependent control of inflammatory cells in BALF, controlled the expression of IL-12, IL-4, and IL-5 genes in the lung, and the protein expression of IL12p40, GATA-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. The component analysis revealed glycyrrhizin and liquiritin as the active ingredients. Conclusions Macmoondongtang treatment alleviates asthma symptoms and modulate the Th1-/Th2- related cytokines. Glycyrrhizin and liquiritin could be the major the active therapeutic components."
https://openalex.org/W2993568450,"Sport horses need to fulfill high physical and psychological requirements during training and competition. These as well as certain conditions of modern husbandry may affect their wellbeing. Here we aimed to (1) evaluate effects of demographic and management factors as well as personality traits on stress reactivity of sport horses, (2) investigate if elite sport horses have elevated stress levels compared to amateur sport horses, and (3) assess whether different equestrian disciplines differentially influence equine adrenal cortex responsiveness. For this purpose, we visited 149 healthy elite (n = 94) and amateur (n = 54) sport horses in Switzerland and performed an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Additionally, a person who was familiar with the horse completed a questionnaire about demographic and management factors and their horses’ personality traits. Linear models were calculated to assess associations between the questionnaire data and salivary cortisol 60 (T60) and 90 (T90) minutes after ACTH stimulation. While the model at T90 was not significant, post-stimulatory cortisol after 60 minutes appears most informative in line with a previous study and was significantly affected by the breed and by three management factors: “number of riders”, “hours spent outside” and “group housing” (adjusted r2 = 15%, p<0.001). Thoroughbred and Warmblood horses displayed an increased adrenal response compared to Franches-Montagnes horses. Horses with several riders had a less pronounced reaction than horses with one rider, and horses that spent more time outside had a decreased response compared to horses that were stabled most of the time. Horses living in groups showed higher post-stimulatory cortisol values than horses that were housed singly. However, no significant associations of cortisol responsiveness with personality traits were found, and neither the use as elite or as amateur sport horses nor the discipline had an effect on the cortisol response. This suggests that optimizing husbandry conditions may be more important for improving equine welfare than changing their use."
https://openalex.org/W2993479606,"The Mexican population is characterized by high and particular admixture, and the picture of variants associated with disease remains unclear. Here we investigated the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Mexican population. We focused on two non-synonymous and three synonymous SNPs in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2), which plays key roles in energy balance regulation. These SNPs were genotyped in 2,011 Mexican Amerindians (MAs) belonging to 62 ethnic groups and in 1,980 geographically matched Mexican Mestizos (MEZs). The frequency distribution of all five ADRB2 variants significantly differed between MAs, MEZs, and other continental populations (CPs) from the 1000 Genomes database. Allele frequencies of the three synonymous SNPs rs1042717A, rs1042718A, and rs1042719C were significantly higher in Mexican individuals, particularly among MAs, compared to in the other analyzed populations (P<0.05). The non-synonymous ADRB2 Glu27 allele (rs1042714G), which is associated with several common conditions, showed the lowest frequency in MAs (0.03) compared to other populations worldwide. Among MEZs, this allele showed a frequency of 0.15, intermediate between that in MAs and in Iberians (0.43). Moreover, Glu27 was the only SNP exhibiting a geographic gradient within the MEZ population (from 0.22 to 0.11), reflecting admixed mestizo ancestry across the country. Population differentiation analysis demonstrated that Glu27 had the highest FST value in MAs compared with Europeans (CEU) (0.71), and the lowest between MAs and Japanese (JPT) (0.01), even lower than that observed between MAs and MEZs (0.08). This analysis demonstrated the genetic diversity among Amerindian ethnicities, with the most extreme FST value (0.34) found between the Nahuatls from Morelos and the Seris. This is the first study of ADRB2 genetic variants among MA ethnicities. Our findings add to our understanding of the genetic contribution to variability in disease susceptibility in admixed populations."
https://openalex.org/W2993751050,"Increasing nutrient intake through home gardening is a sustainable way to address multiple micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries. This study investigated the impact of permagarden intervention in increasing the frequency and diversity of vegetable and fruit consumption among vulnerable families in seven cities of Ethiopia.A quasi-experimental study was conducted from August 10 to September 30, 2015. A total of 884 care givers (427 from intervention and 457 from control) participated in the study. Data were collected through face to face interviews with caregivers of highly vulnerable children. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used as implemented in STATA software. Program impact on the frequency and diversity of households' fruit and vegetable consumption between intervention and control groups was assessed using chi square test.Intervention participants had a 13% higher increase in frequency of vegetable and fruit consumption compared with control participants (p<0.01). Diversity (consumption of 2 or more groups of vegetable and fruit) is higher among intervention groups than control groups (percentage difference = 9, p-value<0.05). A significant higher percentage of participants in intervention group reported getting the one-week vegetable and fruit mainly from their own garden (percentage difference 58.3%, p<0.05). A significantly larger proportion of participants in the intervention group compared to control group reported ""high likelihood"" on intention to grow vegetables in the future (percentage difference = 30%, and P<0.01). Perceived importance to include vegetable in everyday meal was higher among intervention group participants than control group participants (percentage difference = 11.5%, P<0.01).The observed higher FV intake among permagarden intervention group compared to control group suggest that nutrition and health programs need to promote permagarden as a means to improve FV intake among vulnerable societies in resource limited countries."

https://openalex.org/W2994027779,"A perennial activity of demographers is to estimate the percentage of the world's population which is above or below the 'replacement rate of fertility' [RRF]. However, most attempts to do so have been based upon, at best, oversimplified, or at worst, simply incorrect assumptions about what RRF actually is. The objective of this paper is to calculate the proportion of the world's population living in countries with observed period total fertility rates [TFR] below the respective calculated RRF, rather than the commonly used measure of 2.1. While the differences between comparing TFR to 2.1 or RRF are relatively modest in many periods when considering populations at the national level, a significant difference can be observed in the near future based upon India's fertility and mortality trajectories. Our exercise represents a means of 'correcting the record' using the most up-to-date evidence and using the correct protocol."
https://openalex.org/W2994408685,"The use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular events but increased risks of bleeding complications. We aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of aspirin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in Chinese DM patients. A life-long Markov model was developed to compare aspirin therapy (100mg daily) versus no use of aspirin in DM patients with no history of CVD. Model validation was conducted by comparing the simulated event rates with data reported in a clinical trial. Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYs) were the primary outcomes from the perspective of healthcare system in China. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the uncertainty of model inputs. Base-case analysis showed aspirin therapy was more costly (USD1,086 versus USD819) with higher QALYs gained (11.94 versus 11.86 QALYs) compared to no use of aspirin. The base-case results were sensitive to the odds ratio of all-cause death in aspirin therapy versus no use of aspirin. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that aspirin therapy gained an additional 0.066 QALYs (95% CI: -0.167 QALYs-0.286 QALYs) at higher cost by USD352 (95% CI: USD130-644)). Using 30,000 USD/QALY as willingness-to-pay threshold, aspirin therapy and no use of aspirin were the preferred option in 68.71% and 31.29% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. In conclusion, aspirin therapy appears to be cost-effective compared with no use of aspirin in primary prevention of CVD in Chinese DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2992444461,"Elasmobranchs display various reproductive modes, which have been key to their evolutionary success. In recent decades there has been a rise in the number of reported cases of foetal abnormalities including fertilised, double-embryos held within one egg capsule, hereafter referred to as twins. Previously, the occurrences of twin egg cases have been reported in two batoid and one shark species. We report the first cases of twins in three species of oviparous elasmobranchs: the undulate ray (Raja undulata), the nursehound (Scyliorhinus stellaris), and the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). We investigated the genetic relationships between the twins in S. stellaris, and S. canicula using microsatellite markers. Whilst the S. stellaris twins displayed the same genotypes, we found that the S. canicula twin individuals arose through heteropaternal superfecundation. This is the first reported incidence of such a paternity in elasmobranchs. The relationship between environmental change and reproductive strategy in elasmobranchs is unclear and further research is needed to determine its effect on the prevalence and mechanisms of formation of elasmobranch twins."
