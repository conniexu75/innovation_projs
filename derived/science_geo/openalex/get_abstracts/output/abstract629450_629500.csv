https://openalex.org/W2798434869,"Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning. Two classification algorithms that use the quantum state space to produce feature maps are demonstrated on a superconducting processor, enabling the solution of problems when the feature space is large and the kernel functions are computationally expensive to estimate."
https://openalex.org/W2921815890,"The genome sequences of many species of the human gut microbiome remain unknown, largely owing to challenges in cultivating microorganisms under laboratory conditions. Here we address this problem by reconstructing 60,664 draft prokaryotic genomes from 3,810 faecal metagenomes, from geographically and phenotypically diverse humans. These genomes provide reference points for 2,058 newly identified species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represents a 50% increase over the previously known phylogenetic diversity of sequenced gut bacteria. On average, the newly identified OTUs comprise 33% of richness and 28% of species abundance per individual, and are enriched in humans from rural populations. A meta-analysis of clinical gut-microbiome studies pinpointed numerous disease associations for the newly identified OTUs, which have the potential to improve predictive models. Finally, our analysis revealed that uncultured gut species have undergone genome reduction that has resulted in the loss of certain biosynthetic pathways, which may offer clues for improving cultivation strategies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2921763102,"DNA and histone modifications have notable effects on gene expression1. Being the most prevalent internal modification in mRNA, the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modification is as an important post-transcriptional mechanism of gene regulation2-4 and has crucial roles in various normal and pathological processes5-12. However, it is unclear how m6A is specifically and dynamically deposited in the transcriptome. Here we report that histone H3 trimethylation at Lys36 (H3K36me3), a marker for transcription elongation, guides m6A deposition globally. We show that m6A modifications are enriched in the vicinity of H3K36me3 peaks, and are reduced globally when cellular H3K36me3 is depleted. Mechanistically, H3K36me3 is recognized and bound directly by METTL14, a crucial component of the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC), which in turn facilitates the binding of the m6A MTC to adjacent RNA polymerase II, thereby delivering the m6A MTC to actively transcribed nascent RNAs to deposit m6A co-transcriptionally. In mouse embryonic stem cells, phenocopying METTL14 knockdown, H3K36me3 depletion also markedly reduces m6A abundance transcriptome-wide and in pluripotency transcripts, resulting in increased cell stemness. Collectively, our studies reveal the important roles of H3K36me3 and METTL14 in determining specific and dynamic deposition of m6A in mRNA, and uncover another layer of gene expression regulation that involves crosstalk between histone modification and RNA methylation."

https://openalex.org/W3102421726,"In the era of precision cosmology, it is essential to empirically determine the Hubble constant with an accuracy of one per cent or better. At present, the uncertainty on this constant is dominated by the uncertainty in the calibration of the Cepheid period - luminosity relationship (also known as Leavitt Law). The Large Magellanic Cloud has traditionally served as the best galaxy with which to calibrate Cepheid period-luminosity relations, and as a result has become the best anchor point for the cosmic distance scale. Eclipsing binary systems composed of late-type stars offer the most precise and accurate way to measure the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Currently the limit of the precision attainable with this technique is about two per cent, and is set by the precision of the existing calibrations of the surface brightness - colour relation. Here we report the calibration of the surface brightness-colour relation with a precision of 0.8 per cent. We use this calibration to determine the geometrical distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud that is precise to 1 per cent based on 20 eclipsing binary systems. The final distane is 49.59 +/- 0.09 (statistical) +/- 0.54 (systematic) kiloparsecs."

https://openalex.org/W2922441457,"Chemical modifications of histones can mediate diverse DNA-templated processes, including gene transcription1-3. Here we provide evidence for a class of histone post-translational modification, serotonylation of glutamine, which occurs at position 5 (Q5ser) on histone H3 in organisms that produce serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)). We demonstrate that tissue transglutaminase 2 can serotonylate histone H3 tri-methylated lysine 4 (H3K4me3)-marked nucleosomes, resulting in the presence of combinatorial H3K4me3Q5ser in vivo. H3K4me3Q5ser displays a ubiquitous pattern of tissue expression in mammals, with enrichment observed in brain and gut, two organ systems responsible for the bulk of 5-HT production. Genome-wide analyses of human serotonergic neurons, developing mouse brain and cultured serotonergic cells indicate that H3K4me3Q5ser nucleosomes are enriched in euchromatin, are sensitive to cellular differentiation and correlate with permissive gene expression, phenomena that are linked to the potentiation of TFIID4-6 interactions with H3K4me3. Cells that ectopically express a H3 mutant that cannot be serotonylated display significantly altered expression of H3K4me3Q5ser-target loci, which leads to deficits in differentiation. Taken together, these data identify a direct role for 5-HT, independent from its contributions to neurotransmission and cellular signalling, in the mediation of permissive gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2920825919,"Diversity within or between tumours and metastases (known as intra-patient tumour heterogeneity) that develops during disease progression is a serious hurdle for therapy1-3. Metastasis is the fatal hallmark of cancer and the mechanisms of colonization, the most complex step in the metastatic cascade4, remain poorly defined. A clearer understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that underlie both intra-patient tumour heterogeneity and metastasis is crucial for the success of personalized cancer therapy. Here, using transcriptional profiling of tumours and matched metastases in patient-derived xenograft models in mice, we show cancer-site-specific phenotypes and increased glucocorticoid receptor activity in distant metastases. The glucocorticoid receptor mediates the effects of stress hormones, and of synthetic derivatives of these hormones that are used widely in the clinic as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. We show that the increase in stress hormones during breast cancer progression results in the activation of the glucocorticoid receptor at distant metastatic sites, increased colonization and reduced survival. Our transcriptomics, proteomics and phospho-proteomics studies implicate the glucocorticoid receptor in the activation of multiple processes in metastasis and in the increased expression of kinase ROR1, both of which correlate with reduced survival. The ablation of ROR1 reduced metastatic outgrowth and prolonged survival in preclinical models. Our results indicate that the activation of the glucocorticoid receptor increases heterogeneity and metastasis, which suggests that caution is needed when using glucocorticoids to treat patients with breast cancer who have developed cancer-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W2920863604,"The rates and routes of lethal systemic spread in breast cancer are poorly understood owing to a lack of molecularly characterized patient cohorts with long-term, detailed follow-up data. Long-term follow-up is especially important for those with oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers, which can recur up to two decades after initial diagnosis1–6. It is therefore essential to identify patients who have a high risk of late relapse7–9. Here we present a statistical framework that models distinct disease stages (locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, breast-cancer-related death and death from other causes) and competing risks of mortality from breast cancer, while yielding individual risk-of-recurrence predictions. We apply this model to 3,240 patients with breast cancer, including 1,980 for whom molecular data are available, and delineate spatiotemporal patterns of relapse across different categories of molecular information (namely immunohistochemical subtypes; PAM50 subtypes, which are based on gene-expression patterns10,11; and integrative or IntClust subtypes, which are based on patterns of genomic copy-number alterations and gene expression12,13). We identify four late-recurring integrative subtypes, comprising about one quarter (26%) of tumours that are both positive for ER and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, each with characteristic tumour-driving alterations in genomic copy number and a high risk of recurrence (mean 47–62%) up to 20 years after diagnosis. We also define a subgroup of triple-negative breast cancers in which cancer rarely recurs after five years, and a separate subgroup in which patients remain at risk. Use of the integrative subtypes improves the prediction of late, distant relapse beyond what is possible with clinical covariates (nodal status, tumour size, tumour grade and immunohistochemical subtype). These findings highlight opportunities for improved patient stratification and biomarker-driven clinical trials. A statistical framework for breast-cancer recurrence uses long-term follow-up data and a knowledge of molecular subcategories to model distinct disease stages and to predict the risk of relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2921153272,"Histiocytic neoplasms are a heterogeneous group of clonal haematopoietic disorders that are marked by diverse mutations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway1,2. For the 50% of patients with histiocytosis who have BRAFV600 mutations3–5, RAF inhibition is highly efficacious and has markedly altered the natural history of the disease6,7. However, no standard therapy exists for the remaining 50% of patients who lack BRAFV600 mutations. Although ERK dependence has been hypothesized to be a consistent feature across histiocytic neoplasms, this remains clinically unproven and many of the kinase mutations that are found in patients who lack BRAFV600 mutations have not previously been biologically characterized. Here we show ERK dependency in histiocytoses through a proof-of-concept clinical trial of cobimetinib, an oral inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, in patients with histiocytoses. Patients were enrolled regardless of their tumour genotype. In parallel, MAPK alterations that were identified in treated patients were characterized for their ability to activate ERK. In the 18 patients that we treated, the overall response rate was 89% (90% confidence interval of 73–100). Responses were durable, with no acquired resistance to date. At one year, 100% of responses were ongoing and 94% of patients remained progression-free. Cobimetinib treatment was efficacious regardless of genotype, and responses were observed in patients with ARAF, BRAF, RAF1, NRAS, KRAS, MEK1 (also known as MAP2K1) and MEK2 (also known as MAP2K2) mutations. Consistent with the observed responses, the characterization of the mutations that we identified in these patients confirmed that the MAPK-pathway mutations were activating. Collectively, these data demonstrate that histiocytic neoplasms are characterized by a notable dependence on MAPK signalling—and that they are consequently responsive to MEK inhibition. These results extend the benefits of molecularly targeted therapy to the entire spectrum of patients with histiocytosis. A proof-of-concept clinical trial of patients with histiocytoses with MAPK-pathway mutations showed durable responses to treatment with the MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor cobimetinib, which indicates that histiocytic neoplasms are dependent on MAPK signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2922370381,"Children and adolescents with low socioeconomic status (SES) suffer from mental health problems more often than their peers with high SES. The aim of the current study was to investigate the direct and interactive association between commonly used indicators of SES and the exposure to stressful life situations in relation to children's mental health problems.The prospective BELLA cohort study is the mental health module of the representative, population-based German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for children and adolescents (KiGGS). Sample data include 2,111 participants (aged 7-17 years at baseline) from the first three measurement points (2003-2006, 2004-2007 and 2005-2008). Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were conducted to analyze associations among the SES indicators household income, parental education and parental unemployment (assessed at baseline), number of stressful life situations (e.g., parental accident, mental illness or severe financial crises; 1- and 2-year follow-ups) and parent-reported mental health problems (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; 2-year follow-up).All indicators of SES separately predicted mental health problems in children and adolescents at the 2-year follow-up. Stressful life situations (between baseline and 2-year follow-up) and the interaction of parental education and the number of stressful life situations remained significant in predicting children's mental health problems after adjustment for control variables. Thereby, children with higher educated parents showed fewer mental health problems in a stressful life situation. No moderating effect was found for household income and parental employment. Overall, the detected effect sizes were small. Mental health problems at baseline were the best predictor for mental health problems two years later.Children and adolescents with a low SES suffer from multiple stressful life situations and are exposed to a higher risk of developing mental health problems. The findings suggest that the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities and interventions for families with low parental education might help to reduce children's mental health problems."
https://openalex.org/W2894213261,"Questioning the presumably most basic assumptions about the structure of space and time has revolutionized our understanding of Nature. State-of-the-art atomic clocks make it possible to precisely test fundamental symmetry properties of spacetime, and search for physics beyond the standard model at low energy scales of just a few electron volts. Here, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time agreement of two single-ion clocks at the $10^{-18}$ level and directly confirm the validity of their uncertainty budgets over a half-year long comparison period. The two clock ions are confined in separate ion traps with quantization axes aligned along nonparallel directions. Hypothetical Lorentz symmetry violations would lead to sidereal modulations of the frequency offset. From the absence of such modulations at the $10^{-19}$ level we deduce stringent limits on Lorentz symmetry violation parameters for electrons in the range of $10^{-21}$, improving previous limits by two orders of magnitude."

https://openalex.org/W2921983718,"Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can regenerate mesenchymal tissues, such as adipose tissue, bone, and muscle. Recent studies have shown that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications, is involved in the development process. However, whether it plays roles in BMSC differentiation is still elusive. Here, we found that the deletion of m6A ""writer"" protein methyltransferase-like (METTL)3 in porcine BMSCs (pBMSCs) could promote adipogenesis and janus kinase (JAK)1 protein expression via an m6A-dependent way. Knockdown of METTL3 decreased mRNA m6A levels of JAK1, leading to enhanced YTH m6A RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2)-dependent JAK1 mRNA stability. We further demonstrated that JAK1 activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 through regulation of its phosphorylation to bind to the promoter of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) β, which could ultimately lead to a modulated adipogenic process. Collectively, our results reveal an orchestrated network linking the m6A methylation and JAK1/STAT5/C/EBPβ pathway in pBMSCs adipogenic differentiation. Our findings provide novel insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of m6A modification in the regulation of BMSCs differentiating into adipocytes, which may pave a way to develop more effective therapeutic strategies in stem cell regenerative medicine and the treatment of obesity.-Yao, Y., Bi, Z., Wu, R., Zhao, Y., Liu, Y., Liu, Q., Wang, Y., Wang, X.

https://openalex.org/W2921483228,"Pericyclic reactions are powerful transformations for the construction of carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds in organic synthesis. Their role in biosynthesis is increasingly apparent, and mechanisms by which pericyclases can catalyse reactions are of major interest1. [4+2] cycloadditions (Diels–Alder reactions) have been widely used in organic synthesis2 for the formation of six-membered rings and are now well-established in biosynthesis3–6. [6+4] and other ‘higher-order’ cycloadditions were predicted7 in 1965, and are now increasingly common in the laboratory despite challenges arising from the generation of a highly strained ten-membered ring system8,9. However, although enzyme-catalysed [6+4] cycloadditions have been proposed10–12, they have not been proven to occur. Here we demonstrate a group of enzymes that catalyse a pericyclic [6+4] cycloaddition, which is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of streptoseomycin-type natural products. This type of pericyclase catalyses [6+4] and [4+2] cycloadditions through a single ambimodal transition state, which is consistent with previous proposals11,12. The [6+4] product is transformed to a less stable [4+2] adduct via a facile Cope rearrangement, and the [4+2] adduct is converted into the natural product enzymatically. Crystal structures of three pericyclases, computational simulations of potential energies and molecular dynamics, and site-directed mutagenesis establish the mechanism of this transformation. This work shows how enzymes are able to catalyse concerted pericyclic reactions involving ambimodal transition states. Enzymatic catalysis of pericyclic [6+4] cycloaddition reactions to form ten-membered rings is observed during biosynthesis of the macrocyclic antibiotic streptoseomycin, and the mechanism of these transformations is established."
https://openalex.org/W2921978574,"Age-related deficits in speech-in-noise understanding pose a significant problem for older adults. Despite the vast number of studies conducted to investigate the neural mechanisms responsible for these communication difficulties, the role of central auditory deficits, beyond peripheral hearing loss, remains unclear. The current study builds upon our previous work that investigated the effect of aging on normal-hearing individuals and aims to estimate the effect of peripheral hearing loss on the representation of speech in noise in two critical regions of the aging auditory pathway: the midbrain and cortex. Data from 14 hearing-impaired older adults were added to a previously published dataset of 17 normal-hearing younger adults and 15 normal-hearing older adults. The midbrain response, measured by the frequency-following response (FFR), and the cortical response, measured with the magnetoencephalography (MEG) response, were recorded from subjects listening to speech in quiet and noise conditions at four signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): +3, 0, -3, and -6 dB sound pressure level (SPL). Both groups of older listeners showed weaker midbrain response amplitudes and overrepresentation of cortical responses compared to younger listeners. No significant differences were found between the two older groups when the midbrain and cortical measurements were analyzed independently. However, significant differences between the older groups were found when investigating the midbrain-cortex relationships; that is, only hearing-impaired older adults showed significant correlations between midbrain and cortical measurements, suggesting that hearing loss may alter reciprocal connections between lower and higher levels of the auditory pathway. The overall paucity of differences in midbrain or cortical responses between the two older groups suggests that age-related temporal processing deficits may contribute to older adults' communication difficulties beyond what might be predicted from peripheral hearing loss alone; however, hearing loss does seem to alter the connectivity between midbrain and cortex. These results may have important ramifications for the field of audiology, as it indicates that algorithms in clinical devices, such as hearing aids, should consider age-related temporal processing deficits to maximize user benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2921285564,"Loss-of-function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) compromise epithelial HCO3− and Cl− secretion, reduce airway surface liquid pH, and impair respiratory host defences in people with cystic fibrosis1–3. Here we report that apical addition of amphotericin B, a small molecule that forms unselective ion channels, restored HCO3− secretion and increased airway surface liquid pH in cultured airway epithelia from people with cystic fibrosis. These effects required the basolateral Na+, K+-ATPase, indicating that apical amphotericin B channels functionally interfaced with this driver of anion secretion. Amphotericin B also restored airway surface liquid pH, viscosity, and antibacterial activity in primary cultures of airway epithelia from people with cystic fibrosis caused by different mutations, including ones that do not yield CFTR, and increased airway surface liquid pH in CFTR-null pigs in vivo. Thus, unselective small-molecule ion channels can restore host defences in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia via a mechanism that is independent of CFTR and is therefore independent of genotype. Amphotericin B forms nonselective transmembrane ion channels, and restores host defences of cystic fibrosis airway epithelia independently of the regulatory function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance."
https://openalex.org/W2922321385,"The molecular mechanisms leading to aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) mutation-induced aggressive, young-onset growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors are not fully understood. In this study, we have identified that AIP-mutation-positive tumors are infiltrated by a large number of macrophages compared to sporadic tumors. Tissue from pituitary-specific Aip-knockout (AipFlox/Flox;Hesx1Cre/+) mice recapitulated this phenotype. Our human pituitary tumor transcriptome data revealed the “epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway” as one of the most significantly altered pathways in AIPpos tumors. Our in vitro data suggest that bone marrow-derived macrophage-conditioned media induces more prominent EMT-like phenotype and enhanced migratory and invasive properties in Aip-knockdown somatomammotroph cells compared to non-targeting controls. We identified that tumor-derived cytokine CCL5 is upregulated in AIP-mutation-positive human adenomas. Aip-knockdown GH3 cell-conditioned media increases macrophage migration, which is inhibited by the CCL5/CCR5 antagonist maraviroc. Our results suggest that a crosstalk between the tumor and its microenvironment plays a key role in the invasive nature of AIP-mutation-positive tumors and the CCL5/CCR5 pathway is a novel potential therapeutic target."

https://openalex.org/W2921488690,"Automated cell classification is an important yet a challenging computer vision task with significant benefits to biomedicine. In recent years, there have been several studies attempted to build an artificial intelligence-based cell classifier using label-free cellular images obtained from an optical microscope. Although these studies showed promising results, such classifiers were not able to reflect the biological diversity of different types of cell. While in terms of malignant cell, it is well-known that intracellular actin filaments are altered substantially. This is thought to be closely related to the abnormal growth features of tumor cells, their ability to invade surrounding tissues and also to metastasize. Therefore, being able to classify different types of cell based on their biological behaviors using automated technique is more advantageous. This article reveals the difference in the actin cytoskeleton structures between breast normal and cancer cells, which may provide new information regarding malignant changes and be used as additional diagnostic marker. Since the features cannot be well detected by human eyes, we proposed the application of convolutional neural network (CNN) in cell classification based on actin-labeled fluorescence microscopy images. The CNN was evaluated on a large number of actin-labeled fluorescence microscopy images of one human normal breast epithelial cell line and two types of human breast cancer cell line with different levels of aggressiveness. The study revealed that the CNN performed better in the cell classification task compared to a human expert."
https://openalex.org/W2950783320,"The diversity-productivity, diversity-invasibility, and diversity-stability hypotheses propose that increasing species diversity should lead, respectively, to increased average biomass productivity, invasion resistance, and stability. We tested these three hypotheses in the context of cover crop mixtures, evaluating the effects of increasing cover crop mixture diversity on aboveground biomass, weed suppression, and biomass stability. Twenty to forty cover crop treatments were replicated three or four times at eleven sites using eighteen species representing three cover crop species each from six pre-defined functional groups: cool-season grasses, cool-season legumes, cool-season brassicas, warm-season grasses, warm-season legumes, and warm-season broadleaves. Each species was seeded as a pure stand, and the most diverse treatment contained all eighteen species. Remaining treatments included treatments representing intermediate levels of cover crop species and functional richness and a no cover crop control. Cover crop seeding dates ranged from late July to late September with both cover crop and weed aboveground biomass being sampled prior to winterkill. Stability was assessed by evaluating the variability in cover crop biomass for each treatment across plots within each site. While increasing cover crop mixture diversity was associated with increased average aboveground biomass, we assert that this was the result of the average biomass of the pure stands being drawn down by low biomass species rather than due to niche complementarity or increased resource use efficiency. At no site did the highest biomass mixture produce more than the highest biomass pure stand. Furthermore, while increases in cover crop mixture diversity were correlated with increases in weed suppression and biomass stability, we argue that this was largely the result of diversity co-varying with aboveground biomass, and that differences in aboveground biomass rather than differences in diversity drove the differences observed in weed suppression and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2952966875,"The microtubule (MT) associated protein Tau is instrumental for the regulation of MT assembly and dynamic instability, orchestrating MT-dependent cellular processes. Aberration in Tau post-translational modifications ratio deviation of spliced Tau isoforms 3 or 4 MT binding repeats (3R/4R) have been implicated in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) is vital for brain formation and cognitive function. ADNP deficiency in mice causes pathological Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, correlated with impaired cognitive functions. It has been previously shown that the ADNP-derived peptide NAP protects against ADNP deficiency, exhibiting neuroprotection, MT interaction and memory protection. NAP prevents MT degradation by recruitment of Tau and end-binding proteins to MTs and expression of these proteins is required for NAP activity. Clinically, NAP (davunetide, CP201) exhibited efficacy in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease patients (Tau3R/4R tauopathy) but not in progressive supranuclear palsy (increased Tau4R tauopathy). Here, we examined the potential preferential interaction of NAP with 3R vs. 4R Tau, toward personalized treatment of tauopathies. Affinity-chromatography showed that NAP preferentially interacted with Tau3R protein from rat brain extracts and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay indicated that NAP induced increased recruitment of human Tau3R to MTs under zinc intoxication, in comparison to Tau4R. Furthermore, we showed that NAP interaction with tubulin (MTs) was inhibited by obstruction of Tau-binding sites on MTs, confirming the requirement of Tau-MT interaction for NAP activity. The preferential interaction of NAP with Tau3R may explain clinical efficacy in mixed vs. Tau4R pathologies, and suggest effectiveness in Tau3R neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2921738322,"Waterfalls are inspiring landforms that set the pace of landscape evolution as a result of bedrock incision1–3. They communicate changes in sea level or tectonic uplift throughout landscapes2,4 or stall river incision, disconnecting landscapes from downstream perturbations3,5. Here we use a flume experiment with constant water discharge and sediment feed to show that waterfalls can form from a planar, homogeneous bedrock bed in the absence of external perturbations. In our experiment, instabilities between flow hydraulics, sediment transport and bedrock erosion lead to undulating bedforms, which grow to become waterfalls. We propose that it is plausible that the origin of some waterfalls in natural systems can be attributed to this intrinsic formation process and we suggest that investigations to distinguish self-formed from externally forced waterfalls may help to improve the reconstruction of Earth history from landscapes. Even in the absence of external perturbations, waterfalls can gradually form from planar bedrock riverbeds as a result of unstable interactions between flow hydraulics, sediment transport and bedrock erosion."
https://openalex.org/W2921195791,"The general decline of seabird populations worldwide raises large concerns. Although multiple factors are interacting to cause the observed trends, increased mortality from incidental bycatch in fisheries has proven to be important for many species. However, the bulk of published knowledge is derived from longline fisheries, whereas bycatch in gillnet fisheries is less studied and even overlooked in some areas. We present seabird bycatch data from a 10-year time-series of fishery data from the large fleet of small-vessels fishing with gillnets along the Norwegian coast-a large area and fishery with no prior estimates of seabird bycatch. In general, we document high rates of incidental bycatch (averaging 0.0023 seabirds/net, or approximately 0.08 seabirds/fishing trip). This results in an estimated annual bycatch between 1580 and 11500 (95% CI) birds in this fishery. There was a surprisingly high percentage (43%) of surface-feeding seabirds in the bycatch, with northern fulmar being the most common species. Among the diving seabirds caught, common guillemot was most numerous. Our findings suggest that coastal gillnet fisheries represent a more general threat to a wider range of seabird populations, as opposed to longline fisheries where surface-feeding seabird species seem to dominate the bycatch. The bycatch estimates for the Norwegian gillnet-fishery varied in time, between areas, and with fishing depth and distance from the coast, but we found no clear trends in relation to the type of gillnets used. The results enabled us to identify important spatio-temporal trends in the seabird bycatch, which can allow for the development and implementation of more specific mitigation measures. While specific time closures might be an efficient option to reduce bycatch for diving seabirds, measures such as gear modification and reduction in release of wastewater during fishing operation are probably a more effective mitigation approach for reducing bycatch of surface-feeding seabirds."
https://openalex.org/W2922006472,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and fatal disease associated with remodeling of the pulmonary artery. We previously reported that the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) is up-regulated in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and contributes to enhanced Ca2+ responses and excessive cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of CaSR have not yet been elucidated. We herein examined involvement of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on CaSR expression, Ca2+ responses, and proliferation in PASMCs. The expression of PDGF receptors was higher in PASMCs from patients with IPAH than in PASMCs from normal subjects. In addition, PDGF-induced activation of PDGF receptors and their downstream molecules [ERK1/2, p38, protein kinase B, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1/3] were sustained longer in PASMCs from patients with IPAH. The PDGF-induced CaSR up-regulation was attenuated by small interfering RNA knockdown of PDGF receptors and STAT1/3, and by the treatment with imatinib. In monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats, the up-regulation of CaSR was reduced by imatinib. The combination of NPS2143 and imatinib additively inhibited the development of pulmonary hypertension. These results suggest that enhanced PDGF signaling is involved in CaSR up-regulation, leading to excessive PASMC proliferation and vascular remodeling in patients with IPAH. The linkage between CaSR and PDGF signals is a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to the development of PAH.-Yamamura, A., Nayeem, M.

Susceptibility to multiple antibiotics was compared between biofilms of varying species grown on collagen versus standard polycarbonate coupons. Data indicated that in 13/18 instances, biofilms on polycarbonate were more susceptible to antibiotics than those on collagen, suggesting that when grown on a complex substrate, biofilms may be more tolerant to antibiotics. These outcomes may influence the translatability of antibiotic susceptibility profiles that have been collected for biofilms on hard plastic materials. Data may also help to advance information on antibiotic susceptibility testing of biofilms grown on biologically relevant materials for future in vitro and in vivo applications."
https://openalex.org/W2920818926,"Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health challenge. Pharmacists play a key role in the health care setting to support the quality use of medicines. The education and training of pharmacy students have the potential to impact on patterns of antibiotic use in community and hospital settings. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare antibiotic use and knowledge of antibiotics and AMR among undergraduate pharmacy students in Australian and Sri Lankan universities. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Australian and Sri Lankan universities that offer a pharmacy degree. A paper-based survey was utilised in Sri Lanka and an identical survey distributed online among pharmacy students in Australia. Descriptive and comparative data analyses were performed. Results 476 pharmacy students from 14 universities in Australia and 466 students from 6 universities in SL completed the survey. Participants commonly reported previous antibiotic use [Australia (88%) and Sri Lanka (86%)]. The majority of students [Australia (89%) and Sri Lanka (77%)] reported they obtained antibiotics with a prescription. Australian pharmacy students correctly reported regarding optimal antibiotic use for certain disease conditions when compared to Sri Lankan students (P<0.05). A greater antibiotic knowledge level regarding AMR was found among Australian students compared to Sri Lankan students (p<0.05). Conclusion This study provides an understanding about antibiotic consumption and knowledge on AMR among pharmacy students in a developed country, Australia and a developing country, Sri Lanka. These findings identify possible misconceptions about antibiotics and a lower level of knowledge of AMR amongst Sri Lankan undergraduate pharmacy students. Future research should focus on implementation of a strategic education plan for undergraduate pharmacy students in Sri Lankan universities. The curricula of pharmacy courses in Australian universities may inform such a plan."

Qualitative interviews were conducted to understand programmatic experiences.Of 393 persons experiencing homelessness (median age: 50 years; range: 13-74 years), 301 (76.6%) completed treatment, 55 (14.0%) were lost to follow-up, 18 (4.6%) stopped because of an adverse event (AE), and 19 (4.8%) stopped after relocations or refusing treatment. Eighty-one (20.6%) had at least one AE. Persons aged ≥65 were more likely to discontinue treatment than persons aged 31-44 years. Programs reported difficulty in following up with persons experiencing homelessness because of relocations, mistrust, and alcohol or drug use.This study demonstrates the feasibility of administering the 3HP/DOT LTBI regimen to persons experiencing homelessness, a high-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W2993702415,"The effective therapeutic approach of cerebral infarction is limited because of its underlying complexity. Recently, multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction. Here, the current study aims to explore the interaction among lncRNA cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2B–antisense RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1), transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A), and MAPKK kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) and further investigate whether they affect cerebral infarction progression. The expression of CDKN2B-AS1, BCL11A, and MAP4K1 was altered in lymphocytes extracted from patients with cerebral infarction. In order to identify their roles in regulatory T (Treg) cells, the proliferation and apoptosis of the CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were examined, and levels of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β were determined. Also, the RNA crosstalk among CDKN2B-AS1, BCL11A, and MAP4K1 was validated. Finally, we established a rat model of middle cerebral arterial occlusion to evaluate the neurologic impairment and cerebral infarction volume. The results revealed that lymphocytes in patients with cerebral infarction presented with the up-regulated expression of CDKN2B-AS1. Moreover, BCL11A could specifically bind to CDKN2B-AS1 and MAP4K1 promoter so as to inhibit MAP4K1. Moreover, it was observed that down-regulated CDKN2B-AS1 inhibited CD4+CD25+ Treg-cell proliferation, reduced levels of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β and cerebral infarction volume, and elevated MAP4K1 expression. Collectively, our study provides evidence that CDKN2B-AS1 silencing could increase MAP4K1 expression to inhibit the CD4+CD25+ Treg-cell proliferation by reducing enrichment of transcription factor BCL11A, thereby protecting against cerebral infarction progression, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy for treating cerebral infarction.—Lei, J.-J., Li, H.-Q., Mo, Z.-H., Liu, K.-J., Zhu, L.-J., Li, C.-Y., Chen, W.-L., Zhang, L.

https://openalex.org/W2921013292,"A major obstacle to tuberculosis (TB)-subunit–vaccine development has been the induction of inadequate levels of protective immunity due to the limited breadth of antigen in vaccine preparations. In this study, immunogenic mycobacterial fusion peptides Ag85B-TB10.4 and Ag85B-TB10.4-Rv2660c were covalently displayed on the surface of self-assembled polyester particles. This study investigated whether polyester particles displaying mycobacterial antigens could provide augmented immunogenicity (i.e., offer an innovative vaccine formulation) when compared with free soluble antigens. Herein, polyester particle–based particulate vaccines were produced in an endotoxin-free Escherichia coli strain and emulsified with the adjuvant dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide. C57BL/6 mice were used to study the immunogenicity of formulated particulate vaccines. The result of humoral immunity showed the antibodies only interacted with target antigens and not with PhaC and the background proteins of the production host. The analysis of T helper 1 cellular immunity indicated that a relatively strong production of cellular immunity biomarkers, IFN-γ and IL-17A cytokines, was induced by particulate vaccines when compared with the respective soluble controls. This study demonstrated that polyester particles have the potential to perform as a mycobacterial antigen–delivery agent to induce augmented antigen-specific immune responses in contrast to free soluble vaccines.—Chen, S., Sandford, S., Kirman, J.

https://openalex.org/W2921037250,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis disorder. PCOS symptoms most likely result from a disturbance in the complex feedback regulation system of the HPG axis, which involves gonadotrophic hormones and ovarian steroid hormones. However, the nature of this complex and interconnecting feedback regulation makes it difficult to dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for PCOS phenotypes. Global estrogen receptor α (ERα) knockout (KO) mice exhibit a disruption of the HPG axis, resulting in hormonal dysregulation in which female ERα KO mice have elevated levels of serum estradiol (E2), testosterone, and LH. The ERα KO females are anovulatory and develop cystic hemorrhagic ovaries that are thought to be due to persistently high circulating levels of LH from the pituitary. However, the role of ERα in the pituitary is still controversial because of the varied phenotypes reported in pituitary-specific ERα KO mouse models. Therefore, we developed a mouse model where ERα is reintroduced to be exclusively expressed in the pituitary on the background of a global ERα-null (PitERtgKO) mouse. Serum E2 and LH levels were normalized in PitERtgKO females and were comparable to wild-type serum levels. However, the ovaries of PitERtgKO adult mice displayed a more overt cystic and hemorrhagic phenotype when compared with ERα KO littermates. We determined that anomalous sporadic LH secretion caused the severe ovarian phenotype of PitERtgKO females. Our observations suggest that pituitary ERα is involved in the estrogen negative feedback regulation, whereas hypothalamic ERα is necessary for the precise control of LH secretion. Uncontrolled, irregular LH secretion may be the root cause of the cystic ovarian phenotype with similarities to PCOS.-Arao, Y., Hamilton, K. J., Wu, S.-P., Tsai, M.-J., DeMayo, F. J., Korach, K. S.

https://openalex.org/W2921627062,"Dietary inorganic nitrate prevents aspects of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction induced by hypoxia, although the mechanism is not completely understood. In both heart and skeletal muscle, nitrate increases fatty acid oxidation capacity, and in the latter case, this involves up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α expression. Here, we investigated whether dietary nitrate modifies mitochondrial function in the hypoxic heart in a PPARα-dependent manner. Wild-type (WT) mice and mice without PPARα (Ppara-/-) were given water containing 0.7 mM NaCl (control) or 0.7 mM NaNO3 for 35 d. After 7 d, mice were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (10% O2) for the remainder of the study. Mitochondrial respiratory function and metabolism were assessed in saponin-permeabilized cardiac muscle fibers. Environmental hypoxia suppressed mass-specific mitochondrial respiration and additionally lowered the proportion of respiration supported by fatty acid oxidation by 18% (P < 0.001). This switch away from fatty acid oxidation was reversed by nitrate treatment in hypoxic WT but not Ppara-/- mice, indicating a PPARα-dependent effect. Hypoxia increased hexokinase activity by 33% in all mice, whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity increased by 71% in hypoxic WT but not Ppara-/- mice. Our findings indicate that PPARα plays a key role in mediating cardiac metabolic remodeling in response to both hypoxia and dietary nitrate supplementation.-Horscroft, J. A., O'Brien, K.

https://openalex.org/W2922344591,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) crucially modulate fundamental biologic processes such as angiogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the molecular function of miRNA-370-3p (miR-370) in regulating the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells (ECs). Transfection with miR-370 mimic (miR-370m) significantly inhibited the sprouting of human dermal microvascular EC (HDMEC) and HUVEC spheroids and mouse aortic rings, whereas miR-370 inhibitor (miR-370i) promoted sprout formation. Additional in vitro assays demonstrated the pleiotropic inhibitory effects of miR-370m on HDMEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Moreover, Matrigel plugs containing miR-370m-transfected HDMECs exhibited a reduced microvessel density after implantation into CD1 nude mice when compared with controls. In contrast, miR-370i exerted proangiogenic effects. Mechanistic analyses revealed that miR-370 directly targets smoothened (SMO) and down-regulates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 expression in HDMECs. Accordingly, inhibition of SMO by cyclopamine reversed miR-370i-induced HDMEC proliferation and migration. In addition, BMP-2 treatment counteracted miR-370m-suppressed tube formation of HDMECs, whereas blockade of BMP-2 with neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited miR-370i-induced tube formation. Taken together, these novel findings indicate that miR-370 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, which directly targets SMO and BMP-2.—Gu, Y., Becker, V., Zhao, Y., Menger, M. D., Laschke, M.

https://openalex.org/W2922071976,"With warmer springs, herbivores migrating to Arctic breeding grounds may experience phenological mismatches between their energy demands and the availability of high quality forage. Yet, how the timing of the start of the season and herbivore arrival influences forage quality is often unknown. In coastal western Alaska, approximately one million migratory geese arrive each spring to breed, where foliar %N and C:N ratios are linked to gosling survival and population growth. We conducted a three-year experiment where we manipulated the start of the growing season using warming chambers and grazing times using captive Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) to examine how the timing of these events influences the quality of an important forage species. Our results suggest that grazing timing plays a much greater role than an advanced growing season in determining forage quality. All top models included grazing timing, and suggested that compared to typical grazing timing, early grazing significantly reduced foliar %C by 6% and C:N ratios by 16%, while late goose grazing significantly reduced foliar %N by 15% and increased foliar C:N ratios by 21%. While second-ranking top models included the effect of season, the advanced growing season effect was not significant and only reduced %N by 4%, increased %C by <1%, and increased C:N ratios by 5% compared to an ambient growing season. In summary, in years where geese arrive early, they will consume higher quality forage when they arrive and throughout the season, while in years that geese arrive late they will consume lower quality forage when they arrive and for the remainder of the season. When the growing season starts has only a minor influence on this pattern. Our findings suggest that cues determining migration and arrival times to breeding areas are important factors influencing forage quality for geese in western Alaska."
https://openalex.org/W2922289817,"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the major cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The multidrug-resistant E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131) clone is a serious threat to human health, yet its effects on immune responses are not well understood. Here we screened a panel of ST131 isolates, finding that only strains expressing the toxin hemolysin A (HlyA) killed primary human macrophages and triggered maturation of the inflammasome-dependent cytokine IL-1β. Using a representative strain, the requirement for the hlyA gene in these responses was confirmed. We also observed considerable heterogeneity in levels of cell death initiated by different HlyA+ve ST131 isolates, and this correlated with secreted HlyA levels. Investigation into the biological significance of this variation revealed that an ST131 strain producing low levels of HlyA initiated cell death that was partly dependent on the nod-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, with this response being associated with a host-protective role in a mouse UTI model. When the same ST131 strain was engineered to overexpress high HlyA levels, macrophage cell death occurred even when NLRP3 function was abrogated, and bladder colonization was significantly increased. Thus, variation in HlyA expression in UPEC affects mechanisms by which macrophages die, as well as host susceptibility vs. resistance to colonization.-Murthy, A. M. V., Sullivan, M. J., Nhu, N. T.

Cytosolic β-catenin stabilization promotes its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. In the present study, we seek to determine whether there is a connection between A2AR stimulation and cellular β-catenin levels in osteoblasts. Osteoblast precursor cell line (MC3T3-E1) and primary murine osteoblasts were treated with CGS21680, a highly selective A2AR agonist. We analyzed cellular content and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated (p)-serine 552 (S552) β-catenin in response to A2AR stimulation in MC3T3-E1 cells, in both wild-type and A2AR knockout (A2AKO) mice. Moreover, we measured cellular β-catenin levels in MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with scrambled or protein kinase B (Akt) small interfering RNA following A2AR activation. CGS21680 (1 μM) stimulated an increase in both the cellular content and nuclear translocation of p-S552 β-catenin after 15 min of incubation. A2AR activation had no tangible effect on the cellular β-catenin level either in A2AKO mice or in osteoblasts with diminished Akt content. Our findings demonstrate an interaction between A2AR, β-catenin, and Akt signaling in osteoblasts. The existence of such a crosstalk has significant repercussions in the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting medical conditions associated with reduced bone density.-Borhani, S., Corciulo, C., Larranaga-Vera, A., Cronstein, B.

https://openalex.org/W2921577553,"RNA viruses synthesize new genomes in the infected host thanks to dedicated, virally-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). As such, these enzymes are prime targets for antiviral therapy, as has recently been demonstrated for hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, peculiarities in the architecture and dynamics of RdRps raise fundamental questions about access to their active site during RNA polymerization. Here, we used molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, starting from the available crystal structures of HCV NS5B in ternary complex with template-primer duplexes and nucleotides, to address the question of ribonucleotide entry into the active site of viral RdRp. Tracing the possible passage of incoming UTP or GTP through the RdRp-specific entry tunnel, we found two successive checkpoints that regulate nucleotide traffic to the active site. We observed that a magnesium-bound nucleotide first binds next to the tunnel entry, and interactions with the triphosphate moiety orient it such that its base moiety enters first. Dynamics of RdRp motifs F1 + F3 then allow the nucleotide to interrogate the RNA template base prior to nucleotide insertion into the active site. These dynamics are finely regulated by a second magnesium dication, thus coordinating the entry of a magnesium-bound nucleotide with shuttling of the second magnesium necessary for the two-metal ion catalysis. The findings of our work suggest that at least some of these features are general to viral RdRps and provide further details on the original nucleotide selection mechanism operating in RdRps of RNA viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2922021689,"The current study examines the role of moral disengagement on the likelihood of making false allegations or retaliating against the partner in a child custody dispute. Moral disengagement strategies can be useful to explain this tendency to harm their partner in a custody dispute, because they help reduce the aversive state caused by the dissonance provoked when the ethical principles of the individual do not match their behavior. An individual that is able to lessen the negative affect anticipated before committing a transgression, would be more likely to engage in it. A sample of 1097 Spanish adults who had experienced a break up with their partner and had children participated in the study. They were evenly divided by sex and their mean age was 39.95 (SD = 8.89). They answered to a vignette depicting a child custody dispute during a break up process and answered to a series of questions regarding whether they would be willing to make false allegations or to take retaliatory action against their former partner. They also answered to questionnaires on moral disengagement and the “dark triad” of personality. Results show that moral disengagement is a significant predictor of false allegations and retaliatory action, stronger than any of the variables included in the “dark triad”, and predicts willingness to harm the partner beyond the common core of dark traits. We did not find gender differences in inclination to harm the partner, although men are more prone to the use of moral disengagement strategies than women. Still, we found that the type of moral disengagement that better predicts these tendencies is different for men and women. Men significantly favored reconstrual strategies that include moral justification, advantageous comparison and euphemistic labelling, while the best predictor for women are strategies focused on the recipient, like attribution of blame or dehumanization."
https://openalex.org/W2922220713,"Mussels of the genus Bathymodiolus are among the most widespread colonizers of hydrothermal vent and cold seep environments, sustained by endosymbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. Presumed species of Bathymodiolus are abundant at newly discovered cold seeps on the Mid-Atlantic continental slope, however morphological taxonomy is challenging, and their phylogenetic affinities remain unestablished. Here we used mitochondrial sequence to classify species found at three seep sites (Baltimore Canyon seep (BCS; ~400m); Norfolk Canyon seep (NCS; ~1520m); and Chincoteague Island seep (CTS; ~1000m)). Mitochondrial COI (N = 162) and ND4 (N = 39) data suggest that Bathymodiolus childressi predominates at these sites, although single B. mauritanicus and B. heckerae individuals were detected. As previous work had suggested that methanotrophic and thiotrophic interactions can both occur at a site, and within an individual mussel, we investigated the symbiont communities in gill tissues of a subset of mussels from BCS and NCS. We constructed metabarcode libraries with four different primer sets spanning the 16S gene. A methanotrophic phylotype dominated all gill microbial samples from BCS, but sulfur-oxidizing Campylobacterota were represented by a notable minority of sequences from NCS. The methanotroph phylotype shared a clade with globally distributed Bathymodiolus spp. symbionts from methane seeps and hydrothermal vents. Two distinct Campylobacterota phylotypes were prevalent in NCS samples, one of which shares a clade with Campylobacterota associated with B. childressi from the Gulf of Mexico and the other with Campylobacterota associated with other deep-sea fauna. Variation in chemosynthetic symbiont communities among sites and individuals has important ecological and geochemical implications and suggests shifting reliance on methanotrophy. Continued characterization of symbionts from cold seeps will provide a greater understanding of the ecology of these unique environments as well and their geochemical footprint in elemental cycling and energy flux."

It is unknown whether VP/VLBW children's frequent mathematic problems significantly add to the burden of negative life-course consequences over and above effects of more general cognitive deficits. Our aim was to determine whether negative consequences of VP/VLBW versus healthy term birth on adult wealth are mediated by mathematic abilities in childhood, or rather explained by more general cognitive abilities.193 VP/VLBW and 217 healthy term comparison participants were studied prospectively from birth to adulthood as part of a geographically defined study in Bavaria (South Germany). Mathematic and general cognitive abilities were assessed at 8 years with standardized tests; wealth information was assessed at 26 years with a structured interview and summarized into a comprehensive index score. All scores were z-standardized.At 8 years, VP/VLBW (n = 193, 52.3% male) had lower mathematic and general cognitive abilities than healthy term comparison children (n = 217, 47.0% male). At 26 years, VP/VLBW had accumulated significantly lower overall wealth than term born comparison adults (-0.57 (1.08) versus -0.01 (1.00), mean difference 0.56 [0.36-0.77], p < .001). Structural equation modeling confirmed that VP/VLBW birth (β = -.13, p = .022) and childhood IQ (β = .24, p < .001) both directly predicted adult wealth, but math did not (β = .05, p = .413). Analyses were controlled for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, child sex, and family socioeconomic status.This longitudinal study from birth to adulthood shows that VP/VLBW survivors' general cognitive rather than specific mathematic problems explain their diminished life-course success. These findings are important in order to design effective interventions at school age that reduce the burden of prematurity for those individuals who were born at highest neonatal risk."

MCI was defined as patients not seeking care in or outside the clinic for at least 18 months, regardless of whether they returned to care after the interruption. The association between MCI and sociodemographic, clinical, and immuno-virological characteristics at HIV diagnosis and during follow-up was assessed using Cox models.The incidence rate of MCI was 2.5 per 100 persons-years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.3-2.7). MCI was more likely in patients who accessed care >6 months after diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.10-1.54 vs. ≤6 months) or did not report a primary care physician (HR = 2.40; 95% CI = 2.03-2.84). MCI was less likely in patients born in sub-Saharan Africa (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.62-0.91 vs. born in France).

Low or no recorded CD4 counts for a medical visit could alert of a higher risk of MCI, even more in patients who accessed HIV care late or did not report a primary care physician."
https://openalex.org/W2921750829,"Stress to fish during harvest in wild capture fisheries is known to negatively influence subsequent survival in catches that are released. Therefore, if fisheries are to be conducted sustainably, there is a need to promote good fish welfare during the capture process. Purse seine fishing is a widespread and efficient fishing method. However, capture and release of fish from purse seines (a process called ""slipping"") can result in extremely high mortality in small pelagic schooling species. The objective of this study was to establish behavioural indicators of sub-lethal stress in Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) that may be used to set safe threshold limits for use in commercial purse seine fishing, in order to ensure good fish welfare and thereby minimise slipping mortality. Controlled mesocosm scale experiments with schools of mackerel in net pens were undertaken to determine behavioural responses to simulated purse seine capture stressors of ""crowding"", ""hypoxia"" and ""crowding & hypoxia"". Crowding (at 30 kg.m-3) was achieved by reducing the volume of the net pen, while hypoxia (to 40% oxygen saturation) was achieved by surrounding the net pen with a tarpaulin bag to prevent water exchange. Using video analysis, we investigated behavioural responses in nearest neighbour distances, nearest neighbour angular deviations, tail beat amplitude and tail beat frequency (TBF). Of the metrics considered, only TBF showed a response; a significant increase to ""crowding"" (42% increase) and ""crowding & hypoxia"" (38% increase) was found. The increase in TBF in response to ""hypoxia"" alone (29% increase) was not significant. We therefore conclude that increases in tail beat frequency may be used as an indicator of sub-lethal purse seine capture stress in mackerel that may have utility in minimising post slipping mortality."

We have identified and analyzed 150 S. Typhimurium from 884 Salmonella genus isolated from humans, domestic animals, poultry, food items and abattoirs origins. The Salmonella isolates were obtained from Iranian National Veterinary Reference Laboratories of 9 provinces during 2007-2016, and from five hospitals in Tehran in 2015. The isolates were evaluated biochemically, serologically, and by PCR amplification of invA, mdh, STM4492, fliC, fljA, fljB, hin genes, IS200 and DT104. invA and mdh genes were used to confirm the S. Typhimurium serotype, fliC and fljB genes for determination of monophasic variants and amplification of IS200 to discriminate the monophasic variants from the closely related serotypes. We identified 78.6% (118/150) as classical S. Typhimurium (fliC, fljB and IS200 positive), 12.6% (19/150) were IS200 negative from all isolates. DT104 is another marker for S.Typhimurium serovar typing. Contrary to EFSA guidelines 20.6% (19/29) of human isolates that lacked IS200 insertion sequence, were confirmed as S.Typhimurium. Compared to the North American/European isolates the low prevalence of fljB negative 6% (9/150) and the high abundance of fliC negative 23.3% (35/150) isolates also were indicative of a different regional atypical population. Studies have shown that the prevalence of monophasic (fljB-) S. Typhimurium worldwide is promoted by the Swine industry. Thus, one reason for this high number of different atypical strains could be inhibition of swine breeding system (house hold and industry) in Iran. These results demonstrate a need for a modified identifying protocol to overcome the regional differences."
https://openalex.org/W2920963644,"This study was conducted to further understand the mechanism that controls myoblast differentiation, a key step in skeletal muscle formation. RNA sequencing of primary bovine myoblasts revealed many genes encoding the ubiquitin-proteasome system were up-regulated during myoblast differentiation. This up-regulation was accompanied by increased proteasomal activity. Treating myoblasts with the proteasome-specific inhibitor lactacystin impeded myoblast differentiation. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) protein inhibited myoblast differentiation too. Further experiments were conducted to determine whether the proteasome promotes myoblast differentiation by degrading ID1 protein. Both ID1 protein and mRNA expression decreased during myoblast differentiation. However, treating myoblasts with lactacystin reversed the decrease in ID1 protein but not in ID1 mRNA expression. Surprisingly, this reversal was not observed when myoblasts were also treated with the mRNA translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Direct incubation of ID1 protein with proteasomes from myoblasts did not show differentiation stage-associated degradation of ID1 protein. Furthermore, ubiquitinated ID1 protein was not detected in lactacystin-treated myoblasts. Overall, the results of this study suggest that, during myoblast differentiation, the proteasomal activity is up-regulated to further myoblast differentiation and that the increased proteasomal activity improves myoblast differentiation partly by inhibiting the synthesis, not the degradation, of ID1 protein.-Leng, X., Ji, X., Hou, Y., Settlage, R., Jiang, H.

It has been shown that the C-terminal FATC domain of human ATM (hATMfatc) can interact with a range of membrane mimetics and may thereby act as a membrane-anchoring unit. Here, NMR structural and 15N relaxation data, NMR data using spin-labeled micelles, and MD simulations of micelle-associated hATMfatc revealed that it binds the micelle by a dynamic assembly of three helices with many residues of hATMfatc located in the headgroup region. We observed that none of the three helices penetrates the micelle deeply or makes significant tertiary contacts to the other helices. NMR-monitored interaction experiments with hATMfatc variants in which two conserved aromatic residues (Phe3049 and Trp3052) were either individually or both replaced by alanine disclosed that the double substitution does not abrogate the interaction with micelles and bicelles at the high concentrations at which these aggregates are typically used, but impairs interactions with small unilamellar vesicles, usually used at much lower lipid concentrations and considered a better mimetic for natural membranes. We conclude that the observed dynamic structure of micelle-associated hATMfatc may enable it to interact with differently composed membranes or membrane-associated interaction partners and thereby regulate ATM’s kinase activity. Moreover, the FATC domain of ATM may function as a membrane-anchoring unit for other biomolecules. The Ser/Thr protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) plays an important role in the DNA damage response, signaling in response to redox signals, the control of metabolic processes, and mitochondrial homeostasis. ATM localizes to the nucleus and at the plasma membrane, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and other cytoplasmic vesicular structures.

https://openalex.org/W2920815304,"Acianthera section Pleurobotryae is one of ten sections of the genus Acianthera and include four species endemic to the Atlantic Forest. The objective of this study was to describe comparatively the anatomy of vegetative organs and floral micromorphology of all species of Acianthera section Pleurobotryae in order to identify diagnostic characters between them and synapomorphies for the section in relation of other sections of the genus. We analyzed roots, ramicauls, leaves and flowers of 15 species, covering eight of the nine sections of Acianthera, using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Acianthera section Pleurobotryae is a monophyletic group and the cladistic analyses of anatomical and flower micromorphology data, combined with molecular data, support internal relationship hypotheses among the representatives of this section. The synapomorphies identified for A. sect. Pleurobotryae are based on leaf anatomy: unifacial leaves, round or elliptical in cross-section, round leaves with vascular bundles organized in concentric circles, and mesophyll with 28 to 30 cell layers. Within the section, the clade (A. crepiniana + A. mantiquyrana) presented more differences in vegetative organ morphology and higher support values in combined analyses when compared to the second clade, (A. atropurpurea + A. hatschbachii). For each of these clades an exclusive set of homoplasies of vegetative and floral organs were also identified. The results support the argument that vegetative organs are more evolutionarily stable in comparison to reproductive organs and thus helpful for inference of internal phylogenetic relationships in Acianthera, while flowers are highly variable, perhaps due to the diversity of pollinator attraction mechanisms. The analyses indicate that the elliptical leaves observed in A. crepiniana have originated from round leaves observed in the other species of this section, suggesting an adaptation to increase the area of exposure of the leaf and better the efficiency of capture of sunlight in shaded environments such as the Atlantic Forest. The presence of papillose regions in both vegetative and floral organs indicated that micromorphological characters are also useful for the delimitation of species and sections within the genus."
https://openalex.org/W2901592996,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have identified recurrent nonsense mutations in the HBV large S (LHBs) gene from the liver from HBV core antigen-positive HCC patients. These nonsense mutants have been shown to be oncogenic in mouse xenograft models using a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line. Here, we expressed in a liver cell line Huh-7 a carboxy terminally truncated protein from a nonsense mutant of the LHBs gene, sW182* (stop codon at tryptophane-182). Although the sW182* protein appeared not to be very stable in the cultured liver cells, we confirmed that the protein can be highly expressed and retained for a prolonged period of time in the hepatocytes in the mouse liver, indicating its stable nature in the physiological condition. In the Huh-7 cells, the sW182* mutant downregulated tumor suppressors p53 and Smad4. This downregulation was reversed by a proteasome inhibitor MG132, implying the involvement of proteasome-based protein degradation in the observed regulation of the tumor suppressors. On the other hand, we found that c-Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) physically interacts with the sW182*, but not wild-type LHBs. RNA interference (RNAi) of Jab1 restored the levels of the downregulated p53 and Smad4. The sW182* mutant inhibited the promoter activity of downstream target genes of the tumor suppressors. Consistently, Jab1 RNAi reversed the inhibition. These results suggest that the LHBs nonsense mutant antagonizes the tumor suppressor pathways through Jab1 in the liver contributing to HCC development."
