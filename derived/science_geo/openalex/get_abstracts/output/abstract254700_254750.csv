https://openalex.org/W2117028091,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls cell growth and proliferation via the raptor-mTOR (TORC1) and rictor-mTOR (TORC2) protein complexes. Recent biochemical studies suggested that TORC2 is the elusive PDK2 for Akt/PKB Ser473 phosphorylation in the hydrophobic motif. Phosphorylation at Ser473, along with Thr308 of its activation loop, is deemed necessary for Akt function, although the regulatory mechanisms and physiological importance of each phosphorylation site remain to be fully understood. Here, we report that SIN1/MIP1 is an essential TORC2/PDK2 subunit. Genetic ablation of sin1 abolished Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation and disrupted rictor-mTOR interaction but maintained Thr308 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, defective Ser473 phosphorylation affected only a subset of Akt targets in vivo, including FoxO1/3a, while other Akt targets, TSC2 and GSK3, and the TORC1 effectors, S6K and 4E-BP1, were unaffected. Our findings reveal that the SIN1-rictor-mTOR function in Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation is required for TORC2 function in cell survival but is dispensable for TORC1 function."

The prevalence of this practice suggests a psychological association between bodily purity and moral purity. In three studies, we explored what we call the “Macbeth effect”—that is, a threat to one's moral purity induces the need to cleanse oneself. This effect revealed itself through an increased mental accessibility of cleansing-related concepts, a greater desire for cleansing products, and a greater likelihood of taking antiseptic wipes. Furthermore, we showed that physical cleansing alleviates the upsetting consequences of unethical behavior and reduces threats to one's moral self-image. Daily hygiene routines such as washing hands, as simple and benign as they might seem, can deliver a powerful antidote to threatened morality, enabling people to truly wash away their sins."
https://openalex.org/W2093041571,"Our understanding of the mechanism of protein synthesis has undergone rapid progress in recent years as a result of low-resolution X-ray and cryo-EM structures of ribosome functional complexes and high-resolution structures of ribosomal subunits and vacant ribosomes. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome containing a model mRNA and two tRNAs at 3.7 A resolution. Many structural details of the interactions between the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA in the P and E sites and the ways in which tRNA structure is distorted by its interactions with the ribosome are seen. Differences between the conformations of vacant and tRNA-bound 70S ribosomes suggest an induced fit of the ribosome structure in response to tRNA binding, including significant changes in the peptidyl-transferase catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W2107632694,"Yeast is a widely used recombinant protein expression system. We expanded its utility by engineering the yeast Pichia pastoris to secrete human glycoproteins with fully complex terminally sialylated N-glycans. After the knockout of four genes to eliminate yeast-specific glycosylation, we introduced 14 heterologous genes, allowing us to replicate the sequential steps of human glycosylation. The reported cell lines produce complex glycoproteins with greater than 90% terminal sialylation. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of these yeast strains, functional recombinant erythropoietin was produced."
https://openalex.org/W1979089304,"Demonstration of quantum entanglement, a key resource in quantum computation arising from a nonclassical correlation of states, requires complete measurement of all states in varying bases. By using simultaneous measurement and state tomography, we demonstrated entanglement between two solid-state qubits. Single qubit operations and capacitive coupling between two super-conducting phase qubits were used to generate a Bell-type state. Full two-qubit tomography yielded a density matrix showing an entangled state with fidelity up to 87%. Our results demonstrate a high degree of unitary control of the system, indicating that larger implementations are within reach."
https://openalex.org/W2063333127,"The history of Eastern African hominids has been linked to a progressive increase of open grassland during the past 8 million years. This trend was explained by global climatic processes, which do not account for the massive uplift of eastern African topography that occurred during this period. Atmosphere and biosphere simulations quantify the role played by these tectonic events. The reduced topographic barrier before 8 million years ago permitted a zonal circulation with associated moisture transport and strong precipitation. Our results suggest that the uplift itself led to a drastic reorganization of atmospheric circulation, engendering the strong aridification and paleoenvironmental changes suggested by the data."
https://openalex.org/W1976270468,"Humans and animals can nonverbally enumerate visual items across time in a sequence or rapidly estimate the set size of spatial dot patterns at a single glance. We found that temporal and spatial enumeration processes engaged different populations of neurons in the intraparietal sulcus of behaving monkeys. Once the enumeration process was completed, however, another neuronal population represented the cardinality of a set irrespective of whether it had been cued in a spatial layout or across time. These data suggest distinct neural processing stages for different numerical formats, but also a final convergence of the segregated information to form most abstract quantity representations."
https://openalex.org/W2144554317,"Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway in eukaryotic cells whereby the lack of amino acids induces the formation of autophagosomes, double-bilayer membrane vesicles that mediate delivery of cytosolic proteins and organelles for lysosomal degradation. The biogenesis and turnover of autophagosomes in mammalian cells as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying induction of autophagy and trafficking of these vesicles are poorly understood. Here we utilized different autophagic markers to determine the involvement of microtubules in the autophagic process. We show that autophagosomes associate with microtubules and concentrate near the microtubule-organizing center. Moreover, we demonstrate that autophagosomes, but not phagophores, move along these tracks en route for degradation. Disruption of microtubules leads to a significant reduction in the number of mature autophagosomes but does not affect their life span or their fusion with lysosomes. We propose that microtubules serve to deliver only mature autophagosomes for degradation, thus providing a spatial barrier between phagophores and lysosomes.

We propose that microtubules serve to deliver only mature autophagosomes for degradation, thus providing a spatial barrier between phagophores and lysosomes. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal pathway involved in degradation of long lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles. This process, which is essential for normal turnover of cellular compartments, is up-regulated in response to nutrient starvation. Autophagy starts with the sequestration of cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles such as mitochondria, by a membrane sac known as the isolation membrane (phagophore). Closure of the isolation membrane results in the formation of a double-bilayer membrane vesicle, called the autophagosome (1Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Following movement and targeting to lysosomes, the autophagosome outer membrane fuses with the lysosome/vacuole, releasing a single membrane vesicle (autophagic body) into this compartment to generate an autolysosome. Finally, the sequestered contents and the inner membrane are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. The exact origin of autophagosomes is yet unknown. Recently, however, de novo formation by nucleation, i.e. assembly and elongation of small membrane structures, has been proposed (2Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 231-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying autophagy was first characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system (4Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev.

These studies led to the identification of a novel set of Atg (autophagy-related) factors, some of which are evolutionarily conserved (6Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn W.A. Emr Jr., S.D. Sakai Y.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, Atg12 and Atg8, participate in the early stages of autophagy (5Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Atg12p is conjugated to Atg5p by Atg7p, an ubiquitin-activating-like enzyme, and by Atg10p, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The resultant Atg5/12p conjugate, in complex with Atg16, associates with the autophagic membrane and detaches from it immediately upon completion of autophagosome formation (10Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 11Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M.

Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The other ubiquitin-like protein, Atg8p, is first cleaved by Atg4p, a specific cysteine protease, thereby exposing a glycine residue (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Atg8p is then activated by Atg7p, the same ubiquitin-activating enzyme that activates Atg12p, and by Atg3p, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme specific for Atg8p (13Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Finally, the C-terminal glycine of Atg8p is conjugated via an amide bond to the amino group of the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (14Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). The yeast Atg8p is highly homologous to several mammalian proteins, including MAP1-LC3 (LC3), GATE-16, and GABARAP (15Mann S.S. Hammarback J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11492-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W.

The modification of LC3 at its C terminus, like that of Atg8p, is an essential step for the formation of autophagosomes (10Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 18Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). The mammalian Atg4B protease has been recently reported to cleave LC3, exposing its C-terminal glycine 120 (19Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). This form of LC3, termed LC3-I, is further modified into a membrane-bound form, LC3-II, by the mammalian Atg7p and Atg3p (2Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Komatsu M. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13739-13744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although implicated in different intracellular membrane trafficking pathways, all three mammalian homologues of Atg8p are processed by Atg4p proteases and by Atg7p and Atg3p conjugation machineries (19Kabeya Y.

Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). LC3 has been shown to be incorporated specifically into autophagic vesicles under conditions that induce autophagy, thus serving as the first bona fide marker for autophagosomes in mammalian cells (18Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar, 23Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M.

Autophagy. 2005; 1: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Despite significant progress in identifying the molecular components that participate in autophagy, little is known about intracellular routes and dynamics of autophagosomes in mammals. Hence, the kinetics of autophagosome formation and delivery, their exact en route movement to lysosomes, and the rate-limiting steps in this process remain unclear. The involvement of microtubules in autophagy in mammalian cells is under a considerable debate. Treatment of cells with vinblastine, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, has been found in many studies to increase the number of autophagosomes (25Fengsrud M. Roos N. Berg T. Liou W. Slot J.W. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 504-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Punnonen E.L. Reunanen H. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1990; 52: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 28Seglen P.O. Berg T.O. Blankson H. Fengsrud M. Holen I. Stromhaug P.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the level of LC3-II (18Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar, 27Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This accumulation was viewed in some reports (25Fengsrud M. Roos N. Berg T. Liou W. Slot J.W. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 504-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) as a failure of microtubules to facilitate assembly and fusion of autophagosomes with the lysosomes. In contrast to this view, in Ehrlich ascites cells, vinblastine did not prevent the entry of hydrolases to autophagosomes (26Punnonen E.L. Reunanen H. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1990; 52: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but rather accelerated the rate of autophagosome formation (29Reunanen H. Marttinen M. Hirsimaki P. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1988; 48: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Studies using other microtubule-depolymerizing agents, such as nocodazole or colchicine, were also inconsistent with these findings. Hence, nocodazole has been reported to elevate the number of autophagosomes and inhibit autophagy-mediated protein degradation in normal rat kidney cells (30Aplin A. Jasionowski T. Tuttle D.L. Lenk S.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 152: 458-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Likewise, most recently it has been reported that vinblastine as well as nocodazole inhibit fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes (27Kochl R. Hu X.W. Chan E.Y. Tooze S.A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) suggesting that intact microtubules contribute to autophagosome targeting. Others have shown, however, that nocodazole had no effect on fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (29Reunanen H. Marttinen M. Hirsimaki P. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1988; 48: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consistently, Kabeya et al. (18Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar) reported that nocodazole or colchicine (but not vinblastine) does not elevate the level of autophagosomes. In this study, we utilized different autophagic markers to identify phagophores, autophagosomes, and autolysosomes under normal growth and starvation conditions. We found that autophagosomes, unlike phagophores, associate with and move along microtubules. Our data indicate that intact microtubules are not essential for targeting and fusion with lysosomes. Moreover, autophagosomes can be formed in the absence of intact microtubules but to a significantly lower extent. We propose that microtubules facilitate autophagosome formation and serve to direct mature autophagosomes for degradation in lysosomes. Antibodies and Reagents—Minimal essential medium (MEMα), 3The abbreviations used are: MEMα, minimal essential medium α; EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution; FCS, fetal calf serum; taxol, paclitaxel; Baf A, bafilomycin A1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS), valine-free MEMα, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were obtained from Biological Industries (Beit Haemek Laboratories, Israel). Nocodazole, paclitaxel (taxol), and bafilomycin A1 (Baf A) were provided by Sigma. l-[U-14C]Valine was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin and anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma); rabbit polyclonal anti-Atg16 was a kind gift of Noboru Mizushima (Department of Cell Biology, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan); mouse monoclonal anti-LAMPI (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa); mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescence protein (GFP) (Babco); rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG; Cy™5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG; Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch); and horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat antibody against mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). LysoTracker Red DND-99 was obtained from Molecular Probes. pEYFP-Atg5 was a kind gift of Noboru Mizushima. Anti-LC3 antibody was produced by immunization of a rabbit with a peptide corresponding to the 14 amino acids of the N terminus of LC3 with an additional cysteine (PSEKTFKQRRTFEQC). DNA Construction—DNA encoding human LC3 was obtained by PCR from the total cDNA of LNCaP cells with LC3 sense primer 5′-CAACAAGCTTCGATGCCGTCGGAGAAGACC-3′ and LC3 antisense primer 5′-CAATAGATCTCGAGCGGCCGCTTACACTGACAATTTCATCCCG-3′. To obtain pGFP-LC3, LC3 DNA was cleaved at HindIII and XhoI sites and inserted into the HindIII and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1, a GFP fusion protein expression vector (Clontech). The point mutation for glycine to alanine at position 120 of LC3 (LC3G120A) was created by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using LC3 sense primer 5′-CAGGAGACGTTCGCGATGAAATTGTCA-3′ and LC3 antisense primer 5′-TGACAATTTCATCGCGGACGTCTCCTG-3′. Cathepsin-D-GFP was constructed by inserting human cathepsin D into the N terminus of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) at SalI and EcoRI sites. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and HeLa cells were grown on MEMα supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection of cells was performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 4 μl of Lipofectamine/μg of DNA. Stable clones of GFP-LC3-transfected cells were selected in 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418). All the data presented here was derived from at least three different clones of each cell line. Starvation and Drug Treatment—To obtain starvation conditions, cells were washed three times by PBS and incubated in EBSS medium at 37 °C for different time periods. To examine the recovery of cells from starvation, cells incubated in EBSS for 2 h were transferred to MEMα, 10% FCS for 40 min at 37 °C. In cells treated with nocodazole or taxol, a pretreatment period of 30 min was applied to ascertain that the experiments are carried out following the effect on microtubules. Drugs were applied at the following final concentrations: 5 μg/ml nocodazole, 100 nm wortmannin, 100 nm Baf A, or 20 μm taxol. Fluorescence Microscopy—CHO cells were plated on sterile coverslips (13 mm diameter) and cultured under the conditions indicated, fixed with cold methanol for 5 min at -20 °C, and permeabilized by quick washing with cold acetone. Cells were blocked by incubation with 10% FCS in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by1hof incubation with the primary antibody. Cells were then incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min. For fluorescence imaging, a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a GFP filter (HQ FITC 41001) and Hamamatsu digital camera C4742-95 was used. A fluorescence filter was used to observe rhodamine (excitation 543 nm, mirror, emission 560-600 nm), Cy™5 (excitation 633 nm, dichroic 630 nm, emission 660 nm), and GFP (excitation 488, dichroic 560 nm, emission 505-525 nm). Confocal images were taken by a FV500 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a PLAPO 60 × 1.4 NA oil immersion lens and Fluoview software (Olympus). Movement of GFP-LC3 labeled autophagosomes was monitored using Olympus IX-70 confocal microscope with UPLAPO 40 × 0.85 NA. Cells were kept at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, in a micro-incubator (PDMI-2, Harvard Apparatus). All images were done at a rate of 1 frame every 10 s. Each experiment was performed at least five times, and representative images or movies of typical cells are depicted in the different figures. For quantitative analysis of the formation of autophagosomes, cells expressing GFP-LC3 were incubated under normal growth or starvation conditions in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm Baf A. The number of autophagosomes per cell was determined by confocal microscopy at different times. The number of slices and their width were designed so that the entire cell was covered and that autophagosomes do not appear more than once. Each point represents the average ± S.D. obtained from ∼60 cells. The counting was performed manually and validated by more than one person. Electron Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 0.3% glutaraldehyde, 0.3% paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buffer (cacodylate 0.1 m, pH 7.4). The fixative was rinsed twice with cacodylate buffer, and samples were dyed in 1% OsO4, 0.3% potassium dichromate, and 0.3% potassium ferrocyanide for 1-2 h followed by 1.5-2 h of incubation with 2% filtered uranyl acetate in H2O. Ethanol was used for gradual dehydration of the samples and Epon for their embedding. To dissolve the glass coverslips, the Epon-embedded samples were incubated for 2 h in 20% hydrofluoric acid. Sections of 70-100 nm were viewed by transmission electron microscopy (Technai-12; Phillips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Subcellular Fractionation—For cytosol and total membrane analysis, cells were grown in 100-mm diameter dishes, washed, and removed by a cell scraper. After resuspension in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin), cells were homogenized by Dounce homogenizer on ice. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by low speed centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 5 min), and the supernatant was centrifuged in TLA 100.2 (60,000 rpm, 30 min) for cytosol and total membrane fractions. Fractions were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blot. All immunoblots in this study are representatives of at least three experiments. For membrane flotation in the sucrose gradient, CHO cells were grown in suspension to ∼0.5 × 106 cell/ml (3 liters), collected by centrifugation at low speed (2000 rpm for 6 min), resuspended in 4 pellet volumes of homogenization buffer, and homogenized as described previously (43Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29233-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Unbroken cells were removed from the cell homogenate by centrifugation at 700 × g for 6 min. Cell homogenate was adjusted to 2 m sucrose and placed at the bottom of SW-28 tubes, followed by overlaying with layers of 1.75, 1.5, 1.25, 1, and 0.75 m sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C in SW-28 rotor (Beckman) at 25,000 rpm overnight with slow acceleration and deceleration. Fractions were collected continuously from the top of the gradient, and densities of the fractions were calculated from the refractive indices. From each fraction, 100-μl samples were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, and pellets were analyzed by Western blot. Determination of Autophagosome Life Span—From the slope of the graphs obtained under control (Fig. 7A) conditions in the presence of Baf A, we calculated that the average time interval between successive autophagosome formation events is ∼3.3 min. In the absence of Baf A, the average number of autophagosomes per cell remains constant and is equal to 9.8. Therefore, the autophagosome population is in a state of equilibrium (equal rates of autophagosome formation and degradation). Thus, successive degradation events also occur every 3.3 min, on average. The remaining information needed to calculate the autophagosome life span is the average number (hereby labeled X) of degradation events occurring between the formation of a given autophagosome and its degradation. A simple calculation shows that X is a geometric random variable whose average is 9.8 (44Hamming R.W. The Art of Probability for Scientist and Engineers. Addison-Wesley, Redwood City, CA1991: 145-146Google Scholar); that is, following the formation of a given autophagosome, 9.8 degradation events of other autophagosomes occur on average before our autophagosome is degraded. Thus, the average autophagosome life span under control conditions is 9.8 × 3.3 ≈32.7 min. Similarly, from the slope of the graph obtained under starvation conditions in the presence of Baf A (Fig. 7B), we infer that the average time interval between successive autophagosome formation events is 1.22 min. Therefore, when the autophagosome population reaches equilibrium, the time interval between successive degradation events is also ∼1.22 min. From the graph in Fig. 7B, we deduced that under starvation conditions equilibrium is reached after 60 min with ∼28 autophagosomes per cell. Then, as above, the average of X is 28, and the average life span of an autophagosome is ∼28 × 1.22 ≈34.2 min. (As summarized in Table 1, these calculations were done as well under nocodazole treatment.)TABLE 1Rate of formation and average life span of autophagosomes under different growth conditionsTreatmentAut/cell at steady stateFormation rateLife spanaut/minminCon9.8 ± 3.20.3032.3Con + noc8.1 ± 3.30.2631.6st28.5 ± 3.5ap < 0.005.0.8234.8st + noc21.6 ± 5.8ap < 0.005.0.6632.8a p < 0.005. Open table in a new tab Protease Protection Assay—Autophagic vacuole fractions were prepared by a sucrose gradient as described above. To concentrate the membranes, fractions were diluted with reaction buffer (Tris 10 mm, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose), centrifuged at 90,000 rpm for 30 min, and pellets were resuspended in reaction buffer. For the protease protection assay, membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction buffer containing 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 0.4% Triton X-100. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 20 μm at 4 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibody against GFP. Degradation of Long Lived Proteins—Degradation of long lived proteins was performed according to standard protocol (10Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). CHO cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were grown to 70-80% confluence in 6-well plates (35 mm). Cells were then labeled for 14 h in medium containing [14C]valine (0.5 μCi/ml) and 5% FCS in valine-free MEMα. After three rinses with PBS, cells were incubated in either valine-free MEMα or EBSS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm cold valine. When required, 5, 15, or 25 μg/ml nocodazole, 100 nm wortmannin, 100 nm bafilomycin A, or 10 μm 3-methyladenine was added. After the 1-h incubation, the medium was replaced with identical fresh medium, and cells were incubated for additional 4 h. The medium was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity was measured. Total cell radioactivity was measured after lysis with 0.1 m NaOH. [14C]Valine release was calculated as a percentage of the radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble supernatant relative to the total cell radioactivity. Lipidated GFP-LC3 Is Associated with Microtubules under Normal Growth and Starvation Conditions—To characterize the dynamics and intracellular route taken by autophagosomes in living cells, we established a CHO cell line that stably expresses GFP fused to the N terminus of LC3. The localization of GFP-LC3 in living cells was followed by confocal microscopy analysis. Under normal growth conditions (MEMα), most GFP-LC3 was found dispersed in the cytosol, although a significant fraction (resembling a mixture of vesicles and microtubule-like structures) was concentrated at the juxtanuclear region (Fig. 1A). When cells were transferred to a starvation medium (EBSS) to induce autophagy, GFP-LC3-labeled autophagosomes appeared in the cytoplasm within 30 min, peaking after about 1 h of incubation (Fig. 1A). These vesicles were also concentrated at the juxtanuclear region. In agreement with previous reports (10Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 18Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar), the change in cellular localization of LC3 was accompanied by the formation of LC3-II, the membrane-bound form of LC3 (Fig. 1B). Notably, the ratio of cytosol (supernatant) to membrane-bound (pellet) endogenous LC3 was similar to that found for GFP-LC3 (Fig. 1B). Previous studies showed that mutation of glycine at position 120 prevents the C-terminal cleavage and, consequentially, conjugation of LC3 to the autophagosomal membrane (19Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Oshitani-Okamoto S. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Under normal growth conditions, GFP-LC3G120A was evenly distributed throughout the cell, unlike the juxtanuclear localization of GFP-LC3wt (see supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the subcellular localization of GFP-LC3 is dependent on processing of its C-terminal region both under normal growth and starvation conditions. To further characterize the change observed in GFP-LC3 localization, the profile of membranes associated with GFP-LC3 was determined in cell homogenates, separated by flotation on a sucrose density gradient (Fig. 1C). Wild-type GFP-LC3-I was obtained predominantly from the original loading fraction (Fig. 1C, upper left panels, lane 1), whereas only a small proportion of GFP-LC3-I was associated with dense fractions, containing endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). Wild-type GFP-LC3 obtained from starved cells showed a dramatic shift in its fractionation profile. A large amount of the protein, consisting only of the lipidated form GFP-LC3-II, cofractionated with Golgi membranes in the light sucrose fractions (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). Consistently, the endogenous LC3-I and LC3-II, identified by specific anti-LC3 antibodies, were fractionated similarly to GFP-LC3 (data not shown). The fractionation profile of the mutant GFP-LC3G120A was similar to that of the wild-type GFP-LC3-I and did not change upon starvation (Fig. 1C, right panels). We next examined the involvement of microtubules in the localization of GFP-LC3 under different growth conditions. To this end, cells expressing GFP-LC3 were grown in the presence (Fig. 2A) or absence (Fig. 2B) of amino acids, and microtubules were visualized with anti-α-tubulin antibodies. Under amino acid-rich conditions, GFP-LC3 was associated with the minus ends of microtubules, which were also immunostained by anti-γ-tubulin antibodies (Fig. 2A). To examine whether intact microtubules are essential for this localization, cells were pretreated with nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent. Within 1"

In certain Drosophila melanogaster-D. simulans hybrids, hybrid male sterility is caused by the lack of a single-copy gene essential for male fertility, JYAlpha. This gene is located on the fourth chromosome of D. melanogaster but on the third chromosome of D. simulans. Genomic and molecular analyses show that JYAlpha transposed to the third chromosome during the evolutionary history of the D. simulans lineage. Because of this transposition, a fraction of hybrids completely lack JYAlpha and are sterile, representing reproductive isolation without sequence evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2132972924,CD8-positive T lymphocytes recognize peptides that are usually derived from the degradation of cellular proteins and are presented by class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. Here we describe a human minor histocompatibility antigen created by a polymorphism in the SP110 nuclear phosphoprotein gene. The antigenic peptide comprises two noncontiguous SP110 peptide segments spliced together in reverse order to that in which they occur in the predicted SP110 protein. The antigenic peptide could be produced in vitro by incubation of precursor peptides with highly purified 20 S proteasomes. Cutting and splicing probably occur within the proteasome by transpeptidation.
https://openalex.org/W2017885675,"Jasmonic acid (JA) is a lipid-derived signal that regulates a wide variety of developmental and defense-related processes in higher plants. JA is synthesized from linolenic acid via an enzymatic pathway that initiates in the plastid and terminates in peroxisomes. The C18 JA precursor 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) is converted in the peroxisome to 3-oxo-2-(2′-[Z]-pentenyl)cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0), which subsequently undergoes three rounds of β-oxidation to yield JA. Although most JA biosynthetic enzymes have been identified, several key steps in the pathway remain to be elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, we employed co-expression analysis to identify genes that are coordinately regulated with known JA biosynthetic components in Arabidopsis. Among the candidate genes uncovered by this approach was a 4-coumarate-CoA ligase-like member of the acyl-activating enzyme (AAE) gene family, which we have named OPC-8:0 CoA Ligase1 (OPCL1). In response to wounding, opcl1 null mutants exhibited reduced levels of JA and hyperaccumulation of OPC-8:0. Recombinant OPCL1 was active against both OPDA and OPC-8:0, as well as medium-to-long straight-chain fatty acids. Subcellular localization studies with green fluorescent protein-tagged OPCL1 showed that the protein is targeted to peroxisomes. These findings establish a physiological role for OPCL1 in the activation of JA biosynthetic precursors in leaf peroxisomes, and further indicate that OPC-8:0 is a physiological substrate for the activation step.

Oxylipins comprise a group of potent signaling molecules that are derived from oxidative metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In both animals and higher plants, oxylipins are synthesized in response to developmental and environmental cues and serve important roles in controlling diverse physiological processes. Members of the prostanoid family of lipid mediators have been studied extensively with respect to their synthesis from arachidonic acid and their function in the regulation of cell differentiation, immune responses, and homeostasis in animal systems (1Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). The study of plant oxylipins has been focused mainly on the jasmonate family of signaling compounds that includes jasmonic acid (JA) 2The abbreviations used are: JA, jasmonic acid; dhJA, dihydrojasmonic acid; OPDA, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid; dnOPDA, dinor-OPDA; AOS, allene oxide synthase; OPC-8:0, 3-oxo-2-(2′-[Z]-pentenyl)cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid; AAE, acyl-activating enzyme; WT, wild type; F, forward; R, reverse; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; LACS, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase; ACX, acyl-CoA oxidase. and its bioactive precursors and derivatives. Genetic analysis has shown that endogenous jasmonates regulate a wide range of developmental processes including root growth, pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, seed production, and glandular trichome development (2Wallis J.G.

In addition, it is well established that jasmonates play a central role in regulating plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress (2Wallis J.G. Browse J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 254-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 5Gfeller A. Farmer E.E. Science. 2004; 306: 1515-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Halitschke R. Baldwin I.T.

Plant Physiol. 2006; 163: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of JA from linolenic acid (18:3) is initiated in plastids and terminated in peroxisomes (10Vick B. Zimmerman D. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 458-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipases that release 18:3 from plastid lipids are thought to play an important role in regulating the pathway in response to environmental and developmental cues (11Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 129-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ishiguro S. Kawai-Oda A. Ueda J. Nishida I. Okada K.

The first step in the conversion of 18:3 to JA is catalyzed by 13-lipoxygenase. The resulting 13-hydroperoxy fatty acid is transformed to 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) by the sequential action of allene oxide synthase (AOS) and allene oxide cyclase (AOC). A parallel series of reactions converts hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3) to dinor-OPDA (dnOPDA), which is also a JA precursor (14Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). That large pools of OPDA/dnOPDA are esterified to chloroplast glycerolipids raises the possibility that JA synthesis is controlled, at least in part, by lipases that release these intermediates from plastid lipids (15Stelmach B.A. Muller A.

Very little is known about the mechanism of plastid-to-peroxisome trafficking of JA precursors. Evidence indicates that the ATP-binding cassette transporter PXA1 (also known as CTS1 and PED3) is involved in import of OPDA into peroxisomes (17Theodoulou F.L. Job K. Slocombe S.P. Footitt S. Holdsworth M. Baker A. Larson T.R. Graham I.A. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal enzyme OPDA reductase (OPR3) converts OPDA to 3-oxo-2-(2′-[Z]-pentenyl)cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0) (18Schaller F. Biesgen C. Mussig C. Altmann T. Weiler E.W.

Plant J. 2002; 32: 585-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the final steps of the pathway, three cycles of β-oxidation remove six carbons from the carboxyl side chain of OPC-8:0 to yield JA. In contrast to the general role of β-oxidation in the degradation of arachidonic acid-derived signals in animals, it is now clear that these catabolic reactions are essential for production of bioactive jasmonates that promote plant developmental and defensive processes (2Wallis J.G. Browse J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 254-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Schilmiller A.L. Howe G.A. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Moreover, increasing evidence indicates that JA-modifying enzymes such as JA-amido synthetase (i.e. JAR1) and JA methyltransferase play an important role in altering the biological activity of the hormone following its synthesis in peroxisomes (20Staswick P.E. Tiryaki I. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 21Seo H.S. Song J.T. Cheong J.J. Lee Y.H. Lee Y.W. Hwang I. Lee J.S. Choi Y.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4788-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In addition to JA and its derivatives, C18 biosynthetic precursors such as OPDA exhibit potent biological activity. Among the physiological processes that are proposed to be regulated by endogenous OPDA are the tendril-coiling response of Bryonia (22Weiler E.W. Albrecht T. Groth B. Xia Z.Q. Luxem M. Liss H. Andert L. Spengler P. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 591-600Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar), production of various secondary metabolites (23Koch T. Krumm T. Jung V. Engelberth J. Boland W.

A. 2001; 98: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that exogenous OPDA and JA activate the expression of overlapping but distinct sets of target genes (25Stintzi A. Weber H. Reymond P. Browse J. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 26Taki N. Sasaki-Sekimoto Y. Obayashi T. Kikuta A. Kobayashi K. Ainai T. Yagi K. Sakurai N. Suzuki H. Masuda T. Takamiya K. Shibata D. Kobayashi Y. Ohta H. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1268-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the idea that diverse jasmonate-signaled responses are controlled by the relative abundance of multiple bioactive compounds including OPDA/dnOPDA, JA, and various derivatives of JA (14Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Our current knowledge of the biochemical and cellular processes that determine this so-called oxylipin signature is still in its infancy. Greater insight into this question will require identification of the complete repertoire of enzymes that promote jasmonate synthesis, as well as an understanding of how these components are regulated. Co-expression analysis has emerged as a powerful tool in the search for plant genes that participate in complex biological processes (27Toufighi K. Brady S.M. Austin R. Ly E. Provart N.J. Plant J. 2005; 43: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 28Persson S. Wei H.R. Milne J. Page G.P. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The fact that many JA biosynthetic genes are coordinately regulated in response to developmental and stress-related cues (31Reymond P. Weber H. Damond M. Farmer E.E.

Here, we report the use of data-mining tools to identify genes in Arabidopsis that are co-expressed with known JA biosynthetic components. Among the candidate genes singled out by this approach was a member of the large family of ATP-dependent acyl-activating enzymes (AAEs) that metabolize a wide range of carboxylic acid substrates. We provide a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cellular evidence indicating that the enzyme encoded by this gene, which was not previously implicated in JA synthesis, catalyzes the formation of CoA derivatives of jasmonate precursors in leaf peroxisomes. We also provide direct evidence that OPC-8:0 is the physiological substrate for the activation step that immediately precedes β-oxidation. Biological Material—Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chambers maintained at 22 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h light (100 μmol photons m-2 s-1) and 8 h dark. Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as wild type (WT) for all experiments. All T-DNA insertion lines used in this study were identified from the Sequence-Indexed Library of Insertion Mutations. Seed stock identifiers for the T-DNA insertion lines were as follows: At4g05160, SALK_050214; At5g63380, SALK_003233; At1g20510, SALK_140659 (corresponds to opcl1-1); and At1g20510, SALK_107614 (corresponds to opcl1-2). Seed stocks were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Homozygous knock-out lines were selected by PCR-based screening for both the presence of T-DNA insertion and the absence of an intact endogenous gene. PCR reactions to detect the intact endogenous gene were performed with the following forward (F) and reverse (R) gene-specific primer sets: At4g05160, 5′-AGACACCGTAGAGATTCCTC-3′ (1F) and 5′-ATGTGTTCGGACGTGGAATC-3′ (1R); At5g63380, 5′-GGCTCATTGCTTCTCAAGGC-3′ (2F) and 5′-GGAACGCAACGACCGGAGAT-3′ (2R); At1g20510 (opcl1-1), 5′-TCATCGACGCTTCCACAGGT-3′ (3F) and 5′-GAGTCGAACTCGTAGCTTCC-3′ (3R); and At1g20510 (opcl1-2), 5′-TCCGGTTACTGGTCAGATTCTTGG-3′ (3-2F) and 5′-TGGTCATATTTCAACATGGATGCA-3′ (3-2R). PCR reactions to detect the T-DNA insert in each mutant line were performed with the T-DNA left border primer (LBb1, 5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) and the gene-specific primer indicated in supplemental Fig. S1. PCR analysis confirmed the homozygosity of the T-DNA insert in all mutant lines. RNA Blot Analysis—Rosette leaves from 4-week-old plants were either wounded twice across the mid-vein with a hemostat or sprayed with JA (25 ml of a 50 μm solution per 24 plants). Tissue (1 g fresh weight) was collected at the indicated time points and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were performed according to the procedure described by Li et al. (34Li C. Schilmiller A.L. Liu G. Lee G.I. Jayanty S. Sageman C. Vrebalov J. Giovannoni J.J.

Gene-specific probes were prepared by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA clones for At1g20510 (OPCL1; U09223), At4g05160 (U19441), At5g-63380 (U24744), OPR3 (U13428), and Actin-8 (At1g49240). cDNA clones for OPCL1, At4g05160, At5g63380, and OPR3 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. For other probes, PCR amplification was performed with Arabidopsis genomic DNA as template. Forward and reverse PCR primers used to generate these probes were as follows: At4g05160, 5′-AATCCGGCTACGGCAGAGAC-3′ (F) and 5′-TTCAACACCTGGAGCAAGCA-3′ (R); At5g63380, 5′-GAGCTCCGGCTTCGATCAAC-3′ (F) and 5′-GGAACGCAACGACCGGAGAT-3′ (R); At1g20510, 5′-CCAATGGCATACGTCGTAAG-3′ (F2) and 5′-ACTGCCATAATCAATCTGAG-3′ (R2); At1g20480, 5′-AAAGCATGCATGGCGGTTAAGCACGGCGT-3′ (F) and 5′-TCCAGCCACCACAGTGTGCAAC-3′ (R); At1g20490, 5′-TGTTGTGGATCGACTGAAAG-3′ (F) and 5′-TGTACAATGCACAAAAGAAACA-3′ (R); At1g20500, 5′-TAGTTTTTGCTTTGCTTGCG-3′ (F) and 5′-TTCACACTAGTCCAAAAACCAT-3′ (R); At5g38120, 5′-GATCTAATCAAATTTGCCATTT-3′ (F) and 5′-GCTCACAACACATGCTACAC-3′ (R); OPR3, XhoI 5′-GGGCTCGAGATGACGGCGGCACAAGGGAA-3′ (F) and SpeI, 5′-CCCACTAGTTCAGAGGCGGGAAAAAGGAG-3′ (R). Jasmonate Measurements—Rosette leaves were wounded and harvested for jasmonate determinations as described above. Fresh leaf tissue (100-200 mg) was transferred to a Fast-prep tube (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) containing Zirmil beads (Saint-Gobain ZirPro, Mountainside, NJ) and 50 ng of dihydrojasmonic acid (dhJA) as an internal standard. Tubes were capped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until extraction. Jasmonates were extracted and analyzed according to the vapor-phase extraction procedure (35Schmelz E.A. Engelberth J. Tumlinson J.H. Block A. Alborn H.T. Plant J. 2004; 39: 790-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), with minor modifications as described previously (34Li C. Schilmiller A.L. Liu G. Lee G.I. Jayanty S. Sageman C. Vrebalov J. Giovannoni J.J. Yagi K. Kobayashi Y. Howe G.A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 971-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Endogenous JA levels were quantified using a calibration curve for comparing detector responses of MeJA and dhMeJA (36Mueller M.J. Mene-Saffrane L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The combined peak area of the cis and trans isomers of each compound was used for quantification. Because recovery of the dhJA internal standard may not accurately reflect the recovery of ODPA and OPC-8:0 from plant tissue, levels of OPDA and OPC-8:0 were expressed as a relative quantity rather than as an absolute value. Specifically, the relative level of OPDA in extracts from WT and opcl1 plants was calculated by dividing the total GC peak area (cis and trans isomers) of OPDA by the total peak area of the dhJA internal standard. Similarly, the relative level of OPC-8:0 in the extracts was calculated by dividing the total GC peak area (cis and trans isomers) of OPC-8:0 by the peak area of the dhJA. The m/z of [M + H]+ ions and retention times of analyzed methyl esters were as follows: JA (m/z = 225), 7.62 and 8.17 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively; dhJA (m/z = 227), 7.68 and 8.20 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively; OPDA (m/z = 307), 34.69 and 35.22 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively; OPC-8:0 (m/z = 309), 33.45 and 34.17 min for trans and cis isomers, respectively. dhJA was synthesized from JA (Sigma) according to the platinum-catalyzed reduction method (36Mueller M.J. Mene-Saffrane L. Grun C. Karg K. Farmer E.E. Plant J. 2006; 45: 472-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Authentic standards for OPDA and OPC-8:0 were chemically synthesized as previously described (37Ainai T. Matsuumi M. Kobayashi Y. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 7825-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant OPCL1—A full-length OPCL1 cDNA clone was PCR-amplified with the primer set of BamHI (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCTTCAGTGAATTCTCG-3′ (F); BamHI site underlined) and SalI (5′-AAAGTCGACTCAAAGCTTGGAGTTGGAAG-3′ (R); SalI site underlined). The resulting 1641-bp PCR product was ligated into the BamHI and SalI restriction sites of pQE30 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). This construct adds 12 amino acids (MRGSHHHHHHGS), including a hexahistidine tag, to the N terminus of OPCL1. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15 competent cells (Qiagen). Expression and purification of recombinant OPCL1 were performed according to the procedure described by Li et al. (34Li C. Schilmiller A.L. Liu G. Lee G.I. Jayanty S. Sageman C. Vrebalov J. Giovannoni J.J. Yagi K. Kobayashi Y. Howe G.A. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 971-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A minor modification was that the lysis buffer contained 300 mm NaCl, complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (five tablets per 40 ml of buffer; Roche Applied Science) and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. Protein measurements were performed with the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of recombinant OPCL1 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was estimated to be >95%. Measurement of Acyl-CoA Synthetase Activity—We measured acyl-CoA synthetase activity of recombinant OPCL1 using the coupled enzyme assay (38Ziegler K. Braun K. Bockler A. Fuchs G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 62-69Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with modifications described by Schneider et al. (39Schneider K. Kienow L. Schmelzer E. Colby T. Bartsch M. Miersch O. Wasternack C. Kombrink E. Stuible H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13962-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fatty acid substrates were converted to their ammonium salts by addition of a few drops of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The resulting solutions were dried under a stream of N2 gas. These stock solutions were diluted in Triton X-100 and added to the enzyme reaction mixture to yield a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v). Stock solutions of OPDA and OPC-8:0 (in ethanol) were also diluted in Triton X-100, such that the reaction mixture contained 0.1% Triton X-100 and <0.01% ethanol. Reaction mixtures (700 μl) contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CoA, 0.1 to 0.4 mm NADH, 100 μm fatty acyl substrate, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 10 units each of myokinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was initiated by adding ∼10 μg of purified OPCL1. Oxidation of NADH was monitored at 340 nm with a Beckman DU530 spectrophotometer (Fullerton, CA). The assay was validated with a commercial acyl-CoA synthetase (Sigma) from Pseudomonas and 14:0 as a substrate. Heat-killed enzyme was used to determine the rate of non-enzymatic NADH oxidation. Alternatively, total lysate obtained from E. coli cells expressing the empty pQE30 vector was subject to the nickel affinity chromatography procedure used to purify OPCL1. A volume (typically 10 μl) of the resulting eluant was used as a mock-enzyme treatment. Pyruvate kinase (from rabbit muscle), myokinase (from chicken muscle), l-lactate dehydrogenase (from rabbit muscle), and fatty acid substrates were obtained from Sigma. 12-OPDA and OPC-8:0 were chemically synthesized as described previously (37Ainai T. Matsuumi M. Kobayashi Y. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 7825-7832Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and were >97% pure. GC-MS analysis showed that the ratio of cis- to trans-OPDA isomers was ∼25:1. The ratio of cis- to trans-OPC-8:0 isomers was ∼1.5:1. Construction of Transgenic Plants Expressing Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP)-tagged OPCL1—To determine the subcellular localization of OPCL1, we constructed a transgenic line of Arabidopsis expressing a derivative of the yellow fluorescent protein that is fused to the N terminus of OPCL1. The open reading frame of YFP was PCR amplified from the EYFP-Peroxi plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with the primer set of 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ (BamHI site underlined) and 5′-CTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′. The OPCL1 open reading frame was PCR amplified from the full-length cDNA with the primer set of 5′-GACGAGCTGTACAAGATGGCTTCAGTGAATTCT-3′ (an overhang encoding overlapping sequence with EYFP is underlined) and 5′-GGATCCTCAAAGCTTGGAGTTGGA-3′ (BamHI site underlined). The fusion between YFP and OPCL1 was created in a second PCR in which equimolar amounts of the two products from the first round of PCR were used as template with the primer set of 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCAAAGCTTGGAGTTGGA-3′ (BamHI site underlined). The resulting product was cloned into the BamHI restriction site of a modified pBI121 vector containing a single BamHI site, which places the fusion gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. This modified pBI121 vector was constructed as follows. Two pairs of complementary primers (pair 1: 5′-GATCCACTAGTCTCGAG-3′ and 5′-ACGTGCTCGAGACTAGTG-3′; pair 2: 5′-CACGTGGTCGACGGTACCGAGCT-3′ and 5′-CGGTACCGTCGACC-3′) were annealed and ligated to a pBI121 vector that was digested with BamHI and SacI. This manipulation removed the GUS gene and introduced a new set of restriction enzyme sites for cloning. The GFP-OPR3 fusion gene was constructed as follows. The open reading frame of OPR3 was PCR amplified from the cDNA template with the primer set of 5′-GGGCTCGAGATGACGGCGGCACAAGGGAA-3′ (XhoI site underlined) and 5′-CCCACTAGTTCAGAGGCGGGAAAAAGGAG-3′ (SpeI site underlined). The resulting product was cloned into the XhoI and SpeI restriction sites of vector pTA7002. A GFP open reading frame containing 5′ and 3′ XhoI overhangs was amplified from plasmid pEGAD (CD3-389, Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) with the primer set of 5′-AAACTCGAGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCTCGAGCCCGGGGAATTCGG-3′ (XhoI sites underlined). This product was cloned into the XhoI site of the OPR3-containing pTA7002 vector described above. The YFP-OPCL1 and GFP-OPR3 constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1. The floral dip method (40Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis Col-0. T1 generation plants expressing YFP-OPCL1 and T2 generation plants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OPR3 were used for confocal imaging experiments. Confocal Microscopy—Leaf and root tissue of 15-20-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the fluorescent proteins were hand-sectioned with a razor blade and mounted in distilled water between a slide and coverslip. Confocal fluorescence images of the specimens were taken with a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with an argon laser. Chloroplast autofluorescence was excited with a 488-nm argon laser and was detected after passage through a long-pass 650-nm emission filter. YFP and GFP fluorescence was excited with a 488-nm laser and was detected after passage through a band pass 505-530-nm emission filter. MitoTracker Orange CM-H2TMRos (Molecular Probes Inc.) was used to stain mitochondria according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence from MitoTracker-treated root tissue was detected with a 543-nm helium neon laser and a band pass 560-615-nm filter. Identification of an AAE Gene That Is Co-regulated with Other JA Biosynthetic Genes—To facilitate the discovery of new genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis, we took advantage of the fact that many components of the pathway are coordinately regulated in Arabidopsis (30Nemhauser J.L.

The complete list of these genes is given in supplemental Table S1. Among these are genes encoding known or putative JA biosynthetic enzymes including 13-lipoxygenases (At1g72520, At1g17420), AOC (At3g25780), and AOS (At5g42650). One of the highest ranking genes (At1g20510) on the list is a member of the 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL)-like family of AAEs (Fig. 1). A potential role for 4CL-like AAEs in JA biosynthesis is supported by two lines of evidence. First, all eight members of this clade contain a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 motif (44Shockey J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2021557435,"The role for hyaluronan (HA) and CD44 in vascular barrier regulation is unknown. We examined high and low molecular weight HA (HMW-HA, ∼1,000 kDa; LMW-HA, ∼2.5 kDa) effects on human transendothelial monolayer electrical resistance (TER). HMW-HA increased TER, whereas LMW-HA induced biphasic TER changes ultimately resulting in EC barrier disruption. HMW-HA induced the association of the CD44s isoform with, and AKT-mediated phosphorylation of, the barrier-promoting sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P1) within caveolin-enriched lipid raft microdomains, whereas LMW-HA induced brief CD44s association with S1P1 followed by sustained association of the CD44v10 isoform with, and Src and ROCK 1/2-mediated phosphorylation of, the barrier-disrupting S1P3 receptor. HA-induced EC cytoskeletal reorganization and TER alterations were abolished by either disruption of lipid raft formation, CD44 blocking antibody or siRNA-mediated reductions in expression of CD44 isoforms. Silencing S1P1, AKT1, or Rac1 blocked the barrier enhancing effects of HA whereas silencing S1P3, Src, ROCK1/2, or RhoA blocked the barrier disruption induced by LMW-HA. In summary, HA regulates EC barrier function through novel differential CD44 isoform interaction with S1P receptors, S1P receptor transactivation, and RhoA/Rac1 signaling to the EC cytoskeleton.

A number of bioactive agonists contribute to EC barrier regulation via direct effects on the integrity of EC tight junctions, cell-cell, and cell-matrix adhesions. One important extracellular matrix component, hyaluronan (HA), and its cell surface receptor, CD44, has been implicated in normal EC function and angiogenesis (5Turley E.A. Noble P.W.

Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan (GAG) component of the extracellular matrix of many tissues. Structurally, high molecular weight (HMW) HA (>500,000 daltons) is composed of repeating disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, which exists as a random coil structure that can expand in aqueous solutions (6Toole B.P.

Aqueous HA is highly viscous and elastic, properties which contribute to its space filling and filtering functions (7Scott J.E. Heatley F. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and is synthesized by at least three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3) (8Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R.

Preparation and Quantitation of Low and High MW HA— The method of preparation is similar to that described previously (19Slevin M. Kumar S. Gaffney J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41046-41059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For HMW-HA, 500 mg of rooster comb HA (∼1-million Da polymers (34Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A.

For LMW-HA, 500 mg of rooster comb HA was digested with 20,000 units of bovine testicular hyaluronidase in digestion buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.4, 0.15 m NaCl) for 24 h, and the reaction stopped with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting solution was centrifuged in an Ultrafree-MC™ Millipore 5,000 Da MW cutoff filter and the flow-through (less than 5,000 Da) was dialyzed against distilled water for 24 h at 4 °C in 500-Da cutoff Spectra-Por tubing (Pierce-Warriner, Chester, UK). Low and High MW HA were quantitated using an ELISA-like competitive binding assay with a known amount of fixed HA and biotintylated HA-binding peptide (HABP) as the indicator (35Pogrel M.A. Low M.A. Stern R. J. Oral Sci. 2003; 45: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In some cases, both Low and High MW HA were subject to boiling, proteinase K (50 μg/ml) digestion, hyaluronidase SD digestion (100 milliunits/ml) or addition of boiled (inactivated) hyaluronidase SD to test for possible protein/lipid contaminants (36Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). LMW and HMW-HA with DNA standards were run on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with combined Alcian blue and silver staining to further determine HA purity and size (37Min H. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Lipid Raft Isolation—Caveolin-enriched microdomain known as lipid rafts were isolated from human lung EC as we previously described (29Singleton P.A. Dudek S.M. Chiang E.T. Garcia J.G. Faseb J. 2005; 19: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Triton X-100-insoluble materials were mixed with 0.6 ml of cold 60% Optiprep™ and overlaid with 0.6 ml of 40-20% Optiprep™ and the gradients centrifuged (35,000 rpm) in SW60 rotor for 12 h at 4 °C and different fractions were collected and analyzed. In some cases, different fractions were were analyzed for total cholesterol content using the Amplex Red™ cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen (Molecular Probes). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cellular materials associated within the 20% Optiprep™ fractions (lipid raft fraction) were incubated with IP buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 50 μm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:250 dilution of Calbiochem protease inhibitor mixture 3) or IP buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 50 μm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1:250 dilution of Calbiochem protease inhibitor mixture 3) as indicated. The samples were then immunoprecipitated with anti-S1P1 receptor or anti-S1P3 receptor IgG followed by SDS-PAGE in 4-15% polyacrylamide gels, transfer onto Immobilon™ membranes, and developed with specific primary and secondary antibodies. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol LS (Invitrogen) followed by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for further purification. Reverse-transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)— Transcript levels of selected CD44 isoforms were measured using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Specific primer pairs were used as follows: for all CD44 isoforms (C2A reverse primer: 5′-CCAAGATGATCAGCCATTCTGG-3′, GenBank™ L05422, and C13 Forward Primer: 5′-AAGACATCTACCCCAGCAAC-3′, GenBank™ L05410) and for CD44v10-specific isoform (C2A reverse primer: 5′-CCAAGATGATCAGCCATTCTGG-3′, GenBank™ L05422, and pv10 Forward Primer: GGTGGAAGAAGAGACCCAAA-3′, GenBank™ L05419). Amplicons were analyzed by 1.25% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris borate EDTA. Determination of Complex Formation between S1P1 Receptor/CD44s and S1P3 Receptor/CD44v10—EC monolayers were serum-starved for 1 h, treated with High or Low MW HA (100 nm) (5-30 min) and subsequently solubilized in IP buffer A (see above). The samples were then immunoprecipitated with either rabbit anti-S1P1 receptor or mouse anti-S1P3 receptor antibody followed by SDS-PAGE in 4-15% polyacrylamide gels and transfer onto Immobilon™ membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking nonspecific sites with 5% bovine serum albumin, the blots were incubated with either rat anti-CD44 (IM-7, common domain) antibody, rabbit anti-S1P1 antibody, or mouse anti-S1P3 antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, or goat anti-rat IgG. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Tyrosine/Serine/Threonine Phosphorylation of the S1P1 and S1P3 Receptor—Solubilized proteins in IP buffer B (see above) were immunoprecipitated with either rabbit anti-S1P1 receptor or mouse anti-S1P3 receptor antibody followed by SDS-PAGE in 4-15% polyacrylamide gels and transfer onto Immobilon™ membranes (Millipore Corp.). After blocking nonspecific sites with 5% bovine serum albumin, the blots were incubated with either rabbit anti-S1P1 antibody, mouse anti-S1P3 antibody, mouse anti-phosphotyrosine, rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody, or rabbit anti-phosphothreonine antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Construction and Transfection of siRNA against S1P1, S1P3, CD44, AKT1, Src, ROCK1, ROCK2, Rac1, and RhoA—The siRNA sequence(s) targeting human against S1P1, S1P3, CD44, Rac1, and RhoA were generated using mRNA sequences from GenBank™ (gi:13027635, gi:38788192, gi:30353932, gi:62241010, gi:77415509, gi:4885582, gi:41872582, gi:29792301, gi:33876092, respectively). For each mRNA (or scramble), two targets were identified. Specifically, S1P1 target sequence 1 (5′-AAGCTACACAAAAAGCCTGGA-3′), S1P1 target sequence 2 (5′-AAAAAGCCTGGATCACTCATC-3′), S1P3 target sequence 1 (5′-AACAGGGACTCAGGGACCAGA-3′), S1P3 target sequence 2 (5′-AAATGAATGTTCCTGGGGCGC-3′), CD44 target sequence 1 (5′-AATATAACCTGCCGCTTTGCA-3′), CD44 target sequence 2 (5′-AAAAATGGTCGCTACAGCATC-3′), AKT1 target sequence 1 (5′-AATTATGGGTCTGTAACCACC-3′), AKT1 target sequence 2 (5′-AAATGAATGAACCAGATTCAG-3′), Src target sequence 1 (5′-AAAATCGAACCTCAGTGGCGG-3′), Src target sequence 2 (5′-AATCGAACCTCAGTGGCGGCG-3′), ROCK1 target sequence 1 (5′-AAAAAATGGACAACCTGCTGC-3′), ROCK1 target sequence 2 (5′-AAGTGAATTCGGATTGTTTGC-3′), ROCK2 target sequence 1 (5′-AATCTGACTGAGGGGCGGGGA-3′), ROCK2 target sequence 2 (5′-AAGCCGGAGCTAGAGGCAGGC-3′), Rac1 target sequence 1 (5′-AAAACTTGCCTACTGATCAGT-3′), Rac1 target sequence 2 (5′-AACTTGCCTACTGATCAGTTA-3′), RhoA target sequence 1 (5′-AAGAAACTGGTGATTGTTGGT-3′), RhoA target sequence 2 (5′-AAAGACATGCTTGCTCATAGT-3′), scrambled sequence 1 (5′-AAGAGAAATCGAAACCGAAAA-3′), and scramble sequence 2 (5′-AAGAACCCAATTAAGCGCAAG-3′) were utilized. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were provided by the Johns Hopkins University DNA Analysis Facility. For construction of the siRNA, a transcription-based kit from Ambion was used (Silencer™ siRNA construction kit). Human lung EC were then transfected with siRNA using siPORTamine™ as the transfection reagent (Ambion, TX) according to the protocol provided by Ambion. Cells (∼40% confluent) were serum-starved for 1 h followed by incubated with 3 μm (1.5 μm of each siRNA) of target siRNA (or scramble siRNA or no siRNA) for 6 h in serum-free media. The serum-containing media was then added (1% serum final concentration) for 42 h before biochemical experiments and/or functional assays were conducted. Rho Family Activation Assay—RhoA and Rac activities in human lung EC were performed as described previously (38Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Measurement of TransEC Electrical Resistance (TER)—EC were grown to confluence in polycarbonate wells containing evaporated gold microelectrodes, and TER measurements performed using an electrical cell substrate impedance sensing system (Applied Biophysics) as previously described (4Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). TER values from each microelectrode were pooled at discrete time points and plotted versus time as the mean ± S.E. In Vitro S1P Receptor Phosphorylation—The S1P receptor phosphorylation reaction was carried out in 50 μl of the reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1 μm calyculin A, 100 μm ATP, purified enzymes (i.e. 100 ng of recombinant active Src, ROCK1 or ROCK2) with or without immunoprecipitated S1P1 or S1P3 receptor obtained from human pulmonary EC that were serum-starved for 1 h. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed using mouse anti-phosphotyrosine, rabbit anti-phosphoserine, rabbit anti-phosphothreonine, rabbit anti-S1P1, or mouse anti-S1P3 antibody followed by incubation with horse-radish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG. Visualization of immunoreactive bands was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Cortical Actin Quantitation—Polymerized actin rearrangement was assessed with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin and analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope as we have described (4Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Computer-recorded tiff images were analyzed with ImageQuant™ software from Amersham Biosciences. A standardized average gray value (SAGV) was generated for total phalloidin staining versus cortical phalloidin staining for each cell (29Singleton P.A. Dudek S.M. Chiang E.T. Garcia J.G. Faseb J. 2005; 19: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To calculate percent cortical actin staining, the following equation was used: ((cortical actin SAGV × area) divided by (total actin SAGV × area)) × 100. At least ten cells per sample were analyzed. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used to compare the means of data from two or more different experimental groups. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Divergent Effects of Low and High Molecular Weight Hyaluronan on Human Lung Endothelial Cell Barrier Function: Role of Caveolin-enriched Microdomains (Lipid Rafts)—Initial experiments examined the effects of low and high MW-HA on human lung EC barrier function and the role of CD44 and lipid rafts in this process. Lipid rafts isolated from human lung EC contain specific markers (caveolin-1 and flotillin-1), are enriched in cholesterol and exclude other subcellular organelle markers (Fig. 1, A and B). These results demonstrate the purity and specificity of our lipid raft isolation procedure. Next, RT-PCR and isoform-specific immunoblot analysis were performed to explore whether CD44 isoforms, a major cell surface HA receptor family, were present in human lung EC. Fig. 1, C and D demonstrate that human pulmonary EC express at least two major CD44 isoforms, CD44s (standard form, ∼85 kDa) and CD44v10 (∼116 kDa). HMW-HA (∼1 million Da) consistently produced a gradual and sustained rise in transmonolayer electrical resistance (TER) in dose-dependent fashion whereas LMW-HA (∼2,500 Da) induced biphasic changes in TER with an initial rapid increase in barrier enhancement followed by significant and prolonged barrier disruption (Fig. 2, A and B). The dose response was significant when comparing equal nanomolar concentrations (but not equal concentrations in the range of 1.0-100 μg/ml (Fig. 2C)) of Low and High MW HA. Depleting cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) treatment (Fig. 2D) or using a pan-CD44 blocking antibody, which blocks HA binding to all CD44 isoforms, abolished both HMW- and LMW-HA-induced changes in TER (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that cholesterol-enriched microdomains regulate HA-mediated EC barrier function. Further, CD44 is the major HA receptor responsible for HA-mediated EC barrier alterations. We previously demonstrated that CD44 localizes in activated EC to specialized cholesterol- and caveolin-enriched lipid rafts, plasma membrane microdomains implicated in a variety of cellular functions including potocytosis, cholesterol, and calcium regulation as well as signal"
https://openalex.org/W2099637800,"The relaxin and insulin-like peptide 3 receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, respectively, are unique members of the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor (LGR) family, because they possess an N-terminal motif with homology to the low density lipoprotein class A (LDLa) modules. By characterizing several LGR7 and LGR8 splice variants, we have revealed that the LDLa module directs ligand-activated cAMP signaling. The LGR8-short variant encodes an LGR8 receptor lacking the LDLa module, whereas LGR7-truncate, LGR7-truncate-2, and LGR7-truncate-3 all encode truncated secreted proteins retaining the LGR7 LDLa module. LGR8-short and an engineered LGR7 variant missing its LDLa module, LGR7-short, bound to their respective ligands with high affinity but lost their ability to signal via stimulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation. Conversely, secreted LGR7-truncate protein with the LDLa module was able to block relaxin-induced LGR7 cAMP signaling and did so without compromising the ability of LGR7 to bind to relaxin or be expressed on the cell membrane. Although the LDLa module of LGR7 was N-glycosylated at position Asn-14, an LGR7 N14Q mutant retained relaxin binding affinity and cAMP signaling, implying that glycosylation is not essential for optimal LDLa function. Using real-time PCR, the expression of mouse LGR7-truncate was detected to be high in, and specific to, the uterus of pregnant mice. The differential expression and evolutionary conservation of LGR7-truncate further suggests that it may also play an important role in vivo. This study highlights the essential role of the LDLa module in LGR7 and LGR8 function and introduces a novel model of GPCR regulation.

Rev. 2006; 58: 7-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), however, in this report it will be referred to by its original name, leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCR 7 (LGR7) (20Hsu S.Y. Nakabayashi K. Nishi S. Kumagai J. Kudo M. Sherwood O.D. Hsueh A.J. Science. 2002; 295: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). LGR7 has been highly conserved in vertebrate species throughout evolution and is related to the glycoprotein hormone receptors FSHR, TSHR, and LHR (21Scott D.J. Wilkinson T. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. Lett. Peptide Sci. 2004; 10: 393-400Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The closest homolog of LGR7 is LGR8 (the RXFP2 receptor), whose specific ligand is insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) (22Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J.

INSL3 is the closest hormone relative of relaxin, acts to mediate testicular descent (23Nef S. Parada L.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 24Zimmermann S.

In addition to their seven transmembrane-spanning GPCR domains, LGR7 and LGR8 possess large extracellular ectodomains containing 10 leucine-rich repeats similar to those found in the glycoprotein hormone receptors. LGR7 and LGR8 are distinguished into LGR sub-family C, apart from the glycoprotein hormone receptors (class A) because of their unique N-terminal domains, which have homology to the LDL class A (LDLa) modules that make up the ligand binding repeats found in the LDL receptor family (25Wilkinson T. Scott D.J. Hopkins E. Bathgate R.A.D. Curr. Med. Chem.-Immunology, Endocrine & Metabolic Agents. 2005; 5: 369-381Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this report these domains will be referred to as the LDLa modules of LGR7/8. Alternative splicing of the LGR7 and LGR8 genes has been reported (26Muda M. He C. Martini P.G. Ferraro T. Layfield S.

We have previously reported the identification of an LGR7 splice variant in rodents that is missing exon 4 and named LGR7-truncate (33Scott D.J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). LGR7-truncate is expressed in the reproductive tract of late stage pregnant mice and rats (33Scott D.J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and an expressed sequence tag clone (BF191498) from a pooled library of male and female pig reproductive organs encodes LGR7-truncate. Deletion of exon 4 causes a reading frameshift in the LGR7-truncate transcript, the appearance of a premature stop codon, and results in a splice variant encoding a protein comprising the unique LDLa module of LGR7. When co-transfected into human cells with LGR7, LGR7-truncate is able to reduce relaxin-induced LGR7 signaling through an unknown mechanism (33Scott D.J. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of three novel human LGR splice variants, one LGR8 variant encoding a receptor missing its LDLa module, named LGR8-short, and two variants similar to LGR7-truncate, encoding secreted LDLa modules, named LGR7-truncate-2 and LGR7-truncate-3. Functional characterization of these splice variants revealed that the unique LDLa modules of LGR7 and LGR8 are crucial for mediation of receptor signaling upon ligand binding. Furthermore, LGR7-truncate expression is established as being specific to and prevalent in the uteri of pregnant mice, suggesting that the LDLa module of LGR7-truncate may play a regulatory role in vivo. Reagents, Animals, RNA Extraction, PCR, and Cloning—H2 relaxin was kindly provided by BAS Medical (San Mateo, CA). INSL3 was synthesized by Dr. John Wade (34Fu P. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Tomiyama H. Hutson J. Otvos L. Tregear Jr., G.W. Bathgate R.A. Wade J.D. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All female mice (C57B6J) were housed in a controlled environment and maintained as described before (11Zhao L. Roche P.J. Gunnersen J.M. Hammond V.E. Tregear G.W. Wintour E.M. Beck F. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Pregnant female animals were killed at days 7.5, 13.5, and 17.5 of pregnancy for tissue collection. The cerebral cortices, uteri, and livers of three non-pregnant, three day-7.5 pregnant, three day-13.5 pregnant, and three day-17.5 pregnant female mice were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was extracted as described above. 100-mg portions of snap-frozen tissues were crushed with a hammer while frozen and homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the total RNA in each was extracted following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was determined via spectrophotometric analysis in a SmartSpec 3000 (Bio-Rad). All cDNA used for PCR was generated from 2.5 μg of total RNA using random hexamer oligonucleotides and a reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR reactions were undertaken using Triplemaster DNA polymerase (Eppendorf) in a GeneAmp thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Identification of Human LGR Splice Variants—Human uterine cDNA was screened for LGR8 splice variants using PCR and an exon 1–7 spanning primer pair (forward primer, 5′-GAT TGT TTT TCT GGT TTT TAA ACA TC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CTG GTT ATT GGA TTG TCA TCT A-3′) using the PCR conditions 94 °C for 30 s denaturing, 50 °C for 30 s annealing, and 72 °C for 60 s extension repeated 25 times. Electrophoresis of this PCR revealed one product smaller (519 bp) than the expected amplicon size of wild-type LGR8 (666 bp). This band was excised from the gel and cloned into a pGEM-T Easy plasmid (Promega), and both strands of at least three clones were sequenced. Human LGR7-truncate homologous sequences were identified using a primer pair spanning the first five exons of human LGR7 (forward primer, 5′-GGA GGA CTG CTT TGT AAA TGC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-CTT GAA GCA ATC AGG AGG AAG C-3′). PCR was undertaken on human brain and uterus cDNA following the conditions; 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s repeated 25 times. Two products smaller than the expected amplicon size of wild-type LGR7 (629 bp) were identified (368 and 426 bp) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmids (Promega), and both strands of at least three clones were sequenced for each variant. Generation of LGR8-short, LGR7-short, and LGR7-truncate Mammalian Expression Plasmids—A mammalian LGR8-short expression construct was generated with PCR using a forward primer (5′-CAT CAT GTC GAC ACT AGT GGA TGG GCG AC-3′) containing a SalI restriction enzyme site at its 5′-end and a reverse primer (5′-CAT CAT CTC GAG CTA GGA AAC TGG TTT CAT TAT ACT GTC TCC-3′) containing an XhoI site at its 5′-end. The LGR8-short pGEM-T plasmid was used as the template DNA for a PCR following the conditions 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 150 s repeated 25 times. The resultant product was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo, in the process the insert was ligated to a bovine prolactin signal sequence and N-terminal FLAG tag as described previously (35Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A FLAG-tagged LGR7-short equivalent mammalian expression construct (LGR7 missing the sequence derived from exon 2) was generated in the same way using a different primer pair (forward primer, 5′-CAT CAT GAA TTC GGA GAC AAC AAT GGA TGG TC-3′, containing a 5′ EcoRI enzyme site, and a reverse primer, 5′-CAT CAT CTC GAG TCA TGA ATA GGA ATT GAG TCT CGT TG-3′ with a 5′ XhoI enzyme site), and human LGR7 pcDNA3.1 plasmid as the PCR template, following the conditions 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 150 s repeated 25 times. A FLAG-tagged Mouse LGR7-truncate pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid was cloned in a similar manner using the primer pair (forward primer, 5′-CAT CAT GTC GAC CAG GAT GTC AGT TGT CCC CTC-3′, containing a 5′ SalI enzyme site and reverse primer 5′-CAT CAT CTC GAG TTA TGA AGT TCC TCT GCA GG-3′ containing a 5′ XhoI enzyme site) using pregnant mouse uterine cDNA as the PCR template following the conditions; 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s repeated 25 times. A mouse LGR7-truncate pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid without a FLAG tag and with its native signal peptide was generated as described above, using a different forward primer (5′-CAT CAT GGA TCC GCC ACC ATG GGG CCT ACT TTG GGT GC-3′ containing a 5′ BamHI enzyme site), with pregnant mouse uterine cDNA as the PCR template following the conditions; 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s repeated 25 times. A FLAG-tagged human LRG7-truncate (mouse LGR7-truncate equivalent) pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid was also generated using a specific primer pair (forward primer, 5′-CAT CAT GTC GAC CAG GAT GTC AAG TGC TCC CTT G-3′, containing a 5′ SalI enzyme site, reverse primer, 5′-CAT CAT CTC GAG TTA TCC ACA GTT GTC CTC ATC GGC-3′, containing a 5′ XhoI enzyme site) using human LGR7 pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid as a PCR template following the same conditions as the mouse LGR7-truncate PCR outlined above. pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmids containing human LGR7-truncate-2 and human LGR7-truncate-3 were generated using the same forward primer (5′-CAT CAT GGA TCC GCC ACC ATG ACA TCT GGT TCT GTC TTC TTC-3′ containing a 5′ BamHI enzyme site) and specific reverse primers (LGR7-truncate-2, 5′-CAT CAT CTC GAG TTA AGT TCC ACT GAA GTG ACC GCA-3′, and LGR7-truncate-3, 5′-CAT CAT CTC GAG TCA CTC ACC ACA GTT GTC CTC ATC-3′, each containing a 3′ XhoI enzyme site) using the human LGR7-truncate-2 and LGR7-truncate-3 containing pGEM-T plasmids generated above as templates for PCR following the conditions; 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s repeated 25 times. [33P]H2-labeled Relaxin Binding Assays—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells grown in RPMI 1640 media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine were plated into 24-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates for whole cell binding assays. When the cells in each well were ∼80% confluent, cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS, and transient transfection was performed using 1 μg of the pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid containing the receptor of interest in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM serum-free media (Invitrogen). After 5 h, 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine was added to each well for a further 16 h. Relaxin binding assays were performed as previously described (35Sudo S. Kumagai J. Nishi S. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7855-7862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Competition binding experiments were performed with 100 pm 33P-labeled H2 relaxin in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled hormones. Nonspecific binding was determined with excess of unlabeled peptides (500 nm H2 relaxin or INSL3). All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the percentage of the total specific binding of triplicate wells, repeated in at least three separate experiments, and curves were fitted using one-site binding curves in GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). Statistical differences in pIC50 values were analyzed using Student t tests in GraphPad Prism 4. Gpp(NH)p and GTPγS Competition Binding—HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the receptors of interest as above. 24 h later membrane preparations were generated by homogenizing the cells in binding buffer (20 nm HEPES, 50 nm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml lysine, 0.01% NaHPO4, pH 7.5). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in binding buffer. Membrane preparations were pretreated for 30 min with either 100 μm Gpp(NH)p (Sigma) or 100 μm GTPγS (Sigma). The 33P-labeled H2 relaxin binding was performed as per above but in 96-well plates. After a 60-min hormone incubation, the membranes were filtered and washed using a Tomtec harvester. The filters were counted in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter. Data points were measured in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated three times. Inhibition of Forskolin-induced Intracellular cAMP Accumulation—Ligand-induced inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was assessed using a cAMP reporter gene assay (36Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). 293T cells in 96-well plates were co-transfected with either LGR7-short and a pCRE-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (36Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) or LGR8-short and pCRE-β-galactosidase. 24 h later co-transfected cells were treated with 5 μm forskolin and increasing concentrations of H2 relaxin. After 6 h, the cell's media was aspirated, and the cells were frozen at –80 °C overnight. The amount of cAMP-driven β-galactosidase expression in each well was determined by lysing the cells in 10 mm Na2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm MgSO4, 0.01 mm MnCl2 for 10 min. 100 μl of assay buffer was added to the wells (100 mm Na2PO4, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for a further 10 min before the addition of 25 μl of enzyme substrate solution (1 mg/ml chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) in 100 mm Na2PO4, pH8.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm MnCl2). The absorbance of each well was monitored at 570 nm using a Ceres UV900C plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). When the absorbance readings were between 0.3 (no forskolin or relaxin treatment) and 1.0 (5 μm forskolin treatment) the final readings were recorded. Ligand-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was expressed as a percentage of 5 μm forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Data points were measured in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated three times. Analysis of LGR7 Signal Transduction in the Presence of LGR7 Truncate—HEK 293T cells at ∼80% confluency in 48-well plates were transfected with 0.5 μg of the pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid containing the receptor of interest in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM serum-free media (Invitrogen). At least 24 h later, the transfection media was aspirated, and each well was washed with 0.5 ml of PBS. The transfected cells were treated with solutions with or without hormones in RPMI 1640 media containing 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 30 min before aspiration of the treatment solutions. Cell lysis and measurement of intracellular cAMP accumulation was performed using the cAMP Biotrak enzyme immunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Each treatment point was measured in triplicate, and data are represented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). Anti-FLAG Cell-surface Expression Assay—FLAG-tagged receptor-transfected cells were plated into 6-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates (1,000,000 transfected cells per well). 24 h later the cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS before incubation in 1 ml of a 5% bovine serum albumin, PBS solution containing 5 μg/ml Anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature on a gently tilting platform. Cells were lifted from their wells in this solution and resuspended in 1.5-ml tubes (Axygen), centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm in a Heraeus Biofuge 13 (Sepatech), and the antibody solution was aspirated. The cell pellet was washed twice in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, before being resuspended in 200 μl of an ice-cold solution of 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS containing 2,000,000 cpm/ml of 125I-labeled anti-mouse-IgG sheep antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated on ice for 2 h. After 2 cycles of centrifugation, aspiration and washing with 1 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, the resultant pellet was counted in a Cobra Auto-Gamma liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). Empty vector-transfected cells were used to determine the nonspecific binding in the cell-surface expression assay. All data points were performed in triplicate, and the data are accumulated from three separate experiments. Co-culture Experiments—175-cm2 flasks of 80% confluent 293T cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged LGR7, mouse LGR7-truncate, or empty vector. After 24 h the cells were lifted in EDTA phosphate solution, washed in PBS twice, counted, and then plated in 96-well plates (10,000 LGR7-transfected cells) for cAMP accumulation assays, 24-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates (100,000 LGR7-transfected cells) for relaxin binding assays or 6-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates (1,000,000 LGR7-transfected cells) for cell-surface binding assays. Into each well of the plates described above already containing LGR7-transfected cells, either LGR7-truncate or empty vector-transfected cells were co-plated at a 1:2.5 or 1:5 ratio of LGR7-transfected cells to LGR7-truncate or empty vector-transfected cells. LGR7 signaling, relaxin binding assays, and FLAG cell-surface binding assays were performed in parallel 24 h later as described above. Data were plotted, and statistical differences were determined using Student t-tests in GraphPad Prism 4. Expression and Purification of Recombinant LGR7 Truncate Protein—Multiple 175-cm2 flasks of 80% confluent HEK 293T cells were washed with PBS and transfected with a pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid encoding the FLAG-tagged LGR7-truncate of interest using as described above. After 24 h the transfected cells were lifted with EDTA phosphate solution and resuspended into 500-cm2 plates in RPMI 1640 media for another 24 h before replacement of the RPMI 1640 media with 50 ml of Xten Eo serum-free media (Thermotrace) for 3 days. Collected media were filtered with 500 ml of 0.45-μm sterile bottle top filters (Nalgene), and CaCl2 was added to 2 mm. The resultant solution was then passed through a pre-packed and equilibrated column containing Anti-FLAG M1 affinity Gel (Sigma) five times at 4 °C, washed with 36 ml of TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2, and eluted with 10 lots of 1 ml of TBS (2 mm EDTA). The eluant (10 ml) was then washed with 100 ml of TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 and concentrated in 5,000 Da molecular mass cut off Amicon Ultra 15 centrifugal filtration units (Millipore) at 4,000 × g in a swinging bucket centrifuge (Beckman). Affinity-purified protein was applied to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the Anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The activity of affinity-purified LGR7-truncate was accessed by preincubating 50 μl of TBS solutions containing various amounts of either affinity-purified LGR7-truncate or a mock Anti-FLAG M1 affinity column eluant on 293T cells (10,000) stably expressing LGR7 in 48-well plates for 15 min before treatment with 1 nm relaxin. Relaxin-induced LGR7 signaling was determined as above. Determination of LGR7 Truncate Specificity—A plasmid encoding a mutant mouse LGR7-truncate plasmid (C44A) was generated with the following primer pair (5′-GTC AGT GCT CCC CTC GGC TCC TTC-3′ and 5′-GGG AGC ACT GAC ATC CTG GTC GAC ATC ATC-3′) using a QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR was undertaken following the manufacturer's recommended protocol, and the resultant product was treated with 1 μl of DPN1 for 1 h at 37 °C and transformed into the supplied competent cells. The resultant plasmid was sequenced on both strands to confirm generation of the missense mutation. Co-cultures of LGR7-transfected cells with either LGR7-truncate, LGR7-truncate (C44A), or empty vector were prepared as above and co-cultured at a 1:5 cell number ratio. Relaxin-induced cAMP signaling was determined as above but in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (cells pre-treated with pertussis toxin for 16 h). Wells containing 50,000 Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the relaxin-3 receptor (GPCR135), which couples to inhibitory G proteins (37Van der Westhuizen E.T. Sexton P.M. Bathgate R.A. Summers R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1041: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), were used as a positive control for pertussis toxin activity. These cells were pre-treated with or without pertussis toxin before stimulation with 100 nm human relaxin-3. Data were plotted, and statistical differences were determined using Student t-tests in GraphPad Prism 4. Prediction and Identification of an N-Linked Glycosylation Site"
https://openalex.org/W2102202837,"Interest in self-association of peptides and proteins is motivated by an interest in the mechanism of physiologically higher order assembly of proteins such as collagen as well as the mechanism of pathological aggregation such as β-amyloid formation. The triple helical form of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, a peptide that has proved a useful model for molecular features of collagen, was found to self-associate, and its association properties are reported here. Turbidity experiments indicate that the triple helical peptide self-assembles at neutral pH via a nucleation-growth mechanism, with a critical concentration near 1 mm. The associated form is more stable than individual molecules by about 25 °C, and the association is reversible. The rate of self-association increases with temperature, supporting an entropically favored process. After self-association, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 forms branched filamentous structures, in contrast with the highly ordered axially periodic structure of collagen fibrils. Yet a number of characteristics of triple helix assembly for the peptide resemble those of collagen fibril formation. These include promotion of fibril formation by neutral pH and increasing temperature; inhibition by sugars; and a requirement for hydroxyproline. It is suggested that these similar features for peptide and collagen self-association are based on common lateral underlying interactions between triple helical molecules mediated by hydrogen-bonded hydration networks involving hydroxyproline.

There is increasing interest in the ability of proteins and peptides to self-associate into aggregates, both in normal and pathological processes. Normal self-association processes include fibril formation of collagen and polymerization of actin (1Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

The study of the ability of collagen-like peptides to aggregate offers an opportunity to characterize a unique system, which may relate to the physiological self-association of collagen molecules.Collagen, the major structural protein in the extracellular matrix, has a characteristic triple helical conformation, consisting of three polyproline II-like chains that are supercoiled around a common axis (5Ramachandran G.N. Kartha G. Nature. 1955; 176: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 6Rich A. Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 483-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 7Brodsky B. Persikov A.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 301-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The close packing of the three chains near the central axis generates a requirement for Gly as every third residue, (Gly-X-Y)n, whereas the high content of imino acids Pro and hydroxyproline (Hyp) stabilizes the individual polyproline II-like helices. Although imino acids are highly favorable for the triple helix, the post-translational modification of Pro to Hyp in the Y position confers an additional stabilizing contribution. This further stabilization of Hyp is likely to result from steroelectronic promotion of the more favorable exo ring pucker for the Y position and Hyp involvement in solvent-mediated hydrogen bonding (8Jenkins C.L.

The favorable enthalpy of collagen indicates that hydrogen bonding is a major contributor to stability. One direct interchain peptide hydrogen bond is formed for each Gly-X-Y unit, together with an extensive water-mediated hydrogen bonding network (10Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M.

The ordered water network seen in crystal structures links the available backbone carbonyls of the triple helix and Hyp groups.The family of collagens consists of 28 distinct genetic types with a range of tissue distributions and diverse functions (13Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. The Collagen Family: Structure Assembly and Organization in the Extracellular Matrix. Wiley-Liss, New York2002: 159-221Google Scholar). For most collagens, the molecules self-associate to form a higher order structure, such as fibrils and networks, and the supermolecular structure is responsible for mechanical and binding properties critical to function. The most abundant collagens are types I, II, and III, which are found in characteristic fibrils with an axial D = 670 Å period in tendon, skin, bone, cartilage, and other tissues. The process of association of type I collagen molecules into fibrils has been characterized from thermodynamic and kinetic approaches (1Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

The molecular structure of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, determined to high resolution by x-ray crystallography, confirms the basic triple helical structure and shows an extensive hydration network (28Nagarajan V.

Recently, there have been several reports of collagen-like peptides that self-associate to higher molecular weight structures, including studies on poly(Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 (30Kishimoto T. Morihara Y.

Cross-linked, high molecular weight forms of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, but not the (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 molecule itself, have previously been shown to function as strong inducers of platelet aggregation (35Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, peptide studies may increase our understanding of the formation and biological activity of the polymeric collagen structure as well as giving information at the molecular level.Here, self-assembly of the collagen model peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 is characterized by a range of biophysical techniques, including turbidity, CD spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 6The abbreviations used are: DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; DLS, dynamic light scattering; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 6The abbreviations used are: DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; DLS, dynamic light scattering; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. dynamic light scattering (DLS), and electron microscopy. The peptide is shown to self-associate with increasing temperature, following a nucleation-growth mechanism, from a simple trimer to a higher molecular weight form. This process is promoted by high concentration, neutral pH, increasing peptide length, and increasing temperature and is a reversible process. The self-association properties of this triple helical peptide are discussed in the context of collagen fibril formation.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 was obtained from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). The peptides (Pro-Hyp-Gly)7, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)8, and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)12 were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA) and were purified on a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu) with a C-18 column. Purity of all peptides was ensured by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). Peptide concentrations of starting solutions were measured by monitoring the absorbance at 214 nm using ϵ214 = 2200 cm-1·m-1 per peptide bond. d-Glucose and d-fructose were obtained from Merck. Buffers used included 20 mm PBS (10 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl) for pH 7; acetate buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl) for pH 3.0-4.5; and phosphate buffers (20 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl) for pH 9-11.Turbidity Measurements—Turbidity curves were obtained by monitoring the optical density at 313 nm as a function of time using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer with attached Peltier temperature controller. A sample of 600 μl of the peptide solution was placed in a 2-mm cell, which was sealed to avoid evaporation, and then kept at the desired constant temperature. All turbidity measurements were repeated a minimum of three times.The turbidity curves obtained at different temperatures were used to calculate the activation energy of self-assembly using the Arrhenius equation, k = A e-Ea/RT, where k is the rate constant obtained from the slope, dA313 nm/dt, of the linear growth phase of each turbidity curve.At the end of the plateau phase of the turbidity, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by the mean residue ellipticity at 225 nm in the CD spectrum to determine the percentage of peptide that remained in solution. Because some of the turbidity studies were carried out near the Tm of the peptide, each supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 days to allow complete formation of native triple helix of all peptide in solution prior to CD measurements.For seeding experiments, 5% (v/v) aliquots of turbid sample containing aggregates of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 were added to a fresh solution of the peptide prior to incubation. The rate of self-assembly in the absence and presence of seeding was monitored by the turbidity rise at 45 °C. For a comparison with DSC scans (see below), turbidity was also measured as a function of temperature at a heating rate of 1 °C/min (10-90 °C), with concentration and pH values identical to the DSC experiments.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out using an Aviv Model 62DS spectrophotometer (Aviv Biomedical, Inc.), and the characteristic triple helix CD maximum at 225 nm was used to monitor thermal transitions, refolding curves, and determination of the amount of triple helix peptide remaining in the supernatant following aggregation.Rotary Shadowing Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was carried out on rotary-shadowed samples of the peptide to visualize the morphology of the aggregated structures. At various time points during the monitoring of turbidity at a fixed temperature, a small aliquot of the suspension was placed on a carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grid. Samples were allowed to adsorb for 2-3 min and then were washed with ethanol at different dilutions (20-100% v/v) and air-dried. Afterward samples were rotary shadow cast with tungsten using a JEOL (JEE-400) vacuum evaporator and examined by transmission electron microscopy (Phillips 420 TEM). The micrographs were taken at a magnification ranging from ×40,000 to 80,000.Dynamic Light Scattering—DLS measurements are performed using a DynaPro Titan (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with a temperature controller using a 12-μl quartz cuvette. All samples were centrifuged and filtered through 0.1-μm Whatman Anotop filters before measurements. To obtain the hydrodynamic radii (Rh), the intensity autocorrelation functions were analyzed by Dynamics software (Wyatt Technology Corp.). For data analysis, a viscosity value of η20 °C = 1.019 centipoise was used for PBS.Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC measurements were performed on a Nano-DSC II, model 6100, scanning calorimeter from Calorimetry Sciences Corp. (Lindon, UT). All DSC profiles were obtained at a scan rate of 1 °C/min, and each curve was base-line subtracted before data analysis. The concentration of the peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 was 7 mg/ml, and prior to all measurements, peptide solutions were dialyzed. Calorimetric enthalpy values ΔHcal were obtained by integrating the excess heat capacity curve.RESULTSAnalysis of Self-association at a Constant Temperature by TurbidityThe peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 forms a stable triple helical structure, with a Tm of ∼60 °C, and its thermodynamic and kinetic properties have been well characterized (26Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Sakakibara S. Inouye K. Shudo K. Kishida Y. Kobayashi Y. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 303: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 36Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Studies in our laboratory indicated that at higher concentrations and neutral pH, the peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 comes out of solution upon heating, and the conditions for this aggregation were investigated. The self-association of the peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 can be monitored by turbidity, following the change in absorbance at 313 nm as a function of time. Rapid formation of aggregates was observed at a concentration of 7 mg/ml at 58 °C and pH 7. The turbidity curves of the self-assembly process consist of three stages: an initial lag phase with negligible absorbance; a rapid growth phase; and a plateau phase at a maximum absorbance level. After some time, the absorbance may drop because of the settling of aggregated material. The process of self-association of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 is found to be influenced by peptide concentration, temperature, the pH of the solution, and the length of the peptide. The effect of each of these factors, as well as the consequence of the addition of sugars, is described.Concentration Dependence—At 58 °C, pH 7, no turbidity was observed at 2 mg/ml within 4 h, suggesting a minimum requirement of concentration for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 to undergo self-association. At concentrations greater than 2 mg/ml, turbidity curves indicative of self-association were observed. Increasing concentration results in a decrease in the lag time and an increase in the rate of the growth phase (Fig. 1).Samples were centrifuged after the plateau phase was obtained, and the CD signal at 225 nm was used to determine the concentration of peptide in the supernatant, which indicates the amount of peptide in the precipitate. Higher concentrations led to a greater fraction of peptide in the aggregated state (Fig. 1, inset). Regardless of the initial concentration (3-7 mg/ml), the concentrations of all supernatants were in the range of 2.6-3.4 mg/ml (∼1 mm), suggesting that this is the critical concentration.Temperature Dependence—The self-association process is strongly dependent on temperature (Fig. 2a). At or below 35 °C, no turbidity was seen within 4 h for peptide solutions of concentration 7 mg/ml. At temperatures higher than 35 °C, turbidity was observed within 1 h. With increasing temperature, the lag time decreased and the rate of self-association increased, as measured by the slope of the linear rise (dA313/dt) in the growth phase of each curve (Fig. 2a). The maximum rates occur for temperatures in the range of 55 to 62 °C. The rates observed at different temperatures fit a linear Arrhenius plot with an activation energy of 137 ± 10 kJ·mol-1 (Fig. 2b).FIGURE 2a, temperature dependence of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 self-assembly at a concentration of 7 mg/ml, pH 7. The turbidity curves for 55 and 60 °C are very similar to that seen for 58 °C and thus for clarity are not included. b, the Arrhenius plot of [ln(dA313/dt)] versus 103 × (1/T) for the process of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 self-assembly, including values for 37, 40, 45, 50, 55, 58, and 62 °C. The data show a linear fit (r = -0.9858) with a negative slope (-16.33), which is used to calculate the activation energy, Ea = 137 kJ·mol-1, with the Arrhenius equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of pH, Sugars, and Peptide Length—Self-association was studied as a function of pH at a constant temperature (58 °C) and concentration (7 mg/ml). Turbidity was seen between pH 3.8-9.8, with no aggregation detectable at lower or higher pH values. The rate of self-association was highest and the lag time was the least near neutral pH (see supplemental Fig. 8).Because sugars were previously found to inhibit protein aggregation and collagen fibril formation (37Kuznetsova N. Chi S.L. Leikin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11888-11895Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the effect of glucose and fructose were investigated for this peptide system. The addition of d-glucose (1 m) or d-fructose (1 m) to a solution of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 at 7 mg/ml, pH 7, resulted in complete inhibition of self-association at 58 °C as monitored by turbidity measurements (see supplemental Fig. 9).Reliable CD melting curves could not be obtained for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 at concentrations greater than 3 mg/ml in PBS at neutral pH because of aggregation. Because aggregation of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 is not seen at any temperature under acid conditions or in the presence of sugars, CD melting curves under these conditions represent a two-state trimer-monomer process. Thermal transitions with Tm value at 65 °C were observed at pH 3 or in the presence of glucose or fructose (data not shown).To investigate the effect of peptide length on self-association, isothermal turbidity studies were carried out on (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n, where n = 7, 8, 10, and 12. These peptides all formed stable triple helical structures with melting temperature values of Tm = 25 °C (n = 7), 47 °C (n = 8), 60 °C (n = 10), and 70 °C (n = 12) under standard conditions (38Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)7 showed no indication of self-association at 7 mg/ml at any of the temperatures studied, whereas n = 8 showed a small rise in turbidity at 7 mg/ml at 48 °C. The peptide with n = 10 showed the substantial increase reported here at various temperatures. The longest peptide, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)12, showed the highest propensity for aggregation, with self-association at lower concentrations and lower temperatures than seen for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 (see supplemental Fig. 10).Effect of Seeding on Self-assembly—To analyze the effect of seeding, a very small amount (5% v/v) of aggregated sample was added to a fresh solution of the peptide, and then the kinetics of self-association were monitored by turbidity measurements. Without seeding, (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 exhibited a lag phase of ∼12 min when incubated at 45 °C (at 7 mg/ml, pH 7). With seeding, no lag phase was observed, and the maximum turbidity was obtained much earlier but with a similar growth rate (Fig. 3). The effect of seeding is consistent with the nucleation propagation mechanism of the process of self-assembly.FIGURE 3Effect of seeding on the self-association of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10. The rise in turbidity of the peptide sample at concentration 7 mg/ml, pH 7, at a constant temperature of 45 °C is monitored with seeding (····) and without seeding (—).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Self-association Studies at a Constant Heating Rate: Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Turbidity Studies of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10To further characterize the process of self-association, DSC measurements at a constant heating rate were carried out to monitor the temperature dependence of the heat capacity. Under non-aggregating conditions (at pH 3 or in the presence of sugars), the DSC of the peptide shows only one transition at 65 °C, representing the native trimer to unfolded monomer transition (data not shown). Under aggregating conditions, the DSC of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 at pH 7 (7 mg/ml) shows two transitions upon heating, with a first peak at 65 °C and a second peak at 92 °C (Fig. 4). The first peak represents the unfolding of individual triple helices, whereas the second peak represents the melting of the aggregated form of the peptide. The CD spectrum taken at 95 °C shows that only unfolded single chains are present at very high temperatures (see supplemental Fig. 11), indicating that the second DSC peak represents the melting of an associated form into unfolded monomers. The appearance of a second peak higher than the triple helix melting temperature suggests that interactions between triple helices within an aggregate contributes extra stability, raising the transition temperature by almost 25 °C.FIGURE 4The DSC profile (—) of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 at 7 mg/ml, pH 7, together with the turbidity (—-) at the same heating rate, 1 °C/min. Integration of deconvoluted peaks gave ΔHcal values of 252 kJ·mol-1 for the transition at 65 °C and 162 kJ·mol-1 for the transition at 92 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the reversibility of the processes, cooling experiments were carried out at the same scan rate (1 °C/min) from 95 to 0 °C (See supplemental Fig. 12). Upon cooling from a high temperature, the DSC curve showed a dominant transition at 65 °C, reflecting the refolding of the monomers to triple helices under these conditions, as confirmed by CD studies. The observation that both cooling and heating resulted in a peak at the Tm value of 65 °C indicates that the monomer-trimer association/dissociation process is close to equilibrium and is reversible. The second DSC transition at 92 °C seen upon heating was not observed upon cooling. This suggests that aggregation does not arise directly from monomers but is dependent on the presence of native triple helices. As the temperature was cooled below the Tm value, the turbidity began to increase, indicating that refolded triple helices are capable of self-association within the aggregation-prone temperature range of 37-60 °C. With continued cooling below 30 °C, the turbidity fell, and a small negative DSC peak was observed near 20 °C, which may reflect the dissociation of some aggregate into native triple helices at low temperature. Reheating again led to the same two DSC peaks observed upon initial heating, confirming the overall reversibility of the process.Dynamic Light ScatteringDLS studies were carried out on (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 to monitor peptide size, homogeneity, and aggregation (Fig. 5). The translational diffusion coefficient of the sample derived from DLS was processed to derive a size distribution of the molecular assemblies in terms of hydrodynamic radius (Rh). The size distribution profile of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 at 7 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7, was determined at low temperatures, where there is no aggregation. At 4 °C the initial peptide sample gave an apparent hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 1.9 nm, consistent with a single population of native triple helices (Fig. 5a). When heated to 58 °C, rapid peptide aggregation occurred and saturated the system, preventing the recording of DSL data. However, when the 58 °C aggregated sample was cooled back to 4 °C, it immediately became completely soluble. The DLS again showed a single population with Rh = 1.9 nm (Fig. 5b), and the CD spectra showed that the peptide was fully triple helical (supplemental Fig. 11). This indicates that the aggregation process is fully reversible.FIGURE 5Dynamic light scattering analysis of the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of molecular species for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, 7 mg/ml PBS, pH = 7. a, original sample at 4 °C before aggregation; b, sample returned to 4 °C after aggregation at 58 °C; c, sample kept at 37 °C for 60 min (end of lag phase); d, sample kept at 37 °C for 80 min (beginning of growth phase).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize the presence of any smaller aggregates within the range of DLS capability, a sample of (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 at 7 mg/ml was monitored at 37 °C, where the lag time was very long (>1 h).

https://openalex.org/W2160259240,"A major goal in antibody design for cancer therapy is to tailor the pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule according to specific treatment requirements. Key parameters determining the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic antibodies are target specificity, affinity, stability, and size. Using the p185HER-2 (HER-2)-specific scFv 4D5 as model system, we analyzed how changes in molecular weight and valency independently affect antigen binding and tumor localization. By employing multimerization and PEGylation, four different antibody formats were generated and compared with the scFv 4D5. First, dimeric and tetrameric miniantibodies were constructed by fusion of self-associating, disulfide-linked peptides to the scFv 4D5. Second, we attached a 20-kDa PEG moiety to the monovalent scFv and to the divalent miniantibody at the respective C terminus. In all formats, serum stability and full binding reactivity of the scFv 4D5 were retained. Functional affinity, however, did change. An avidity increase was achieved by multimerization, whereas PEGylation resulted in a 5-fold decreased affinity. Nevertheless, the PEGylated monomer showed an 8.5-fold, and the PEGylated dimer even a 14.5-fold higher tumor accumulation than the corresponding scFv, 48 h post-injection, because of a significantly longer serum half-life. In comparison, the non-PEGylated bivalent and tetravalent miniantibodies showed only a moderate increase in tumor localization compared with the scFv, which correlated with the degree of multimerization. However, these non-PEGylated formats resulted in higher tumor-to-blood ratios. Both multimerization and PEGylation represent thus useful strategies to tailor the pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic antibodies and their combined use can additively improve tumor targeting.

However, these non-PEGylated formats resulted in higher tumor-to-blood ratios. Both multimerization and PEGylation represent thus useful strategies to tailor the pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic antibodies and their combined use can additively improve tumor targeting. Antibodies have attracted attention as cancer therapeutics, because of their ability to specifically bind to cell surface antigens selectively expressed on tumor cells (1Borrebaeck C.A. Carlsson R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Moroney S.E. Plückthun A. Knäblein J. Modern Biopharmaceuticals. 3. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2005: 1147-1186Google Scholar). Using unarmed antibodies, fusion proteins, or chemical immunoconjugates various strategies have been investigated, which include the direct delivery of cytotoxic agents, such as radionuclides, small molecule drugs, or protein toxins (3Wu A.M. Senter P.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Moreover, indirect strategies have also been investigated, which include blocking of cellular growth factors or their receptors, recruitment of cellular or complement-dependent cytotoxicity or induction of apoptosis by receptor engagement (2Moroney S.E. Plückthun A. Knäblein J. Modern Biopharmaceuticals. 3. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2005: 1147-1186Google Scholar, 4Trikha M. Yan L. Nakada M.T. Curr. Opin.

Depending on the desired mode of action, the pharmacokinetic properties of the therapeutic molecule need to meet different requirements. When a cytotoxic principle is used, it is essential that the action is restricted to the tumor site as much as possible, and that the activity in normal tissues is limited both in magnitude and duration. Conversely, if the mode of action does not include a cytotoxic mechanism, accumulation in normal tissues may be less harmful, and high concentration at the tumor site can be the main criterion. The in vivo behavior of the antibody format is dictated by its molecular properties. Therefore, to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies, understanding how changes of the molecular format may affect the pharmacokinetic behavior is crucial. Critical determinants of tumor targeting efficiency are specificity, affinity, valency, stability, surface charge, and size (6Adams G.P. Schier R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7LeSauteur L. Cheung N.K. Lisbona R. Saragovi H.U. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1120-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focus on two of these parameters: functional affinity (avidity) and molecular size. Increasing the functional affinity of antibodies usually results in increased tumor localization and retention. However, there seems to be an upper limit in affinity beyond which no further improvement can be achieved (6Adams G.P. Schier R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Adams G.P. Schier R. McCall A.M. Simmons H.H. Horak E.M. Alpaugh R.K. Marks J.D. Weiner L.M.

Med. 1990; 31: 1191-1198PubMed Google Scholar): in the “loading phase”, the total dose of antigen-bound antibody molecules accumulating at the tumor is limited by plasma clearance (depletion of the plasma pool) and diffusion, in addition to the total amount injected (bolus size). In the “retention phase,” antigen metabolism, which includes shedding and internalization, may become rate limiting, if this occurs faster than antibody dissociation (10Fujimori K. Covell D.G. Fletcher J.E. Weinstein J.N. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5656-5663PubMed Google Scholar, 11Graff C.P. Wittrup K.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1288-1296PubMed Google Scholar, 12Weinstein J.N. Eger R.R.

(14Jackson H. Bacon L. Pedley R.B. Derbyshire E. Field A. Osbourn J. Allen D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) antibodies of different affinities demonstrated that for a tumor antigen with the turnover rate of HER-2, raising the affinity above 10-9 m no longer translates into increased tumor accumulation. One way to augment the functional affinity (avidity) of antibodies is to increase the number of binding sites (15Rheinnecker M. Hardt C. Ilag L.L. Kufer P. Gruber R. Hoess A. Lupas A. Rottenberger C. Plückthun A. Pack P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2989-2997PubMed Google Scholar, 16Plückthun A. Pack P. Immunotechnology. 1997; 3: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Multivalency in principle allows the antibody to simultaneously bind to more than one target molecule on the tumor cell, provided that this is geometrically possible. By potentially affecting target dimerization, multimeric antibody formats may also increase antigen uptake and signaling. Whether this is desirable or not depends on the target and the effector mechanism of the antibody construct. An increase in valency also results in increased molecular size, which will affect pharmacokinetics, extravasation, and diffusion, and thus tissue distribution. Indeed, there is an inverse relationship between the effect of molecular size on systemic clearance and tissue penetration, which both affect tumor targeting, albeit in opposite ways (6Adams G.P. Schier R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 231: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Small antibody formats such as scFv fragments (25-30 kDa) show rapid tumor localization and efficient diffusion into the tumor mass, reaching maximal accumulation after 0.5-6 h. Their systemic clearance is fast and occurs mainly through renal excretion, since their molecular weight is below the threshold of the filtration barrier in the kidney glomeruli (∼65 kDa) (17Chang R.L.

Sigulem D. Kidney Int. 1979; 16: 251-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). This results in rather low concentrations of scFv molecules in the circulation, which in turn reduces unspecific accumulation in non-target tissues, but it also reduces the total dose localizing to the tumor (19Batra S.K. Jain M. Wittel U.A. Chauhan S.C. Colcher D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). On the other hand, large molecules, such as whole IgGs, show poor extravasation and slower tissue diffusion (20Chester K.A. Hawkins R.E. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 294-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Ross J.S. Gray K. Gray G.S. Worland P.J. Rolfe M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2003; 119: 472-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). At the same time, they can exhibit prolonged serum half-lives of up to several weeks (19Batra S.K. Jain M. Wittel U.A. Chauhan S.C. Colcher D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), because they avoid renal excretion and are instead removed by the more delayed hepatic clearance (22Olafsen T. Kenanova V.E. Sundaresan G. Anderson A.L. Crow D. Yazaki P.J. Li L. Press M.F. Gambhir S.S. Williams L.E. Wong J.Y. Raubitschek A.A. Shively J.E. Wu A.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5907-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The resulting high serum concentration favors accumulation in the tumor, but also unspecific localization in non-target tissues. To define the optimal format for particular applications, various antibody formats including scFv fragments, Fab fragments, disulfide-stabilized Fv fragments (dsFv), minibodies, and miniantibodies (16Plückthun A. Pack P. Immunotechnology. 1997; 3: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) have been engineered and tested in biodistribution experiments.

Here we systematically examined the molecular and tumor targeting properties of a series of antibody formats all derived from the same antibody fragment, as a step toward a better understanding of the relation and interdependence of these factors. As a model system, we used the humanized scFv 4D5 (24Carter P. Kelley R.F. Rodrigues M.L. Snedecor B. Covarrubias M. Velligan M.D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C.E. Carver M.E. Yang M. Bourell J.H.

Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This antibody shows above-average thermodynamic and serum stability and binds selectively with high affinity to its target antigen, the extracellular domain of p185HER-2 (35Willuda J. Kubetzko S.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (referred to here as HER-2). HER-2 is a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the family of human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER) (43Nahta R. Hortobagyi G.N. Esteva F.J. Oncologist. 2003; 8: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 44Cho H.S. Mason K. Ramyar K.X. Stanley A.M. Gabelli S.B. Denney Jr., D.W. Leahy D.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). It is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and in a variety of other tumors of epithelial origin (45Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar, 46Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar). It plays a key role in HER ligand-dependent tumor growth and can either form homo- or heterodimers with other HER receptors (47Rubin I. Yarden Y. Ann. Oncol. 2001; 12: S3-S8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Based on the scFv 4D5, we constructed four different antibody formats by multimerization and PEGylation, and compared their molecular and tumor targeting properties to those of the scFv 4D5 itself. First, dimeric and tetrameric miniantibodies were constructed by fusion of self-associating peptides to the C terminus of the scFv 4D5. In this approach an increase in valency was combined with a change in size from 29 kDa (monomeric scFv) to 66 kDa (dimer), which is slightly above the renal filtration threshold, and up to 130 kDa (tetramer), which is almost the size of a whole IgG. To further stabilize the multimeric formats and prevent their dissociation at high dilution, the multimerization domains were covalently linked by structure-guided introduction of disulfide bridges. In the second approach a 20-kDa polyethylene glycol moiety (PEG20) was site-specifically attached to the C terminus of the scFv 4D5. Thereby, the molecular weight of the antibody fragment was increased without altering its valency to enable us to discriminate the effects because of valency from those due to size. The PEG molecule is a non-immunogenic, hydrophilic polymer, rapidly fluctuating between bulky and extended structures (48Bailon P. Palleroni A. Schaffer C.A. Spence C.L. Fung W.J. Porter J.E.

Janjua H. Peng P. Longley C. Borowski V. Mehlig M. Filpula D. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because a PEG-tail is not a rigid moiety, but quite flexible, it can also act to shield protein sites from recognition by the immune system, cellular receptors, or proteases (51Cunningham-Rundles C. Zhuo Z. Griffith B. Keenan J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 152: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, multimerization and PEGylation were combined by site-specific PEGylation of the dimeric miniantibody. To assess the potential of these modifications for tailoring effective antibody therapeutics, the various formats were compared regarding their antigen binding properties, serum stability, and in vivo biodistribution. By individually testing multimerization and PEGylation, we wished to differentiate the influence of changes in functional affinity from those of molecular size on the pharmacokinetic and tumor targeting behavior. Tumor Cell Line and Recombinant Antigen—For in vitro cell binding experiments, as well as for tumor localization and biodistribution studies in vivo, the ovarian carcinoma cell line SK-OV-3 (HTB 77, ECACC, Salisbury, Wilts, UK) was used. Cell culture was performed as described (35Willuda J. Kubetzko S. Waibel R. Schubiger P.A. Zangemeister-Wittke U. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14385-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant antigen HER-2-ECD was kindly provided by Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA. Molecular Modeling of the Multimerization Domains to Determine Suitable Positions for Introduction of Disulfide Bonds—The three-dimensional models of the multimerization domains were generated by using the molecular modeling software InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The model of the dimerization domain dhlx was obtained from the average NMR structure of the corresponding synthetic peptide (52Hill R.B. deGrado W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 1138-1145Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The model of the tetramerization domain p53 was based on the crystal structure of the corresponding human peptide (53Mittl P.R. Chene P. Grütter M.G. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Potential positions for insertion of disulfide bonds were determined with the program MODIP (54Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) using the following search parameters: allowed Cα-Cα distance ≤7.4 Å, allowed Cβ-Cβ distance ≤4.7 Å, pseudo bond angles in the range of 60° to 180° and disallowed pseudo-dihedral angles between 60° and 80°. The resulting models of the multimerization domains with cross-linked peptide chains were checked for possible strain and clashes. Construction of the Cysteine Mutants—The dimeric miniantibodies with C-terminal (4D5-dhlx-Cys) or internal cysteines (4D5-dhlx-SS) were derived from the construct 4D5-dhlx (35Willuda J. Kubetzko S. Waibel R. Schubiger P.A. Zangemeister-Wittke U. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14385-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mutant 4D5-dhlx-SS with internal cysteines was generated by a two-step PCR mutagenesis of the dimerization domain, using the primer dhlx-m2 (5′-CCCCGCAAAGGCGAACTCTGCGAACTGCTGAAACATCTGAAGGAGCTGTGTAAAGGTG), which encodes point mutations that replace Glu23 and Ile33 of the dhlx domain by cysteines. The same method was applied to obtain the tetrameric miniantibody 4D5-p53-SS. For introducing a cysteine at position Ala347 of the tetramerization domain we used the primer tetracys-fwd (5′-GCTGAATGAGTGCTTGGAAC) and performed PCR amplification of the vector template pIG6-4D5-p53 (35Willuda J.

For the monomeric scFv 4D5 the cysteine was introduced by PCR mutagenesis using the primer sk-cyst.rev (5′-GCATAAGCTTTCATTAACAACCACCGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTGGTTCAGGTCTTCTTCAG), which encodes a Gly2-linker, followed by a single unpaired cysteine, 2 stop codons, and a HindIII restriction site. The dimeric miniantibody 4D5-dhlx-Cys with C-terminal cysteines was generated by ligation of the EcoRI/HindIII fragment of the plasmid pAK300-B2 into the vector pIG6-4D5 (35Willuda J. Kubetzko S.

This insert was thereby placed downstream of the variable domains of the scFv 4D5 and contained the dimerization domain dhlx, followed by a His6 tag, a Gly4 spacer, and a cysteine. All four different antibody constructs were inserted into the expression vector pIG6 (57Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 229-266Google Scholar), like their unmodified counterparts. The correct DNA sequences of the new constructs were confirmed. Expression and Purification—The expression and purification of the 4D5 antibody fragments are described in detail under supplementary materials. Briefly, all antibody constructs were expressed in the periplasm of the Escherichia coli strain SB536 (58Bass S. Gu Q. Christen A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and purified at 4 °C by Ni-NTA chromatography and then protein A-Sepharose (because this VH domain binds to protein A). The purified proteins were analyzed by UV-spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. PEGylation of the 4D5 Miniantibodies—The PEGylation procedure of monomeric (scFv 4D5-Cys) and dimeric (4D5-dhlx-Cys) miniantibodies is described under supplementary materials. Briefly, purified protein samples were concentrated to ∼0.3-1 mg/ml. The C-terminal cysteine residue was selectively reduced by preincubation with 3 mm dithiothreitol (final concentration) before incubation with a 5-10-fold molar excess of maleimide-PEG20 (Nektar, Huntsville, AL) for 2 h at 37 °C. The efficiency of PEGylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. The same chromatography procedure was used to purify the PEGylated proteins from both the native antibody fragments and the unreacted free PEG. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical gel filtration analysis of the multimerized and PEGylated antibody fragments was performed with an ÄKTAexplorer chromatography system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) at 4 °C and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, using a Superdex-200 column (24-ml bed volume). The column was equilibrated with filtered and degassed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), containing 1 m NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20. For calibration, five protein standards were used: β-amylase (β-Amyl, 200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, 150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (CA, 29 kDa) and cytochrome c (Cyt c, 12.5 kDa). The exclusion volume of this Superdex-200 column was experimentally determined as 8 ml by injection of dextran blue (∼2000 kDa). Samples of the different antibody formats were injected at concentrations between 500 μg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml in a volume of 100 μl. The absorption was recorded at 280, 260, and 230 nm. If impurities or a low PEGylation yield (less than 80%) were detected, preparative size exclusion chromatography under the same conditions was used as an additional purification step. His Tag-specific 99mTc Labeling of the Miniantibodies— The radioactive labeling of the 4D5 miniantibodies with 99mTc(CO)3 was performed essentially as described before (56Waibel R. Alberto R.

All constructs were rebuffered with 0.5 m MES, pH 6.5 and concentrated to ∼0.7-1.3 mg/ml. In the labeling reaction they were mixed with freshly prepared 99mTc(CO)3 (56Waibel R. Alberto R. Willuda J.

The degree of incorporation was checked by gel filtration analysis on a Sephadex G-25 fast desalting column (HiLoad system, GE Healthcare) connected to a HPLC radioactivity monitor (LB 508, Berthold). Unreacted free 99mTc(CO)3 was removed by desalting, using a Biospin-6 column (BioRAD), equilibrated with PBS. The eluted protein samples were quantified for the total amount of incorporated radioactivity by γ-scintillation counting.

We used the fossil record of seep mollusks to show that the living seep genera have significantly longer geologic ranges than the marine mollusks in general, but have ranges similar to those of deep-sea taxa, suggesting that seep faunas may be shaped by the factors that drive the evolution of life in the deep sea in general. Our data indicate that deep-sea anoxic/dysoxic events did not affect seep faunas, casting doubt on the suggested anoxic nature and/or global extent of these events."

https://openalex.org/W2085605010,"Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) are a novel class of binding proteins that bind their target protein with high affinity and specificity and have very favorable expression and stability properties. We describe here the in vitro selection of DARPins against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), an important target for cancer therapy and diagnosis. Several DARPins bind to the same epitope as trastuzumab (Herceptin), but none were selected that bind to the epitope of pertuzumab (Omnitarg). Some of the selected DARPins bind with low nanomolar affinity (Kd = 7.3 nm) to the target. Further analysis revealed that all DARPins are highly specific and do not cross-react with epidermal growth factor receptor I (EGFR1) or any other investigated protein. The selected DARPins specifically bind to strongly Her2-overexpressing cell lines such as SKBR-3 but also recognize small amounts of Her2 on weakly expressing cell lines such as MCF-7. Furthermore, the DARPins also lead to a highly specific and strong staining of plasma membranes of paraffinated sections of human mamma-carcinoma tissue. Thus, the selected DARPins might be used for the development of diagnostic tests for the status of Her2 overexpression in different adenocarcinomas, and they may be further evaluated for their potential in targeted therapy since their favorable expression properties make the construction of fusion proteins very convenient.

Targeting of tumor cells with antibodies has been widely studied during the last decades as an alternative and a complement to conventional chemotherapy. Dozens of monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor antigens are in clinical trials, and several have been approved as drugs (1Moroney S. Plückthun A. Knäblein J. Müller R.H. Modern Biopharmaceuticals. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim, Germany2005: 1147-1185Google Scholar). These antibodies work by different actions, including steric hindrance of ligand binding, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or complement activation. The high specificity of these approaches and the generally low toxicity of human antibodies reduce the severe side effects inherent in conventional chemotherapy approaches. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/c-neu, ErbB2) is a member of the EGF 5The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; DARPin, designed ankyrin repeat protein; ECD, extracellular domain; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. receptor family. Its use as a target for antibody-based cancer therapy has been widely studied. The members of the EGF receptor family are able to form different homo- and heterodimers leading to altered ligand specificities. This behavior gives rise to a complex signaling network (2Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5633) Google Scholar). In various tumors, members of the EGF receptor family are overexpressed, leading to abnormal hetero- and homodimer formation and, consequently, to altered ligand binding and aberrant signaling. Her2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of all breast cancer patients, and its overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis (3Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9954) Google Scholar). Several monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of Her2 have been described, which show therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of Her2-positive breast cancer; Trastuzumab (Herceptin™) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (4Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C. Carver M.E. Shepard H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4285-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar), which binds to the membrane-adjacent cysteine-rich domain, termed domain IV (5Cho H.S. Mason K. Ramyar K.X. Stanley A.M. Gabelli S.B. Denney Jr., D.W. Leahy D.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). The mode of action is still not elucidated completely but most likely includes inhibition of shedding of the ECD from the plasma membrane by proteases (6Molina M.A. Codony-Servat J. Albanell J. Rojo F. Arribas J. Baselga J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4744-4749PubMed Google Scholar) and induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (4Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D.

Ravetch J.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). In contrast, the monoclonal antibody 2C4, also known as pertuzumab or Omnitarg™, binds to a hairpin structure on domain II, which is important for homo- and heterodimerization (8Franklin M.C. Carey K.D. Vajdos F.F. Leahy D.J. de Vos A.M. Sliwkowski M.X. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). It sterically blocks the engagement of Her2 in homo- and heterodimeric complexes and thus inhibits ligand-induced signaling (9Agus D.B. Akita R.W. Fox W.D. Lewis G.D. Higgins B. Pisacane P.I. Lofgren J.A. Tindell C. Evans D.P. Maiese K. Scher H.I. Sliwkowski M.X. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Some of the therapeutic antibodies are also of diagnostic relevance since the expression pattern of tumor antigens can highly vary from patient to patient and the presence of a tumor marker has to be verified in each case in diagnostic tests before applying an immune therapy. Despite the great conceptual advantages over conventional chemotherapy, the efficacy of IgGs in tumor therapy is modest and almost never leads to a cure, as seen, e.g. in a phase III trial with trastuzumab (10Cobleigh M.A. Vogel C.L. Tripathy D. Robert N.J. Scholl S. Fehrenbacher L. Wolter J.M. Paton V. Shak S. Lieberman G. Slamon D.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2639-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Adams G.P. Weiner L.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Therefore, complementary approaches, including the fusion of targeting agents with drug-converting enzymes, cytokines, or toxins or the generation of bispecific antibodies to recruit effector cells, are continuously being developed. However, these approaches are often limited by the difficulty in manufacturing these molecules (12Wu A.M. Senter P.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). These considerations gave rise to the development of alternative binding proteins, which retain the beneficial properties of antibodies, such as high specificity and affinity, but which overcome some of the limitations described above (13Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel approach to generate alternative binding molecules based on repeat proteins has been described (14Forrer P. Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Plückthun A. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Binz H.K. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Repeat proteins are, next to antibodies, the most abundant binding proteins found in nature (16Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 17Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). They are built from a single structural motif, termed repeat module, which is assembled to a repeat domain. Due to sequence homologies of the single repeat modules, a consensus sequence could be deduced from natural ankyrin repeat proteins, which consists of conserved framework residues and randomized interaction residues (14Forrer P. Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Plückthun A. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). By assembly of the randomized repeat modules, complex libraries of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) can be generated. The number of randomized repeat modules used determines the size of the final protein, and with increasing numbers of repeat modules, the interaction interface and the library diversity can be increased. DARPins were shown to exhibit extraordinary stability and expression yield in Escherichia coli (18Kohl A. Binz H.K. Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Plückthun A. Grütter M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol.

Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Using complex DARPin libraries, binding molecules could be isolated that show great selectivity, specificity, and affinity in the recognition of their cognate antigen (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 21Amstutz P. Binz H.K. Parizek P. Stumpp M.T. Kohl A.

Since they encode no cysteines, they can be used for intracellular and extracellular targets. We show here the in vitro selection of DARPins binding to epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) using ribosome display. We tested the selected DARPins for binding to the extracellular domain of Her2 (Her2 ECD) in vitro, to tumor cells in cell culture, and in situ on paraffinated Her2-positive breast cancer tissues. In addition, we investigated the cross-reactivity to epidermal growth factor receptor 1 and analyzed the epitopes bound by the selected DARPins using competition studies with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The high specificity and affinity and the good expression yield of the selected DARPins in bacteria are encouraging for the development of novel diagnostic applications in vivo and in vitro. In addition, further studies can now be carried out to explore their therapeutic potential. Selection Using Ribosome Display—The selection of DARPins binding to Her2 ECD was performed in parallel using two different libraries consisting of two and three randomized modules between an N- and C-terminal capping repeat, thus termed N2C and N3C, respectively. The generation of these libraries has been described previously (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We used the extracellular domain (residues 1-621) of Her2 (Genentech) as target for the selection with ribosome display (22Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). For the first three rounds, Her2 ECD was immobilized directly on a Maxisorp plate (Nunc) by incubation overnight of 2 μg of Her2 ECD in PBS150 (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C. To block unspecific binding sites, Her2 ECD-coated plates were washed three times with PBS150 and incubated for at least 2 h with 0.5% BSA in TBST500 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). For selection rounds 4-6, Her2 ECD was biotinylated. The biotinylation was performed by incubation of a 9.8 μm solution of Her2 ECD with a 20-fold molar excess of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-6-hexanamido hexanoate (sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin, Pierce) in PBS150 on ice for 2 h. The biotinylated Her2 was dialyzed extensively against PBS150, and the degree of biotinylation was determined as 3.1 molecules of biotin/molecule of Her2, using the 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene) benzoic acid (HABA) assay (Pierce). Round four was performed on 75 nm biotinylated Her2 ECD immobilized on a NeutrAvidin-coated Maxisorp plate (Nunc). For the coating of NeutrAvidin, 100 μl of a 66 nm solution of NeutrAvidin in PBS150 were incubated in a Maxisorp plate at 4 °C overnight. In round five, the selection pressure was increased by applying off-rate selection. For this purpose, after the in vitro translation was stopped by 5-fold dilution into ice-cold WBT buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Mg(CH3COO-)2, 0.05% Tween 20), biotinylated Her2 ECD was added to a final concentration of 10 nm, and the translation was allowed to equilibrate for 2 h at 4 °C. The translation reaction was split into two aliquots, and non-biotinylated Her2 ECD was added to a final concentration of 1 μm to each aliquot, corresponding to a 100-fold excess over biotinylated antigen. The aliquots were incubated for 2 and 20 h, respectively, to increase the selection stringency for slower off rates (23Zahnd C. Spinelli S. Luginbühl B. Amstutz P. Cambillau C. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18870-18877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Ribosomal complexes were recovered using 30 μl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Roche Applied Science). In round six, 175 nm biotinylated Her2 ECD was immobilized on a NeutrAvidin-coated Maxisorp plate. A summary of the selection process is given in Fig. 1. In all selection rounds on solid-phase immobilized Her2 ECD, a prepanning step of 30 min on a neutravidin-coated Maxisorp plate was performed as described (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). After prepanning, the translation extracts were allowed to bind for 45 min to Her2 ECD-coated Maxisorp plates. Retained complexes were extensively washed with WBT buffer. Isolated mRNA was purified and reverse-transcribed using the oligonucleotide tolAk (5′-CCGCACACCAGTAAGGTGTGCGGTTTCAGTTGCCGCTTTCTTTCT-3′) and PCR amplified using the oligonucleotides T7B (5′-ATACGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACAACgg-3′) and tolAk (rounds 1-3) or WTC4 (5′-TTTGGGAAGCTTTTGCAGGATTTCAGC-3′) for rounds 4-6. When amplifying with primer WTC4, the tolA spacer had to be fused to the library again. Therefore, the selected pools were digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into pRDV (GenBank™ accession number AY327136). The ribosome display construct was PCR-amplified from the purified ligation using primers T7B and tolAk (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). All amplifications were performed using Vent DNA polymerase under stringent conditions. The mutation rate was not artificially increased during amplification. Radioimmunoassay—To monitor the enrichment of specific DARPins in the pools, radioimmunoassays were performed after each selection round. Translation of pool mRNA was performed as described previously (23Zahnd C. Spinelli S. Luginbühl B. Amstutz P. Cambillau C. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18870-18877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Auf der Maur A. Zahnd C. Fischer F. Spinelli S. Honegger A. Cambillau C. Escher D. Plückthun A.

The stopped translation mixtures were allowed to bind to surface-immobilized Her2 ECD as for the selection rounds for 30 min in the presence of 1% skimmed milk. After washing, the bound radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. Analysis of Selected Pools and Individual Clones—DNA of the selected pools after round 6 was amplified with primers SD_EWT5 (5′-AGACCACAACGGTTTCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATATCCATGGGTATGAGAGGATCG-3′) and WTC4 and cloned via BamHI and HindIII into pQE30 (Qiagen). The pools were transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue, and single clones were picked for plasmid preparation. Crude extracts of 1 ml of overnight protein expression cultures in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose were prepared according to previous protocols (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Crude extracts were assayed by comparing the binding to wells containing immobilized Her2 ECD (0.5 μg/well) with the binding to wells containing NeutrAvidin alone (66 nm, 100 μl/well, Pierce). Detection was performed via an anti-RGS-His6 antibody (Qiagen) and an anti-mouse-IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Pierce). For competition ELISA, the crude extracts were incubated with soluble Her2 ECD prior to binding to the Maxisorp plate for 1 h at 4°C. Quantitative ELISAs were performed as described for the crude extract analysis, except that purified protein was used at 25 nm (see below). Protein Production and Purification—For competition ELISAs, Biacore, flow cytometry, and tissue staining experiments, the DARPins were expressed on a 500-ml scale and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid gravity flow column as described (19Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For Biacore analysis, the proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 column in PBS150 as described (19Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Selected binders from each sequence group were cloned into the vector p254 with the restriction enzymes BamHI/HindIII, introducing a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (LYPYDVPDYA) to the C terminus of the ankyrin protein. p254 was constructed as follows. The two 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides r-cHA-Hind (5′-P-AGCTCTATTAGCGTAGTCCGGAACGTCGTACGGGTAA-3′) and f-cHA-Hind (5′-P-AGCTTTACCCGTACGACGTTCCGGACTACGCTTAATAG-3′) were annealed to each other and inserted into the HindIII site of pQE30 (Qiagen) via HindIII. HA-tagged ankyrin repeat proteins were expressed and purified as described for the RGS-His6-tagged proteins. The single-chain Fv antibody fragment 4D5 was expressed from the plasmid pIG6 (25Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 229-266Google Scholar) in E. coli strain SB536 (26Bass S. Gu Q. Christen A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (27Willuda J. Kubetzko S. Waibel R. Schubiger P.A. Zangemeister-Wittke U. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14385-14392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance—Monovalent affinities were measured for selected binders using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore). The measurements were performed in HBST (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20). Biotinylated Her2 was immobilized on a CM5 chip (Biacore), on which NeutrAvidin had previously been coated using amine coupling chemistry (according to the Biacore manual), to a final density of about 150 resonance units. The monomeric fraction of purified DARPins was injected at a flow rate of 100 μl/min at concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 1 μm, including a buffer control. The off rate was followed for at least 10 min. Data evaluation was performed by global fitting using BIAevaluation (Biacore), Scrubber (BioLogic software), and Clamp (28Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Flow Cytometry—Breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin (10,000 units/ml), and 1% streptomycin (10 mg/ml). SKBR-3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin (10,000 units/ml), and 1% streptomycin (10 mg/ml). The cells were harvested at 80% confluence by trypsinization. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS150 containing 1% BSA at 107 cells/ml. DARPins bearing a C-terminal HA tag were added to 1 ml of cells to a final concentration of 50 nm and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS150/BSA containing anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics, clone 12CA5, 30 min of incubation on ice according to the manufacturer's manual), pelleted again, and resuspended in PBS150/BSA containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-mouse antibody (20 min of incubation on ice). The cells were washed with PBS150/BSA and resuspended in CytoFix buffer (BD Biosciences) to a final density of 107 cells/ml. Measurements were performed on a Beckman Coulter Epics Altra machine at a flow rate of 500-700 s-1. Fluorescence was detected at 525 nm after excitation with an argon laser at 488 nm. Data were analyzed using the software WinMDI (Version 2.8) and Microsoft Excel. Staining of Tissue Sections—Paraffin-embedded human breast tissue specimens were cut into 5-μm sections and mounted on SuperFrost Plus microscope slides (Menzel-Gläser). Sections were deparaffinized in xylene (2 × 5 min) and sequentially hydrated by soaking first in 100% ethanol (2 × 5 min), 95% ethanol (2 × 5 min), and 75% ethanol (2 × 5 min) and finally rinsed in water for 2 min. The rehydrated tissue sections were incubated in pepsin epitope retrieval solution (25 mg of pepsin in 5 mm HCl) for 15 min at 37 °C. The sections were allowed to cool to ambient temperature for another 15 min and then transferred to the serum blocking solution (10% fetal calf serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) for 45 min. DARPins were diluted to a concentration of 200 nm in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, 155 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 and 1% BSA, pH 7.2), added to the specimen, and incubated for 45 min. After the DARPin binding step, endogenous peroxidase was blocked for 5 min using the LSAB2 kit (Dako). Thereafter, the murine anti-HA antibody (Roche Diagnostics, clone 12CA5) was diluted 1:4000 in binding buffer and administered for 45 min. For the secondary antibody and the developing step, the LSAB2 kit (Dako) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the specimens were counterstained for 45 s in a hematoxylin bath and thoroughly rinsed with water. The slides were mounted using the Faramount kit (Dako). Selection of DARPins Using Ribosome Display—We used ribosome display to select DARPins against the extracellular domain of Her2 (Her2 ECD) from designed ankyrin-repeat protein libraries (19Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Ribosome display is a method to select polypeptide binders from large libraries in vitro. The selection is based on ternary complexes of ribosome, mRNA without a stop codon, and the newly synthesized polypeptide that form in the translation reaction and are stable after cooling (22Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). We used two different libraries in parallel with two or three randomized repeat modules between N-terminal and C-terminal capping repeats, termed N2C and N3C, respectively. The selection procedure is summarized in Fig. 1. Six panning rounds were performed to enrich for specific DARPins for Her2 ECD. The first three rounds were performed with non-biotinylated Her2 ECD. The antigen was directly coated to a microtiter plate. To be able to perform the selection rounds in solution and to increase the selection pressure by off-rate selections, Her2 ECD was biotinylated. From round 4 on, all subsequent selection rounds were performed on biotinylated antigen. The number of PCR cycles needed to recover the mRNA pools after reverse transcription decreased from round to round, which was an indication for the enrichment of specific DARPins. After the first round, 40 cycles of amplification with PCR were used. After the second round, only 35 cycles of amplification were needed to generate comparable amounts of a specific PCR band, as visualized on an agarose gel, and 30 cycles were sufficient after the third round. In the fifth round, the pools were subjected to off-rate selection (23Zahnd C. Spinelli S. Luginbühl B. Amstutz P. Cambillau C. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18870-18877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) to enrich for binders with slower off rates. For this purpose, the pools were equilibrated with 10 nm biotinylated Her2 ECD. Non-biotinylated Her2 ECD was then added to a final concentration of 1 μm, resulting in a 100-fold excess of competitor. After 2 and 20 h, aliquots of each pool were isolated and subjected to the standard work-up of a ribosome display round (22Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). A sixth panning round was performed under non-stringent conditions as it has been shown that the concentration of binders can become very low after off-rate selections when compared with unspecific background (23Zahnd C. Spinelli S. Luginbühl B. Amstutz P. Cambillau C. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18870-18877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Pools—An indication for the specificity of the enriched DARPins in the pools for Her2 ECD was obtained by comparing the binding of the pools to immobilized Her2 ECD and to a control. Starting from the third round, selections were carried out in parallel to Her2 ECD-coated surfaces and control surfaces, coated with neutravidin or BSA. In all pools tested, only a faint band was visible for the unspecific surface when compared with the specific surface. The specific enrichment for binders during off-rate selection was further monitored by radioimmunoassays of the pools after rounds 4 and 5 (23Zahnd C. Spinelli S. Luginbühl B. Amstutz P. Cambillau C. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18870-18877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The binding signal of the pools to immobilized Her2 ECD increased significantly, whereas the binding signal to an unspecific surface remained about constant. For the N3C pool, 184 cpm of activity bound to a Her2 ECD-coated well after round 4 and 3345 cpm of activity bound after round 5 (18-fold more), whereas the binding activity on a neutravidin-coated surface was 180 and 206 cpm after rounds 4 and 5, respectively. The enriched pools after rounds 3 and 6 were ligated into the expression plasmid pQE30, and E. coli strain XL1-Blue was transformed for plasmid preparation and expression. Single clones of these pools were assayed in a crude extract ELISA in the 96-well format. After round 3, one DARPin showed significant binding over background out of 48 assayed clones from the N2C pool, and two showed significant binding over background out of 48 assayed clones for the N3C pool. After round 6, 57 out of 120 assayed clones (48%) showed specific binding in the N2C pool, and 19 out of 60 (32%) showed specific binding in the N3C pool. None of the assayed DARPin sequences showed significant binding to a BSA-coated microtiter plate. All clones showing binding signals were sequenced. Sequence analysis of the selected clones of the N2C library revealed that most clones belonged to three sequence families (Fig. 2), representing 56, 23, and 13% of all specific binders in this pool, respectively. The members within one family only differed in a few positions. Four clones have been found several times. Only 3 out of the 57 analyzed clones did not belong to any of these major sequence families.

In Xenopus, Claspin interacts with Chk1 after DNA damage through a region containing two highly conserved repeats, which becomes phosphorylated during the checkpoint response. Because this region is also conserved in human Claspin, we investigated the regulation and function of these potential phosphorylation sites in human Claspin. We found that Claspin is phosphorylated in vivo at Thr-916 in response to replication stress and UV damage. Mutation of these phosphorylation sites on Claspin inhibited Claspin-Chk1 interaction in vivo, impaired Chk1 activation, and induced premature chromatin condensation in cells, indicating a defect in replication checkpoint. In addition, we found that Thr-916 on Claspin is phosphorylated by Chk1, suggesting that Chk1 regulates Claspin during checkpoint response.

Genomic integrity of DNA is maintained by checkpoint mechanisms that monitor DNA damage or incomplete replication. These cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms, once activated, delay the cell cycle transitions to allow damage to be repaired or replication to be completed. Key components of the checkpoint pathway are ATM 2The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; ATR, ataxia telangiectasia mutated- and Rad3-related; hClaspin, human Claspin; PCC, premature chromatin condensation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HU, hydroxyurea; UV, ultraviolet light; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and ATR, members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase family (1Kurz E.U. Lees-Miller S. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 2Schechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These kinases phosphorylate the effector kinases Chk1 and Chk2. Although the ATM-Chk2 pathway is primarily activated by ionizing radiation (IR), the ATR-Chk1 pathway is typically activated by UV damage and stalled replication forks. Chk1 is an essential protein, and its activation is involved in regulation of S phase and mitotic entry after DNA damage (3Chen Y. Sanchez Y. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Activation of Chk1 requires not only ATR but also several additional checkpoint proteins, including Claspin (4Chini C.C.S. Chen J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), Rad9, Rad17, TopBP1, and BRCA1 (3Chen Y. Sanchez Y. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these proteins work together to regulate Chk1 function remains to be elucidated. To understand how Chk1 is regulated, it was important to determine the function and regulation of these Chk1 activators. In both Xenopus and human cells Claspin has been shown to be a key regulator of Chk1 activation (5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because Claspin binds with high affinity to DNA, it has been proposed that Claspin may be a component of the replication ensemble (9Sar F. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Subramanian D. Croteau D.L. Hutsell S.Q. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39289-39295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After DNA damage and replication stress, Claspin is phosphorylated and interacts with Chk1 (5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 6Chini C.C.S. Chen J. J. Biol.

Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Claspin and Chk1 interact appears to be complex and has been explored in more detail in Xenopus. XClaspin interacts with Chk1 through the Chk1-binding domain, a region of 57 amino acids that contains two highly conserved repeats of ∼10 amino acids with the consensus sequence EXXLC(S/T)GXF (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These motifs are also conserved in hClaspin. While XClaspin has two of these motifs, hClaspin has three. Mutation of serines in these repeats abolishes the Claspin-Chk1 interaction as well as Chk1 activation in Xenopus egg extracts (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, these motifs are not necessary for the binding of XClaspin to chromatin (12Lee J. Gold D.A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5269-5282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicating that retention of XClaspin on the chromatin is not necessary for Chk1 activation. These repeats also appear to be involved in hClaspin-Chk1 interaction. In an in vitro human cell-free system, mutation of two of these putative phosphorylation sites in the Chk1-binding domain of human Claspin inhibited Claspin-Chk1 interaction (13Clarke C.A. Clarke P.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However it is still not clear how these phosphorylation events are regulated and how they contribute to Claspin function in vivo. Although it has been demonstrated that Claspin is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage and replication stress, it is not known which protein kinases phosphorylate Claspin. Phosphorylation of the EXXLC(S/T)GXF motifs in XClaspin (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and human Claspin (14Bennett L.N. Clarke P.R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4176-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) is ATR-dependent, but these sites are not consensus sites for ATR/ATM kinases, suggesting that an ATR-dependent kinase is directly responsible for Claspin phosphorylation at these residues. In the present study we investigated whether the conserved repeats on hClaspin are required for hClaspin-Chk1 interaction and Claspin function in the cell. We confirmed that these sites are phosphorylated in vivo in response to replication stress and UV damage. Phosphorylation of these residues is important for Claspin function and for the regulation of hClaspin-Chk1 interaction in vivo. More importantly, we found that these sites are phosphorylated by Chk1, indicating that Claspin and Chk1 may regulate each other to ensure optimal checkpoint activation following DNA damage. Cell Lines and Antibodies—Human cell lines HeLa, U20S, and 293T were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Claspin antibodies have been described previously (6Chini C.C.S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Phospho-antibody against Thr-916 was raised against the peptide DENAMDANMDELLDLC(p)TGKFTSQAE. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Chk1 antibody was form Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-317) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). UCN01 was a gift of J. N. Sarkaria (15Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—We generated wild-type Claspin, Claspin deletion mutants, Chk1, and Chk2 in the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Claspin, Chk1, and Chk2 were cloned in gateway vector pDEST20, and Myc epitope-tagged Chk1 was cloned into pDEST8. Baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). FLAG-Claspin baculovirus was a gift from A. Sancar (9Sar F. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Subramanian D. Croteau D.L. Hutsell S.Q. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39289-39295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the appropriate baculoviruses and harvested 48 h after infection. Cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. 0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0. 5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 20 min, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) or glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Resins were washed several times with lysis buffer and then once with phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were eluted from FLAG beads with lysis buffer containing 0. 2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Elution from glutathione beads was performed using 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, supplemented with 20 mm glutathione for 30 min. Eluted proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining and/or Western blotting. Kinase Assays—Recombinant proteins were expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system. GST-Chk1 and GST-Chk2 bound to glutathione beads were incubated with GST-Claspin eluted from glutathione beads. Incubation was in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris. HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP) for 10 min at 30 °C. Western blots were performed using P-Claspin antibody. Generating U20S Stable Cell Lines Expressing Wild-type and Mutant Claspin—Wild-type Claspin was cloned in pIRES2-EGFP vector containing S and FLAG tags. Claspin mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis. USOS cells were transfected with these Claspin expression vectors. Stable cell clones were selected using medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. The expression of wild-type and mutant Claspin in these clones was determined by Western blots and/or immunofluorescence staining using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Interaction between Claspin and Chk1 in Stable Cell Line—U20S stable cell lines were treated for 2 h with 5 mm HU. Cells were harvested in NETN, and cell lysates were incubated with S-protein-agarose beads. Beads were washed with NETN, and associated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in NETN containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 1 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. siRNA Transfection and Preparation of Mitotic Spreads—siRNA duplexes were 21 base pairs including a 2-deoxynucleotide overhang. The target cDNA sequence for the Claspin and control siRNA were described previously (16Chini C.C.S. Wood J. Chen J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4165-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For siRNA transfection, U20S cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected at 40% confluence with the siRNA duplex and Oligofectamine. Transfection was repeated 24 h later, and cells were analyzed 72 h after the first transfection. Mitotic spreads were performed as described previously (6Chini C.C.S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Human Claspin Is Phosphorylated at the Thr-916 Site in Vivo in Response Replication Stress and UV Radiation—Previous studies in Xenopus and a human cell-free system show that binding of Chk1 to Claspin requires two conserved repeats on Claspin that contain phosphorylation sites (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Clarke C.A. Clarke P.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the importance of these phosphorylation sites in vivo for human Claspin function and its interaction with Chk1 has not been addressed. To study the regulation and function of these phosphorylation sites in human cells, we prepared antibodies specifically recognizing a peptide containing phosphorylated Thr-916, one of the phosphorylation sites within this repeat region. We first tested this phospho-specific antibody in 293T cells before and after treatment with hydroxyurea or UV damage. Exposure of cells to either of these treatments induced phosphorylation of hClaspin at the Thr-916 site, and phosphatase treatment abolished the immunoreactivity of this phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 1A). These results confirm that human Claspin is indeed phosphorylated at this conserved repeat region following DNA damage. Although the phosphorylation sites like the Thr-916 site within these conserved repeats are not consensus ATM and/or ATR phosphorylation sites, phosphorylation of these repeats is ATR-dependent (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Bennett L.N. Clarke P.R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4176-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that an ATR-dependent kinase is directly involved in the phosphorylation of these residues in vivo. To address this question, we decided to investigate whether the major ATR downstream kinase Chk1 is required for phosphorylation of these residues in human cells. To investigate the potential role of Chk1 in Claspin phosphorylation, we treated cells with UCN01, an inhibitor of Chk1 (15Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, pretreatment with UCN01 blocked HU-induced Claspin phosphorylation, suggesting that Chk1 is required for Claspin phosphorylation following replication stress. This HU-induced phosphorylation of human Claspin at Thr-916 site is also inhibited by caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM/ATR (17Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B), which is in agreement with data from Xenopus (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using 293T cells, in which pretreatment with UCN01 reduced HU- or UV-induced Thr 916 phosphorylation of Claspin (Fig. 1C). We also performed experiments using Chk1 siRNA or prolonged treatment with UCN01. However, Claspin levels were reduced dramatically following these treatments, because Chk1 also regulates Claspin stability (16Chini C.C.S. Wood J. Chen J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4165-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In conclusion, these results suggest that Claspin is phosphorylated in vivo on these conserved repeats upon DNA damage and that Chk1 may be the kinase responsible for these phosphorylation events. Claspin Is Phosphorylated by Chk1—To confirm a role for Chk1 in Claspin phosphorylation and further characterize the interaction between Claspin and Chk1, we prepared baculoviruses for expression of these proteins in insect cells. When insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing GST-Chk1 and FLAG-Claspin, we observed an interaction between Chk1 and Claspin by either pulldown with glutathione beads (Fig. 2A) or immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG beads (Fig. 2B). Claspin only interacted with Chk1, but not with Chk2 (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the interaction was specific. The Claspin-Chk1 interaction was also observed when GST-Claspin was co-expressed with Myc-tagged Chk1 (Fig. 3, C and D).FIGURE 3Phosphorylation of Claspin repeats is not essential for its interaction with Chk1 in vitro. A, upper panel, phospho- and nonphosphobiotinylated Claspin peptides were incubated with streptavidin beads, and whole cell lysates (WCL) were prepared from 239T cells or 293T cells treated with 10 grays of IR or 10 mm HU for 1 h. Associated proteins were detected by Western blots using anti-Chk1 antibody. Lower panel, phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated biotinylated Claspin peptides were incubated with GST-Chk1 and streptavidin beads. Western blots were performed with anti-GST antibody. B, summary of GST-Claspin deletions and point mutants used in this study. C, Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing wild type (WT) and five deletion mutants of GST-Claspin together with Myc epitope-tagged Chk1. Proteins were pull down with glutathione-agarose beads and stained with Coomassie Blue to show equal levels of wild-type and mutant Claspin in these samples. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-Myc antibody. D, Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing wild type, Δ4, Δ repeat, or the 3A mutant of GST-Claspin together with Myc-tagged Chk1. Pulldown experiments performed were similar to that described in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we examined whether Claspin would be phosphorylated by Chk1 in these cells. When FLAG-Claspin was expressed alone, we could not detect phosphorylation of Claspin at Thr-916 site using our anti-Claspin phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 2B). However, co-expression of FLAG-Claspin with active GST-Chk1 induced Claspin phosphorylation at the Thr-916 site (Fig. 2, A and B). Although GST-Chk1 kinase dead mutant (KD) also interacted with Claspin, it did not promote Claspin phosphorylation. As a control, when Claspin was expressed with GST-Chk2, we did not observe Claspin phosphorylation or an interaction between Claspin and Chk2 (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that Claspin specifically interacts with and is phosphorylated by Chk1. To confirm this phosphorylation of Claspin by Chk1, we isolated both proteins separately and performed in vitro kinase assays. When Claspin was incubated with active GST-Chk1 it became phosphorylated at Thr-916. This residue was not phosphorylated when Claspin was incubated with GST-Chk1 kinase dead (data not shown) or GST-Chk2 (Fig. 2C) Furthermore, mutation of the all three potential phosphorylation sites on the repeat region to alanines (3A mutant) also abolished Claspin phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). These data confirm that the repeat region of Claspin is phosphorylated by Chk1. Phosphorylation of Claspin Repeats Is Not Essential for Claspin-Chk1 Interaction in Vitro—In Xenopus, phosphorylation of Claspin repeats is necessary for the interaction between Claspin and Chk1 (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To study this interaction for human Claspin, we made biotinylated phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides containing Thr-916 of human Claspin. Only phosphorylated peptides interacted with Chk1 from 293T cells or purified GST-Chk1 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the phosphorylated residues within the conserved repeat region could contribute to human Claspin-Chk1 interaction. However, the data presented above (Fig. 2A) from our baculovirus studies would argue that Claspin and Chk1 could interact in vitro even when Thr-916 is not phosphorylated. To further investigate how human Claspin and Chk1 interact, we generated five internal deletions of ∼200–300 amino acids within the full-length GST-Claspin (Fig. 3B) and investigated the interaction between these Claspin mutants and Myc-tagged Chk1. Insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing the wild type and mutants of GST-Claspin together with baculovirus expressing Myc-tagged Chk1. Pulldown experiments using glutathione beads were performed. As shown in Fig. 3C, only one deletion mutant (Δ4, deleted residues 850–1114) of Claspin has reduced binding affinity for Chk1. Because this region (residues 850–1114) includes the conserved repeat motifs, we analyzed two additional GST-Claspin mutants. The first contains a smaller deletion inside this region, which only deletes the conserved repeat motifs (residues 905–954). The other one has all three potential phosphorylation sites on the repeat region mutated to alanines (3A). When we assessed the interaction between these mutants and Myc-tagged Chk1, we observed that deletion of the entire region (residues 850–1114) dramatically decreased the interaction between Claspin and Chk1. The other two mutants have less reduction in their ability to bind Chk1 (Fig. 3D). As expected, all three of these mutants abolished Claspin phosphorylation as detected by our anti-Claspin phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 3D). We concluded that there are both phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylation-independent interactions between Claspin and Chk1. Phosphorylation of Claspin Repeats Is Essential for Claspin-Chk1 Interaction in Vivo—Because of the complexity of the Claspin-Chk1 interaction, we decided to investigate this interaction in human cells. To pursue these experiments, we generated U20S derivative cell lines stably expressing the wild type or the triple phosphorylation mutant (3A) of Claspin. Additional silent mutations within the Claspin siRNA target sequence were introduced to render the expression of these FLAG- and S-tagged Claspin resistant to Claspin siRNA down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 4A, stable U20S cell lines express S-/FLAG-tagged wild type and 3A mutant of Claspin. Pulldown experiments in these stable cell lines using S-agarose beads showed that Chk1 only interacted with wild-type S-/FLAG-tagged Claspin but not the 3A mutant of Claspin. In addition, this interaction only occurred when cells were treated with HU (Fig. 4B). Therefore, differently from our results in vitro, phosphorylation of these repeats in hClaspin in vivo after replication stress does appear to be essential for Claspin-Chk1 interaction. Phosphorylation of Claspin Repeats Is Important for Claspin Function—Because mutation of these phosphorylation sites prevented the interaction between Claspin and Chk1 in vivo, we further investigated whether these phosphorylation events would be important for Claspin function. For these experiments we used the U20S stable cell lines described above, which express wild-type or 3A mutant siRNA-resistant Claspin. As shown in Fig. 5A although transfection with Claspin siRNA down-regulated the endogenous Claspin expression, we still detected expression of the exogenous siRNA-resistant wild-type and 3A mutant of Claspin. To study Claspin function in these cells, we first analyzed these cells for Chk1 activation. As we described previously, Claspin siRNA decreases Chk1 activation in response to HU treatment in U20S cells (16Chini C.C.S. Wood J. Chen J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4165-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In U20S cells expressing wild-type siRNA-resistant Claspin, Chk1 activation is similar to control cells, even in the presence of Claspin siRNA. In contrast, cells that express the 3A mutant show a defect in Chk1 activation (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that the conserved repeats on Claspin are important for Chk1 activation. We next investigated the role of Claspin phosphorylation on premature chromatin condensation (PCC), a process induced by replication stress that is normally prevented by the activation of ATR-Chk1 pathway (18Nghiem P. Park P.K. Kim Y.-S. Vaziri C. Screiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9022-9097Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that down-regulation of either Claspin or Chk1 by siRNAs leads to a dramatic increase in PCC, supporting the idea that Claspin, like Chk1, is also required for this checkpoint function (6Chini C.C.S. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Indeed, U2OS cells transfected with Claspin siRNA, but not control siRNA, showed a significant increase in PCC (Fig. 5C). This increase of PCC following Claspin siRNA transfection was completely inhibited in U2OS cells expressing wild-type siRNA-resistant Claspin (Fig. 5C). In contrast, although the 3A mutant expresses even better than wild-type Claspin, it was not able to prevent the induction of PCC (Fig. 5C). Actually, the 3A mutant induced PCC even when cells were treated with control siRNA. These data suggest that phosphorylation of this conserved repeat region is essential for regulating the hClaspin-Chk1 interaction in vivo and for Claspin function. In this study, we have shown that hClaspin is phosphorylated in vivo at the repeat region and that phosphorylation of these motifs after replication stress is important for Claspin function. Surprisingly, our results also demonstrate that Chk1 itself may be directly involved in the phosphorylation of the Claspin repeats. Previous studies (5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 10Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) proposed a model in which Claspin is phosphorylated after DNA damage and then interacts with Chk1, with this damage-induced Claspin-Chk1 interaction being essential for the activation of Chk1 by ATR. Because these phospho-repeats on Claspin mediate the interaction between Claspin and Chk1 in Xenopus, it was believed that the repeats had to be phosphorylated before Claspin/Chk1 interacted and Chk1 was activated (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that phosphorylation of these repeats by Chk1 may occur after both proteins have already associated and the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between these two proteins may regulate the stability or the affinity of the interaction. Exactly how Claspin interacts with Chk1 is complex. In this study, we have shown that Claspin can interact with Chk1 in both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners. When we overexpressed both Claspin and Chk1 in insect cells, it appeared that Claspin could interact with Chk1 in a phosphorylation-independent manner, because the phospho-mutant of Claspin had reduced Chk1 binding but nevertheless still interacted with Chk1 (Fig. 3D). The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between Claspin and Chk1 was also observed in our study. First we observed a reduction of Claspin-Chk1 interaction when we used the 3A mutant of Claspin. Second, we showed that only a peptide containing phosphorylated Thr-916 of Claspin, but not the unphosphorylated control peptide, could interact with Chk1 (Fig. 3A). Third, this phosphorylation-dependent interaction appeared to be more important for Claspin-Chk1 interaction in human cells, because in vivo Chk1 only interacted with the wild type, but not the phospho-mutant of Claspin, in response to replication stress (Fig. 4B). This latter finding is consistent with the data from a recent study using an in vitro human cell-free system (13Clarke C.A. Clarke P.R. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In that study, mutation of two phosphorylation sites (Thr-916 and Ser-945) in the C-terminal half of Claspin inhibited its association with Chk1. Indeed, the importance of these phosphorylation events is further supported by our observations that these phosphorylation sites on Claspin are required for optimal Chk1 activation and Claspin function following replication stress (Fig. 5). The unanswered question is why there is a phosphorylation-independent interaction between Claspin and Chk1. One explanation is that the phosphorylation-independent interaction is just an in vitro artifact due to the overexpression of these two proteins in insect cells. Alternatively, the phosphorylation-independent interaction of these proteins may have some role in the activation of checkpoint response following DNA damage. We speculate that the later explanation may have some merit. First, even in insect cells, the phosphorylation-independent interaction between Claspin and Chk1 is quite specific, because Chk2 does not bind to Claspin in this system (Fig. 2A). Second, we have shown that the repeated motifs on Claspin are phosphorylated by Chk1, suggesting that Chk1 may at least transiently associate with and phosphorylate Claspin even before the phosphorylation-dependent Claspin-Chk1 interaction become possible. Based on these observations, we believe that Claspin does not merely act upstream of Chk1. Claspin and Chk1 may interact transiently in a phosphorylation-independent manner in normal cells. Following DNA damage and/or replication stress, this phosphorylation-independent interaction between Claspin and Chk1 may allow the initial ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1. This initial phosphorylation of Chk1 increase Chk1 activity and leads to the Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of Claspin at these conserved repeated motifs. The phosphorylation of these motifs further increases the Claspin-Chk1 interaction and results in full activation of Chk1 by ATR. This model of dynamic interaction between Claspin and Chk1 can explain the seemingly paradoxical results presented here. The phosphorylation and regulation of Claspin are highly complex, more than we imagined several years ago. A recent study in Xenopus suggests that ATR-dependent phosphorylation of S/TQ sites on Claspin regulates Chk1 activation in response to double strand breaks but not in response to aphidicolin (19Yoo H.Y. Jeong S.-Y. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These observations imply that ATR may be directly involved in regulating Claspin phosphorylation and that Claspin may be differently regulated in response to various types of DNA damage. In Xenopus and human cells, Claspin can also be phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (20H.Y. Kumagai A. Schevchenko A. Schevchenko A. Dunphy W.G.

This Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of Claspin in Xenopus is involved in the regulation of adaptation following DNA damage. In human cells, Claspin phosphorylation by Plk1 also controls the ability of β-TrCP to recognize and degrade Claspin before mitosis (21Mailand N. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol.

We have shown previously that Chk1 is required to maintain Claspin stability in S phase cells (16Chini C.C.S. Wood J. Chen J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4165-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism responsible for this regulation remains to be determined, it may involve phosphorylation of Claspin by Chk1. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the repeat region in Claspin is phosphorylated by Chk1. However, these may not be the only sites that are phosphorylated by Chk1, because Chk1 can still phosphorylate the Ser-3/Thr-to-Ala mutant of Claspin in vitro. 3C. C. S. Chini and J. Chen, unpublished observations. To understand the complex interaction between Claspin and Chk1 and Claspin regulation, it will be important in the future to determine the identity and function of these additional Chk1-dependent phosphorylation sites on Claspin. Besides protein kinases, other proteins such as TopBP1 and Rad17 have also been implicated in the regulation of Claspin-Chk1 complexes and Claspin phosphorylation (24Liu S. Bekker-Jensen S. Mailand N. Lukas C. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6056-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Wang X. Zou L. Lu T. Bao S. Hurov K.E. Hittelman W.N. Elledge S.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Uncovering how these proteins regulate human Claspin phosphorylation after replication stress will also contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that control the ATR-Claspin-Chk1 pathway following DNA damage. We thank members of the Chen laboratory for helpful discussions and technical support."

Here we provide evidence that a single alloreactive T cell receptor interacts with analogous structural regions of its cognate ligand, HLA-B*0801<sup>FLRGRAYGL</sup>, as its allogeneic ligand, HLA-B*3501<sup>KPIVVLHGY</sup>. The crystal structures of the binary peptide-major histocompatibility complexes show marked differences in the conformation of the heavy chains as well as the bound peptides.

Moreover, regions of close structural homology between the heavy chains of HLA B8 and HLA B35 coincided with regions that have previously been implicated in ""hot spots"" of T cell receptor recognition. The avidity of this human T cell receptor was also comparable for the allo- and cognate ligand, consistent with the modes of T cell receptor binding being broadly similar for these complexes. Collectively, it appears that highly focused structural mimicry against a diverse structural background provides a basis for the observed alloreactivity in this system.

ADP-ribose polymers also mediate cell death and are degraded by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Here we show that the catalytic domain of PARG interacts with the automodification domain of PARP-1. Furthermore, PARG can directly down-regulate PARP-1 activity. PARG also interacts with XRCC1, a DNA repair factor that is recruited by DNA damage-activated PARP-1. We investigated the role of XRCC1 in cell death after treatment with supralethal doses of the alkylating agent MNNG. Only in XRCC1-proficient cells MNNG induced a considerable accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose). Similarly, extracts of XRCC1-deficient cells produced large ADP-ribose polymers if supplemented with XRCC1. Consequently, MNNG triggered in XRCC1-proficient cells the translocation of the apoptosis inducing factor from mitochondria to the nucleus followed by caspase-independent cell death. In XRCC1-deficient cells, the same MNNG treatment caused non-apoptotic cell death without accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose). Thus, XRCC1 seems to be involved in regulating a poly(ADP-ribose)-mediated apoptotic cell death.

Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The most abundant and active PARP enzyme is PARP-1, a predominantly nuclear protein of 113 kDa. PARP-1 rapidly binds to DNA breaks, is thereby activated, and covalently automodifies itself under consumption of NAD+. To a lesser extent, some other nuclear proteins are also modified with PAR polymers (2Bouchard V.J. Rouleau M. Poirier G.G. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 446-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The primary structure of PARP-1 is well conserved between species. The N-terminal DNA binding domain, which contains two zinc finger motifs, is linked to a nuclear localization signal, the main acceptor sites of automodification are located within the central domain, and the 55-kDa C-terminal domain of the enzyme contains the catalytic site (1Amé J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). PARP-1 appears to physically interact with multiple proteins involved in DNA metabolism, such as histones, transcription factors, replication factors, and DNA repair enzymes (3Petermann E. Keil C. Oei S.L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Among DNA repair proteins, PARP-1 interacts with x-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1) (4Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). A mutant line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which displays hypersensitivity to a broad range of genotoxins was established and termed EM9 cells (5Thompson L.H. Brookman K.W. Dillehay L.E. Carrano A.V. Mazrimas J.A. Mooney C.L. Minkler J.L. Mutat. Res. 1982; 95: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It turned out that EM9 cells have a reduced ability to rapidly repair DNA single-strand breaks and are genetically unstable as a consequence of XRCC1 deficiency. Different analyses revealed that XRCC1 physically interacts with several DNA repair enzymes, thereby regulating their corresponding activities (6Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 955-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). XRCC1, a polypeptide of 70 kDa, contains two breast cancer C-terminal domains and a nuclear localization signal but is lacking any known enzymatic activity (6Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 955-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Notably, recruitment of XRCC1 to single-strand breaks strictly depends on PARP-1 activity (7Okano S. Lan L. Caldecott K.W. Mori T. Yasui A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3974-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 8Lan L. Nakajima S. Oohata Y. Takao M. Okano S. Masutani M. Wilson S.H. Yasui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PAR polymers are synthesized in response to DNA breaks, which can arise directly or indirectly, for example, after treatment with alkylating agents. Produced PAR modifications are rapidly degraded by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), which cleaves the polymers with high specificity at the glycosidic bonds, generating free ADP-ribose. PARG is the physiological counterpart for all PARP enzymes, encoded by a unique gene (9Davidovic L. Vodenicharov M. Affar E.B. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Human PARG, encoded by 18 exons is 110 kDa in size (10Meyer R.G. Meyer-Ficca M.L. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 314: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the catalytic domain resides in the C-terminal part of the enzyme (11Lin W. Ame J.C. Aboul-Ela N. Jacobson E.L.

J. 2005; 388: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recently a 39-kDa protein termed ARH3 has been isolated (13Oka S. Kato J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 705-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which possesses a glycohydrolase activity although is structurally unrelated to the conventional 110-kDa PARG. In addition, several PARG isoforms with different sizes, resulting either from alternative initiation events or from post-translational proteolysis, have been described in mammalians (14Bonicalzi M.E. Haince J.F. Droit A. Poirier G.G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Human PARG contains several putative localization signals: nuclear localization signal, nuclear export signals, and a mitochondrial localization signal (15Meyer-Ficca M.L. Meyer R.G. Coyle D.L. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Oei S.L. Keil C. Ziegler M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas PARG activity is detected predominantly in the cytoplasm, full-length PARG is localized to the nucleus (17Bonicalzi M.E. Vodenicharov M. Coulombe M. Gagne J.P. Poirier G.G. Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Ohashi S. Kanai M. Hanai S. Uchiumi F. Maruta H. Tanuma S. Miwa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Knockout of the full-length isoform of PARG in mice resulted in an increased sensitivity to genotoxic and endotoxic stress (19Cortes U. Tong W.M. Coyle D.L. Meyer-Ficca M.L. Meyer R.G. Petrilli V. Herceg Z. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Wang Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7163-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and the loss of PARG activity in Drosophila melanogaster caused progressive neurodegeneration (20Hanai S. Kanai M. Ohashi S. Okamoto K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Miwa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Finally, it was demonstrated that after complete abrogation of PARG expression, murine embryonic cells were only viable in the presence of PARP inhibitors. After withdrawal of these inhibitors an accumulation of PAR polymers was observed and cells underwent apoptosis (21Koh D.W. Lawler A.M. Poitras M.F. Sasaki M. Wattler S. Nehls M.C. Stoger T. Poirier G.G. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17699-17704Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the metabolism of PAR plays a fundamental role for the decision of the cell to survive or die (22Koh D.W. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Pharmacol. Res. 2005; 52: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the induction of PARP-1 activity by irreparable amounts of DNA breaks can deplete the cell of NAD and ATP, finally leading to cell death (23Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). For example, PARP-1-dependent necrosis can be triggered by treatment with 1 mm H2O2 (24Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13978-13982Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Yu et al. (25Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar) described yet another cell death program depending on PARP-1 activity. In response to an exposure to 0.5 mm N-methyl-N′nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), PAR polymers accumulate, instantly provoking the translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus. This death stimulus then induces nuclear shrinkage and finally caspase-independent cell death (25Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar, 22Koh D.W. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Pharmacol. Res. 2005; 52: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). How an accumulation of PAR is accomplished, whether by overactivation of PARP-1 or by repression of PARG activity, is not known. Therefore, the analysis of the relationship between PARP-1 and PARG is necessary to unravel the role of PAR metabolism in cell death. Previously we reported that PARG interacts with human PARP-1 from HeLa cell extracts (26Keil C. Petermann E. Oei S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In line with our findings, an affinity of PARG for PARP-1 was shown in a recent proteomic approach (27Gagné J.P. Bonicalzi M.E. Gagne P. Ouellet M.E. Hendzel M.J. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the functional relationship between PARP-1 and PARG. Both enzymes interact directly and PARG has the ability to modulate PARP-1 activity. In addition, PARG also interacts with XRCC1. Above all, we provide evidence that the interplay between PARP-1, PARG, and XRCC1 regulates apoptotic cell death induced by supralethal MNNG doses.

Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Cloning and Purification of Proteins—The cDNA encoding amino acids 378-976 of human PARG (accession number DQ867088) was cloned as a SalI fragment into the vector pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) or the GST-PARG65 construct was performed in Escherichia coli BL21 Codon Plus-RIL cells (Stratagene), which additionally were transfected with the pREP4 plasmid (Qiagen). Cells were cultured in LB broth overnight at 25 °C and overexpression was induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. GST-PARG65 was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4 (7 H2O), 1.4 mm KH2PO4), supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol. After washing, proteins were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% N-octyl-β-d-glucoside, 40 mm glutathione, pH 8.0. Eluted GST-PARG65 was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. XRCC1, Lig III, and PARP-1 constructs were expressed and purified as described before (32Petermann E. Ziegler M. Oei S.L. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Griesenbeck J. Oei S.L. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Ziegler M. Buchlow G. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PAR Metabolism—[α-32P]NAD+ was obtained from Amersham Biosciences and gallotannins were from Sigma. Poly-(ADP-ribosylation) activities were determined as described previously (26Keil C. Petermann E. Oei S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Purified recombinant proteins as specified in the legends to the figures or 20 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated in 25 μl of phosphate buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 200 μm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 10 μm [α-32P]NAD+ and 10 μg/ml nicked DNA at 30 °C for 20 min. All reactions were performed in the presence of 200 μm EDTA and absence of Mg2+ ions to reduce endogenous phosphodiesterase and/or ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase activities that convert PAR and ADPR to AMP (34Rossi L. Denegri M. Torti M. Poirier G.G. Scovassi A.I. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and incorporation of [32P]PAR was determined. For determination of relative PARG activity [32P]PAR was synthesized in vitro as described earlier (33Griesenbeck J. Oei S.L. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Ziegler M. Buchlow G. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and incubated with purified proteins or nuclear extracts (20 μg of proteins per 30 μl reactions) in phosphate buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by precipitation with acetone. Precipitated nucleotides were dissolved in TE buffer. Samples containing equal amounts of radioactivity were applied to cellulose-coated plates. Thin layer chromatography was performed using the solvent system 0.3 m LiCl, 1 m acetic acid. After separation, dried cellulose plates were subjected to autoradiography and quantified using a phosphorimager or by Cerenkov counting of excised thin layer slices. Protein modifications with [α-32P]ADP-ribose were analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. Alternatively, reactions were stopped by precipitation with acetone and nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography. Antibodies and Immunostaining Analyses—Antibodies against PARG were raised in rabbits immunized with the purified His-tagged catalytic domain of PARG (26Keil C. Petermann E. Oei S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These PARG antibodies recognize the catalytic 65-kDa PARG fragment and to a lesser extent also the human full-length PARG. Anti-pentahistidine antibodies were obtained from Qiagen. Antibodies directed against XRCC1 (H-300, from rabbit), AIF (H-300, from rabbit), GST (Z-5, from rabbit), PARP-1 (A-20, from goat), and YY 1 (C-20, from rabbit) were from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal α-tubulin antibodies (DM1A, from mouse) were from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany), polyclonal anti-PAR antibodies were from Alexis (96-10-04 from rabbit). For immunofluorescence analyses, cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde, 0.25% Triton X-100, and antibodies against PAR or AIF were used and visualized using Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (3 μm, Invitrogen). Necrotic cells were stained by incubating unfixed cells with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) in BBS (3.1 mm KCl, 134 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.25 mm KH2PO4, 15.7 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm glucose, pH 7.2) for 30 min at 37 °C and analyzed immediately using a fluorescence microscope. Photomicrographs were obtained at room temperature with a microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a digital camera. The relative amount of PAR accumulation was quantified using imaging software (Matrix Vision, Oppenweiler, Germany). Localization of AIF in cells and nuclear shrinkage of cells were estimated by visual inspection. At least 300 cells were counted for each sample and all experiments were repeated three times. Affinity Precipitation and Pulldown Assays—For GST pull-down experiments, GST or GST-PARG65 (7.5 μg) together with recombinant PARP-1 or XRCC1 constructs (20 μg) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (50 μl) in 0.5 ml of BP (10 mm Tris/HCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) by head over head rotation at 4 °C for 45 min. After 5 washing steps with BP, bound proteins were extracted with SDS gel loading buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Precipitation of XRCC1-bound proteins from EM9-XH cells was performed as described by Caldecott et al. (35Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 40 μl of nuclear extracts from HeLa S3 cells (75 μg of protein) were diluted with 120 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5) and pre-cleared by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), covalently coupled with control goat antibodies, at 4 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the unbound fraction was incubated with 10 μg of goat anti-PARP-1 antibodies (PARP-1 (A-20), Santa Cruz) covalently coupled to 35 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer including 100 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were extracted subsequently with SDS gel loading buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Human full-length PARG was cloned into the two-hybrid vector pGADT7 (Clontech). pAS-XRCC1 (36Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by K. W. Caldecott. Plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain PJ69-4A (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and diploids were selected using synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. For validation of protein-protein interaction, colonies were transferred to histidine- or adenine-free medium. Treatment of CHO Cells—Stock solutions of MNNG, 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA), staurosporine, and Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk (Bachem, Weil am Rhein, Germany) were dissolved in Me2SO and serially diluted with BBS or growth medium immediately before use. Nonconfluent CHO cells were treated with 0.5 mm MNNG in BBS for 10 min. Then cells were washed with medium and incubated in fresh medium at 37 °C for time periods as indicated in the figure legends. Perchloric acid extracts were prepared from CHO cells and the cellular ATP level was determined as described earlier (32Petermann E. Ziegler M. Oei S.L. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using the luciferase assay. The cellular NAD level was determined from perchloric acid extracts as described by Jacobson and Jacobson (38Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PARG Interacts with PARP-1—Previously, we demonstrated an interaction between full-length PARG immobilized to tannin-Sepharose and endogenous PARP-1 from HeLa cell extracts (26Keil C. Petermann E. Oei S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also detected interaction of PARP-1 with the immobilized 65-kDa C-terminal fragment of PARG (amino acids 378-976), in the following termed PARG65, which contains the catalytic activity (data not shown). To further characterize the interaction between PARP-1 and PARG we performed GST pulldown experiments with purified recombinant constructs (Fig. 1A). We expressed catalytically active GST-PARG65 in E. coli, purified it, and incubated it with His-tagged full-length PARP-1. Fractions from GST pull-down experiments were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-polyhistidine and anti-GST antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1A). As evident, after GST pulldown full-length PARP-1 was detected only in fractions eluted from GST-PARG65 beads (Fig. 1A, uppermost panels, fourth lane). If His-tagged constructs of isolated domains of PARP (33Griesenbeck J. Oei S.L. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Ziegler M. Buchlow G. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were applied, only the automodification domain showed an affinity to GST-PARG65, whereas no interaction was observed with the other PARP domains (Fig. 1A). These experiments were performed in the absence of NAD+ or PAR, thus demonstrating a direct protein-protein interaction between catalytically active PARG65 and the automodification domain of PARP-1. Next, purified full-length PARP-1 and GST-PARG65 were incubated as described before and the elution fraction from the GST pull-down was analyzed for PARP activity by incubation with [α-32P]NAD and nicked DNA. Eluted PARP-1 was catalytically active (Fig. 1B, second lane), indicating that native PARP-1 bound to the GST-PARG65 beads. Menard et al. (39Menard L. Thibault L. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that PARG was no acceptor for PAR modifications in vitro, when PARP-1, PARG, histones, DNA, and NAD were incubated together at physiological ratios. Similarly, we observed that the predominant reaction in elution fractions from pull-down with GST-PARG65 was automodification of PARP-1, whereas [32P]ADP-ribosylation of PARG65 was only detectable if GST-PARG65 was added in excess (data not shown). To study the impact of the interaction between PARP-1 and PARG in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. First, Western blot analyses showed that PAR modifications were virtually absent in extracts of untreated HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). PARG65 was detected after co-imunoprecipitation of these extracts with anti-PARP-1 antibodies (Fig. 1D). Thus, a preformed complex of PARG and PARP-1 might exist in the nucleus of HeLa cells, independent of PARP-1 activation. To further study the interplay of these enzymes, we supplemented nuclear extracts of HeLa cells with increasing amounts of recombinant GST-PARG65 and incubated the extracts with [α-32P]NAD and nicked DNA. After reaction for 20 min, modifications with [32P]poly(ADP-ribose) were visualized in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). Amounts of released [32P]ADP-ribose were determined by evaluation of thin layer chromatograms (Fig. 2A), and polymer chain lengths were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2C). As expected, the addition of increasing amounts of catalytically active GST-PARG65 enhanced the levels of released [32P]ADP-ribose (Fig. 2A, bars 1-4), whereas the sizes of the produced [32P]PAR polymers were decreased (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-4). Previously we presented evidence that tannins elevate the level of PAR in HeLa cell extracts by inhibition of PARG (26Keil C. Petermann E. Oei S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the presence of nuclear proteins 150 μm tannins had no modulating influence on PARP-1 activity (26Keil C. Petermann E. Oei S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If similar experiments as shown in Fig. 2, bars/lanes 1-4, were performed in the presence of 150 μm tannins, the levels of [32P]ADP-ribose were not affected by the addition of PARG65 (Fig. 2A, bars 5-8), but, notably, the sizes of the polymers were significantly reduced (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 5-8). In conclusion, even independent of its hydrolyzing activity PARG65 may affect the catalytic activity of PARP-1 by direct protein-protein interaction, resulting in the synthesis of only short polymers. PARG Interacts with XRCC1—PARG65 interacts with the automodification domain of PARP-1 (Fig. 1A), which contains a breast cancer C-terminal domain and is known to be the region important for interactions with other proteins (33Griesenbeck J. Oei S.L. Mayer-Kuckuk P. Ziegler M. Buchlow G. Schweiger M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7297-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) such as for instance XRCC1 (4Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). To analyze a potential direct connection between PARG and XRCC1, we investigated a direct interaction of these proteins using the following set of experiments. First of all, human full-length PARG was cloned into the yeast two-hybrid reporter plasmid pGADT7 and interaction with an appropriate construct containing XRCC1 (pAS-XRCC1; Ref. 36Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) was studied in yeast cells (Fig. 3A). Indeed, only in the presence of both PARG and XRCC1 was a supplementation of histidine biosynthesis observed, whereas controls using empty vectors were negative (Fig. 3A). The interaction between PARG65 and XRCC1 was further verified by in vitro GST pulldown experiments. For that purpose, His-tagged XRCC1 was purified from E. coli and incubated with purified GST-PARG65. After GST pulldown, fractions were analyzed by Western blot as described above for PARP-1 (cf. Fig. 1A). Fig. 3B shows that His-tagged XRCC1 bound to GST-PARG65. The interaction between XRCC1 and GST-PARG65 was stable toward salt concentrations of up to 150 mm NaCl (data not shown). To analyze the interaction between PARG and XRCC1 in vivo, we made use of EM9 cells, complemented with either empty vector (EM9-V) or a vector containing His-tagged, human wild-type XRCC1 (EM9-XH) (29Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4836-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts of exponentially growing CHO cells were incubated with Ni-NTA-Sepharose. After washing the Ni-NTA beads, elution fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against PARG65. As shown in Fig. 3C, PARG clearly bound to His-tagged XRCC1. In conclusion, PARG has the ability to interact with PARP-1 and also with XRCC1, even in the absence of its substrate PAR. XRCC1 Enhances the Synthesis of Poly(ADP-ribose) in MNNG-treated Cells—XRCC1 interacts with PARP-1 (4Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and also with PARG (cf. Fig. 3). Thus, XRCC1 might have the capacity to regulate cellular PAR metabolism. Therefore, in the following experiments we addressed the impact of XRCC1 on PAR synthesis using EM9 cells. First, EM9-V and EM9-XH cells were treated with 0.5 mm MNNG, a supralethal dose to induce poly-(ADP-ribosylation). Interestingly, immunofluorescence analyses clearly showed that higher amounts of PAR polymers were produced in XRCC1-containing EM9-XH cells compared with XRCC1-deficient EM9-V cells (Fig. 4A). Evaluation of quantified PAR signals revealed that in EM9-XH cells, PAR accumulation was increased about 3-4-fold compared with the accumulation observed in EM9-V cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Western blot analyses of cell extracts confirmed this (Fig. 4D"

Synthetic ligands and ECM fragments regulate the vascular smooth muscle cell contractile state by altering intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i). Information on the Ca2+ effect of integrins in vascular smooth muscle cells is limited, but nonexistent in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). We therefore characterized integrin expression in endothelium-denuded pulmonary arteries, and explored [Ca2+]i mobilization pathways induced by soluble ligands in rat PASMCs. Reverse transcriptase-PCR showed mRNA expression of integrins α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α7, α8, αv, β1, β3, and β4, and immunoblots of α5, αv, β1, and β3 confirmed protein expression. Exposure of PASMCs to integrin-binding peptides (0.5 mm) containing the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif elicited [Ca2+]i responses with an order of potency of GRGDNP > GRGDSP > GRGDTP = cyclo-RGD. Pharmacological analysis revealed that the GRGDSP-induced Ca2+ response was unrelated to Ca2+ influx and the inositol triphosphate receptor-gated Ca2+ store, but partially blocked by ryanodine or inhibition of lysosomerelated acidic organelles with bafilomycin A1. Simultaneous inhibition of both pathways was necessary to abolish the response. GRGDSP treatment increased cyclic ADP-ribose, the endogenous activator of ryanodine receptors, by 70%. GRGDSP also rapidly reduced Lysotracker Red accumulation, confirming direct modulation of acidic organelles. These data are the first demonstration of integrin-mediated Ca2+ regulation in PASMCs. The presence of an array of integrins, and activation of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores and lysosome-like organelles by GRGDSP suggest important roles for integrin-dependent Ca2+ signaling in regulating PASMC function.

Integrins physically bridge the ECM and cytoskeleton, and act as transducers of “outside-in” and “inside-out” signaling (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Extracellular integrin ligation changes [Ca2+]i in a variety of cell types, including platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, osteoclasts, neurons, glomerulosa cells, epithelial and smooth muscle cells (2Campbell S. Otis M. Cote M. Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.D. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1486-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Sjaastad M.D. Lewis R.S. Nelson W.J. Mol. Biol.

Wu X. Wilson E. Hill M.A. Davis G.E. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. J. Vasc. Res. 2003; 40: 211-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Integrin ligation also activates other intracellular signaling molecules, including H+ and a plethora of protein kinases such as the focal adhesion kinase, Rac, and extracellular signal regulated kinases (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar, 6Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). As a result, a myriad of cellular functions such as differentiation, proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and mechanosensing for shear and tension are affected (6Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 7Iqbal J. Zaidi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Integrins participate in controlling systemic vascular tone by invoking changes in smooth muscle [Ca2+]i, resulting in relaxation or contraction. Synthetic ligands carrying the prototypic integrin-binding tripeptide motif, arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD), decrease [Ca2+]i causing vasodilation in rat cremaster muscle arterioles (8Mogford J.E. Davis G.E. Platts S.H. Meininger G.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9D'Angelo G. Mogford J.E. Davis G.E. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2065-H2070PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, RGD-containing peptides constrict rat renal afferent arterioles through increased [Ca2+]i (10Yip K.P. Marsh D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F768-F776PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chan W.L. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. Yip K.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C593-C603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other integrin binding sequences also exist, such as leucine-aspartate-valine (LDV), which elevates [Ca2+]i and causes vasoconstriction of rat cremaster muscle arterioles (12Waitkus-Edwards K.R. Martinez-Lemus L.A. Wu X. Trzeciakowski J.P. Davis M.J. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 are, furthermore, directly involved in the vascular myogenic behavior, where blockade of either integrin inhibits myogenic constriction of skeletal muscle arterioles (13Martinez-Lemus L.A. Crow T. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol.,. 2005; 289: H322-H329Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Apart from regulating tone, integrins play an important role in vascular pathogenesis. This is evidenced by the remodeling and deposition of ECM components seen in various vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis (5Martinez-Lemus L.A. Wu X. Wilson E. Hill M.A. Davis G.E. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. J. Vasc. Res. 2003; 40: 211-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the pulmonary vasculature, remodeling occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, scleroderma, and pulmonary hypertension (14Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Interestingly, pulmonary vascular remodeling has been linked to integrin activation in rat models recapitulating pulmonary hypertension. Previous studies in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension show that degraded ECM components activate vascular smooth muscle cell integrin β3, causing focal adhesion formation and initiation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal transduction cascade (15Rabinovitch M. Clin. Chest Med. 2001; 22: 433-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Incidentally, the increased PASMC proliferation and medial hypertrophy related to pulmonary hypertension also involves altered [Ca2+]i homeostasis in PASMCs (16Mandegar M. Fung Y.C. Huang W. Remillard C.V. Rubin L.J. Yuan J.X. Microvasc. Res. 2004; 68: 75-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).The influence of integrins on [Ca2+]i homeostasis in governing systemic vascular tone, and the participation of integrins in pulmonary vascular remodeling suggest that integrin ligation would affect [Ca2+]i homeostasis in PASMCs. However, information to this end is lacking. In this article, we therefore test this hypothesis by monitoring [Ca2+]i levels in rat PASMCs upon exposure to soluble integrin ligands. We subsequently characterize the intracellular Ca2+ signaling cascade initiated by GRGDSP, and identify the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores and lysosome-related acidic organelles as the key mediators of this response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation and Culture of PASMCs—PASMCs were enzymatically isolated and transiently cultured as previously described (17Zhang W.M. Yip K.P. Lin M.J. Shimoda L.A. Li W.H. Sham J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L680-L690Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, lungs were removed from male Wistar rats (150-200 g) anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (130 mg/kg intraperitoneal), upon which intrapulmonary arteries were dissected in HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS) containing (in mm) 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Pulmonary arteries were carefully cleaned of connective tissue, and the endothelial layer removed by gently rubbing the luminal surface with a cotton swab. Arteries were incubated in ice-cold HBSS (30 min), and then in reduced Ca2+ (20 μm) HBSS (20 min, room temperature), upon which they were digested in reduced Ca2+ HBSS containing collagenase (Type I, 1750 units/ml), papain (9.5 units/ml), bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml), and dithiothreitol (1 mm), at 37 °C for 18 min. After washing with Ca2+-free HBSS, single smooth muscle cells were gently dispersed from the tissues by trituration in Ca2+-free HBSS, and cultured (16-24 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2) on 25-mm glass coverslips in Ham's F-12 medium (with l-glutamine) supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mg/ml penicillin.RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Intralobar pulmonary arteries and aorta were removed, cleaned of connective tissue, denuded of endothelium as above, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80 °C until use. Tissues were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using a PowerGen homogenizer (Fisher Scientific), and total RNA was isolated according to the protocol supplied with the TRIzol reagent. Ethanol-precipitated RNA samples were dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and quantified using a BioPhotometer spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).Total RNA samples were subsequently used for cDNA synthesis with SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Primers for PCR (Table 1) were carefully designed to regions specific for each integrin subtype, based on sequence alignments generated by a Clustal W algorithm. At least one of each primer pair was designed to exon-exon junctions, to minimize the possibility of amplifying genomic DNA. Where it was not feasible to design primers to exon-exon junctions, primers were designed to span intronic regions, to differentiate between genomic DNA and cDNA. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles using PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), which involved denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.TABLE 1Primer sequences used to amplify integrin cDNAPrimer sequenceSubtypeForward (5′-3′)Reverse (5′-3′)Expected size (bases)α1AGCAGACACAGGTCGGGATTGGTGGTGTTATGAGGGATGAC646α2CAGGTGACTTTTACCATTAACTTAGCCAACAGCAAAAGGATTC800α3AAGGAAACAGCTACATGATTCAGTCCATCCTGGTTGATGTCAC487α4ATCTAGTTTTTACACACAGGATTTTGTCAATGTCGCCAAGATT524α5GGTGATGACACAGAAGACTTTGTTGCGCTCCTCTGGGTTGAACA685α7GTGGTCCTAGATTATGTGTTAGATGGTAAAAGGTGACCTGAGTGCC722α8TGACACCACCAACAACAGTTCTGTGCTCCTCTTGGAAT548αvTATTGGGGATGACAACCCTCTGACCCTCATAGATGTGCTGAACAGGC500β1ATGGAGTGAATGGGACAGGAGACACACCATTTCCTCCACAGAT515β3GACTATCGACCCTCTCAGCACTTCCACTGGAGTCTTCATAG598β4GCGAGCTGCAAAAGGAAGTTCGTATCGCCGAGTAGTTGAT498 Open table in a new tab Preparation of Protein Samples and Western Analysis—Total protein was isolated from endothelium-denuded pulmonary arteries and aorta. Briefly, upon dissection, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and pulverized. Samples were subsequently homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes) in ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and protease mixture inhibitor (Roche Applied Sciences). Homogenized tissues were centrifuged (3000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), upon which the protein concentrations of the post-nuclear supernatant were measured with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Total protein from cultured PASMCs were isolated by scraping cells with a rubber policeman in the ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer and processed as described for the smooth muscle tissue.Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Samples were treated with Laemmli sample buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol (100 °C, 5 min), separated by an 8% polyacrylamide gel at a concentration of 20 μg/lane, and then electrotransferred onto Immobilon P membranes (0.45 mm, Millipore) using a tank transfer system (80 V, 3 h, 4 °C). Upon blocking (1 h, room temperature) with 5% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin/PBST) at 4 °C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: α5 (1:1000, catalog number AB1949, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA); αv (1:250, catalog number 611012, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA); β1 (1:2000, catolog number AB1952, Chemicon International); and β3 (1:500, catalog number 4702, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). After washing in PBST, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBST (1 h, room temperature), again washed extensively, and ultimately detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-CD38 immunoblot was performed essentially as described above, except that for the negative control, the antibody (1:200, catalog number sc-7049, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was preadsorbed with the antigenic peptide (5 times excess by weight, sc-7049P, Santa Cruz) prior to use (overnight, 4 °C).Calcium Imaging—PASMCs were loaded with Fluo-3 AM (10 μm) dissolved in Me2SO containing 20% pluronic acid for 45 min at room temperature (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Upon washing thoroughly with Tyrode solution containing (in mm) 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 10 NaHEPES (pH 7.4), the cytosolic dye was allowed to de-esterify for 20 min at room temperature.Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to monitor the fluorescence changes upon treatment of PASMCs with the respective agents. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Germany) using a Zeiss Plan-Neofluor ×40 oil immersion objective (NA = 1.3) and an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Fluorescence, measured at wavelengths >505 nm, was acquired in a framescan mode at either 5-(Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6) or 10-s (Fig. 7) intervals. Photobleaching and laser damage to cells were minimized by attenuating the laser to ∼1% of its maximum power (25 milliwatts). In all cases during fluorescence recordings, reagents were applied manually but with care, so as not to disturb the cells or cause an artificial change in fluorescence.FIGURE 4Concentration dependence of [Ca2+]i response to GRGDSP.

A, control, n = 160 cells from 8 dishes; bafilomycin, n = 202 cells from 11 dishes; B, control, n = 8 dishes; ryanodine + bafilomycin, n = 9 dishes.

Protocols were executed and data collected on-line with a Digidata analog-to-digital interface and the pClamp software package (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA).Changes in fluorescence intensity were used to calculate the cellular concentrations of Ca2+, using the following equation: [Ca2+]i = (KD·R)/[(KD/[Ca2+]rest) + 1 - R], where R is F/F0, KD of Fluo-3 is 1.1 μm, and the resting [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]rest) is 100 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i (i.e. Δ[Ca2+]i) were the differences between the calculated values and the initial [Ca2+]i at rest (i.e. 100 nm) (18Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Concentrations of Ca2+ were similarly calculated for data obtained with the epifluorescence microscope, upon obtaining a background fluorescence value in an area devoid of cells by using the Ca2+ ionophone 4-Br-A23187 (EMD Biosciences) followed by Mn2+ quenching.Imaging Lysosomes—Acidic organelles were labeled with the acidotropic dye Lysotracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) diluted in Tyrode's solution (50 nm) at room temperature for 30-45 min. Labeled PASMCs were imaged with a Zeiss LSM-510 inverted microscope as described above, but with excitation and emission wavelengths of 543 and >560 nm, respectively. Images were acquired in framescan mode at 2-min intervals, and cellular changes in fluorescence intensity were represented as F/F0, with F0 being the fluorescence level immediately preceding treatment with the respective agent.Detection of Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)—cADPR levels were measured in cultured PASMCs at passage 3-4. Cells were isolated and cultured in Ham's F-12 media overnight as described above, and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum thereafter. Prior to treatment with GRGDSP (1.25 mm), cells were washed three times with PBS, and equilibrated in Tyrode's solution for at least 30 min. Upon GRGDSP treatment, nucleotides were extracted from cells with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C, followed by removal with watersaturated diethyl ether. The aqueous layer containing cADPR was adjusted to pH 8 with 1 m Tris and contaminating nucleotides other than cADPR were removed with a mixture containing hydrolytic enzymes with the following final concentrations: 0.44 unit/ml nucleotide pyrophosphatase, 12.5 units/ml alkaline phosphatase, 0.0625 unit/ml NADase, 2.5 mm MgCl2. Incubation proceeded at 37 °C for 2 h. Detection of cADPR was performed with some modifications to the cycling method described recently (19Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 ml of cADPR standard or nucleotides extracted from cell samples were incubated with 100 μl of cycling reagent containing (final concentrations) 0.3 μg/ml ADP-ribosyl cyclase, 4 mm nicotinamide, 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8), 0.8% (v/v) ethanol, 40 μg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase, 8 μm resazurin, 0.04 units/ml diaphorase, and 4 μm flavin mononucleotide. Following a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the increase in resorufin fluorescence was measured using a Spectramax XPS fluorescent plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 544 and 590 nm, respectively (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Results are the averages of three to four independent experiments and are normalized to the value at time 0.Chemicals—GRGDSP, GRGDNP, GRGDTP, GRADSP, thapsigargin, nifedipine, SKF96365, ryanodine, Xestospongin C, bafilomycin A1, and 4-Br-A23187 were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); GRGESP and cyclo-RGD (cyclo-GRGDSPA) were from Bachem (Torrance, CA); caffeine was from Sigma.RESULTSIntegrin Expression in PASMCs—To determine the repertoire of integrins expressed in endothelium-denuded rat pulmonary arteries, RT-PCR was performed using primers designed to integrins α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α7, α8, αv, β1, β3, and β4 (Table 1). Fig. 1 shows a representative image of an RT-PCR, in which positive mRNA expression was observed for all integrin subtypes examined (Fig. 1a). We further compared the integrin expression profile to that in endothelium-denuded aorta (Fig. 1b). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the pattern of integrin expression was similar in both tissue types, except that integrin α4 consistently could not be detected in the aortic smooth muscle. Sizes of the PCR products obtained in all cases corresponded to that expected (see Table 1). All PCR primers were tested prior to use in other tissues (e.g. heart, small intestine, and brain) and shown to efficiently amplify products of the expected size (data not shown). Negative controls, in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted, yielded no PCR products (data not shown).FIGURE 1RT-PCR shows the presence of multiple integrin subtypes in pulmonary artery (A) and aortic (B) smooth muscle. Table 1 gives the specifics of the primers used, as well as the expected sizes, which correspond with each of the products obtained in this figure. All primers were tested in other tissue types to verify their capability in efficiently and robustly amplifying the product of the expected size. This figure is a representative image of an RT-PCR, which was repeated a total of 3 times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We focused our attention on a few integrin subtypes that have been characterized most extensively in other smooth muscles and examined the protein expression in endothelium-denuded pulmonary arteries and aorta. Western analysis of integrins α5, αv, β1, and β3 confirmed the presence of these proteins in both tissue subtypes (Fig. 2). Immunoblots were performed using both reduced and nonreduced protein samples, as certain antibodies were generated against reduced or non-reduced antigens. Some integrin α subunits including α5 and αv contain a disulfide-linked cleavage site at the C terminus of the protein, yielding 2 polypeptides in the presence of reducing agents (20Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β Subunits have internally disulfide-bonded cysteine-rich domains in the C termini that influence mobility on SDS-PAGE gels depending on the presence of reducing agents (21Green L.J. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A number of antibodies from various companies were tested for each of the integrin subtypes, and those giving the most specific products of the expected size were chosen. The anti-α5 antibody recognized a broad band of ∼150 kDa under non-reducing conditions in both PA and aorta, but was not reactive with the reduced protein as indicated by the manufactu"

The 2-hydroxy group of the substrate is hydrogen-bonded to Asp287, which forms a triad together with His218 and Glu221 and is assumed to be the catalytic base.

These enzymes have been reported to require neither a cofactor such as NAD+, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, or thiamine monophosphate nor a pyruvoyl group for catalytic activity. In studies on these enzymes, the interest is focused on their substrate specificities and catalytic mechanisms. We isolated a thermophilic reversible 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate (γ-resorcylate) decarboxylase (GRDC) 2The abbreviations used are: GRDC, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate (γ-resorcylate) decarboxylase. 2The abbreviations used are: GRDC, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate (γ-resorcylate) decarboxylase. from Rhizobium sp. strain MTP-10005 and characterized it (13Yoshida M. Fukuhara N. Oikawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6855-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GRDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2,6- and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate to 1,3-dihydroxybenzene (resorcinol) and 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, respectively but does not act on 2,4-, 2,5-, 3,4-, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 2-hydroxybenzoate, or 3-hydroxybenzoate (Scheme 1). 2,6-Dihydroxybenzoate is an important intermediate of medicine and agricultural or industrial chemicals (14Reid J.

However, it is generated together with 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate as a by-product at a rate of about half and half by traditional chemical methods (17Nakamatsu, T., Nishida, Y., and Kometani, N. (1993) Patent JP 0552, 912 A2.Google Scholar). 2,6-Dihydroxybenzoate is expected to be produced specifically from 2,6-dihydroxybenzene by the reverse carboxyl reaction of GRDC. Recently, Ishii et al. (18Ishii Y. Narimatsu Y. Iwasaki Y. Arai N. Kino K. Kirimura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported the purification and characterization of GRDC from Rhizobium radiobacter WU-0108, Agrobacterium tumefaciens IAM12048 (19Yoshida T. Hayakawa Y. Matsui Y. Nagasawa T. Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Pandoraea sp. 12B-2 (20Matsui T. Yoshida T. Yoshimura T. Nagasawa T. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). They reported that these enzymes also catalyze the reversible decarboxylation of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate without cofactors and have a similar substrate specificity. Orotidine 5′-monophosphate decarboxylase catalyzes the cofactorindependent decarboxylation. On the basis of the x-ray structure of the enzyme, it is proposed that the decarboxylation of orotidine 5′-monophosphate proceeds by an electrophilic substitution mechanism in which decarboxylation and carbon-carbon bond protonation by Lys62 occur in a concerted way (21Appleby T.C.

To elucidate the overall and active-site structure, the substrate recognition, and the reaction mechanism, we have determined the crystal structures of GRDC from the Rhizobium sp. strain MTP-10005 in the native form, GRDC complexed with the substrate 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate, and GRDC complexed with substrate analogue 2,3-dihydroxybezaldehyde at 1.7-, 1.9-, and 1.7-Å resolutions, respectively. Interestingly, these structures revealed that Zn2+ ion is bound to the active center to catalyze the reaction. We now report the first structure of GRDC as a novel Zn2+-dependent reversible decarboxylase. Crystallization and Data Collection—The purification of the enzyme has been reported elsewhere (13Yoshida M. Fukuhara N. Oikawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6855-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The initial screening for the crystallization conditions was performed using the sparse matrix screens (Crystal Screens I and II) from Hampton Research (23Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Crystallization of the native GRDC was carried out at 293 K by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, using 3.6 mg/ml protein solution and a reservoir solution containing 15% (w/v) PEG8000, 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The native crystal was obtained from a drop composed of a 1:1 volume ratio of the reservoir solution and the protein solution. Within 2 weeks, crystals had grown to dimensions of ∼0.05 × 0.15 × 0.40 mm3. Crystals of GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde were obtained at 293 K by soaking the native crystals in a reservoir solution containing 40 mm 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate for 10 min and 40 mm 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde for 40 min, respectively, before data collection. The x-ray diffraction data set for the native crystal was collected to 1.7 Å resolution at 100 K using a wavelength of 1.00 Å on the NW12 station equipped with an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector system at the photon factory, KEK (Tsukuba, Japan). The x-ray data sets for the GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate crystal and the GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde crystal were collected to 1.9 and 1.7 Å resolution at 100 K using a wavelength of 1.0 Å on the BL41XU station and a ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector at the SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). These three crystals are isomorphous with a space group of P212121 and have average cell dimensions of a = 109.2, b = 113.66, and c = 119.2 Å. There are four subunits in the asymmetric unit, and ∼44% of the crystal volume is occupied by solvent (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7893) Google Scholar). The heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking unliganded crystals in solutions containing heavy atom reagents. The data sets for heavy atom derivatives were collected to 2.15 and 2.45 Å resolution at 100 K on the NW12 station at the photon factory (KEK). All the data were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The scaling of all the data and the map calculations were performed with the CCP4 program suite (26Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 (CCP4)Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). The positions of one mercury and five platinum sites were determined with the program SOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The resulting isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering map has a mean figure-of-merit of 0.335 at a resolution of 20-3.0 Å. The map was significantly improved by the process of solvent flattening and local symmetry averaging with the program RESOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). The mean figure-of-merit reached 0.712 with the same resolution range. The map was of good quality, and the model of the subunit was gradually built into the 3.0 Å map through several cycles of model building using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). The model was refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization with the program CNS (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). A random sample with 10% of the reflections was set apart for the calculation of the Rfree. Solvent molecules were picked up on the basis of the peak heights (3.0 σ) and distance criteria (4.0 Å from protein or solvent) from the sigmaA-weighted Fo - Fc map. The procedure converged to Rfactor and Rfree values of 0.180 and 0.200, respectively, calculated for 163,233 reflections observed in a 40.3-1.70 Å resolution range (Table 1). The same refinement procedure was applied to GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde but using the coordinates of the unliganded enzyme as the initial model. When the Rfactor value became less than 30%, the simulated annealing 2Fo - Fc map showed residual electron densities corresponding to the bound 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. Solvent molecules were picked up from the sigmaA-weighted Fo - Fc map. Further model building and refinement cycles gave Rfactor values of 0.176 and 0.184 and Rfree values of 0.206 and 0.208 for GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, respectively (Table 1). Quality of the Structure—The final model of the native GRDC comprises 325 residues (1-325) of 327 residues for subunit A, 324 residues (1-324) for subunit B, 323 residues (1-20 and 24-326) for subunit C, 321 residues (1-20 and 24-324) for subunit D, and four Zn2+ ions with 1223 water molecules. The average thermal factors of the main-chain atoms (N, Cα,C,and O) in subunits A, B, C, and D are 16.7, 16.8, 19.0, and 19.4 Å2, respectively. The final model of the GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate comprises 325 residues (1-325) of 327 residues for subunit A, 324 residues (1-324) for subunit B, 324 residues (1-20 and 23-326) for subunit C, 321 residues (1-20 and 24-324) for subunit D, four Zn2+ ions, and four 2,6-dihydroxybenzoates with 1034 water molecules. The average thermal factors of the main-chain atoms in subunits A, B, C, and D are 17.5, 17.5, 19.4, and 19.8 Å2, respectively. The final model of the GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde comprises 325 residues (1-325) of 327 residues for subunit A, 324 residues (1-324) for subunit B, 323 residues (1-20 and 24-326) for subunit C, 321 residues (1-20 and 24-324) for subunit D, four Zn2+ ions, and four 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehydes with 1223 water molecules. The average thermal factors of the main-chain atoms in subunits A, B, C, and D are 19.3, 19.3, 21.4, and 22.7 Å2, respectively. The differences in the average thermal factors between the subunits AB and CD in the final models are because of the asymmetry of the intermolecular interactions. The thermal factors for both complexes imply that crystal packing has less effect on subunits A and B than on subunits C and D. The final models were validated with the PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crytallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and CNS (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar) programs. 99.4% of the amino acid residues in the final model were located in the most favorable and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). We note that one residue in the active site, Asp27, is located in the disallowed region in subunits A and B of the native GRDC. It is confirmed that the conformation of Asp27 is correct on the basis of the electron density map. We use subunit A and subunit B, if necessary, as the reference standards for the native and complex forms of GRDC. Structure diagrams were drawn using the programs MOLSCRIPT (32Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), RASTER3D (33Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar), and POV-SCRIPT+ (34Fenn T.D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 944-947Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Overall and Subunit Structure—The overall structure of GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate is shown in Fig. 1A. The molecular mass of the enzyme is about 151 kDa by gel filtration and that of the subunit is 37.5 kDa by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the GRDC exists as a homotetramer (13Yoshida M. Fukuhara N. Oikawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6855-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain is folded into a tetrameric form with a noncrystallographic 222 axis, having approximate dimensions of 95 × 85 × 50 Å. One subunit in the tetramer interacts with the other three subunits, and the surface areas of the subunit interfaces are 3431 Å2 for subunits A and B, 546 Å2 for subunits A and C, and 206 Å2 for subunits A and D. The largest of these areas is found between the subunits A and B (or C and D) indicating that the tetramer may be considered to be an assembly of two dimer units (a dimer of dimers) around a 2-fold axis. The subunit structure of GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate with secondary structure assignments by the program DSSP (35Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11983) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1, B and C. The subunit Cα carbon atoms except for Ala21-Asp28 in the native GRDC can be superimposed onto the corresponding ones in GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde within root mean square deviations of 0.08 and 0.05 Å with the maximum displacement of 0.25 and 0.23 Å, respectively. Thus, the overall structure of the native GRDC is quite similar to that of the complex with the substrate or analogue when Ala21-Asp28 is neglected. However, the region of Ala21-Asp28 is mobile and plays an important role in substrate recognition (see “Induced Fit of Linker 1”). The subunit is divided into a (αβ)8 barrel, three linkers (linker 1, Glu9-Asp38; linker 2, Arg166-Thr86; and linker 3, His232-Glu255), and a C-terminal tail (Ser304-C-terminal). The barrel has a typical TIM-barrel structure (β-strand S1, α-helix H3, S3, H4, S4, H5, S5, H6, S6, H7, S7, H8, S8, H10, S9, and H11) (Fig. 1, B and C). The linker 1 is inserted between S1 and H3 forming S2, H1, and H2. The random coiled linker 2 connects S6 and H7. The linker 3, composed of a random coil followed by H9, is between H8 and S8. The linkers play an important role in the formation of the dimeric unit because the residues from the linkers contribute to 46.5% of accessible surface area in the interface between subunits A and B. The C-terminal tail located at the dimer-dimer interface forms 40.5 and 46.6% of the interfaces between subunits A and C and subunits A and F, respectively, serving to form the tetramer. The amino acid sequence of GRDC displays no significant homology to those of the known decarboxylases requiring a cofactor such as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, thiamine pyrophosphate, and a pyruvoyl group. The program DALI (36Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) was used to search the Protein Data Bank data base for proteins possessing three-dimensional structures similar to that of the native GRDC. The highest Z scores (strength of structural similarity) were calculated to be 16.6 for the catalytic domain of d-hydantoinase (14% sequence identity; Protein Data Bank ID, 1YNY (37Radha Kishan K.V.

Davies G.J. Brannigan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2809-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), 13.2 for the α-subunit of urease (13%, 1UBP (44Benini S. Rypniewski W.R. Wilson K.S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 268-273Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar)), 13.1 for d-aminoacylase (9%, 1M7J (45Liaw S.H. Chen S.J. Ko T.P. Hsu C.S. Chen C.J. Wang A.H. Tsai Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)), and 13.1 for adenosine deaminase (12%, 1A4M (46Wang Z. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8314-8324Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). Because these enzymes are members of the recently identified TIM-barrel metallo-dependent hydrolase superfamily, GRDC is classified as a member of this superfamily. The superfamily is mainly divided into two subgroups depending on a bi-metal or mono-metal enzyme (47Lai W.L. Chou L.Y. Ting C.Y. Kirbv R. Tsai Y.C. Wang A.H. Liaw S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13962-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 48Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and GRDC thus belongs to the mono-metal-dependent hydrolase subgroup together with Fe3+-dependent cytosine deaminase (42Ireton G.C. McDermott G. Black M.E. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and Zn2+-dependent adenosine deaminase (46Wang Z. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8314-8324Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Possibly, the active site structure of GRDC is more similar to that of adenosine deaminase than cytosine deaminase in terms of the mono-Zn2+ binding. Induced Fit of Linker 1—One of the interesting features of GRDC is the insertion loop's conformational change to close the active site upon binding of the substrate (Fig. 1C). The Cα atoms of 314 residues (1-19 and 31-325) of 325 residues in the native form can be superimposed onto the corresponding ones in GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate within 0.5 Å with a root mean square deviation of 0.08 Å. However, the root mean square deviation for 11 residues excluded from the calculation is 1.36 Å with a maximum displacement of 2.48 Å. This indicates that, upon binding of the substrate (2,6-dihydroxybenzoate), a part (Ser20-Ala30) of the linker 1 changes its main-chain conformation to close the active site from the solvent region. The bound substrate is almost isolated from the solvent region because accessible surface area of the substrate is reduced from 298 to 1 Å2 (Fig. 1A). This is also the case for the GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde with the reduced accessible surface area of 3 Å2. The linker 1 acts as an active site lid and plays important roles in the substrate recognition and catalytic actions of the enzyme. It has been reported that isoaspartyl dipeptidase belonging to the hydrolase superfamily displays a conformational change similar to that of GRDC (39Jozic D. Kaiser J.T. Huber R. Bode W. Maskos K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Zinc Coordination and Active Site Structure—When the Rfactor value became less than 30%, the simulated annealing 2Fo - Fc map showed a marked electron density peak located within 2.0-2.3 Å from Glu8, His10, His218, and Asp287. The peak was identified as that of Zn2+ ion by an anomalous scattering experiment, although Zn2+ ion was not contained in the buffer solution for purification or crystallization, and GRDC has been reported to require no cofactor. Zn2+ absorption edge was determined to be 1.2805 Å by x-ray absorption experiment. An electron density was observed at the position on Bijvoet difference map based on the data at λ = 1.0000 Å, whereas there was no significant electron density on that based on the data at λ = 1.2820 Å. We also determined the Zn2+ concentration by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Zinc atomic absorbencies followed at a wavelength of 213.9 nm, using a Hitachi Z-8200 model. The calculated number of Zn2+ ion per each tetramer was 4.01. Active site components and bound Zn2+ ion in the native GRDC are shown in Figs. 2A and 3A. The Zn2+ ion located at the bottom of the active site is coordinated by the N-3 nitrogens of His10 (2.2 Å) and His164 (2.2 Å), the carboxylate oxygen of Glu8 (2.1 Å) and Asp287 (2.2 Å), and a water molecule (2.2 Å) with trigonal bipyramidal geometry. His164 and Asp287 act as axial ligands (aligned 173° apart through the Zn2+ ion) and His10, Glu8, and the bound water molecule form the vertices of three equatorial ligands. The side chains of Glu8, His10, His164, and Asp287 are arranged in geometrical positions favorable to act as ligands for Zn2+ by interactions with the neighboring residues of the active site. Glu8, His10, and His164 interact with Tyr162, Ser58, and Asn128, respectively. The carboxylate oxygen of Asp287 is hydrogen-bonded to the N-1 atom of His218, and the N-3 atom of His218 is further hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of Glu221, implying that the Asp:His:Glu triad forms the charge relay system. The Asp287 and His218 dyad is conserved in adenosine and cytosine deaminases, but it has been observed in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (42Ireton G.C. McDermott G. Black M.E. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 46Wang Z. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8314-8324Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Zinc coordination scheme is very similar to those observed in adenosine deaminase and cytosine deaminase, although Glu8 in GRDC is replaced by a His residue in both deaminases.FIGURE 3Schematic diagram showing hydrogen bond and coordinate bond interactions. Putative hydrogen bond interactions are shown by dotted lines if the acceptor and donor are less than 3.5 Å apart. Coordinate bonds between Zn2+ ion and the active site residues are shown by solid lines if Zn2+ ion and the ligand are less than 2.2 Å apart. A, GRCD in the native form.

The bottom of the cavity is composed of Zn2+ ion and the surrounding residues, and the active site wall is encircled by the C-terminal residues of the barrel (Ala61, Pro165, Pro185, Phe189, and Phe290), the linker 1 residues (Ser20 and Phe23), and the linker 3 residues (Asn234* (* indicates a residue from another subunit of the dimer unit) and Arg229*). Binding Mode of the Substrate and Substrate Analogue—2,6-Dihydroxybenzoate is a true substrate for GRDC, and the GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate crystal was obtained by soaking the native crystal in a solution supplemented with 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate for 10 min. The stereo structure of GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and the hydrogen-bonding scheme are shown in Figs. 2B and 3B, respectively. Upon binding of the substrate, three water molecules are expelled from the cavity. Concurrently, the linker 1 changes not only its main-chain but also its side-chain conformation to enclose the substrate in the cavity. The linker 1 residues, Ser20 and Phe23, behave like a lid for the active site cavity. Phe23 changes its side-chain direction toward the active site, and its side-chain phenyl group makes a van der Waals contact with the bound substrate with the shortest contact of 3.5 Å. The active site residues except for the linker 1 do not change their main-chain and side-chain conformations and retain the interactions among them upon binding of the substrate. The substrate carboxylate is coplanar with the substrate phenyl ring. One side of the substrate phenyl ring plane is perpendicular to the phenyl ring of Phe189 with the shortest contact of 3.8 Å. The other side is parallel to Phe290 with π-π interaction within 3.5 Å. One of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the substrate is directly coordinated to Zn2+ ion with a distance of 2.0 Å. The other oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. The substrate 2-hydroxy group is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate oxygen of Asp287, which is a ligand for Zn2+ ion and to two water molecules (W1 and W2), which are further hydrogen-bonded to Arg229*. Asp287 forms a triad together with His218 and Glu221. The 6-hydroxy group is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule, which interacts with Ser20 and Ala61. The activity of GRDC is inhibited by 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, which is an analogue of the substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. The stereo structure of GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and the hydrogen-bonding scheme are shown in Figs. 2C and 3C, respectively. The GRDC·2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde crystal was generated by the soaking method. The side-chain arrangements of the active site residues are quite similar to those observed in GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate. The location of 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde is roughly the same as that of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate, although the phenyl ring of 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde rotates by about 30° around the axis perpendicular to the ring at the C-1 atom (Fig. 3C). The aldehyde carbonyl group in cis-position with respect to the C-1—C6 bond is coordinated to a Zn2+ ion. This might cause the phenyl ring rotation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde compared with 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate. Asn234* is hydrogen-bonded to the 2- and 3-hydroxy groups. Arg229* and Asp287 interact with the 2-hydroxy group in the medium of two water molecules, W1 and W2. GRDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of both 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate but does not act on 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 2-hydroxybenzoate, or 3-hydroxybenzoate. This suggests that to catalyze the decarboxylation, it is necessary that the carboxylate and two hydroxy groups occupy three consecutive positions of the benzene ring (13Yoshida M. Fukuhara N. Oikawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6855-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity shown by GRDC might be explained by the binding mode of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde to the active site (Figs. 2 and 3). The substrate carboxylate is coordinated to bind Zn2+ ion with the 3-position of the benzene ring directed toward the entrance of the cavity. Pro185, Phe189, and Phe290 limit the substrate to having a planar shape. Asp287, Arg229*, and Asn234* form a hydrophilic cluster together with water molecules to interact with the 2-hydroxy group or the 2- and 3-hydroxy groups. Ser20 acts as the recognition site for the 6-hydroxy group with the aid of a water molecule. These results show that the active site can recognize the hydroxy groups at positions 2, 3, and 6 of a benzene ring. When 3,4- or 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate is superimposed onto 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate in GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate, the hydrophilic 4- or 5-hydroxy group makes short contacts of 2-3 Å with the hydrophobic phenyl ring of Phe23 as a lid for the active site cavity. The lack of activity for decarboxylation of 2,4-, 2,5-, or 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate is attributable at least in part to the unfavorable access between the 4- or 5-hydroxy group and Phe23. Mechanism—The crystallographic study revealed that GRDC is Zn2+-dependent decarboxylase, suggesting that the reaction mechanism is different from that of decarboxylase dependent on thiamine diphosphate (49Candy J.M.

The proposed mechanism of GRDC based on the geometrical consideration is shown in Fig. 4. Upon access of the substrate 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate to the active site cavity, GRDC changes the linker 1 conformation to enclose the substrate in the cavity. One of the substrate carboxyl oxygen atoms interacts with Zn2+ ion, and the substrate 2-hydoxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of Asp287. Asp287 is liganded to Zn2+ ion and is involved in a triad together with His218 and Glu221. This indicates that Asp287 plays an important role in the catalysis. The water molecule (W1) interacts with positively charged His218 and Arg229* and the substrate 2-hydroxy group. The water molecule (W2), which interacts with Arg229*, bridges Asp287 and the substrate 2-hydroxy group by hydrogen bonds. Zn2+ ion, the triad (Asp287, His218, and Glu221), W1, and W2 form the specific recognition site for the carboxylate and the adjacent 2-hydroxy group of the substrate. The negative charge on the substrate carboxylate group migrates via Zn2+ ion to the carboxylate of Asp287, which is polarized by the His218 and Glu221 pair (Fig. 4A). This increases the basicity of the carboxylate of Asp287, which then acts as a catalytic base to abstract a proton from the substrate 2-hydroxy group. The negative charge generated on the substrate O-2 flows into the aromatic ring and accumulates on the C-1 atom to form the substrate carbanion (Fig. 4B). The next step is the addition of a proton to the C-1 atom. The water molecule W1 interacts with positively charged Agr229* and His218, thereby reducing its pKa value. The pKa value would be further reduced after the 2-hydoxy proton abstraction by Asp287; the protonation at Asp287 weakens the hydrogen bond between Asp287 and His218 and decreases the electron density at N-1 of His218, thereby reducing the interaction between W1 and His218. W1, which is at a distance of 3.76 Å from the C-1 atom in Fig. 4A, approaches the C-1 atom within the distance of 3.4 Å on the formation of the carbanion followed by the adoption of sp3 hybridization by the C-1 atom. W1 is thus reasonably assumed to be the conjugate acid to shuttle its proton to the C-1 atom (Fig. 4C). Throughout this process, the repulsive interaction between the substrate carboxylate and the C-1 carbanion is suppressed by the coordination of the carboxylate to Zn2+ ion. The substrate C-2 carbonyl group then abstracts a proton from the carboxylate of Asp287 in concert with the decarboxylation of the substrate to yield carbon dioxide and resorcinol (Fig. 4, C and D). The enzyme also catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate is modeled into the active site of GRDC·2,6-dihydroxybenzoate on the assumption that 2-hydroxybenzoate moieties of both substrates occupy the same position. The 3-hydroxy group of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is located at a position favorable for forming a hydrogen bond with Asn234* (Fig. 2C). Therefore, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is a good substrate for GRDC. After submission of this paper, we learned that the native structure of mono-metal-dependent decarboxylase (α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ϵ-semialdehyde decarboxylase) belonging to the TIM-barrel metallo-dependent hydrolase superfamily has been published (58Martynowski D. Eyobo Y. Li T. Yang K. Liu A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10412-10421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have determined the three-dimentional structures of the novel decarboxylase, GRDC, in the native form, complexed with substrate 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and complexed with 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. This is the first structure of a Zn2+-dependent decarboxylase complex with the substrate or substrate analog belonging to the hydrolase superfamily. The arrangements of the active site residues, the substrate, the substrate analogue, and the interactions among them have been elucidated to provide a putative mechanism for catalysis of the enzyme. Asp287 and Zn2+ ion are identified as the catalyst."

Replicating physiologic apoptosis associated with tissue repair, fibroblasts incorporated into type I collagen matrices undergo apoptosis in response to collagen matrix contraction. In this in vitro model of wound repair, fibroblasts first attach to collagen via α2β1 integrin. This provides a survival signal via activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signal pathway. However, during subsequent collagen matrix contraction, the level of phosphorylated Akt progressively declines, triggering apoptosis. The mechanism underlying the fall in phosphorylated Akt is incompletely understood. Here we show that PTEN phosphatase becomes activated during collagen matrix contraction and is responsible for antagonizing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and promoting a decline in phosphorylated Akt and fibroblast apoptosis in response to collagen contraction. PTEN null fibroblasts displayed enhanced levels of phosphorylated Akt and were resistant to collagen matrix contraction-induced apoptosis. Reconstitution of PTEN in PTEN null cells conferred susceptibility to apoptosis in response to contraction of collagen matrices. Consistent with this, knockdown of PTEN in PTEN+/+ embryonic fibroblasts by small interfering RNA augmented Akt activity and suppressed apoptosis in contractile collagen matrices. Furthermore, inhibition of Akt activity restored the sensitivity of PTEN null cells to collagen contraction-induced apoptosis, indicating that the mechanism by which PTEN alters fibroblast viability is through modulation of phosphorylated Akt levels. Our work suggests that collagen matrix contraction activates PTEN by a mechanism involving cytoskeletal disassembly.

Our studies indicate a key role for PTEN in regulating fibroblast viability during tissue repair. Fibroblasts play an essential role in tissue repair. In response to injury, interstitial fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts (1Hinz B. Celetta G. Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Chaponnier C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Myofibroblasts synthesize and deposit type I collagen into the wound provisional matrix (2Desmouliere A. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Wound Repair Regen. 2005; 13: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). They subsequently contract the type I collagen matrix, facilitating wound closure (3Desmouliere A.

Using fibroblasts cultured in three-dimensional contractile type I collagen matrices as a model of wound/tissue repair, the molecular signals regulating fibroblast viability during collagen contraction have begun to be elucidated. When fibroblasts are incorporated into the type I collagen matrix, they utilize α2β1 integrin to attach and spread (5Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C.A. J. Biol.

Currently, the molecular mechanism by which collagen matrix contraction depresses the level of phosphorylated Akt, thereby promoting fibroblast apoptosis, is incompletely understood. However, our previous work has demonstrated that enforced activation of PI3K by overexpression of the constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K preserves Akt phosphorylation and protects fibroblasts from collagen matrix contraction-induced apoptosis. These data strongly suggest that collagen matrix contraction suppresses PI3K activity, thereby decreasing phosphorylated Akt. These data also suggest that certain phosphatase(s) may be responsible for inhibition of PI3K and Akt activity during collagen matrix contraction. PTEN is a dual protein and lipid phosphatase whose primary function is to convert phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate to phosphatidyinositol 4,5-biphosphate (13Stambolic V.

The phosphatase(s) responsible for facilitating a decrease in phosphorylated Akt in response to collagen matrix contraction have not been identified. Furthermore, the role of PTEN in regulating fibroblast removal during tissue repair is not known. Here we demonstrate for the first time that PTEN activity increases in response to collagen matrix contraction. This antagonizes PI3K activity, thereby promoting a decrease in the level of phosphorylated Akt, triggering fibroblast apoptosis. Our studies suggest a critical role for PTEN in regulating fibro-blast removal during tissue repair. Cell Culture—Human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and used between passages 9 and 11. PTEN null (-/-) and wild type (+/+) embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in the same medium as indicated. Reagents—Anti-polyclonal Akt antibody, anti-phosphorylated Akt antibody, human- or mouse-specific cleaved caspase-9 antibody, and PTEN antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-monoclonal PTEN for immunoprecipitation and phosphatase assay were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A specific Akt inhibitor (1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate) was purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Actin polymerization inducer (jasplakinolide) and microtubule-stabilizing agent (paclitaxel) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and Sigma, respectively. Adenovirus Construction and Akt Constructs—PTEN cDNA was generated from normal human lung fibroblasts (ATCC-210) by reverse transcription-PCR. Wild type (WT) and mutant (MU) PTEN DNA were generated by PCR. The primers used for wild type PTEN, which span the entire coding region of PTEN, are 5′-CTA CTC GAG GCT CCC AGA CAT GAC-3′ and 5′-ACG CTC GAG ATA AAA AAA AAT TCA G-3′. The lipid and protein phosphatase truncated mutant was generated by PCR with primers 5′-CAG CTC GAG GGA CGA ACT GGT GTA A-3′ and 5′-ACG CTC GAG ATA AAA AAA AAT TCA G-3′. The amplified products were cloned into MIGR1-IRES-GFP vector, followed by SalI and EcoRI digestion. The wild type and mutant PTEN MIGR1-IRES-GFP fragments were then cloned into adenovirus vectors, pAxCAwt (purchased from Dakara Bio. Inc.). The recombinant adenovirus with WT PTEN and MU PTEN were generated and collected in HEK 293 cells according to the company's instructions. Adenovirus titer was measured by the plaque method in 0.5% soft agar. Activated Akt (N-terminal myristoylation) construct under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) for overexpression of activated Akt in human lung fibroblasts. Type I Collagen Matrices—Type I collagen solution (Vitrogen 1000) was obtained from Cohesion (Palo Alto, CA). Collagen gels were prepared as previously described (5Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human lung fibroblasts (1.2 × 105) were resuspended in 2.0 ml of 1.5× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Type I collagen (3 mg/ml; Cohesion) was added to the cell suspension to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The cell/collagen solution was incubated in a water bath for 10 min at 37 °C, poured into 3.5-cm uncoated plastic dishes, and placed in a cell culture incubator at 10% CO2 and 37 °C, where the gels polymerized in ∼30-60 min. PTEN and Control siRNA—siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD). Twenty-one base sequences of the human PTEN gene against phosphatase domain were chosen (PTEN sense siRNA sequence, 5′-AAC CCA CCA CAG CUA GAA CUU-3′; PTEN antisense siRNA sequence, 5′-AAG UUC UAG CUG UGG UGG GUU-3′). A control nonsilencing siRNA was derived from bacteria, Thermotoga maritime. Control sense sequence was 5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTT-3′. Control antisense sequence was 5′-ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA AdTT-3′. Transient transfection of HLF-210 fibroblasts was performed using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Fibroblasts were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm glycerolphosphate, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4°C with protein A/G-coupled agarose beads and immunoprecipitated overnight (16 h) at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody. Western analysis of human lung fibroblasts was performed as previously described (5Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were subjected to 8-12% SDS-PAGE and transferred (90 min, 110 V) to nylon membrane. Membranes were blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with the primary antibody, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were developed using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—Human lung fibroblasts were transfected with PTEN siRNA or control siRNA. Alternatively, cells were infected by an adenoviral vector containing wild type or phosphatase-dead mutant PTEN construct followed by incorporation into collagen gels as described above. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 rpm, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-PTEN antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 10 μl of PTEN enzyme assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and 10 μl of phospholipid vesicles (PLV; 0.1 mm diC8PIP3, 0.5 mm dioleoyl phosphatidylserine in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA in diC8PIP3 followed by sonication for 30 min) were added to 5 μl of immunoprecipitate and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The enzyme reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of Malachite Green solution (0.034% malachite green in 10 mm ammonium molybdate, 1 n HCl, and 3.4% ethanol) for 15 min at room temperature. PTEN activity (pmol of phosphatate) was measured using a microtiter plate reader at 630 nm. TUNEL Assay—Fibroblasts recovered from type I collagen gels were analyzed for apoptosis using an in situ cell death detection kit (fluorescence TUNEL assay; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, recovered cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 60 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in TUNEL reaction mixture, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (18Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Experiments were performed three times. For assessment of the percentage of apoptotic cells within collagen gels using the TUNEL assay, microscopic analysis of at least 200 cells/slide was performed. Paired evaluations were made for experimental and control conditions within each experiment, and significance was determined by Student's t test. Significance level was set at p < 0.05. Collagen Matrix Contraction Increases PTEN Activity While Concomitantly Decreasing Akt Phosphorylation—We have previously demonstrated that during the process of collagen matrix contraction, the level of phosphorylated Akt progressively decreases (5Tian B.

These data suggest that collagen matrix contraction inhibits PI3K activity, thereby promoting the decrease in phosphorylated Akt. Because the PTEN phosphatase is a major inhibitor of PI3K, we sought to determine whether PTEN was involved in depressing the level of phosphorylated Akt during collagen matrix contraction. To begin to determine whether PTEN phosphatase activity may be responsible for facilitating the decrease in phosphorylated Akt during collagen contraction, we examined PTEN protein expression and activity as a function of time during collagen matrix contraction. Although PTEN protein expression did not appreciably change during collagen matrix contraction (Fig. 1B, top), PTEN phosphatase activity progressively increased. By 48 h, when collagen contraction was complete, the level of PTEN activity was significantly increased by ∼40% (Fig. 1C). This increase in PTEN activity inversely correlated with the decrease in the level of phosphorylated Akt and induction of collagen contraction-induced fibroblast apoptosis (5Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As a control, PTEN expression and activity were measured in noncontractile collagen matrices. Both PTEN expression and the level of phosphorylated Akt remained relatively steady in noncontractile matrices (Fig. 1B, bottom). In addition, PTEN activity was not significantly altered under noncontractile conditions (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that collagen matrix contraction is associated with increases in PTEN phosphatase activity. These data suggest that in response to collagen matrix contraction, PTEN phosphatase plays a role in down-regulating the β1 integrin survival signal by antagonizing PI3K activity, thereby facilitating a decrease in the level of phosphorylated Akt. Overexpression of Wild Type PTEN Promotes a Loss of Phosphorylated Akt and Augments Fibroblast Apoptosis in Contractile Collagen Matrices, whereas Overexpression of Mutant PTEN Preserves Akt Phosphorylation and Confers Protection against Collagen Contraction-induced Apoptosis—To directly test whether PTEN activity regulates the level of phosphorylated Akt and fibroblast viability in collagen matrices, PTEN activity was up-regulated by infecting normal lung fibroblasts with an adenoviral vector containing wild type PTEN. Alternatively, PTEN was down-regulated using a truncated mutant PTEN construct lacking the amino-terminal phosphatase domain (Fig. 2A). Cells were successfully infected with adenovirus expressing wild type PTEN and phosphatase-deleted PTEN mutant. GFP expression demonstrated that infection efficiency was high (>92%; Fig. 2B). We found that Akt was not phosphorylated in control contractile collagen matrices (untransfected fibroblasts and fibroblasts transfected with empty vector) at the 48 h time point (Fig. 2C). This finding is consistent with our previous observation that the level of phosphorylated Akt progressively decreases in response to collagen matrix contraction (5Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26630-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, Akt was also not phosphorylated in fibroblasts transfected with wild type PTEN in contractile collagen gels at the 48 h time point. In contrast, the level of phosphorylated Akt was preserved in fibroblasts transfected with the truncated mutant PTEN construct at 48 h. We also measured PTEN activity in cells expressing wild type PTEN and mutant PTEN in contractile matrices at the 48 h time point. We found that PTEN activity was increased >2-fold in cells expressing wild type PTEN (Fig. 2D). However, PTEN activity was not significantly altered in cells infected with empty vector or mutant PTEN constructs compared with untransfected cells. These data demonstrate an inverse correlation between PTEN activity and the level of phosphorylated Akt in contractile collagen matrices. We next analyzed the percentage of apoptotic fibroblasts recovered from contractile collagen gels at the 48 h time point by TUNEL (Fig. 2, E and F). The percentage of fibroblasts transfected with wild type PTEN that were apoptotic was increased nearly 3-fold compared with control. In contrast, the percentage of fibroblasts expressing mutant PTEN undergoing apoptosis was decreased compared with vector control. These data support the notion that the level of PTEN phosphatase activity is a critical regulator of the level of phosphorylated Akt and fibroblast viability in response to collagen matrix contraction. PTEN Null Cells Are Resistant to Collagen Matrix-induced Apoptosis—To confirm the role of PTEN in regulating the level of phosphorylated Akt and fibroblast viability in response to collagen matrix contraction, PTEN wild type (+/+) and null (-/-) embryonic fibroblasts were utilized. Because PTEN null cells proliferate rapidly in serum, PTEN+/+ and PTEN-/- cells were serum-starved for 2 days prior to incorporation into contractile gels. We first examined the viability of PTEN wild type and null embryonic fibroblasts during collagen matrix contraction. At 48 h, gel contraction was largely complete in both PTEN+/+ and PTEN-/- collagen gels (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, we found that PTEN null fibroblast cell numbers increased during collagen matrix contraction (Fig. 3B, top). In contrast, similar to normal human lung fibroblasts, PTEN wild type embryonic fibroblast cell numbers decreased. We quantified the level of apoptosis in fibroblasts recovered from contractile gels at the 48 h time point by a TUNEL assay. We found that the level of apoptosis in PTEN null cells was very low (<2%), whereas the level of apoptosis in PTEN+/+ control embryonic fibroblasts and normal human lung fibroblasts was ∼11 and ∼7%, respectively (Fig. 3B, bottom). Although some of the increase in PTEN null cell number was probably due to increased proliferation, this result indicates that at least some of the increase in PTEN null cell number in contractile collagen matrices was due to increased resistance to apoptosis. We also examined the level of phosphorylated Akt in PTEN wild type and null fibroblasts in response to collagen matrix contraction. Using PTEN null fibroblasts cultured in contractile collagen gels, Akt remained fully phosphorylated during collagen matrix contraction (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the level of Akt phosphorylation was decreased at 24 h in contractile collagen gels containing PTEN+/+ fibroblasts. Taken together, these data further suggest that PTEN phosphatase activity regulates the level of Akt phosphorylation/activity and fibroblast susceptibility to the proapoptotic stimulus of collagen matrix contraction. Reconstitution of Wild Type PTEN in PTEN Null Cells Confers Susceptibility to Collagen Matrix Contraction-induced Apoptosis—Since PTEN null fibroblasts were resistant to apoptosis and Akt remained phosphorylated in response to collagen matrix contraction, we investigated the effect of reconstitution of PTEN in PTEN null fibroblasts by infecting the fibroblasts with an adenoviral vector containing a wild type PTEN construct. As controls, PTEN null fibroblasts were infected with either empty vector or the truncated mutant PTEN construct or were left uninfected. The levels of phosphorylated Akt, total Akt, and PTEN protein expression as well as PTEN phosphatase activity were examined at the 48 h time point in contractile collagen gels. The level of apoptosis in fibroblasts recovered from contractile collagen gels at the 48 h time point was analyzed by TUNEL. Using PTEN null fibroblasts infected with wild type PTEN, PTEN protein expression and phosphatase activity were restored (Fig. 4, A and B). Importantly, the level of phosphorylated Akt decreased in response to collagen matrix contraction (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, these cells now became susceptible to collagen matrix contraction-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4, C and D). However, in controls, untransfected PTEN-/- cells and PTEN-/- fibroblasts transfected with empty vector, no significant PTEN activity could be detected, and Akt remained phosphorylated (Fig. 4, A and B). These cells remained highly resistant to apoptosis, and very few apoptotic cells could be detected (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, in the PTEN null fibroblasts transfected with the truncated mutant PTEN construct, no significant PTEN activity was detected, Akt remained phosphorylated, and similarly these cells were markedly resistant to collagen contraction-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that PTEN regulates fibroblast viability in contractile collagen matrices and suggest that the mechanism involves modulation of the level of Akt phosphorylation. Knockdown of PTEN by PTEN siRNA Preserved Akt Phosphorylation and Conferred Resistance to Collagen Matrix Contraction-induced Apoptosis—We next knocked down PTEN in PTEN wild type (+/+) embryonic fibroblasts using PTEN siRNA. The levels of PTEN and phosphorylated Akt were examined at the 48 h time point in contractile collagen gels. We found that PTEN siRNA effectively decreased PTEN protein expression by ∼60%, whereas control siRNA did not (Fig. 5A). Of note, the transfection efficiency of the fibroblasts using GFP siRNA as a surrogate was ∼54%. We next examined the level of PTEN activity in contractile collagen gels at 48 h. We found that PTEN activity was decreased by ∼40% in cells treated with PTEN siRNA but not in cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the level of phosphorylated Akt was increased in PTEN+/+ fibroblasts treated with PTEN siRNA. Moreover, knockdown of PTEN reduced susceptibility of the PTEN+/+ fibroblasts to collagen matrix contraction-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C). These data provide further support for the concept that during collagen matrix contraction, PTEN phosphatase activity regulates fibroblast viability via modulating the level of Akt phosphorylation/activity.

However, we previously demonstrated that colonic PepT1 may be expressed during chronic inflammation. To begin elucidating inflammatory hPepT1 signaling, we herein investigated the long term leptin treatments, on PepT1 expression and activity in Caco2-BBE cells, and began to reveal the involved signaling pathways. We successfully cloned the 723-bp hPepT1 promoter region and identified the human transcription initiation site 86 bp upstream from the translation start site. Leptin treatment dose- and time-dependently increased hPepT1 promoter and transport activities in Caco2-BBE cells, with maximal activity observed in cells treated with 100 nm leptin for 8 h. Under these conditions, we observed 2-fold increases in hPepT1 mRNA and protein expression, as well as increased transport activity. Our molecular analyses of possible signal-transduction pathways revealed that leptin treatment enhanced the intracellular levels of cAMP and phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) protein in Caco2-BBE cells, whereas our deletion, mutation, and CDX2 overexpression analyses demonstrated that interaction of the Cdx2 and phosphorylated CREB transcription factors was essential for leptin-induced hPepT1 transcription in Caco2-BBE cells. Our results indicate that leptin, which is increased in inflamed colonic mucosa, triggers colonic expression of hPepT1 via the CREB and Cdx2 transcription factors. These findings provide important new insights into the mechanisms of intestinal inflammation and may suggest new therapeutic modalities in the future.

We recently reported that the normal colon lumen contains low (nanomolar) concentrations of leptin. Because no leptin staining was detected in epithelial cells from normal small and large intestines, we suggest that this leptin arises from the gastric gland (25Sitaraman S. Liu X. Charrier L. Gu L.H. Ziegler T.R. Gewirtz A. Merlin D. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 696-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we detected strong leptin staining in colonic epithelial cells from inflamed tissues, and the luminal leptin concentration was up to >15-fold higher than normal during inflammation (25Sitaraman S.

The intestinal luminal leptin and the leptin in colonic epithelial cells provide an additional local pool of leptin. The latter observation suggests that colonic epithelial cells may be in contact with high leptin concentration and may play important physiopathological roles in the colon during inflammation. Various leptin receptor isoforms, including the functional long isoform (Ob-Rb), have been detected in rat intestines from the duodenum to the colon and in the Caco2 model intestinal cell line (26Buyse M.

For example, our group demonstrated that luminal leptin can regulate the activity of transporters such as monocarboxylate transporter 1 (31Buyse M. Sitaraman S.V. Liu X. Bado A. Merlin D. J. Biol.

Leptin administered to the basolateral side of Caco2 cells was found to inhibit the secretion of triglycerides, the biosynthesis of apoB-100 and apoB-48, and the output of chylomicron and low density lipoproteins (29Doi T.

Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that short term leptin treatment increased hPepT1 activity in vivo and in vitro (26Buyse M. Berlioz F. Guilmeau S. Tsocas A. Voisin T. Peranzi G. Merlin D.

However, no previous study has investigated transcriptional regulation of hPepT1 in response to hormones, particularly during intestinal inflammation. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the leptin-induced transcriptional activation of hPepT1 in the intestinal epithelia. Cell Culture—Caco2-BBE cells (passages 45 and 75) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's Vogt-modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 14 mm NaHCO3, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/100 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Transfected cells were maintained in the same medium containing 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and 90% humidity, and the medium was changed daily. Monolayers were subcultured every 7 days with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen). Transport experiments were performed with confluent monolayers plated on permeable supports (area = 1cm2; pore size, 0.4 μm; Transwell-Clear polyester membranes from Costar VWR, Suwanee, GA) and examined 15 days post-plating. For extraction of proteins, membranes, or RNA, Caco2-BBE cells were plated in 6-well plates (Costar VWR) at a density of 104 cells/cm2 and prepared 15 days post-plating. Isolation of the 5′-Flanking Region of the hPepT1 Gene—Genomic DNA was extracted from Caco2-BBE cells using the REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit (Sigma). The promoter of the hPepT1 gene was amplified using PCR primers specific to the 5′-flanking region of the human PepT1 gene (sense, 5′-AAA GAA AGG ATG ATT CTT AAA GAA AGG AAA TG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CAT GGC GGC GGC TCC CAG GGC TCC TGC-3′). The PCR conditions consisted of 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was gel-purified, subcloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and confirmed by sequence analysis. For promoter activity, the hPepT1 promoter pCR 2.1-TOPO was digested with SacI and XhoI and subcloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—RACE 4The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RLA, relative luciferase activity; PKA, protein kinase A; pCREB, phosphorylated CREB; CMV, cytomegalovirus; Sar, sarcosine. was performed with total RNA isolated from Caco2-BBE cells and the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total RNA was dephosphorylated, decapped, and ligated to the provided GeneRacer RNA oligonucleotide. The resulting RNA was reverse-transcribed using a human PepT1-specific primer (hPepT1 5′-RACE400, 5′-AAG GAC AGC ACC ACG TGC ACA GGA A-3′) and the provided Superscript III reverse transcriptase. The 5′-end of PepT1 was amplified from this cDNA using the hPepT1 5′RACE400 primer and the provided GeneRacer 5′ Primer. The resulting product was further amplified with the nested primers hPepT1 5′RACEnest (5′-GAT GGC GGT GGA CAG GTT ATC ATC C-3′) and the provided GeneRacer 5′ nested primer. The resulting RACE product was subcloned into the pCR-4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Preparation of the Reporter Constructs—The -634/+89 hPepT1 promoter, contained in the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), was digested with SacI and XhoI, and the product was subcloned into the pGL3-Basic firefly luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Site-directed mutations in the putative CREB and Cdx2 binding sites of the -634/+89 construct were introduced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with the following primers: hPepT1 promoter with mutated CREB, sense (5′-CAA CGG GGC CGG GCC TGG AAT TCA GGT CGG AGG AGT AG-3′) and antisense (5′-CTA CTC CTC CGA CCT GAA TTC CAG GCC CGG CCC CGT TG-3′); hPepT1 promoter with the first Cdx2 site mutated, sense (5′-GAA ATG TAG AAT CCC CCA GAG ATG CTT TCA AAG GTT-3′) and antisense (5′-AAC CTT TGA AAG CAT CTC TGG GGG ATT CTA CAT TTC-3′); hPepT1 promoter with the second Cdx2 site mutated, sense (5′-GGT TGA ATC TCA AAA TGA AGC CAC ACA CAC ACT CT-5′) and antisense (5′-AGA GTG TGT GTG TGG CTT CAT TTT GAG ATT CAA CC-3′); hPepT1 promoter with the third Cdx2 site mutated, sense (5′-AAC CTC CCC TTA GAC TTC TTC GAA ATG CAC ATT CTG G-3′) and antisense (5′-CCA GAA TGT GCA TTT CGA AGA AGT CTA AGG GGA GGT T-3′). The PCR conditions consisted of 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The truncated promoter construct (Table 1), containing deletions of all three Cdx2 sites (-324/+89) was amplified using specific primers (sense, 5′-AGC CCC GAC CTC CTG AGT CAG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CAT GGC GGC GGC TCC CAG GGC TCC TGC-3′) and cycling conditions of 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product (324 bp) was gel-purified and subcloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for confirmation by sequence analysis. This was subsequently digested with BamHI and subcloned into the pGL3-Basic firefly luciferase reporter vector (Promega).TABLE 1PepT1 promoter constructs Open table in a new tab Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay—Caco2-BBE cells (50,000 cells/well) were cultured in 12-well plates for 1 day. At 50-70% confluence, the cells were rinsed and then incubated with 1000 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), 5 ng of a construct encoding Renilla luciferase (phRL-CMV), 2 μg of the relevant hPepT1 promoter construct, and 10 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen). In each experiment, cells were incubated with the same total amount of plasmid DNA. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with the provided buffer (Luciferase Assay Kit, Promega). Subsequently, the Caco2-BBE cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of leptin or vehicle for 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, or 48 h. For the luciferase activity assay, 20 μl of cell extract was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega), and the resulting luminescence was measured for 10 s in a luminometer (Luminoskan, Thermal Labsystems, Needham Heights, MA). Each luciferase activity was normalized with regards to that of the control Renilla luciferase. Extracts were analyzed in duplicate, and at least two independent experiments were performed for each experiment. The observed luciferase activity reported in each figure is expressed as the percentage of the activity obtained with regards to the most active construct used in that figure. The DNAs and transfected cell lines are as indicated in the individual experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of Cdx2 Expression—Caco2-BBE cells were cultured to confluence on plastic supports (area, 9.4 cm2) for 14 days, and total RNA was isolated using a Micro Fast Track™ kit (Invitrogen). RNA yield was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and 3 μg of each total RNA was primed with oligo(dT) and reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase, using the cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen). The reverse-transcribed cDNA was PCR-amplified with primers specific for Cdx2 (sense, 5′-AGC CAA GTG AAA ACC AGG AC-3′; and antisense, 5′-AGC CAA GTG AAA ACC AGG AC-3′; yielding a 722-bp product) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (internal control; sense, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′; and antisense, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′). The cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. The resulting PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide. The desired fragment (722 bp) was gel-extracted using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), ligated into the Topo Mammalian Expression Vector system (Promega), grown and purified using the Mini-Prep plasmid kit (Qiagen), and confirmed by sequencing (Lark Sequencing, Houston, TX). Subconfluent Caco2-BBE cells were transfected with Cdx2-Topo or empty vector, using the Trojene transfection reagent (Avanti, Alabaster, AL) according to the manufacturer's instructions, for 3-4 h in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen). Transfectants were selected in medium containing 1.2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). cAMP Analysis—Caco2-BBE cells were stimulated apically and basolaterally with 100 nm leptin or 10 μm forskolin for the indicated times, and cAMP levels were measured from whole cell lysates using a competitive cAMP immunoassay kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Luminescence was read with a luminoscan (Ascent Thermo Labsystems, Needham Heights, MA). Membrane Extractions—Caco2-BBE cells were grown at confluency, pelleted, homogenized in 5 mm HEPES containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline by repeated passage through an 18-gauge needle, and the resulting protein solution was boiled for 5 min at 100 °C in Laemmli buffer supplemented with 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed on ice in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the Catch and Release Reversible Immunoprecipitation Kit (Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY), according to the manufacturer's instructions under non-denaturing conditions. Briefly, 500 μg of cell lysate, 4 μg of anti-phospho-CREB antibody (Upstate Biotech), 10 μl of antibody capture affinity ligand, and washing buffer were mixed, applied to a spin column, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The spin column was then placed in a capture tube and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 30 s to collect the flow-through. The spin column was washed three times (5,000 rpm, 30 s) using the provided wash solution, and the target protein was eluted in its native form with 70 μl of non-denaturing elution buffer and centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 30 s. For immunoblot analysis, the eluate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes overnight at 4 °C. The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in blocking buffer, washed with blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate antibody. The blots were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibody, and probed using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected for Western blot analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Folin method (DC Protein Assay kit, Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were mixed in Tricine sample buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 5 min, resolved on 7.5% (Bio-Rad) or 8% polyacrylamide gels (VWR, Westchester, PA), and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in blocking buffer, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature, along with rabbit anti-hPepT1 antibody (1:1000 dilution (11) or mouse anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution, Invitrogen). The membranes were washed three times for 15 min each in blocking buffer and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were washed, and immunoreactive proteins were detected with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The band intensities were quantitated using a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Northern Blot Analysis—The 2.6-kb hPepT1 cDNA (11Merlin D. Si-Tahar M. Sitaraman S.V.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1666-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was used as probe for Northern blot analysis. Caco2-BBE cells were incubated with or without 100 nm leptin for 8 h, and total RNA was isolated using the Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research, Cincinnati, OH). Total RNA (20 μg) was denatured for 15 min at 65 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 50% formamide and 6% formaldehyde, and then resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde. The separated RNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and covalently cross-linked by exposure to UV light. The hPepT1 cDNA probe was labeled with [α-P32]CTP using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized to the membrane in 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 250 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaPO4, and 1 mg of DNA salmon sperm (Ambion, Austin, TX). A mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was used as the control (Ambion), and visualization was made by autoradiography. The band intensities were quantitated using a gel-documentation system (Alpha Innotech). Uptake Experiments—Cells were grown on filters for 15 days, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and placed in containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in the basolateral compartment and 10 mm MES (pH 6.2) in the apical compartment. The monolayers were allowed to stabilize in these buffers for 15 min at 37 °C. The apical compartment was then loaded with Hanks' balanced salt solution-10 mm MES (pH 6.2) containing 20 μm [14C]Gly-Sar with or without 20 mm Gly-Leu, or the basolateral compartment was loaded with Hanks' balanced salt solution-10 mm MES (pH 7.2) without [14C]Gly-Sar or Gly-Leu. After samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, the supernatants were removed, the cells were washed twice, the filters were cut, and cell-associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a β-counter. The results are expressed as specific uptake of [14C]Gly-Sar mediated by hPepT1, calculated as follows: (uptake of [14C]Gly-Sar) - (uptake of [14C]Gly-Sar in the presence of Gly-Leu). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Probes for the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were prepared using a standard protocol. Forward Cdx2 (GAATCTCAAAATAAAGCCACACA) and Reverse Cdx2 (TGTGTGGCTTTATTTTGAGATTC) are complementary oligonucleotides for the second Cdx2-562 binding site, Forward* Cdx2 (TAAGTAACTCAAGCCACACAAAA) and Reverse* Cdx2 (TTTTGTGTGGCTTGAGTTACTTA) are complementary oligonucleotides for the second Cdx2-562 binding site mutant. The probes were synthesized with high-performance liquid chromatography purification, represent the transcript factor binding sites, and were first end-labeled with a Biotin 3′ End DNA Labeling Kit (Pierce). Briefly, 0.2 unit/μl of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, 0.5 μm biotin-11-UTP, and 100 nm of each single-stranded oligonucleotide were incubated in 1× terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase reaction buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. EDTA (2.5 μl of 0.2 m) was added to stop the reaction, and 50 μl of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol was added to extract the labeled oligonucleotides. For annealing, concentrated complementary oligonucleotides were mixed together at a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. The heat was then gradually reduced over 3 hours until the oligonucleotides reached room temperature. Standard EMSAs were performed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Pierce). Briefly, 20 fmol of each biotin end-labeled target oligonucleotide pair was incubated in EMSA binding buff"

A major problem in developing safe and effective co-receptor inhibitors is the risk of interfering with chemokine receptor signaling, thereby causing harmful side effects. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying chemokine function in HIV infection will hopefully provide a foundation for designing and screening drugs that offer strong and long lasting HIV-inhibitory function but have little effect on the physiology of the homeostatic chemokine system. In the past years, extraordinary progress has been made in solving the structures of gp120 and CD4 and in demonstrating that chemokines and small derivative molecules block HIV infection (4Poignard P.

The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells consists of a complex assembly of various lipids and proteins that are distributed in regions of distinct lipid microenvironments known as lipid or non-lipid raft microdomains (12Edidin M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Jacobson K. Dietrich C.

Lipids in rafts possess long and saturated fatty acyl chains and are organized in a tightly packed, liquid-ordered manner, whereas non-lipid raft microdomains contain shorter, unsaturated fatty acyl chains and are in a loosely packed, disordered state (12Edidin M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Jacobson K. Dietrich C.

Lipid rafts are defined as microdomains that are enriched with cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and sphingomyelin and are often isolated in detergent-resistant membrane fractions. Previous studies draw different conclusions regarding the role of lipid raft microdomains during the formations of HIV entry complexes involving CD4 and CCR5. Using detergent insolubility or immunostaining with fluorescence microscopy, several studies suggest that CD4 and CCR5 receptors localize in lipid rafts, and this localization is important for ligand binding, receptor signaling, and the formation of HIV entry complexes (18Manes S. del Real G.

In contrast to these reports, other reports suggest that the localization of CD4 and CCR5 in the lipid raft microdomains is not required for HIV infection and conclude that HIV entry into T-cells does not depend on the localization of CD4 and CCR5 to cholesterol-enriched, detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (20Popik W.

However, recent studies suggest that membrane microdomains isolated from detergent do not reliably reflect the organization of the lipids in the cell membrane. It has been very difficult to demonstrate the existence of lipid rafts in cells, because their size is <70 nm in diameter, which is too small to be resolved by light microscopy. In addition, their stability and motion on the plasma membrane of live cells are unclear (12Edidin M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 14Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 15Pierce S.K. Nat. Rev.

Because of the dynamic and submicroscopic nature of lipid microdomains in living cells, the physiological function of lipid microdomains in HIV entry is still in dispute. Structural studies suggest that a mature HIV particle contains an average of 10-15 spikes, the distance between two spikes is ∼23 nm, and a spike forms a knob with a diameter of 10.5 nm (23Gelderblom H.R.

Binding of CD4 to gp120 leads to conformational changes in a spike that allows gp120 to interact with a chemokine receptor. Binding of gp120 to CD4 and a chemokine receptor triggers further structural changes that allow the gp41 to insert into the target cell membrane (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev.

High resolution fluorescence imaging techniques that take advantage of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescence proteins have been developed that offer a new approach for studying the formation of HIV entry complex in living cells (29Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Because of the extreme sensitivity of the efficiency of FRET to the distance between FRET donor and acceptor proteins, which are within 10 nm, FRET imaging has proven to be a valuable tool for studying protein-protein interaction as well as conformational changes in a protein complex in live cells (30Jiao X.

Here we report the results of studies using FRET imaging coupled with quantitative microscopy to monitor gp120-induced interactions on the plasma membrane of live cells between CCR5 and CD4, which were tagged with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (FRET donor) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (FRET acceptor). We observed that gp120 variants that interact with both CD4 and CCR5 induced FRET increases. Disruption of lipid raft microenvironments by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which depletes cholesterol, did not alter the distributions of CD4 and CCR5 on the membrane. However, this treatment blocked gp120-induced FRET increases, suggesting that cholesterol-rich microdomains are required for gp120-induced interactions between CD4 and CCR5. Chemicals and Reagents—pEYFP-N1 and pECFP-N1 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. HIV-1 core+V3 (JRFL, YU2, HXB2) (36Huang C.C. Tang M. Zhang M.Y. Majeed S. Montabana E. Stanfield R.L. Dimitrov D.S. Korber B. Sodroski J. Wilson I.A. Wyatt R. Kwong P.D. Science. 2005; 310: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), SDF1α, and RATENs were purchased from BIO-SOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Fluo-4-AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Water-soluble cholesterol was from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (JL-8) was from BD Biosciences. All of the other reagents were reagent grade and were obtained from standard suppliers. Plasmid, Cell Line, and Transfection—Human CD4 and CCR5 genes were generated by PCR. The plasmids encoding CD4-YFP were constructed by inserting the PCR product of CD4 into the pEYFP-N1 vectors between the BglII and EcoRI sites. The plasmid encoding CCR5-CFP was constructed by inserting the PCR product of CCR5 into the pECFP-N1 vector between the HindIII and BamHI sites. HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin (5 μg/ml), and streptomycin (5 μg/ml) and were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The HEK293T cells were transfected or co-transfected with the plasmids encoding CD4-YFP and/or CCR5-CFP mediated by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cholesterol Extraction and Reconstitution—For cholesterol extraction, cells in serum-free medium were treated with 10 mm MβCD for 30 min at 37 °C and then rinsed and incubated in the growth medium with 1% lipid-free bovine serum albumin. The efficiency of cholesterol extraction was reported in previous studies (30Jiao X. Zhang N. Xu X. Oppenheim J.J. Jin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). MβCD-treated cells were reconstituted with 100 μg/ml water-soluble cholesterol at 37 °C for 1 h. Calcium Assay—HEK293T cells were seeded in four-well chambers at 10E4/ml, 24-36 h before the experiments. After 3 h of starvation, the cells were labeled by incubation with Fluo-4-AM in Hanks' balanced salt solution for half an hour, washed twice, and incubated for half an hour before imaging under the microscope. Upon the addition of gp120 or RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell-expressed and -secreted) (50 nm) to the cell chamber, time-lapse images were collected in multitrack mode, and CFP and Fluo-4 images were digitally separated. Changes in Ca2+ concentration were monitored as the changes in the intensity of Fluo-4 (It/I0, where It is the intensity at time t and I0 is the intensity at time 0). Imaging and FRET Assay—Cells were washed twice with 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution and then starved in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h. Before the imaging, the cells were treated with 0.15 nm gp120 (JRFL, YU2, HXB2) for 20 min. A Zeiss Plan-apochromat 40× oil immersion objective was used for image acquisition. Images were collected in multitrack mode (Zeiss 510). In Track I, there were two channels, cells were excited with 458 nm, CFP emission signals were collected through Channel I (475-525 nm), and FRET emission signals were collected through Channel II (>530 nm). In Track II, there was only one YFP channel, and YFP emission signals were collected with this channel (>530 nm). FRET efficiency between CFP and YFP was analyzed using Zeiss laser scanning microscope software. Intermolecular FRET efficiency was shown as normalized FRET (NFRET) using macros of Zeiss LSM software. Briefly, correction factors were determined from single CFP or YFP control cells as follows: β(F/D) from CCR5-CFP single positive cells and γ(F/A) and δ(D/F) from CD4-YFP single positive cells, where F, D, and A are fluorescence intensities of the donor (CFP) when excited with the wavelength of the donor (CFP channel), that of the acceptor when excited with wavelength of the donor (FRET channel), and that of the acceptor when excited with the wavelength of the acceptor (YFP channel). β, γ, and δ depend on the image acquisition settings and were determined under identical settings for all FRET experiments. The original images were background-subtracted, and CFP images were further corrected for bleed-through components consisting of fractions of actual acceptor fluorescence at 458 nm excitation by image processing using the equation Dcor = D - δF/1 - βδ. NFRET images were processed on a pixel-by-pixel basis using equation NFRET = [F - βD - γ(1 - βδ)A]/1 - βδ/(DcorA)½ (38Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For quantification of NFRET, regions of interest (ROIs) covering the plasma membrane from the acquired images were chosen, processed as above, and calculated automatically in the FRET macro of the LSM imaging software program. Means ± S.D. are shown. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test. Expression of CCR5 and CD4 Receptors Tagged with Fluorescence Proteins—To investigate the arrangement of CCR5 and CD4 in the plasma membranes of live cells, we fused CFP to the C terminus of CCR5 and YFP to the C terminus of CD4. HEK293 cells were transfected with the construct expressing CCR5-CFP or CD4-YFP (Fig. 1). CCR5-CFP (Fig. 1B) and CD4-YFP (Fig. 1C) were expressed efficiently on plasma membrane with no gross heterogeneity in their distribution. CCR5-CFP and CD4-YFP were detected with the expected molecular mass by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 1, C and F). Two bands were detected by anti-GFP antibodies in the cells expressing CCR5-CFP. The upper one is CCR5-CFP and the lower one, ∼30 kDa, is likely the CFP portion of the degraded products of CCR5-CFP, which is typical of ectopically expressed chemokine G-proteincoupled receptors (30Jiao X. Zhang N. Xu X. Oppenheim J.J. Jin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ligand of CCR5 Triggers a Ca2+ Response Mediated by CCR5-CFP—To test the functionality of the CCR5-CFP fusion protein, we examined the ligand-induced Ca2+ response in the CCR5-CFP-expressing cells (Fig. 2). We imaged a fluorescence intensity change of Fluo-4 (a fluorescent calcium indicator) trigged by MIP1α (a ligand for CCR5). Using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss 510 META), fluorescence images of Fluo-4 (Fig. 2A, green) and CCR5-CFP (red) were simultaneously recorded in a time-lapse experiment. Fluo-4 was distributed throughout the entire cytosol, and CCR5-CFP was uniformly distributed on the cell surface. Upon the addition of MIP1α to the cell chamber, the green fluorescence signal transiently increased in the cytosol, indicating that MIP1α induced changes in Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 2). The distribution of CFP signal (Fig. 2, red) was not significantly changed upon stimulation, suggesting that ligand binding immediately trigged downstream signaling events without altering the membrane distribution of CCR5. To ensure that the MIP1α-elicited Ca2+ responses were specifically mediated by the expressed CCR5-CFP, we did a control experiment with the parental HEK293 cells. No apparent increase in green fluorescence signal was observed after MIP1α stimulation (Fig. 2B). Other ligands of CCR5, such as RANTES, also triggered CCR5-CFP-mediated Ca2+ response (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the CCR5 receptor fused with CFP at its C terminus retained its functions in ligand binding and in signaling. CD4 fused with CFP or YFP at the C terminus has been previously shown to be functional in T-cell receptor signaling (34Krummel M.F. Sjaastad M.D. Wulfing C. Davis M.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 35Zal T. Zal M.A. Gascoigne N.R. Immunity. 2002; 16: 521-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells expressing CCR5-CFP and CD4-YFP provide a system for probing extracellular ligand-induced changes in the dynamic distribution of these receptors on the plasma membranes of live cells. Aggregation of CD4-YFP on Plasma Membrane Induced by gp120 and anti-CD4 Antibodies—We investigated membrane distribution of CD4-YFP in the cells stimulated with anti-CD4 antibody and two different variants of gp120. The V3-containing gp120 core of HXB2 variant binds CD4 and CXCR4 but not CCR5, and the V3-containing gp120 core of the JRFL variant binds CD4 and CCR5 but not CXCR4 (36Huang C.C. Tang M. Zhang M.Y. Majeed S. Montabana E. Stanfield R.L. Dimitrov D.S. Korber B. Sodroski J. Wilson I.A. Wyatt R. Kwong P.D. Science. 2005; 310: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). CD4-YFP was uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane before stimulation (Fig. 3B, Control). After incubation with anti-CD4 antibody (CD4-YFP, 20 nm) for 30 min, the third variable region V3-containing gp120 core of JRFP (20 nm) and the V3-containing core of HXB2 (20 nm) formed large patches on the plasma membrane, indicating CD4 binding to anti-CD4. JRFP and HXB2 also induced aggregation of CD4-YFP on the plasma membrane. We then studied whether the CCR5 receptor affects these ligand-induced CD4 aggregations. Cells expressing both CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP were used for the live cell experiment (Fig. 3, C and D). Before stimulation, both CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP were uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane. After incubation for 30 min with HXB2 and anti-CD4, both of which bind to CD4 but not to CCR5, CD4-YFP clearly aggregated on the plasma membrane, whereas CCR5-CFP remained uniformly distributed. Interestingly, incubation of JRFP, which binds both CD4 and CCR5, did not induce a clear CD4-YFP aggregation. One possible explanation for the gp120-induced aggregation is that a small amount of gp120 forms oligomers leading to CD4 aggregation. Another explanation is that gp120 binding may trigger intracellular signaling that results in the aggregation. Although we do not have a clear explanation for the phenomenon, our observations combined with previous studies (27Singer I.I. Scott S. Kawka D.W. Chin J. Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. DiSalvo J. Gould S.L. Lineberger J.E. Malkowitz L. Miller M.D. Mitnaul L. Siciliano S.J. Staruch M.J. Williams H.R. Zweerink H.J. Springer M.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3779-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Steffens C.M. Hope T.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggest that CD4 and CCR5 do not form stable heterodimers in the absence of extracellular ligands that bind both of them. Measurement of FRET between CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP—To assess interactions between CD4 and CCR5, we measured FRET between CFP and YFP in cells coexpressing CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP. We used the sensitized emission method to calculate FRET between CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP using confocal microscopy. Using a multitrack and line-scanning mode of a laser scanning confocal microscope, cells were simultaneously recorded in the CFP, YFP, and FRET detection channels. Fluorescence was simultaneously collected pixel-by-pixel from three detection channels: CFP (458 nm, CFP excitation; 475-525 nm, CFP emission); FRET (458 nm, CFP excitation; long pass filter 530 nm, YFP emission); and YFP (514 nm, YFP excitation; long pass filter 530 nm, YFP emission) (Fig. 4A). We first obtained bleed-through (cross-talk) co-efficients by analyzing images from cells expressing only CCR5-CFP or CD4-YFP, which were imaged with the identical configuration and scanning setup as the controls (Fig. 4B). We then obtained FRET efficiency and FRET images from cells expressing both CCR5-CFP and CD4-YFP. Using the FRET analysis tool, the FRET macro for the Ziess LSM 510 META microscope, the NFRET image with intensities was converted from the FRET index calculated for each pixel using the Xia method (38Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (details under “Experimental Procedures”). A major advantage of using confocal microscopy to evaluate FRET is that individual ROIs within a cell can be selectively examined for FRET efficiency. In contrast, flow cytometric or fluorometric approaches can only measure total cellular FRET, which often includes high concentrations of fluorophores in intracellular compartments. Because we were interested in CCR5 and CD4 interactions at the cell surface, only the plasma membrane region of the cell was used as the ROI. Although CCR5-CFP and CD4-YFP both localized on the cell membrane, very low FRET intensity was detected in the cells before the addition of gp120 (Fig. 4B). Strikingly, after incubation of gp120, which binds both CD4 and CCR5, a strong FRET signal was detected on the membrane of these cells. FRET efficiency is usually sensitive to the relative amounts of donors and acceptors in the selected regions. However, our method calculated a corrected FRET value by dividing the square root of the donor and acceptor concentrations pixel-by-pixel and therefore providing a reliable FRET measurement, as it depended less on the concentrations of either CFP or YFP. Fig. 4C shows the FRET value versus CFP or versus YFP intensity. The gp120 Variants That Interact with Both CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP Induced FRET Increase—Envelope gp120 glycoproteins isolated from different HIV strains all bind to CD4 but selectively bind to CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptors (36Huang C.C. Tang M. Zhang M.Y. Majeed S. Montabana E. Stanfield R.L. Dimitrov D.S. Korber B. Sodroski J. Wilson I.A. Wyatt R. Kwong P.D.

Retroviruses. 2005; 21: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To determine the relationship between gp120-induced FRET changes and specificity in interactions between gp120 and CD4 or CCR5, we measured the FRET efficiency in CD4-YFP/CCR5-CFP-expressing cells in the presence of V3-containing gp120 cores of JRFL and YU2 (variants that bind to CCR5) and the core of HXB2 (a variant binds to CXCR4) (Fig. 5). In control experiments, NFRET values in cells that were not incubated with any ligand or stimulated with SDF1α, a ligand for CXCR4, were relatively low. A small and insignificant increase in FRET was detected in cells that were incubated with HXB2. In contrast, large (∼40%) FRET increases were detected in cells that were stimulated with JRFL and YU2 (Fig. 5). Quantitative analyses of FRET efficiency indicated that there is a statistically significant increase in FRET in cells that were treated with JRFL and YU2. Our results indicated that gp120, which interacts with both CD4 and CCR5, could bring CD4 and CCR5 together on the plasma membrane of live cells. Effect of Cholesterol Depletion and Reloading on gp120-induced FRET Increase—To probe the requirements for gp120-induced interaction between CD4 and CCR5, we treated cells with MβCD to remove cholesterol from the membrane and to disrupt the function of the cholesterol-rich membrane microdomain (Fig. 6) (12Edidin M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Jacobson K. Dietrich C.

Jin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with MβCD, we detected a low level of FRET, which was similar to that in cells that were not stimulated. After MβCD treatment, JRFL and YU2 did not induce any FRET increase, although the levels of CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP and their distributions remained same. If cholesterol was added back to the chamber after the MβCD treatment, either V3-conatining cores of JRFL or YU2 could induce FRET increases in the cells, indicating that replenishing cholesterol to the plasma membrane restores the membrane requirements for gp120-induced interaction between CD4 and CCR5. Moreover, if cells were incubated with V3-containing cores of JRFL and YU2 first and then treated with MβCD to remove cholesterol from the membrane, FRET value remained low. These results suggest that gp120-induced CD4-CCR5 interaction is a dynamic process and cholesterol-rich microdomains are required for maintaining the interactions on the plasma membrane. In this study, we used a live cell system to investigate gp120-induced interaction between CD4 and CCR5, and our results have provided new insights on this issue in comparison with previous studies of this earliest step of the formation of HIV entry complex by conventional imaging and biochemical approaches. Previous studies have demonstrated that depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol inhibits HIV entry. However, the modulating effect of plasma membrane cholesterol on the HIV entry process has been controversial. In one view, the removal of cholesterol disrupts lipid rafts where HIV forms the entry complex, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (18Manes S. del Real G. Lacalle R.A. Lucas P. Gomez-Mouton C. Sanchez-Palomino S. Delgado R. Alcami J. Mira E. Martinez A.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 19Nguyen D.H. Taub D. J.

In another view, the formation of the HIV entry complex takes place outside of lipid rafts, and cholesterol modulates the HIV entry process independently of its ability to promote lipid raft formation (20Popik W. Alce T.M. Au W.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4709-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 21Percherancier Y. Lagane B. Planchenault T. Staropoli I. Altmeyer R. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Hoessli D.C. Bachelerie F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3153-3161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence arguing for the second view. CCR5 receptors are not largely present in the detergent-resistant membrane fraction, which is the biochemical definition of lipid rafts. Although CD4 receptors are enriched in detergent-resistant membrane, a mutant CD4 that does not stay in detergent-resistant membrane is still able to mediate HIV infection. It has become increasingly clear that plasma membrane contains various microenvironments. The operational definitions for lipid rafts, such as detergent insolubility to define components of rafts, cholesterol depletion to define raft functions, and immunostaining to define co-localization with rafts on the cell surface are not adequate to describe the dynamic nature and the complexity of microenvironments in native cell membrane. On the other hand, live cell FRET approaches provide a powerful tool to probe the dynamic distribution of proteins in plasma membrane. Our current results indicate that CCR5 and CD4 localize in different and small microenvironments, although both of them are uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane. We found that anti-CD4 antibody or gp120 that binds to CD4 (but not to CCR5) induced an aggregation of CD4 (but not of CCR5) on the plasma membrane. We also found that CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP each displayed a different lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane using FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching) analysis (data not shown). Different dynamic properties suggested that these two receptors are spatially separated in the resting state, which is consistent with previous studies by FRAP, immunoelectron miscroscopy, and biochemical approaches (27Singer I.I. Scott S. Kawka D.W. Chin J. Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. DiSalvo J. Gould S.L. Lineberger J.E. Malkowitz L. Miller M.D. Mitnaul L. Siciliano S.J. Staruch M.J. Williams H.R. Zweerink H.J.

Although some studies suggest that both CD4 and CCR5 are localized within raft regions and a stable association exists between CD4 and CCR5 in the plasma membrane (40Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lineberger J.E. Malkowitz L. Miller M.D. Mitnaul L. Siciliano S.J. Staruch M.J. Williams H.R. Zweerink H.J. Springer M.S. J.

Virol. 2004; 78: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) indicate that CD4 and CCR5 move independently with one another in the membrane before they encounter extracellular ligands. The gp120 variants JRFL and YU2 that bind extracellular domains of both CD4 and CCR5 induced a clear FRET increase between CCR5-CFP and CD4-YFP, suggesting that our FRET measurement was sensitive enough to monitor the formation of the protein complex of gp120, CD4, and CCR5 on the plasma membrane of live cells. FRET can be used to calculate the distance between the donor and acceptor and thereby infers the distance between the molecules to which they are linked. At this stage, it is difficult to calculate the precise distance between CD4 and CCR5, because the relative orientations of CFP and YFP are unknown in CD4-YFP and CCR5-CFP. Future structural studies may provide information of their orientations in these tagged receptors, which will allow us to calculate the distance without assuming a free rotation of CFP and YFP, although it is unlikely to be the case when they are tethered to CD4 and CCR5. However, FRET between CFP and YFP is detectable only within the distance of 10 nm, and FRET efficiency increases exponentially as the distance between fluorophores decreases. Thus, our data indicate that CFP and YFP are held in extremely close proximity upon gp120 binding to CD4 and CCR5. The FRET increase induced by gp120 requires cholesterol in the plasma membrane, suggesting that the protein complex of gp120, CD4, and CCR5 forms in a cholesterol-rich microenvironment in live cells. We propose that gp120 binding to CD4 and CCR5 triggers the conformational changes that alter their affinity to different lipids in the plasma membrane, leading to a partitioning of the complex with cholesterol-rich microenvironments. This cholesterol-rich microenvironment differs from the lipid raft microdomains (where unbound CD4 localizes) and also differs from non-lipid raft microdomains (where unbound CCR5 resides). The idea that unbound CD4 and CCR5 and gp120-bound CD4 and CCR5 change their microenvironments is consistent with previous studies by biochemical approaches and also reflects the dynamic and complicated nature of the plasma membrane. The live cell system with FRET imaging analysis developed in the present study allows direct monitoring of the formation of gp120, CD4, and CCR5, the first step of the HIV entry process. Many questions regarding the development of safe and effective inhibitors targeting this step of HIV infection can now be addressed directly. Future studies on developing and applying this new technology to the study of HIV opens the possibility of the elucidation of the molecular details of the HIV entry mechanisms. Such knowledge could lead to new strategies for designing and screening drugs against HIV infection.

Multifunctional roles have been described recently for many proteins, and glycolytic enzymes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and enolase exhibit other functions in addition to their catalytic role in glycolysis, both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Kim J.W.

The overall architecture of this enzyme is well known; four identical subunits (O, P, Q, and R) are arranged with a molecular 222 symmetry, the 2-fold axes being labeled P, Q, and R (Fig. 1). Each ∼330-amino acid subunit is composed of two domains, as shown on Fig. 2. The NAD+-binding domain, comprising amino acids 1-148, displays the characteristic Rossmann fold, with a central parallel β-sheet covered on both sides by α-helices. The catalytic domain (residues 149-329) folds into an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and four α-helices.FIGURE 2A, kmGAPDH1p monomer. β-Strands A-F and α-helices A-D are part of the NAD-binding domain. The catalytic domain is composed of β-strands 1-8 and α-helices 1-3. The S-loop (orange) and the NAD+ molecule represented are from the superposed monomer of ecGAPDH and are absent from the kmGAPDH1p model. B, the kmGAPDH1p sequence is shown aligned against the sequences of GAPDH from different organisms (shown are common name and Protein Data Bank code): Escherichia coli (1GAD); Palinurus versicolor (lobster, 1CRW); Homo sapiens (human, 3GPD); Bacillus stearothermophilus (1NQO), and Oryctolagus cuniculus (rabbit, 1J0X). The secondary structural elements of kmGAPDH1p are illustrated. The positions with residues involved in hydrogen bonds across the R interface of the GAPDH from E. coli are indicated by black triangles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Over the past 10 years mounting evidence has revealed that this protein also has non-glycolytic functions (1Kim J.W.

Cell. 2003; 114: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These additional functions of GAPDH are often attributed to its tetrameric form. Nevertheless, there are reports that indicate that monomers and dimers are the forms involved in DNA (25Meyer-Siegler K. Mauro D.J. Seal G. Wurzer J. deRiel J.K. Sirover M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and RNA interaction (26Arutyunova E.I. Danshina P.V. Domnina L.V. Pleten A.P. Muronetz V.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Given its multiple subcellular localizations (e.g. cell wall) the protein must exist, at least transiently, in nontetrameric forms in order to be translocated across specific membranes (e.g. the ER membrane) (27Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The presence of glycolytic enzymes on the cell surface of microorganisms has been previously reported. Indeed, enolase was found to be associated to glucan in the inner layers of the cell wall in Candida albicans (28Angiolella L. Facchin M. Stringaro A. Maras B. Simonetti N. Cassone A. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and to be secreted together with GAPDH when the S. cerevisiae cell walls are regenerating (29Pardo M. Monteoliva L. Pla J. Sanchez M. Gil C. Nombela C. Yeast. 1999; 15: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In C. albicans, phosphoglycerate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and GAPDH have also been found associated to the cell wall, and glycolytic enzymes appear to be important during its pathogenesis, because they act as major inducers of host immune responses (30Chaffin W.L. Lopez-Ribot J.L. Casanova M. Gozalbo D. Martinez J.P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 130-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During Streptococcus pyogenes infection GAPDH acts as an adhesion molecule and helps escape detection by neutrophils (31Terao Y. Yamaguchi M. Hamada S. Kawabata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Alcohol dehydrogenase was also detected on the surface of Entamoeba histolytica (32Yang W. Li E. Kairong T. Stanley Jr., S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and phosphoglycerate kinase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and GAPDH have been found on the surface of Schistosoma mansoni (33Goudot-Crozel V.

Of the three genes coding for GAPDH-like polypeptides, only GAP1 and GAP2 are transcribed (36Fernandes P.A. Sena-Esteves M. Moradas-Ferreira P. Yeast. 1995; 11: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GAPDH isoform 1 from K. marxianus (kmGAPDH1p), formerly referred to as p37 (37Fernandes P.A. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Moradas-Ferreira P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was first identified at the cell surface of flocculent K. marxianus cells, which was the first report of a non-cytosolic localization of a glycolytic enzyme. Subsequently the same observation was described for S. cerevisiae (38Delgado M.L. O'Connor J.E. Azorin I. Renau-Piqueras J. Gil M.L. Gozalbo D. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although kmGAPDH1p is detected at the cell surface and is N-glycosylated (37Fernandes P.A. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B.C. Moradas-Ferreira P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Fernandes P.A. Sousa M. Moradas-Ferreira P. Yeast. 1993; 9: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it does not contain the N-terminal signal peptide (36Fernandes P.A. Sena-Esteves M. Moradas-Ferreira P. Yeast. 1995; 11: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison shows that this protein is 81.6% identical to GAPDH isoform 1 from S. cerevisiae. Although all these GAPDH isoforms are secreted, it has not been possible to identify a classic ER targeting sequence in any of them. It was reported that the GAPDH isoform 3 from C. albicans is able to direct incorporation of polypeptides into the S. cerevisiae cell wall and that any motifs responsible for this targeting should be within the N-terminal half of the GAPDH amino acid sequence (40Delgado M.L. Gil M.L. Gozalbo D. Yeast. 2003; 20: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying the multifunctionality of GAPDH, the regulation of its intracellular localization, and its oligomeric structure remain to be disclosed. Aiming at finding molecular features that could account for the multilocalization of the GAPDH isoform 1 from K. marxianus, we determined its three-dimensional structure. This is the first description of the three-dimensional structure of a GAPDH protein from a yeast species (kmGAPDH1p) obtained by both x-ray crystallography and small angle scattering experiments. Protein Expression and Purification—kmGAPDH1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR and cloned into pQE32 (Qiagen). Recombinant kmGAPDH1p was overexpressed in E. coli M15 and purified as follows. Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 nm = 0.6 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 10 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 11,000 × g) and the pellet stored at -70 °C. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C, and all buffers were supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (MiniComplete®, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After thawing, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). After 30 min the suspension was sonicated and incubated with 10 μg/ml RNase A and 5 μg/ml DNase I for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 82,500 × g), and the supernatant was loaded onto a 10 × 75-mm nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column. A washing step was carried out with buffer B (1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) until the A280 nm value remained invariant (10 column volumes). Protein was eluted with buffer B + 250 mm imidazole. kmGAPDH1p-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), concentrated to 13 mg/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. The purity of the sample was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot followed by immunodetection with anti-His tag and anti-kmGAPDH1p sera (2Falcão Moreira R. Ferreira-Da-Silva F. Fernandes P.A. Moradas-Ferreira P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals of apo-kmGAPDH1p were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method from 7% polyethylene glycol 6000, 4% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, at 14 °C using 4 μl of drops containing an equal volume of the protein (13 mg/ml) and reservoir solutions. Crystals reached maximum size after 1 week and were then transferred to a solution containing the reservoir solution supplemented with 30% glucose and cryocooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Data Reduction—X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K from a single crystal on an ADSC Q4R CCD detector using synchrotron radiation at the ID14-EH1 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble. Data were evaluated and processed with MOSFLM (41Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierri J.C. Crystallographic Computing 5: From Chemistry to Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 50-61Google Scholar), and reduced with SCALA and TRUNCATE (42Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19730) Google Scholar). The kmGAPDH1p crystal used in the experiments diffracted to a maximum resolution of 2.3 Å and belonged to space group P41212. The unit-cell parameters were a = b = 70.9 Å and c = 358.4 Å. Assuming a molecular mass of 36.8 kDa and two monomers per asymmetric unit a Matthews coefficient of 3.06 Å3 Da-1 is obtained. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (43Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) and the coordinates of E. coli GAPDH (Protein Data Bank code 1GAD (1Kim J.W. Dang C.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 142-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar)) as search model. Calculations were performed for data in the 15-3.5 Å resolution range, and the rotation and translation searches provided the correct solution, which was further improved with a final rigid body refinement, yielding an R-factor of 0.45 and a correlation coefficient of 46.5 for the best solution (R-factor of 0.52 and correlation coefficient of 26.3 for the second best solution). Positional and individual temperature factor refinement was carried out using the program CNS (44Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Automated refinement was alternated with manual fitting of the model to the electron density on a SGI Graphic Work station using the program Turbo-FRODO (45Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO: Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar). Water molecules were added manually at the positions of positive peaks (>3σ) on the difference Fourier maps, when good hydrogen bond geometry was possible. Structure validation was performed with the programs PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), WHAT_ CHECK (47Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C.

The column was equilibrated with buffer C, and a 0.5 ml/min flow rate was used throughout the experiments. Calibration was done with protein standards (molecular mass, Stokes radius (Rs)): blue dextran 2000 (2 MDa), catalase (232 kDa, 5.22 nm), aldolase (158 kDa, 4.81 nm), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 3.55 nm), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 3.05 nm), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa, 2.09 nm). Two hundred μl of purified protein (13 mg/ml) was used in each run. Protein elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The Kav parameter was determined according to the equation Kav = (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0), where Ve represents the elution volume, V0 the void volume of the column, and Vt the total bed volume. The Stokes radii (Rs) for the experimental data were calculated using (-logKav)1/2 = f(Rs) (52Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) Experiments and Data Analysis—The synchrotron radiation small angle x-ray scattering data were collected on beamline X33 (53Boulin C. Kempf R. Koch M.H.J.

A. 1988; 269: 312-320Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) at EMBL-Hamburg on storage ring DORIS III of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) using a MAR 345 image plate detector. The scattering patterns from solutions of kmGAPDH1p at protein concentrations of 2.1, 4.2, 6.3, and 13 mg/ml were measured in buffer C with and without a preincubation with 1 mm NAD+. At a sample detector distance = 2.7 m and wavelength λ = 1.5 Å, the momentum transfer range 0.015 < s < 0.45 Å-1 was covered (s = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). To monitor radiation damage, two successive 2-min exposures were compared, and no significant change was observed. The data were normalized to the intensity of the transmitted beam and averaged radially, and the scattering of the buffer was subtracted. The difference curves were scaled for protein concentration and extrapolated to yield the final composite scattering curves. The data processing steps were performed using the program package PRIMUS (55Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I(0), radius of gyration Rg, and maximum particle dimension Dmax were evaluated using the program GNOM (56Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the solutes were evaluated by comparison of the I(0) values with that from a reference solution of bovine serum albumin. Rigid body modeling of the quaternary structure of kmGAPDH1p in solution was performed using the crystallographic coordinates of dimeric kmGAPDH1p. The missing loop (amino acids 180-199) was added as in the model of ecGAPDH (Protein Data Bank code 1GAD). The scattering from the tentative tetrameric assembly of kmGAPDH1p as observed in the crystals of ecGAPDH was calculated using the program CRYSOL (57Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl.

This program evaluates the scattering from the protein in solution by computing the scattering from the atomic structure in vacuum, from the excluded volume and from the solvation shell. The values of the excluded volume and of the shell contrast are adjusted to fit the experimental data Iexp(s) by minimizing the discrepancy, χ2=1N−1Σj[Iexp(sj)−clcalc(sj)σ(sj)]2(Eq. 1) where N is the number of experimental points, c is a scaling factor, and Icalc(sj) and σ(sj) are the calculated intensity and the experimental error at the momentum transfer sj, respectively. The quaternary structure was further modeled by the exhaustive search program GLOBSYMM (58Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1237-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) in terms of two kmGAPDH1p dimers. The program screened the tetramers produced by rigid body movements and rotations of the crystallographic kmGAPDH1p dimer, whereas the second dimer was generated using a 2-fold symmetry axis (z). The first dimer was oriented to have a 2-fold symmetry along the x axis, and only movements along x and rotations around x were allowed, such that the resulting tetramer kept the 222 symmetry. GLOBSYMM performed an exhaustive search of interconnected tetramers without steric clashes with a 2° angular step and 0.5 Å spatial increments. For each model, the discrepancy (1Kim J.W. Dang C.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 142-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) between the experimental scattering data and the curve calculated from the entire tetramer was calculated, and the best-fit solution was selected. The experimental scattering curves recorded in the absence and presence of NAD+ were fitted independently to yield the rigid body models for the two cases. Structure Determination by X-ray Crystallography—Crystals of kmGAPDH1p belong to the tetragonal space group P41212, with cell dimensions a = b = 70.9 Å and c = 358.4 Å, two monomers per asymmetric unit, and a solvent content of 59.8%. Diffraction data to 2.3 Å resolution were collected using synchrotron radiation. Data processing and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The final model has a crystallographic R-value of 21.6% and consists of a dimer with 4662 protein atoms, 230 water molecules, two β-mercaptoethanol molecules, and two α-d-glucose molecules. All protein residues lie in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Of the 329 amino acids that compose each kmGAPDH1p monomer, residues 180-199 are not well d"

To identify amino acid residues responsible for the tRNA recognition, we have carried out the alanine substitution mutagenesis of the basic amino acid residues that are conserved only in TrmH enzymes and not in the other SpoU proteins. We analyzed the mutant proteins by S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine affinity column chromatography, gel mobility shift assay, and kinetic assay of the methyl transfer reaction. Based on these biochemical studies and the crystal structure of TrmH, we found that the conserved residues can be categorized according to their role (i) in the catalytic center (Arg-41), (ii) in the initial site of tRNA binding (Lys-90, Arg-166, Arg-168, and Arg-176), (iii) in the tRNA binding site required for continuation the catalytic cycle (Arg-8, Arg-19, and Lys-32), (iv) in the structural element involved in release of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (Arg-11—His-71—Met-147 interaction), (v) in the assisted phosphate binding site (His-34), or (vi) in an unknown function (Arg-109). Furthermore, the difference between the Kd and Km values for tRNA suggests that the affinity for tRNA is enhanced in the presence of AdoMet. To confirm this idea, we carried out the kinetic studies, a gel mobility shift assay with a mutant protein disrupted in the catalytic center, and the analytical gel-filtration chromatography. Our experimental results clearly show that the enzyme has a semi-ordered sequential mechanism in which AdoMet both enhances the affinity for tRNA and induces formation of the tetramer structure.

In the reaction, AdoMet is converted to S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy). G18 is a highly conserved residue in the D-loop of tRNA (12McCloskey J.A. Crain P.F.

Because the 2′-O-methylation of ribose at position 34 stabilizes the C3′-endo form (16Kawai G. Yamamoto Y. Kamimura T. Masegi T. Sekine M. Hata T. Iimori T. Watanabe T. Miyazawa T. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the 2′-O-methyl-G18 (Gm18) modification probably imposes conformational rigidity on the local structure of tRNA. Although the absence of the Gm18 modification in Escherichia coli tRNA has been shown to have no effect on either the activity of the supF amber suppressor tRNA or on the growth rate of cells (9Persson B.C. Jager G. Gustafsson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3969-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it has been reported that the growth rate is decreased and that the frequency of the frameshift errors is increased in an E. coli mutant lacking both Gm18 and Ψ55 (17Urbonavicius J. Durand J.M. Björk G.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5348-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the Gm18 modification probably works in conjunction with the other modified nucleosides in the three-dimensional core such as Ψ55. The genes responsible for the Gm18 modification have been experimentally identified as trmH (spoU)in E. coli (9Persson B.C. Jager G. Gustafsson C.

Furthermore, it has been recently proposed that Sulfolobus solfataricus tRNAGln undergoes Gm18 modification by the C/D box small RNA (sRNA) guide methylation system (18Ziesche S.M. Omer A.D. Dennis P.P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 980-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Analyses based on the amino acid sequence alignments have shown that several RNA ribose 2′-O-methyltransferases share the common sequence motifs (termed motifs 1, 2, and 3) and, thus, have been classified as SpoU family methyltransferases (10Gustafsson C. Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

Recently, an archaeal SpoU family enzyme, tRNA (Cm56) methyltransferase (aTrm56), has been identified (24Renalier M.H. Joseph N. Gaspin C. Thebault P. Mougin A.

Thus, SpoU family members are distributed among three domains of life. One of the prominent characters of the SpoU family proteins is the protein fold, which encompasses a deep trefoil knot structure, which is produced by threading the polypeptide chain through an untwisted loop (7Nureki O.

Therefore, the SpoU and TrmD family proteins constitute the SpoU-TrmD (termed SPOUT) superfamily (35Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein fold is classified as the class IV fold of the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (36Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X.

However, a very important question remains outstanding. The amino acid residues responsible for the contact with the substrate tRNA have not been identified. In the current study, therefore, we have focused on the basic amino acid residues that are conserved only in the TrmH enzymes and not in the other SpoU family proteins to clarify the tRNA binding site. Beyond our expectations, the initial site of tRNA recognition and the subsequent tRNA binding site required for the catalytic cycle to proceed could be distinguished by biochemical experiments. Furthermore, the basic amino acid residues that are involved not only in tRNA binding but also in AdoMet binding (AdoHcy releasing) have been identified. Together with the information from the crystal structures of the TrmH alone and the TrmH-AdoMet complex, the recognition sites of tRNA in TrmH are discussed in comparison to other SpoU family members.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[Methyl-14C]AdoMet (1.95 GBq/mmol) and [methyl-3H]AdoMet (2.47 TBq/mmol) were purchased from ICN, cold AdoMet, and AdoHcy from Sigma, and DE52 was from Whatman. The AdoHcy affinity column was synthesized from a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's manual. CM-Toyopearl 650M was from Tosoh. DNA oligomers were bought from Invitrogen, and T7 RNA polymerase was from Toyobo. All other chemical reagents were of analytical grade.Site-directed Mutagenesis and Purification of the Proteins— The tRNA (Gm18) methyltransferase expression vector (pET30aGm) has been previously reported (5Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We carried out the site-directed mutagenesis by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The DNA sequences were analyzed with ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencers.The wild-type enzyme was expressed in E. coli and purified as reported previously (5Hori H. Suzuki T. Sugawara K. Inoue Y. Shibata T. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Oshima T. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ten mutant proteins (R8A, R19A, K32A, H34A, H71A, K90A, R109A, R168A, R176A, and L179Stop) were purified by the same method. Two mutant proteins (R11A and R166A) were purified by repeated ion-exchange chromatography, because AdoHcy affinity column chromatography did not work efficiently on the purification of them. In brief, fractions collected from the DE52 column chromatography step in the standard purification procedure were combined, dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 6.8), 5 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and separated by CM-Toyopearl 650M column chromatography (liner gradient; 0-250 mm KCl in the buffer A). The mutant protein fractions were assessed by 15% SDS-PAGE. If the purity of the protein was not satisfactory, we repeated the CM-Toyopearl 650M column chromatography after dialysis against the buffer A. The fractions were combined, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl), and concentrated with Centriprep YM-10 centrifugal filters (Millipore). The quantity of protein was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The purified proteins were mixed with glycerol (final concentration 50%) and stored at -30 °C.Measurements of the Enzymatic Activity—A standard assay for enzyme purification was performed according to a previously reported method (4Hori H. Yamazaki N. Matsumoto T. Watanabe Y. Ueda T. Nishikawa K. Kumagai I. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25721-25727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Hori H.

To determine the kinetic parameters for AdoMet, the concentrations of each mutant protein and the yeast tRNAPhe transcript were fixed at 0.1 and 8.5 μm, respectively. However, the range of the incubation time was varied (2-30 min) according to the methyl transfer activity of the protein. In a typical assay, [methyl-3H]AdoMet concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, and 80 μm were used. The kinetic parameters for tRNA were determined as previously reported (4Hori H.

In experiments to assess the enzyme mechanism (see Fig. 4), the tRNA and AdoMet concentrations were varied as follows: tRNA (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 400, 600 nm) and [methyl-3H]AdoMet (0.5, 1.0, 5.0 μm) (see Fig. 4A) or tRNA (25, 50, and 100 nm) and [methyl-3H]-AdoMet (0, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, 40, 60 μm) (see Fig. 4B). In each reaction 2.3 nm enzyme, [methyl-3H]-AdoMet, and tRNA were incubated for 2 min at 50 °C in the buffer B.FIGURE 4Kinetic assay for enzyme mechanism. To clarify the enzyme mechanism, concentrations of both AdoMet and tRNA were varied around the Km values of the wild-type enzyme for AdoMet and tRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, at three different concentrations of AdoMet (0.5 μm (open circles), 1.0 μm (filled circles), and 5.0 μm (open squares)), the kinetic parameters for tRNA were measured. B, at three different concentrations of tRNA (25 nm (filled squares), 50 nm (open triangles), and 100 nm (filled triangles)), the kinetic parameters for AdoMet were measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analytical Ado-Hcy Affinity Column Chromatography—The affinity of the purified proteins for AdoHcy was qualitatively analyzed by the Ado-Hcy column chromatography as described in our previous report (7Nureki O.

In brief, the purified protein and 0.05 A260 unit of yeast tRNAPhe transcript were incubated in 20 μl of buffer B at 37 °C for 20 min. 6% polyacrylamide gel (width, 90 mm; length, 90 mm; thickness, 1 mm) was prepared with buffer C (50 mm Tris base, 50 mm acetic acid, and 5 mm magnesium acetate). 4 μl of loading solution (0.25% bromphenol blue and 30% glycerol) was added to each sample and loaded onto the gel immediately. The electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature by constant voltage (100 V) for 1 h. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue for detection of protein and then with methylene blue for detection of RNA. The quantities of RNA and protein were measured with a Fuji Photo Film BAS2000 imaging analyzer.To analyze the effect of AdoMet (see Fig. 5, B and C), the experimental procedure was changed as follows. In the assay shown in Fig. 5B, the R41M protein (0-11 μm) and tRNA (5 μm) were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the buffer B, AdoMet was then added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. In the assay shown in Fig. 5C, the R41M protein (0-11 μm) and AdoMet (50 μm) were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the buffer B, tRNA was then added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Loading solution (0.25% bromphenol blue and 30% glycerol) was added to each sample, which was then loaded onto the gel immediately.FIGURE 5Gel mobility shift assay using the R41M mutant protein. To investigate the effect of AdoMet on the subunit structure of TrmH, the gel mobility shift assays were carried out using the R41M mutant protein. The gel was doubly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for protein detection and methylene blue for RNA detection. A, the gel mobility shift assay was carried out in the absence of AdoMet. B, the gel mobility shift assay was carried out after preincubation of the R41M protein with tRNA followed by addition of AdoMet as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, the gel mobility shift assay was carried out after preincubation of the R41M protein with AdoMet followed by the addition of tRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analytical Gel Filtration—Analytical gel filtration was performed with an ÁKTAprime chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a Superdex 75 column (10/30; column volume, 23.6 ml) at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2147939322,"Abstract We found that engagement of β2 integrins on human neutrophils increased the levels of GTP-bound Rap1 and Rap2. Also, the activation of Rap1 was blocked by PP1, SU6656, LY294002, GF109203X, or BAPTA-AM, which indicates that the downstream signaling events in Rap1 activation involve Src tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and release of calcium. Surprisingly, the β2 integrin-induced activation of Rap2 was not regulated by any of the signaling pathways mentioned above. However, we identified nitric oxide as the signaling molecule involved in β2 integrin-induced activation of Rap1 and Rap2. This was illustrated by the fact that engagement of β2 integrins increased the production of nitrite, a stable end-product of nitric oxide. Furthermore, pretreatment of neutrophils with Nω-monomethyl-l-arginine, or 1400W, which are inhibitors of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, blocked β2 integrin-induced activation of Rap1 and Rap2. Similarly, Rp-8pCPT-cGMPS, an inhibitor of cGMP-dependent serine/threonine kinases, also blunted the β2 integrin-induced activation of Rap GTPases. Also nitric oxide production and its downstream activation of cGMP-dependent serine/threonine kinases were essential for proper neutrophil adhesion by β2 integrins. Thus, we made the novel findings that β2 integrin engagement on human neutrophils triggers production of nitric oxide and its downstream signaling is essential for activation of Rap GTPases and neutrophil adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2036556476,"Human pancreatitis-associated protein was identified in pathognomonic lesions of Alzheimer disease, a disease characterized by the presence of filamentous protein aggregates. Here, we showed that at physiological pH, human pancreatitis-associated protein forms non-Congo Red-binding, proteinase K-resistant fibrillar aggregates with diameters from 6 up to as large as 68 nm. Interestingly, circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectra showed that, unlike typical amyloid fibrils, which have a cross-β-sheet structure, these aggregates have a very similar secondary structure to that of the native protein, which is composed of two α-helices and eight β-strands, as determined by NMR techniques. Surface structure analysis showed that the positively charged and negatively charged residues were clustered on opposite sides, and strong electrostatic interactions between molecules were therefore very likely, which was confirmed by cross-linking experiments. In addition, several hydrophobic residues were found to constitute a continuous hydrophobic surface. These results and protein aggregation prediction using the TANGO algorithm led us to synthesize peptide Thr84 to Ser116, which, very interestingly, was found to form amyloid-like fibrils with a cross-β structure. Thus, our data suggested that human pancreatitis-associated protein fibrillization is initiated by protein aggregation primarily because of electrostatic interactions, and the loop from residues 84 to 116 may play an important role in the formation of fibrillar aggregates with a native-like conformation.

Many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; PAP, pancreatitis-associated protein; hPAP, human PAP; CR, Congo Red; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; LIT, lithostathine; hLIT, human LIT; EM, electron microscopy; AFM, atomic force microscopy; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. Huntington's disease, and the transmissible prion diseases, are characterized by fibrillar deposits of proteins or peptides in the brain (1Dobson C.M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). Although these amyloidogenic precursor proteins have different amino acid sequences and native folds, the resulting amyloid fibrils are similar in several aspects. They have histochemical staining properties similar to those of starch (e.g. apple-green birefringence of Congo Red (CR)) and are therefore called amyloid fibrils (2DeLellis R.A. Glenner G.G. Ram J.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1968; 16: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and are protease-resistant, thermally stable, typically rigid, straight, unbranched, and 5-13 nm in diameter (3Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, the x-ray diffraction pattern suggests that amyloid fibrils are composed of a cross-β structure (4Sunde M. Blake C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 123-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this is supported by CD and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (5Dos Reis S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Lascu I. Begueret J. Saupe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5703-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the ability to form amyloid fibrils is not restricted to amyloidogenic precursor proteins. Many other proteins not associated with known diseases also form fibrils with the cross β-patterns characteristic of amyloid fibrils (6Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M.

In addition, many short peptides from proteins, either alone or when bound to globular proteins, form amyloid-like fibrils (8Azriel R. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34156-34161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 9Baxa U. Taylor K.L. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Cheng N. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Biol.

Lacroix E. Dobson C.M. Hoenger A. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16052-16057Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Mutational studies have revealed a simple correlation between aggregation and physicochemical properties, such as β-sheet propensity, hydrophobicity, and charge (12Chiti F. Stefani M. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 424: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 13Lopez de La Paz M. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2005; 102: 10105-10110Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is therefore believed that there are certain sequence motifs that are more prone to fibrillize when they are cleaved from the whole protein or once they move from a buried position in the native protein to an exposed position. Several computer algorithms, e.g. the TANGO algorithm of Serrano and co-workers (15Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) and the Zyggregator algorithm of Dobson and co-workers (16Pawar A.P. Dubay K.F. Zurdo J. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), were therefore developed to identify aggregation-prone regions in the amino acid sequence of a protein. The three-dimensional profile method recently developed by Eisenberg and co-workers (17Thompson M.J. Sievers S.A. Karanicolas J. Ivanova M.I. Baker D. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4074-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) can be further used to identify sequences that form amyloid-like fibrils. The establishment of rules that link sequence and amyloid features is critical for the understanding of amyloid diseases and therefore has significant applications. Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP), also known as p23, hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas protein, or Reg3-encoded protein (the third member of the Reg family) (18Tachibana K. Marquardt H.

Several biological functions of PAP have been proposed, including induction of bacterial aggregation (21Iovanna J. Orelle B. Keim V. Dagorn J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24664-24669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation of cell proliferation (20Livesey F.J. O'Brien J.A. Li M. Smith A.G. Murphy L.J. Hunt S.P.

Closa D. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7199-7207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); however, its actual function is not known. PAP shows high sequence homology with lithostathine (LIT, also known as pancreatic stone protein or Reg1-encoded protein), another stress protein found in pancreatic juice (27Bernard J.P. Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both PAP and LIT contain a carbohydrate recognition domain linked to a signal peptide and belong to group VII of the C-type lectin family (28Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Rat PAP I and III (an isoform of rat PAP) and LIT can form highly organized fibrillar structures following trypsin cleavage, which removes the N-terminal propeptide and converts the 16-kDa proteins into the 14-kDa mature isoforms (29Graf R. Schiesser M. Scheele G.A. Marquardt K. Frick T.W. Ammann R.W. Bimmler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21028-21038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to understand how precipitation properties could serve a useful function in pancreatic physiology. Furthermore, human LIT (hLIT) and hPAP have been identified in the pathognomonic lesions of AD (the extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles) and are highly expressed even during the very early stages of AD before clinical signs appear, showing that they may be involved in AD (30Duplan L. Michel B. Boucraut J. Barthellemy S. Desplat-Jego S. Marin V. Gambarelli D. Bernard D. Berthezene P. Alescio-Lautier B. Verdier J.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, hPAP is an important protein for exploring the relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and protein deposition. Here, we used electron microscopy (EM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), glutaraldehyde cross-linking, optical absorbance, CD, fluorescence, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structural properties of recombinant hPAP lacking the N-terminal propeptide, both in the soluble form and as fibrillar aggregates. Based on the solution structure analysis and the TANGO prediction, peptide hPAP84-116 was synthesized and found to form fibrils. The mechanism of fibril formation by hPAP is proposed and compared with that of hLIT. Expression and Purification of Recombinant hPAP—Recombinant hPAP was prepared as described previously (31Ho M.R. Lou Y.C. Lin W.C. Lyu P.C. Chen C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA sequence encoding hPAP in which the N-terminal 12 residues are replaced by the sequence MKHHHHHHQ was cloned into the pQE1 vector (Qiagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli M15. For unlabeled or uniformly 15N/13C-labeled hPAP, the cells were overexpressed, respectively, in LB broth or in M9 minimum medium containing 15N-NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and 13C-glucose (4 g/liter) at 37 °C. hPAPs 15N-labeled with specific amino acids were produced by overexpressing the cells in M9 minimum medium containing the desired 15N-labeled amino acid (0.1 g/liter), and deuterated hPAP were obtained by growing the cells in M9 minimum medium dissolving in 99% D2O. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced using 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. The inclusion bodies were collected after the cells were lysed using an M-110S microfluidizer (Microfluidics) and dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl. The denatured hPAP proteins were diluted to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml in refolding buffer (100 mm Tris acetate, 0.5 m l-arginine, 3 mm reduced glutathione, 0.6 mm oxidized glutathione, and 2 m urea, pH 8.5) and incubated at room temperature for 2 days. The refolded hPAP protein was then purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and dialyzed against 20 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, pH 4.0. The authenticity of hPAP was verified by SDS electrophoresis and electron spray/mass spectrometry. Preparation of Peptide hPAP84-116—Peptide hPAP84-116 was synthesized in automated mode on a solid phase synthesizer (model 431 A; Applied Biosystems), cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid, and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The authenticity of the peptide was determined by electron spray/mass spectrometry. Preparation of Fibrils— hPAP fibrillar aggregates were prepared by incubating hPAP (10 μm) in 20 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, for 1 month. To check the proteinase K resistance, hPAP fibrils were mixed with proteinase K (2.5 ng/ml) for 6 h at room temperature. hPAP84-116 fibrils were prepared by incubating the peptide (10 μm) in 20 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, for 2 weeks. All of the fibrillar aggregates were collected by centrifugation for 60 min at 13,000 × g and resuspended in double distilled H2O. This procedure was repeated three times, and the collected aggregates were stored at -20 °C until needed. Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy—Samples of hPAP (10 μm) in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl at different pH values (pH 4-7) were incubated for 1 month with gentle shaking, and the aggregates were collected as described above. For EM, the samples were applied to Formvar-coated copper grids (200 and 400 mesh) for 5 min, negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (w/v) for 3 min, and the images were viewed in a JEOL JEM 1200EX transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. For AFM, the samples were applied onto a freshly cleaved mica surface for 10 min, washed three times with double distilled H2O, and air-dried at room temperature, and the bound material was imaged with the SPM-A-100 AFM (AngsNanoTek Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) using Tapping Mode in air. The images were collected at an optimized scan rate corresponding to 0.7-1 Hz and were flattened and presented in height mode using SPM-A-100 Imaging Process software (AngsNanoTek Co., Ltd.). Congo Red Assay—A CR stock solution was prepared at pH 7.4 as described previously (32Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). hPAP aggregates (100 μg/ml) or hPAP84-116 aggregates (100 μg/ml) were mixed for 30 min at room temperature with CR (15 μm), and then the absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature on a U-3210 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd.). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—To compare soluble and fibrillar hPAP, thin film attenuated total reflectance FTIR spectra were recorded (33Berriman J. Serpell L.C. Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9034-9038Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). 50 μl of 1 mg/ml solution of soluble hPAP freshly prepared at pH 7 and suspension of fibrillar hPAP incubated at pH 7 for 1 month were deposited on ZnSe ATR crystal plates (50 × 10 × 2 mm; Harrick, Ossining, NY) and air-dried to form a hydrated thin film. It had been shown that the formation of a hydrated thin film does not disrupt the native structure of proteins (34Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 35Safar J. Roller P.P. Ruben G.C. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Biopolymers. 1993; 33: 1461-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 470 spectrometer continuously purged with dried nitrogen. The attenuated total reflection mode was selected with a spectral resolution of 2 cm-1. Residual absorption of buffer was corrected by subtracting the spectrum for buffer. Overlapping bands in the amide I region were resolved by Fourier self-deconvolution using the software OMNIC 6.0 (Thermo Nicolet Corporation). Circular Dichroism Spectra—Soluble hPAP and hPAP84-116 were diluted to a final concentration of 20 μm in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl at the desired pH. Fibrillar hPAP and hPAP84-116 were prepared by incubating the samples at desired pH for a period that is sufficient for fibril formation and collected by centrifugation as described above. The fibrillar samples were resuspended in double-distilled H2O before acquiring the spectra. All of the CD spectra were collected on an Aviv CD 202 spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C. For far-UV CD spectra, a 1-mm-path length cuvette was used, and the spectra were recorded three times from 190 to 260 nm with a wavelength step of 0.5 nm. For near-UV experiments, a 10-mm-path length cuvette was used, and the spectra were recorded three times from 320 to 250 nm with a wavelength step of 0.5 nm. Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out by monitoring the changes in ellipticity at 220 nm from 15 to 95 °C with a 2 °C interval and 2 min for equilibrium. The curves were fitted and analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.02 (SPSS Inc.). Fluorescence Spectra— hPAP was diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl at the desired pH and mixed with 1 μm 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS). The fluorescence spectra were acquired using a 10-mm quartz cell at 25 °C on an LS55 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The excitation wavelength was 365 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 440 to 600 nm with a slit width of 5 nm. Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking Assay— hPAP was diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl at pH 4, 5, 6, or 7. Two more samples at pH 7 were prepared at higher concentrations of NaCl (150 mm and 500 mm). All of the samples were then mixed for 5 min at room temperature with 0.25% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma) and then analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. NMR Spectroscopy and Resonance Assignments—NMR experiments on 15N,13C-labeled and 2H,15N,13C-labeled hPAP in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, were carried out at 298 K on Bruker AVANCE 600 and 800 NMR spectrometers (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a triple (1H, 13C, and 15N) resonance cryoprobe including a shielded z-gradient. The NMR spectra of, and sequential assignment for, hPAP were carried out as described previously (36Lin T.H. Chen C. Huang R.F. Lee Y.L. Shaw J.F. Huang T.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 363-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, the triple-resonance experiments (HNCO, HN(CA)CO, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB) were used for backbone resonance assignment and the aliphatic 13C and 1H side chain resonances were determined from the three-dimensional C(CO)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. Aromatic resonances were assigned as described (37Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). All of the NMR spectra were processed using the NMRPipe package (38Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView 5.0 (39Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Structure Determination of hPAP—The dihedral angle information was predicted using the program TALOS (40Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonding information was obtained from D2O exchange monitored by the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The nuclear Overhauser effect restraints from the 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC and 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectra were automatically assigned by the CANDID module of CYANA (41Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) and checked manually. NMR structures were calculated from all experimental restraints by simulated annealing using the program Xplor-NIH. The final 20 structures with no distance restraint violation greater than 0.3 Å, and no dihedral angle restraint violations larger than 3° were chosen on the basis of total energy. The quality of structures was analyzed using the program PRO-CHECK-NMR (42Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Data Bank Accession Number—The chemical shifts of recombinant hPAP at pH 4.0 and 298 K have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession number BMRB-6231. The best 20 structures, together with the complete list of restraints, have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank under accession number 2GO0. hPAP Forms Non-Congo Red-binding, Proteinase K-resistant Fibrillar Aggregates at Physiological pH—Fibril formation by hPAP at different pH values was examined using EM and AFM. The hPAP samples were incubated for 1 month in buffers from pH 4.0 to 8.0. EM showed that, at pH 4.0, hPAP only formed circular aggregates (Fig. 1A), which had diameters ranging from 6 to 30 nm and were prone to clustering. At pH 5.0 (Fig. 1B), short protofibrillar aggregates were also observed, with diameters of around 6 nm, i.e. smaller than most of the circular aggregates. At pH 6.0 (Fig. 1C), abundant long, straight, unbranched protofibrils, as well as circular aggregates, were observed. At pH 7.0, these protofibrils assembled with each other to form thicker fibrils, as shown by EM (Fig. 1, D-F) and AFM (Fig. 1G). These thicker fibrils had different shapes and thicknesses; the thickest having a diameter of 68 nm (Fig. 1F), which is rare in typical amyloid fibrils. At pH 8, the EM images of fibrillar aggregates were similar with those observed at pH 6 (data not shown). We then examined whether the aggregates formed by hPAP have the characteristics of amyloid fibrils. Because amyloid fibrils deposited in tissue as a result of disease are highly protease-resistant (1Dobson C.M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), the protease resistance of the hPAP fibrillar aggregates was tested. hPAP incubated at pH 7.0 for 1 week was exposed for different periods of time to proteinase K, a broad spectrum protease that is highly active under these conditions, and the extent of digestion was monitored by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) and EM. As shown in Fig. 1H, after 6 h of digestion, protofibrillar aggregates could still be seen, whereas circular aggregates were virtually absent, demonstrating that the fibrillar aggregates of hPAP are compactly assembled and highly proteinase K-resistant, whereas the circular aggregates are accessible to proteinase K. Congo Red is widely used as a histological indicator of amyloid fibril deposition. The binding of CR to amyloid fibrils has been characterized and shown to depend on the presence of extensive arrays of β-pleated sheet (2DeLellis R.A. Glenner G.G. Ram J.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1968; 16: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For example, after CR binds to the cross-β structure of Aβ fibrils, its absorbance peak shifts from 485 nm to 512 and 541 nm (32Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, in our study, the absorbance spectrum of CR when mixed with hPAP fibrillar aggregates was similar to that of CR alone (Fig. 2A), indicating that CR does not bind to the aggregates, suggesting that they may not have a typical β-pleated sheet structure. The Secondary Structure of hPAP Fibrillar Aggregates Resembles That of the Native Protein—The structural properties of hPAP fibrillar aggregates were studied by FTIR and CD spectroscopy, both of which have been widely used in structural studies of protein aggregates, for example, to examine the structural rearrangement of prion protein HET-s from a soluble α-helical protein to β-sheet fibril aggregates (5Dos Reis S. Coulary-Salin B. Forge V. Lascu I. Begueret J. Saupe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5703-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FTIR and far-UV CD spectra give information on the average secondary structure of the peptide chain, whereas the near-UV CD spectra can monitor the environment of aromatic side chains, especially Trp. The hPAP fibrillar aggregates had almost the same FTIR spectrum as soluble hPAP at pH 7 (Fig. 2B). Deconvolution of the amide I region showed that both spectra had two major peaks at 1658 and 1639 cm-1 (Fig. 2B, inset), corresponding, respectively, to α-helix and β-sheet. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the hPAP fibrillar aggregates contained 19% α-helix and 34% β-sheet, whereas soluble hPAP contained 20% α-helix and 36% β-sheet. The far-UV CD spectra of soluble and aggregated hPAP were also basically similar (Fig. 3A), the only difference being the absorption at 230 nm, which may be associated with Trp side chains (43Vuilleumier S. Sancho J. Loewenthal R. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10303-10313Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Secondary structures were estimated using CDPro software (44Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar) and gave values of 19 ± 2% α-helix and 37 ± 5% β-sheet for hPAP aggregates and 17 ± 1% α-helix and 41 ± 5% β-sheet for soluble hPAP at pH 7. The near-UV CD spectra of fibrillar aggregates and soluble protein had similar minima at 297, 289, and 283 nm (Fig. 3B). However, the extra minimum seen at 275 nm in the aggregates indicated that the orientation of one or more Trp side chains were different. In conclusion, the FTIR and CD spectra suggest that hPAP retains a native-like secondary structure when assembled into fibrillar aggregates and that assembly perturbs the side chain orientation of one or more Trp residues. Soluble hPAP Protein Has a Similar Conformation over the pH range of 4-8—The conformational features of soluble hPAP at different pH values were studied by CD and ANS fluorescence. ANS binds to solvent-exposed hydrophobic regions of proteins and has been widely used for the characterization of partially folded intermediates. In our study, far-UV and near-UV CD spectra of soluble hPAP at different pH values (4.0-8.0) were almost identical (Fig. 3, A and B), as were the ANS fluorescence spectra (Fig. 3D). Temperature denaturation experiments followed by CD (Fig. 3C) demonstrated that hPAP showed greatest temperature stability at pH 4.0 (Tm = 68 °C) and that the Tm value was 10 °C lower at pH 7.0. These results showed that the secondary and tertiary structures of soluble hPAP were pH-independent over the range tested and that, although soluble hPAP was less stable at pH 7 than at pH 4, there is no significant change in the structure of the hydrophobic core, as shown by the ANS experiment. hPAP Forms Oligomers at Physiological pH—The oligomerization of soluble hPAP was investigated by glutaraldehyde cross-linking test. Glutaraldehyde reacts with the amino group of the Lys side chain and has been extensively used to cross-link oligomeric proteins (45Wang L. Lashuel H.A. Walz T. Colon W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15947-15952Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Soluble hPAP at different pH values was incubated for 5 min with 0.25% glutaraldehyde, and then the oligomeric state was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4, hPAP clearly formed oligomers at physiological pH. Furthermore, increasing the NaCl concentration lowered the degree of oligomerization, indicating that electrostatic interac"

YY1 contains an evolutionarily conserved, 22-amino acid segment, the PHO homology region (PHR), which is located within its central domain (spacer) and has been shown previously to participate in the recruitment of Polycomb group of proteins and in YY1-mediated transcription. In this report, we show that the PHR physically interacts with several Abd-B-type Hox proteins. Although ectopic expression of Hoxa11 enhanced target promoter activity, overexpression of YY1 repressed this effect, which was abrogated by YY1 siRNA and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. We have further demonstrated that this suppression effect was the result of YY1-dependent recruitment of HDAC2 to the Hoxa11 target promoter. Taken together, our findings show that YY1 represses Hoxa11-dependent transcription via interactions with the Hox proteins and HDAC recruitment, providing a link between an Abd-type Hox protein and a Polycomb group protein at the level of direct protein-protein interactions. These findings not only provide a novel insight into YY1 function but also identify a new regulation of homeotic protein-mediated transcriptional regulation in general.

YY1-deficient embryos die around the time of implantation, suggesting that YY1 plays an indispensable role in embryonic development (6Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Galvin K.M. Bauknecht T. See R.H. Lee J.S. Deng T. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Wang J. Seto E. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional regulators essential for the establishment and maintenance of the transcriptionally silenced state of homeotic gene expression (7Lund A.H. van Lohuizen M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that the YY1 ortholog in Drosophila, pleiohomeotic (PHO), functions as a PcG protein (5Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M.L. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This is supported by recent findings that mammalian YY1 also functions as a PcG protein (8Atchison L. Ghias A. Wilkinson F. Bonini N. Atchison M.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 9Lorente M. Perez C. Sanchez C. Donohoe M. Shi Y. Vidal M. Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). YY1 is the only known PcG protein containing a zinc finger domain that has the sequence-specific DNA binding capability that is conserved in PHO. It has been demonstrated that PHO binds a 17-base pair (bp) PRE sequence in the Drosophila engrailed gene (5Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M.L. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These early studies in Drosophila suggest an important role of YY1 in regulating homeotic gene transcription. Although YY1 is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human, the sequence homology between YY1 and PHO is limited to the DNA-binding zinc fingers and a 22-aa segment located at the central region of the protein (aa 205–226, PHO homology region (PHR)) (5Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M.L. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The spacer region (aa 205–295) that encompasses PHR has been shown to play a role in YY1-mediated transcriptional regulation (9Lorente M. Perez C. Sanchez C. Donohoe M. Shi Y. Vidal M. Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study suggests that PHR may mediate physical interactions between PHO and other PcG proteins (10Wang L. Brown J.L. Cao R. Zhang Y. Kassis J.A. Jones R.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A human YY1 with the spacer deleted has been shown to possess reduced transcriptional activity in vitro (11Austen M. Luscher B. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, removal of the spacer region in chicken DT40 cells abrogated the ability of cYY1 to support DT40 cell survival in vivo, indicating that the spacer region is required for YY1 biological functions (3Sui G. Affar el B. Shi Y. Brignone C. Wall N.R. Yin P. Donohoe M. Luke M.P. Calvo D. Grossman S.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However molecular mechanisms that underlie the spacer and PHR are incompletely understood. To address the role of the YY1 spacer region, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay using the spacer region as bait. We identified novel physical interactions between YY1 and the Abd-B-type Hox proteins and showed that the physical interactions are important for YY1 to negatively regulate Hox protein-dependent transcription in a manner that is dependent on the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Taken together, these findings suggest that YY1 not only functions as a PcG protein to directly repress Hox gene transcription but also participates in negatively regulating transcription mediated by the products of the Hox genes, i.e. via direct physical interactions of the homeodomain proteins. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The SalI-BglII cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 205–226 of human yy1 was cloned downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain into pPC98 vector and used as bait. An 8.5-day mouse embryonic cDNA library was produced using pPC86 vector (Resgen, Invitrogen). The yeast strain MaV103 (MATα, gal4, gal80, leu2, trp1, his3, SPAL10::URA3) (12Vidal M. Brachmann R.K.

Transformants were plated on synthetic complete media plates lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan in the presence of 12.5 mm 3-aminotriazole. It produced 5.8 × 106 transformation efficiency. An X-gal filter assay was performed after the yeast two-hybrid assay for confirmation. Yeast colonies from minimal plates (–Leu, –Trp, –His) were lifted onto nitrocellulose membranes, immersed in liquid nitrogen for 5 s, and then transferred onto Whatman filter papers saturated with 3 ml of Z-buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mg/ml X-gal. The color of the colonies was verified after putting the membranes at 30 °C for 1 h.

Cell Culture, Transfection, GST Pulldown, Immunoblot, and Immunoprecipitation—F9 cells and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. F9 cells were induced to differentiate by retinoic acid for 4 days. HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and immunoprecipitation was achieved as described previously (15Johnstone R.W. See R.H. Sells S.F. Wang J. Muthukkumar S. Englert C.

For GST binding assays, in vitro translated Hoxa11 and Hoxa11 lacking the homeodomain mutant products were allowed to interact with either GST or GST-YY1.

Anti-YY1 (H414), anti-HDAC1 (H-51), and anti-HDAC2 (H-54) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Probes containing Hox and non-Hox consensus binding sites were used in this study (18Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J.

The sense strands of complementary oligonucleotides for Hox binding sequences was 5′-TCGAGCCAGATCTGACAGTTTTACGACAGATCTCCC-3′ and for non-Hox binding site sequences was 5′-TCGAGCCAGATCTGACAGTTTGATGACAGATCTCCC-3′. Both were end-labeled and annealed overnight with their corresponding antisense oligonucleotides to generate double-stranded DNA probes. His-YY1 and His-YY1(ΔPHR) fusion proteins were prepared and purified as instructed by Qiagen. GST and GST/Hoxa11 proteins were purified using Glutathione-Agarose (G-4510) from Sigma.

Reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Gel electrophoresis was performed using 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Luciferase Assay—pcDNA3/FLAG-Hoxa11 (400 ng) and increasing amounts of pcDNA3/HA-YY1 (200 and 400 ng) or pcDNA3/HA-YY1(ΔPHR) (200 and 400 ng) were independently co-transfected with 0.1 μg of HBS-Luc reporter and 0.3 μg of β-gal expression plasmid into HeLa cells on the 12-well plates. Cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-gal activities were analyzed. Luciferase assay results were normalized with the corresponding β-gal activity. For histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitor analysis, 400 ng of Hoxa11 was co-transfected with 100 ng of HBS-Luc reporter in HeLa cells, treated with 100 ng of TSA in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated for 18 h. In the YY1 knockdown experiment, 400 ng Hoxa11 was transfected with 300 ng of U6 vector-YY1 siRNA and 100 ng of HBS-Luc reporter in HeLa cells. Cell lysates were analyzed 48 h after transfection. Results were all normalized by the corresponding β-gal activity. YY1 Interacts with Abd-B-type Hox Proteins—Human YY1 contains a 22-amino acid fragment (aa 205–226) in the spacer region (aa 205–295) that is >80% conserved in Drosophila PHO (5Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M.L. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To better characterize the function of the PHR in embryogenesis, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of an 8.5 day post coitum mouse embryo library. Amino acids 205–226 (PHR) of YY1 was used as bait (Fig. 1A). We selected color changes via X-gal filter assays. Three independent cDNAs were identified, and they encoded portions of the homeodomain proteins with a high degree of homology, i.e. Hoxa9, Hoxd9, and Hoxa11 (19Krumlauf R. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 20Grier D.G. Thompson A. Kwasniewska A. McGonigle G.J. Halliday H.L. Lappin T.R. J. Pathol. 2005; 205: 154-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These proteins are closely related to the products of the abdominal-B (Abd-B) HOM-C genes in Drosophila, which are situated at the 5′-end of the mammalian Hox clusters. Overlapping expression of these genes was found in developing limbs, indicating their specific regional identity (21Yokouchi Y. Sasaki H. Kuroiwa A. Nature. 1991; 353: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 22Dolle P. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Falkenstein H. Renucci A. Duboule D. Nature. 1989; 342: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). YY1 PHR Binds Hoxa11 Homeobox Domain in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the yeast two-hybrid results and to characterize the Hoxa11 interaction domain of YY1, we carried out a GST binding assay using in vitro translated products, full-length Hoxa11 and Hoxa11 homeodomain (ΔHD) deletion mutant (Fig. 1B). Comparable amounts of GST and GST-YY1 were used in the assays (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C, only full-length Hoxa11 directly interacted with YY1 (lane 3) whereas Hoxa11 ΔHD was unable to bind (lane 6), indicating that the DNA binding domain of Hoxa11 is essential for the direct interaction with YY1. In co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, FLAG-tagged Hoxa11 was co-transfected with HA-tagged YY1 protein into HeLa cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotted with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, YY1 PHR physically interacts with Hoxa11 (Fig. 1D, lane 4). This binding is specific as no interaction was found when Hoxa11, YY1 or YY1 (ΔPHR) were expressed alone (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–3). Importantly, Hoxa11 co-transfected with the mutant YY1 deleted of PHR (ΔPHR) also failed to support physical interaction, indicating that PHR is necessary for YY1 to interact with Hoxa11 (Fig. 1D, lanes 5). Similarly, a reciprocal co-IP assay was performed using an anti-HA antibody for the YY1 protein, and Western blotted with an anti-FLAG antibody for the detection of Hoxa11 protein, and essentially the same result was obtained (data not shown). The interaction between Hoxa11 and YY1 was also detected in the F9 embryonic carcinoma cell line where Hoxa11 was found to have the highest level of protein expression 4 days post retinoic acid induction (Fig. 1E). In contrast, no Hoxa11 protein was detected if F9 cells remain undifferentiated. Both differentiated and undifferentiated F9 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Hoxa11 antibody and Western blotted with an anti-YY1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1E, endogenous YY1 was pull down in F9 differentiated but not undifferentiated cells, confirming that endogenous YY1 physically interacts with Hoxa11 in vivo. YY1 Enhances Hoxa11 DNA Binding—The ability of YY1 to interact with Hoxa11 protein suggests that YY1 may influence Hox protein activity via protein-protein interactions. Because cofactors are generally required for Hox proteins to bind their downstream targeting genes (23Shen W.F. Krishnan K. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7509-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we next asked whether YY1 interaction with Hoxa11 affects Hoxa11 DNA binding activity. All Abd-like Hox proteins preferentially bind DNA sequences containing a TTAC core recognition sequence (18Shen W.F. Montgomery J.C. Rozenfeld S. Moskow J.J. Lawrence H.J. Buchberg A.M. Largman C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay based on this Hox binding sequence. As shown in Fig. 2, binding of Hoxa11 to HBS is specific as the unlabeled HBS probed specifically abrogated its binding (lanes 5 and 7). Furthermore, a supershifted band was observed with the addition of the Hoxa11 antibodies (lane 6). No binding was detected for the GST or YY1 protein (lanes 2 and 12). Interestingly, compared with Hoxa11 alone, increasing amount of YY1 strongly enhanced Hoxa11 binding to HBS, whereas the mutant YY1 (ΔPHR) only enhanced Hoxa11 binding slightly (Fig. 2, lanes 5,8,9, 10 and 11). These results suggest that YY1 enhances Hoxa11 binding to its DNA sequences via physical interactions mediated by PHR. YY1 Interacts with Hoxa11 and Represses Transcriptional Activity—YY1 is capable of activating or repressing transcription by direct association with other transcription factors without necessarily binding to DNA (24Bennett M.K. Ngo T.T. Athanikar J.N. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13025-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To understand the functional consequence of the YY1 and Hoxa11 protein interaction, we next performed reporter assays using a triple TTAC Hox binding sequence in a luciferase (Luc) reporter (14Luo L. Yang X. Takihara Y. Knoetgen H. Kessel M. Nature. 2004; 427: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, Hoxa11 activated the HBS-Luc reporter activity (3-fold); however, co-transfection with increasing amounts of YY1 suppressed promoter activities (lanes 5 and 6). Importantly, no repression was observed when mutant YY1 (ΔPHR) was used to replace wild type YY1 (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that the YY1 physical interaction with Hoxa11 is likely to be essential for regulating Hoxa11 activity. Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase Activity and Depletion of YY1 Abrogated the Repression of YY1 to Hoxa11-mediated Transcription—It has been shown that YY1 recruits histone modifiers to mediate transcriptional regulation, and numerous studies have revealed a functional significance of YY1 association with HDACs (25Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Seto E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4814-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 27Coull J.J. Romerio F. Sun J.M. Volker J.L. Galvin K.M. Davie J.R. Shi Y. Hansen U. Margolis D.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the repression effect observed above might be because of YY1 recruitment of HDACs. To investigate this hypothesis, the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA was added to HeLa cells co-transfected with Hoxa11 and the HBS-Luc reporter. Significantly, compared with the controls, Hoxa11 activated promoter activity in the presence of TSA by 10-fold (Fig. 4A, lane 5), indicating that inhibition of HDAC activities reversed the suppressive effect of the endogenous YY1. Consistent with the observation that YY1 mediated Hoxa11-dependent transcription, knockdown of YY1 by siRNA in HeLa cells also enhanced Hoxa11 reporter activity (Fig. 4A, lane 4). In contrast, control experiments using the U6 siRNA vector showed no effect on reporter activity (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Thus, these findings suggest that YY1 represses Hoxa11-mediated transcription by recruiting HDACs. YY1 Is Required for Hoxa11 to Recruit HDAC2—The TSA experiments described above suggest that HDACs might be associated physically with the YY1-Hoxa11 complex. To address this possibility, we transfected FLAG-Hoxa11 into HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated Hoxa11 by the FLAG antibodies followed by Western blotting to detect the presence of HDACs. As shown in Fig. 5, the FLAG antibodies co-immunoprecipitated HDAC2 from cells expressing FLAG-Hoxa11 but not from HeLa cells without FLAG-Hoxa11 expression (Fig. 5, compare lane 2 with lane 1). Strikingly, this interaction is dependent on YY1, as the Hoxa11-HDAC2 interaction was specifically disrupted by YY1 depletion (Fig. 5, lane 4). Unlike HDAC2, we found that Hoxa11 interacted with HDAC1 in the absence of YY1 (Fig. 5, lane 4). Taken together, these findings suggest that YY1 may serve as a bridge for the recruitment of HDAC2 for repression of Hoxa11-dependent transcription. YY1 is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation and has been shown to play an indispensable role in embryonic development (1Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene. 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3Sui G. Affar el B. Shi Y. Brignone C. Wall N.R. Yin P. Donohoe M. Luke M.P. Calvo D. Grossman S.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). YY1 is a PcG protein (8Atchison L. Ghias A. Wilkinson F. Bonini N. Atchison M.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and the PHO homology region (PHR, aa 205–226) has been shown to interact with other PcG proteins such as E(z) (10Wang L. Brown J.L. Cao R. Zhang Y. Kassis J.A. Jones R.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A main function of the PcG proteins is to mediate repression of Hox gene transcription during development (28Orlando V. Cell. 2003; 112: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 29Beuchle D. Struhl G. Muller J. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 993-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, YY1 has been shown to repress homeotic genes during development (8Atchison L. Ghias A. Wilkinson F. Bonini N. Atchison M.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 9Lorente M. Perez C. Sanchez C. Donohoe M. Shi Y. Vidal M. Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that PHR also mediates YY1 interactions with the products of the Abd-B-type Hox genes. This interaction results in the enhancement of Hoxa11 DNA binding activity and repression of Hoxa11-mediated transcription. Importantly, YY1 represses Hoxa11-mediated downstream target gene transcription in a manner that is dependent on its physical interactions with Hoxa11 and the recruitment of HDACs. Our findings suggest that YY1 as a PcG protein not only directly represses Hox gene transcription but also inhibits the transcriptional activities of the Hox gene products such as Hoxa11. This reveals a new layer of regulation that involves PcG and the homeodomain proteins. Because the physical interaction between YY1 and Hoxa11 appears to be mediated by the conserved PHR, our findings further suggest that the negative regulation conferred by YY1 through protein-protein interaction is also evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human. The role of Hox proteins as activators or repressors is context-dependent and may involve differential recruitment of co-regulators (30Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Previous published studies show that some Hox proteins mediate transcriptional repression via direct interactions with HDACs (30Saleh M. Rambaldi I. Yang X.J. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8623-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 31Chariot A. van Lint C. Chapelier M. Gielen J. Merville M.P. Bours V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47792-47802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our findings have extended these earlier studies and identified YY1 as a possible bridging protein between Hox proteins and HDACs. YY1 transcriptional repression activity has been shown to be mediated by its association with HDACs via aa residues 170–200 (GK-rich) and the C-terminal zinc finger domain (34Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. Seto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5979-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the zinc finger region-deleted mutant of YY1 was co-transfected with Hoxa11, it failed to suppress HBS-Luc reporter expression, consistent with the idea that recruitment of HDACs is important for repression (data not shown). RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of YY1 did not result in the same level of derepression of the target gene as it did in the TSA treatment. It is possible that this may be due to an incomplete knockdown of YY1 or an involvement of additional histone deacetylases such as HDAC1 in the regulation. The Abd-B-type Hox genes are situated at the 5′-end of the Hox clusters. Only one Abd-B gene is found in Drosophila, but a total of 16 Abd-B-type genes have been discovered in mammals (35Zhao Y. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36Hsieh-Li H.M. Witte D.P. Weinstein M. Branford W. Li H. Small K. Potter S.S. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1373-1385PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-end of Hox genes is generally expressed in the hind limb bud (37Nelson C.E. Morgan B.A. Burke A.C. Laufer E. DiMambro E. Murtaugh L.C. Gonzales E. Tessarollo L. Parada L.F. Tabin C. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 1449-1466PubMed Google Scholar). These genes exhibit overlapping domains of expression during limbs development, consistent with their key roles in regional identity specification (21Yokouchi Y. Sasaki H. Kuroiwa A. Nature. 1991; 353: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Hoxa11 has been shown to be expressed in the developing limbs and caudal body (13Small K.M. Potter S.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2318-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Interestingly, elevated YY1 mRNA expression has been found in the limb bud and tail tip region as well (6Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Galvin K.M. Bauknecht T. See R.H. Lee J.S. Deng T. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Wang J. Seto E. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Given the findings reported in our current study, it is possible that YY1 and Hox proteins coordinate to regulate gene expression during embryogenesis. The Hox-YY1 interaction may also be involved in regulating cell survival and/or apoptosis. Several lines of evidence indicate that Hox function is linked to apoptosis. For instance, HoxA5 has been shown to regulate expression of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, in breast cancer tissue (38Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Miguel-Aliaga and Thor (39Miguel-Aliaga I. Thor S. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 6093-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have shown that neuronal segmental specificity is mediated by differential expression of the Abd-B Hox genes, which protect pioneer neurons from apoptosis via repression of the two RHG motif cell death activators, rpr and grim. Significantly, mammalian YY1 has also been shown to be a negative regulator of p53 recently (3Sui G. Affar el B. Shi Y. Brignone C. Wall N.R. Yin P. Donohoe M. Luke M.P. Calvo D. Grossman S.R.

Liu, and Y. Shi, unpublished data. suggesting that YY1 PHR is necessary for YY1 to support cell survival. Taken together, these findings suggest that YY1 may regulate important developmental processes as well as cell survival, in part by regulating Hox protein activities via protein-protein interactions. Previous studies have shown that YY1 is required for Ezh2 binding to the silenced state of muscle specific genes (42Caretti G. Di Padova M. Micales B. Lyons G.E. Sartorelli V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and that YY1 interacts with the EED protein in the EED-EZH human homolog PcG complex (43Satijn D.P. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These findings implicate YY1 in epigenetic regulation, specifically in mediating Hox gene repression. Importantly, our study has identified a new relationship between PcG (YY1) and Hox proteins at the level of direct protein-protein interaction. We speculate that other Hox proteins such as Hoxa9 and Hoxd9 may also be regulated by YY1 via a similar mechanism. Altogether, our findings suggest that YY1 may participate in the regulation of embryonic development in part by modulating the activity of the Hox proteins. These findings provide a new insight into YY1 function and offer a potential mechanism for the critical role of YY1 in mouse embryonic development.

https://openalex.org/W2081491446,"The Met regulon in Escherichia coli encodes several proteins responsible for the biosynthesis of methionine. Regulation of the expression of most of these proteins is governed by the methionine repressor protein MetJ and its co-repressor, the methionine derivative S-adenosylmethionine. Genes controlled by MetJ contain from two to five sequential copies of a homologous 8-bp sequence called the metbox. A crystal structure for one of the complexes, the repressor tetramer bound to two metboxes, has been reported (Somers, W. S., and S. E. Phillips (1992) Nature 359, 387-393), but little structural work on the larger assemblies has been done presumably because of the difficulties in crystallization and the variability in the number and sequences of metboxes for the various genes. Small angle neutron scattering was used to study complexes of MetJ and S-adenosylmethionine with double-stranded DNA containing two, three, and five metboxes. Our results demonstrate that the crystal structure of the two-metbox complex is not the native solution conformation of the complex. Instead, the system adopts a less compact conformation in which there is decreased interaction between the adjacent MetJ dimers. Models built of the higher order complexes from the scattering data show that the three-metbox complex is organized much like the two-metbox complex. However, the five-metbox complex differs significantly from the smaller complexes, providing much closer packing of the adjacent MetJ dimers and allowing additional contacts not available in the crystal structure.

A. 1986; 83: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and in vitro selection has shown that this sequence is optimal for MetJ binding (12He Y.Y. Stockley P.G. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The number of contiguous metboxes as well as the match of those sequences to the consensus are likely responsible for the differential levels of repression of the genes in the Met regulon (1Old I.G. Phillips S.E. Stockley P.G. Saint Girons I. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 56: 145-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Marincs F. Manfield I.W. Stead J.A. McDowall K.J. Stockley P.G. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite the variety in length and sequence of the natural operators, the only high resolution structure determined for a complex of native MetJ with SAM and metbox DNA is the tetramer bound to DNA having two copies of the consensus sequence. Higher order complexes containing more than two metboxes have not been successfully crystallized. Here, we report the results of small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with contrast variation measurements of three MetJ complexes with SAM and DNA containing two, three, and five metboxes in solution. These results suggest that the solution conformation of the two-metbox complex differs significantly from the crystal structure. Furthermore, the higher order complexes, particularly the five-metbox complex, are not simple extensions of the arrangement seen in the smallest complex. Sample Preparation—MetJ was prepared by overexpression from an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter in BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Cells were harvested and lysed with BugBuster (Novagen). MetJ was purified sequentially by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange with cellulose phosphate and DEAE columns, and gel filtration on a Sephacryl-200 column. The protein was determined to be pure by SDS-PAGE. MetJ was concentrated with a Vivaspin-20 concentrator (ISC Bioexpress, Kaysville, UT) and then dialyzed into buffer containing varying amounts of D2O for contrast variation studies. The buffer was 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% sodium azide. The DNA oligos used in this study were obtained from IDT (Coralville, IA). All sequences were flanked by GG-on the 5′-end and -CC on the 3′-end to “lock” the ends of the oligos and reduce the chances that the strands would separate. The two-metbox (5′-GGAGACGTCTAGACGTCTCC-3′) and three-metbox (5′-GGAGACGTCTAGACGTCTAGACGTCTCC-3′) constructs contained multiple copies of the consensus sequence and were self-complementary. To eliminate the possibility that a long palindromic sequence might fold back on itself and form a hairpin, the five-metbox construct used was the natural operator for the metF gene (5′-GGCTTCATCTTTACATCTGGACGTCTAAACGGATAGATGTGCCC-3′; bases that match the consensus sequence are underlined). Concentrated DNA stock solutions were heat annealed before use to favor the double-stranded form. The SAM used was the chloride salt (A7007; Sigma). A concentrated stock solution was made up in water and then adjusted to pH ∼5.0 with NaOH to ensure that the addition of SAM did not affect the pH of the samples. Samples for SANS were made by using MetJ that had been dialyzed into the required buffers and adding small volumes of DNA and SAM from concentrated stocks. All samples contained 5 mg/ml MetJ and stoichiometric amounts of DNA and SAM, i.e. one metbox and two SAM molecules per dimer. Gel Shift Assay—Samples were prepared containing 0.4 mg/ml MetJ with stoichiometric amounts of SAM and various DNA oligos in the same buffer as that used for SANS. In addition to the oligos used for the neutron scattering experiments, we examined oligos containing four and five copies of the consensus metbox as well as the natural metA operator that contains four metboxes (5′-GGAGCTATCTGGATGTCTAAACGTATAAGCGTATCC-3′; bases that match the consensus sequence are underlined). After the samples were allowed to mix for 15-20 min at room temperature, an equal volume of 2× loading dye (20% sucrose, 0.02% xylene cyanol in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA) was added before loading on the gel. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature on a 9% non-denaturing acrylamide gel that was made and run in 1× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA). The gel was stained with SYBR Green nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen). SANS Measurements—SANS data were collected at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research (Gaithersburg, MD) using the NG-7 30-m SANS instrument (14Glinka C.J. Barker J.G. Hammouda B. Krueger S. Moyer J.J. Orts W.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 430-445Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature. A neutron wavelength of 5 Å was used with a wavelength spread Δλ/λ of 0.22 to provide the maximum flux on the sample. Sample and background intensities were collected at sample-to-detector distances of 1.5 and 4.6 m to obtain data over the q-range necessary for structural modeling. Data reduction to one-dimensional scattered intensity profiles, I(q) versus q, followed standard procedures to correct for detector sensitivity and sample background (14Glinka C.J. Barker J.G. Hammouda B. Krueger S. Moyer J.J. Orts W.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 31: 430-445Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar). An empty beam measurement was used to calibrate the measurements into absolute units (1/cm) (15Wignall G.D. Bates F.S. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 28-40Crossref Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The reduced intensities from the two detector distances were merged using routines included with the data reduction software provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Samples of the two-metbox complex were prepared in 10 and 71% D2O by mixing stock solutions of the subunits. Samples of the three-metbox and five-metbox complexes were prepared in the same way but in 10, 32, 53, and 71% D2O. The samples and corresponding solvent blanks were measured in 1-mm path length cells. The precise D2O content of each sample was determined by comparing the measured neutron absorbance, μ, to that of pure H2O and D2O. The neutron absorbance is obtained from the measured sample transmission using the relationship μ = ln(T)/d, where T is the transmission, and d is the sample path length. The neutron absorbance of a sample varies linearly with the hydrogen content, which is dominated by the buffer solution. The solvent deuteration fraction of the sample, P, can be determined using the relation P = 1-((μsample - μD2O)/(μH2O-μD2O)). The D2O content of each sample determined in this manner was used throughout the analysis and modeling of the data. Small Angle Scattering Data Analysis—The small angle scattering intensity profile of monodisperse, identical particles in solution is shown in Equation 1 I(q)=|〈∫v(ρ(r→)-ρs)e-iq→⋅r→d3r〉|2(Eq. 1) where ρ(→r) is the scattering length density of the particle as a function of position →r within the particle volume V; ρs is the average scattering length density of the solvent; and →q is the momentum transfer, having the magnitude q = 4πsin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength. The integration in Equation 1 is averaged over all conformations and orientations of particles in the incident beam and includes the time- and ensemble-averaged information of all of the particles in the sampled volume. In addition to determining the radius of gyration, Rg, according to Guinier (16Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar), data were analyzed for the distance distribution function, P(r), between scattering centers within an object. The scattered intensity I(q) is related to P(r) as shown in Equation 2. P(r)=12π2∫0∞dq⋅(qr)⋅I(q)sin(qr)(Eq. 2) The indirect Fourier transform algorithm originally described by Moore (17Moore P.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Crossref Google Scholar) was used to determine P(r) from measured intensity profiles. The boundary conditions P(r)/r = 0at r = 0 and the maximum linear dimension, dmax, are applied to ensure proper behavior. In addition to providing dmax, P(r) fitting also provides a second measure of Rg, which is the second moment of P(r). Structural Models from SANS Data—Modeling of the complex was based on the high resolution crystal structure of a two-metbox complex (Protein Data Bank code 1CMA) (9Somers W.S. Phillips S.E. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) with hydrogen atoms added using MOLPROBITY (18Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W615-W619Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The structure of a single MetJ dimer bound to the metbox sequence from the crystal structure was used as the basic unit for building models, which was maintained as a rigid body when constructing models of the higher order assemblies. This approach maintained the appropriate distortion of the DNA induced by the binding of the MetJ dimer. The two-, three-, and five-metbox complexes were constructed by sequential assembly of the basic unit. To facilitate the construction, a coordinate system was defined using the A3/T18 base pair of the first metbox in the crystal structure and the standard reference frame for nucleic acids (19Olson W.K. Bansal M. Burley S.K. Dickerson R.E. Gerstein M. Harvey S.C. Heinemann U. Lu X.J. Neidle S. Shakked Z. Sklenar H. Suzuki M. Tung C.S. Westhof E. Wolberger C. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To assemble the two-, three-, and five-metbox complexes, the translation and rotation applied to the next copy of the basic unit is such that the A3/T18 base pair of the basic unit is properly placed in the space of the standard reference frame of the A11/T10 base pair of the previous basic unit. To test for structural deviations of the two-, three-, and five-metbox complexes from the organization implied by the crystal structure (9Somers W.S. Phillips S.E. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the roll angle, ω, of the basic unit about the vector from C′1,T18 to C′1,A3 of the metbox was varied. An examination of the high resolution structure suggests that this particular rotation axis affords the greatest degree of flexibility for the modeling and avoids interference between adjacent MetJ dimers. In the models of the three- and five-metbox complexes, the roll angles between all of the basic units were assumed to be identical, thereby ensuring that the interaction between subsequent MetJ dimers remains identical and minimizing the number of free parameters. The modeling tested ω values every 5° from -90° to +90°, where 0° is defined by the angle present in the crystal structure. Negative values of ω increase the separation of adjacent MetJ dimers bound to the DNA, whereas positive values bring the centers of mass of adjacent dimers closer together. The program ORNL_SAS 4W. T. Heller and E. Tjioe, manuscript in preparation. was used to calculate the intensity profiles from the generated model structures and evaluate the quality of the fit against the experimental data. ORNL_SAS simultaneously calculates multiple small angle scattering intensity profiles from high resolution structures using a Monte Carlo approach and is capable of comparing the results against several sets of input data from x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. If the series of input data sets are Ij(q) and the model intensity profiles are Im,j(q), the quality of fit is evaluated using the reduced χ2 parameter as shown in Equation 3. χ2=1(∑jNj,pts)−Nf∑j∑Nj,pts(Ij(q)−Im,j(q))2σj(q)2(Eq. 3) Nj,pts is the number of data points modeled against in the measured intensity Ij(q). σj(q) is the experimental uncertainty in the measured intensity Ij(q). Nf is the number of parameters used for the scaling of the model profiles to the data. There are two scaling parameters per data set, being the overall scale factor and a base line, which reflects difficulties in determining the exact base line of SANS data when the solvents contain a large amount of hydrogen and is generally not larger than the uncertainty in the measured forward scatter, I(0), of a properly background-subtracted data set. SANS data were collected on solution samples of two-, three-, and five-metbox complexes. To verify the formation of the MetJ-DNA-SAM complexes, we performed a gel shift assay, shown in Fig. 1. These results show that MetJ forms only one stable complex with each of the DNA oligos, because, in the presence of MetJ, there is only a single band that is shifted in mobility relative to the DNA alone. The size of the complexes cannot be determined from this type of experiment, but by examining the full series of complexes the trend in the shift of the bands for the complexes clearly indicates that longer DNA fragments bind more MetJ than the shorter ones. In addition, the complexes formed with the four-consensus metbox sequence and metA run identically, indicating that the same number of MetJ dimers are bound to both. This is also true for the five-consensus metbox sequence and metF, justifying our assumption that the five-metbox complex used for SANS binds five MetJ dimers. One other observation to note is that the long palindromic sequences show signs of hairpin formation, indicated by an additional fast-running band in the lanes without MetJ. It was to avoid this hairpin potential that we decided to use a natural sequence for the five-metbox construct. The reduced SANS intensity profiles for the two-, three-, and five-metbox complexes are shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and C, respectively. The differential spacing between the data points (on the left and right side) of each profile results from the two detector distances used to provide the desired q-range. The P(r) for the three complexes extracted from the data collected in 10 and 71% D2O, which have the strongest signals, are shown in Fig. 3. The trends in Rg and dmax with increasing numbers of MetJ dimers can be seen in Fig. 4. The trend in Rg is not simple to interpret, but it is clear from the trend in dmax that the length of the complex, going from 80-90 to 120 Å, is not a linear function of the number of base pairs of DNA. The results suggest that the binding of five MetJ dimers has produced a compaction of the complex beyond any structural change induced in the two- and three-metbox complexes. The overall lengths for all three complexes are shorter than expected for idealized B-form DNA.FIGURE 3P(r) curves derived from the 10% (A) and 71% (B)D2O data sets using the Moore algorithm (17Moore P.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Crossref Google Scholar). The symbols correspond to the two-metbox (▪), three-metbox (○), and five-metbox (▴) complexes.

The easiest to interpret are those from the samples in 71% D2O (Fig. 3B), which are dominated by the scattering of the MetJ in the complex because the scattering length density of DNA is very nearly identical to the solution scattering length density. In contrast, at 10% D2O both the MetJ and DNA scatter strongly, with the DNA scattering ∼3.5 times stronger than MetJ on a per unit volume basis. The larger relative total volume of the MetJ means that it contributes more to the scattered intensity than the DNA, but the DNA contribution is not negligible, as it is in 71% D2O. The P(r) curve of the two-metbox complex shown in Fig. 3B is consistent with a compact structure, such as would be expected based on the crystal structure. The five-metbox complex P(r) is typical of a rod-like structure, as might be expected for an assembly of the proteins on a longer piece of DNA. The P(r) of the three-metbox complex is the most interesting. In addition to the main peak at 27 Å, there is a shoulder near 50 Å. Such a shoulder suggests some distinction between groups of structural elements that leads to a secondary peak in P(r), but the effect is subtle. The modeling of the complexes provides an effective means of visualizing the conformational changes that occur in the higher order complexes. A plot of χ2 as a function of the rotation angle ω is shown in Fig. 5. The two-metbox- and three-metbox complexes essentially have a plateau centered near ω = -60°, but the minimum is relatively shallow and there is considerable noise. The minimum for the 5-metbox complex is the most clearly defined of the three complexes measured and best fits the data at an ω of +30°. The model intensity profiles for the best-fit models are plotted in Fig. 2 with the data. The fit is excellent in all cases. The model profiles that appear to end before the end of the plotted range reflect the small shift in the base line allowed for the scaling of the intensity profiles to account for possible difficulties in the data subtraction. It is important to point out that the original crystal structure, after having hydrogens appropriately added using MOLPROBITY (18Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W615-W619Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and removing water molecules found in the crystal structure, yields a χ2 of 2.29 when tested against the SANS data of the two-metbox complex. This value is significantly higher than the best value found in the modeling (χ2 = 1.05), indicating that the model structure fits the data significantly better than the crystal structure. The best-fit models for the three complexes are shown in Fig. 6 and provide a way to understand the nature of the sign of the rotation angle ω. In the models, the structure of a single metbox and the associated MetJ dimer with SAM bound is considered fixed. As ω changes, the extent of the interaction between the consecutive dimers changes. A negative value of ω increases the separation between the centers of mass of the MetJ dimers, whereas a positive value of ω causes the separation between the MetJ dimers to decrease, enhancing the potential for interaction between the dimers. The most obvious feature of the structures of the two-metbox and three-metbox complexes is that the amount of contact along Helix A of the adjacent MetJ dimers is very minimal, being reduced to only a few interactions near the ends of the helix. If the structure were to be continued indefinitely, the resulting superhelical arrangement of the protein around the DNA would be very wide with only minimal protein-protein contacts. In contrast, the structure of the five-metbox complex is such that there is a great deal of interaction between the adjacent MetJ dimers and the points of contact are no longer limited to Helix A. The nature of the superhelical packing of the structure can be seen clearly in Fig. 6D and is significantly more compact than if the structures of the smaller (two- and three-metbox) complexes were to be extended. Fig. 7 shows a close-up of the interface between adjacent dimers highlighting the main difference between the models of the smaller complexes and that of the five-metbox complex.FIGURE 7Close-up of the interface of adjacent MetJ dimers from the crystal structure (A), the model of the two-metbox complex (B), and one of the interfaces from the model of the five-metbox complex (C). Relative to the crystal structure, the model of the two-metbox complex shows that the dimers are farther apart and the number of contacts across Helix A have been reduced. For the model of the five-metbox complex, the dimers have moved closer to each other and contacts are not limited to Helix A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of the SANS studies with contrast variation presented here provide new insight into the cooperative regulation of genes in the Met regulon by the methionine repressor MetJ and its cofactor SAM. One important finding is that the calculated scattering curve based on coordinates from the crystal structure is not consistent with the SANS data collected from the two-metbox complex in solution. The models derived from the SANS data indicate that the centers of mass of the adjacent MetJ dimers are further apart than they are in the crystal structure. The DNA conformation also differs significantly in that there is a significant bend between adjacent metboxes as can be seen in Fig. 6. As a result of the opening of the structure, the interaction between the adjacent MetJ dimers through Helix A is drastically reduced as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Contacts along the A helix are thought to be involved in the cooperativity observed for binding multiple MetJ dimers to adjacent metboxes (7Hyre D.E. Spicer L.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3212-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Somers W.S. Phillips S.E. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10He Y.Y. McNally T. Manfield I. Navratil O. Old I.G. Phillips S.E. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and have been postulated to explain why at least two metboxes are required for stable protein binding to DNA. In our SANS-based model for the tetramer assembly on two consecutive metbox sequences in solution, however, there is reduced contact at the dimer-dimer interface. The addition of a third metbox, which allows a third MetJ dimer to bind the complex, does not significantly change the relationship between the MetJ dimers from that seen in the two-metbox complex. The other surprising result is that the five-metbox complex appears to have a very different organization of MetJ dimers. In addition to contacts through the previously identified Helix A (residues 30-45), the model suggests that there are additional interactions through residues 17-20 in the loop that precedes the β strand. The most straightforward a priori assumption would be that increasing the number of metboxes should have a simple additive effect on the strength of MetJ binding, so that each additional dimer that can bind adds some fixed amount to the overall affinity. Our model of the five-metbox complex suggests, however, that additional factors associated with structural features of the assembly must be considered. Intriguingly, an earlier footprinting experiment with DNA having mutations in the metF operator supports this interpretation as well (20Davidson B.E. Saint Girons I. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1639-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). DNase footprinting showed that of the five metboxes in the metF operator, four were preferentially bound initially whereas binding to a fifth (repeat 5) required higher concentrations of MetJ. Moreover, deletion of or mutations in repeat 5 could eliminate repression in vivo. This result was interpreted to mean that the additional cooperativity gained from binding the last MetJ dimer to repeat 5 allowed the complex to meet some “threshold” for tight binding (20Davidson B.E. Saint Girons I. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1639-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In light of our SANS results, we further postulate that MetJ binding to repeat 5, and possibly 4, modifies the structure of the assembly, creating a more compact complex that is likely bound more tightly. With the data presented here, we can only say that in solution the tight binding mode requires more than three dimers. It should also be noted that the DNA sequence used in the footprinting experiment as well as our SANS experiment was not five copies of the consensus metbox but rather the native metF operator sequence. It is possible, but unlikely, that the natural sequence variations alter the interaction between adjacent MetJ dimers in the complex. There is a long history of using the consensus sequence as well as natural operators to study MetJ binding (6Phillips S.E. Manfield I. Parsons I. Davidson B.E. Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Hyre D.E. Spicer L.D.

Biol. 2002; 320: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Further evidence that MetJ may bind DNA differently depending on the number of metboxes comes from studies of the metC operator, the only one in E. coli that contains the minimum of two metboxes (11Belfaiza J. Parsot C. Martel A. de la Tour C.B. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). DNase footprinting experiments have shown that MetJ covers a 32-bp region centered around the two consensus metbox sequences, i.e. MetJ covers a region the size of four 8-bp metboxes (6Phillips S.E. Manfield I. Parsons I. Davidson B.E. Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Wild C.M. McNally T. Phillips S.E. Stockley P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1125-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that in vivo repression is only achieved by the binding of four to five MetJ dimers, and that this tight binding mode is different from the weak binding of two to three dimers. While most of the in vitro work has been done with synthetic minimal operators containing only two metboxes, sometimes embedded within longer DNA fragments, the metboxes used are always composed of repeats of the consensus sequence (6Phillips S.E. Manfield I. Parsons I. Davidson B.E. Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Margarita D. Cohen G.N. Saint-Girons I. Stockley P.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Hyre D.E.

Biol. 2002; 320: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consequently, MetJ has an unnaturally high affinity for them. In E. coli, only one metbox, part of the metD operator, consists of the actual consensus sequence (2Gal J. Szvetnik A. Schnell R. Kalman M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4930-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), while in the closely related Salmonella typhimurium there is also only one occurrence, part of the metER operator (24Wu W.F. Urbanowski M.L. Stauffer G.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The strength of binding is also affected significantly by the co-repressor, SAM, but all of the SANS experiments reported here were carried out in the presence of SAM and thus provide no information on the structural consequence of SAM binding. The different binding modes could be a result of many factors, including enhanced compaction of the DNA, which could lead to more extensive DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, as well as conformational changes within MetJ. The models built to test against the SANS data are intended to be simple and assume that the structure of the MetJ dimer in solution is unchanged from the high resolution crystallographic structure in the tetramer complex (9Somers W.S. Phillips S.E. Nature. 1992; 359: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which is reported to be essentially the same as that of the crystallized dimer alone (8Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Saint-Girons I. Phillips S.E. Nature. 1989; 341: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). SANS, being an inherently lower resolution technique than x-ray diffraction, is often well suited for determining whether the solution structure of a protein is identical to a crystal structure, such as when there are well defined domains connected by flexible linkers. In the case of the MetJ-DNA-SAM complexes, the system is significantly more complicated. The use of additional variables to model changes in the structures of the MetJ subunits would decrease confidence in the final models as the size and complexity of the search space increases geometrically with the number of variables used. The application of ab initio modeling (25Heller W.T. Krueger J.K. Trewhella J.

The modeling approach chosen is a compromise to help visualize the solution conformations of the complexes with the minimum number of variables. Because this approach does not take into account any conformational changes that could occur in the MetJ dimers, the models do not preclude cooperativity in the assembly of the complex. In conclusion, we have used SANS with contrast variation to study the solution structures of two-, three-, and five-metbox complexes. Model building has demonstrated that the solution conformation adopted is a function of the number of tandem metbox sequences. Importantly, the SANS data collected for the two-metbox complex demonstrate that the crystal structure is not consistent with the solution conformation of the complex. In the shorter complexes measured, the centers of mass of the adjacent MetJ dimers are further apart than found in the crystal structure, producing a superhelical assembly that is relatively open. In contrast, the SANS data of the largest complex studied, the five-metbox complex, are consistent with a structure in which the adjacent MetJ dimers are in much closer proximity, producing a superhelical structure that is quite compact. In this case, SANS with structural modeling gives unique insight into the assembly of this large (150 kDa), important native repressor complex in solution. The results provide evidence for a structural mechanism controlling differences observed in the transcription regulation provided by MetJ and suggest the possibility that, in solution, MetJ is able to bind to DNA in at least two different ways.

https://openalex.org/W1976711071,"Flavodoxins play central roles in the electron transfer involving various biological processes in microorganisms. The mioC gene of Escherichia coli encodes a 16-kDa flavodoxin and locates next to the chromosomal replication initiation origin (oriC). Extensive researches have been carried out to investigate the relationship between mioC transcription and replication initiation. Recently, the MioC protein was proposed to be essential for the biotin synthase activity in vitro. Nevertheless, the exact role of MioC in biotin synthesis and its physiological function in vivo remain elusive. In order to understand the molecular basis of the biological functions of MioC and the cofactor-binding mechanisms of flavodoxins, we have determined the solution structures of both the apo- and holo-forms of E. coli MioC protein at high resolution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The overall structures of both forms consist of an α/β sandwich, which highly resembles the classical flavodoxin fold. However, significant diversities are observed between the two forms, especially the stabilization of the FMN-binding loops and the notable extension of secondary structures upon FMN binding. Structural comparison reveals fewer negative charged and aromatic residues near the FMN-binding site of MioC, as compared with that of flavodoxin 1 from E. coli, which may affect both the redox potentials and the redox partner interactions. Furthermore, the backbone dynamics studies reveal the conformational flexibility at different time scales for both apo- and holo-forms of MioC, which may play important roles for cofactor binding and electron transfer.

However, the detailed mechanisms are not clear yet and remain to be further elucidated. Flavodoxins are classified into the long-chain and shortchain groups according to the presence or absence of a 20-amino acid loop that splits the fifth β-strand of the central β-sheet (25Lopez-Llano J.

The Escherichia coli protein MioC is identified as a flavodoxin with 147 amino acid residues and belongs to the short-chain group. The mioC gene is located next to the chromosomal replication initiation origin (oriC) of the E. coli genome, and the transcription of mioC runs through the oriC site (27Kolling R. Gielow A. Seufert W. Kucherer C. Messer W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 212: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on its peculiar chromosomal location, extensive efforts were dedicated to establishing the relationship between mioC transcription and DNA replication initiation (28Lobner-Olesen A. Atlung T.

However, these experimental results are often contradictory, and no ultimate conclusions have been reached thus far. Recently, it was suggested that MioC protein plays an essential role in promoting the biotin synthase (BioB) activity in vitro (11Birch O.M. Hewitson K.S. Fuhrmann M. Burgdorf K. Baldwin J.E. Roach P.L. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32277-32280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two other essential protein components for keeping BioB activity were previously identified to be E. coli flavodoxin 1 (FldA) and flavodoxin reductase (10Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It was also shown that both MioC and FldA are needed in the in vitro activity assays, and neither of them can substitute the function of the other (11Birch O.M. Hewitson K.S. Fuhrmann M. Burgdorf K. Baldwin J.E. Roach P.L. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32277-32280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Intriguing questions are thus raised. What exact role does MioC play in biotin synthesis? Does it act up- or downstream of FldA in the electron transfer chain, or does it act parallel? Why are two flavodoxins needed in this reaction system, and how do they distinguish their redox partners and their biological roles? Is MioC essential for biotin synthesis in vivo, and what other potential physiological roles may MioC play? In order to elucidate these issues, one needs to answer the following two fundamental questions. Does E. coli MioC exhibit similar or different molecular properties as FldA? What are the structural and dynamic features that might determine the roles of MioC in the biotin synthesis and other redox activities? Since MioC and FldA share low sequence identity and belong to the short-chain and long-chain flavodoxin groups, respectively, the structural and dynamic diversities may give rise to the different redox activities and functions of the two proteins. In an effort to obtain insights into the molecular mechanism of the biological functions, we have determined the solution structures of both the apo- and holo-forms of MioC by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. Both structures show the typical flavodoxin fold consisting of an α/β sandwich. However, the protein structure is considerably stabilized, and the secondary structures are extended upon FMN binding. In addition, backbone dynamics studies of the apo- and holo-forms in conjunction with structural analysis and titration experiments provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms of cofactor binding and electron transfer of flavodoxins. Expression and Purification of the Recombinant MioC—The mioC gene was cloned into pET21a expression vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain (Novagen). The culture was allowed to grow in LB medium, centrifuged, and resuspended in M9 minimal medium with antibiotics (ampicillin) and 15NH4Cl in the presence or absence of 13C6-glucose for preparations of 13C/15N-labeled or 15N-labeled samples, respectively (38Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The MioC protein was purified by ion exchange chromatography (DEAE) and subsequently gel filtration (Superdex-75) using anÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The purity was determined to be greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. The apo-form of MioC was prepared by denaturing the purified protein using 5% trichloroacetic acid (39Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), followed by refolding the protein in a buffer containing 30 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 30 mm NaCl, and 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The holo-form of MioC was prepared by refolding the protein in a buffer containing 30 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 30 mm NaCl, and excess fully oxidized FMN (50 mm). 5% D2O was added for preparations of the NMR samples, and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid was added as the internal chemical shift reference. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker Avance 500- and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with four RF channels and triple resonance probes with pulsed field gradients. The chemical shifts were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid. All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (40Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11559) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (41Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and threedimensional HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HBHA-(CO)NH, CBCA(CO)NH, (H)CC(CO)NH-TOCSY, (H)CCHCOSY, and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments were performed to obtain the chemical shift assignments of backbone and side chain atoms (42Sattler M.

Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. Ikura M. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 620-627Google Scholar). The three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (mixing time 100 ms) were collected to confirm the chemical shift assignments and generate distance restraints for structure calculations (48Marion D.

Structure Calculations—The structure calculations were performed using the program package CYANA (49Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar) and refined by AMBER (50Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.R. Cheatham T.E. DeBolt III, S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2670) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from interproton nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE). Dihedral angles (φ and ψ) were determined from backbone chemical shifts using TALOS (51Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were obtained using intermediate range NOEs in combination with the secondary structural information. The initial structures were calculated with the CANDID module of the CYANA program (49Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar, 52Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). The 20 lowest energy structures were selected as models for SANE to extend the NOE assignments (53Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two hundred structures were calculated by CYANA, and the 100 lowest energy structures were used as initial structures and refined using AMBER. Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures for each form were selected to represent the MioC protein in the apo- and holo-form, respectively. Hydrogen bond restraints were used in the initial structural determination and refinement but were removed in the final stage of structure refinement. The final structures were analyzed using the program packages MOLMOL (54Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK_NMR (55Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar). In order to fix the phosphate group of the FMN cofactor during the structure calculations of the holo-form of MioC, ambiguous restraints were added between the oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups and residues Leu12-Gly14. These residues showed large chemical shift perturbations upon FMN binding, and their peculiar chemical shifts suggested hydrogen bond formation with the phosphate group (21Sibille N. Blackledge M. Brutscher B. Coves J. Bersch B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9086-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 56Barsukov I. Modi S. Lian L.Y. Sze K.H. Paine M.J. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1997; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Titration Experiments—The FMN titration experiments were performed and monitored by a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC experiments. The apo-form of MioC was first exchanged using the NMR buffer without DTT under anaerobic conditions to remove DTT. The two-dimensional HSQC spectra of apo-MioC in the NMR buffer with or without DTT were identical. During the titration, the molar ratio of FMN/protein was gradually increased from 0.1:1 to 2:1. The spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C. Backbone 15N Relaxation Measurements—The backbone 15N relaxation parameters of the longitudinal relaxation rates (R1), transverse relaxation rates (R2), and steady-state heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE values of the apo- and holo-forms of MioC were measured, respectively (57Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 800-MHz NMR spectrometer at 25 °C. A spectral width of 11160.7 Hz for the 1H dimension was used for both the apo- and holo-MioC, whereas for 15N dimension, spectral widths of 2595.0 and 2676.1 Hz were used for the apo- and holo-MioC, respectively. For the R1 and R2 measurements, 1024 (1H) and 100 (15N) complex data points were collected with 24 transients per increment and a recycle delay of 2.7 s. The delays used for the R1 experiments were 10 (×2), 100, 200, 500, 800, 1100, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3190 ms, and those used for the R2 experiments were 8 (×2), 16, 32, 48, 64, 88, 112, 136, and 176 ms. The relaxation rate constants were obtained by fitting the peak intensities to a single exponential function using the nonlinear least squares method as described (58Fushman D. Cahill S. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The {1H}-15N NOE experiments were performed in the presence and absence of a 3-s proton presaturation period prior to the 15N excitation pulse and using recycle delays of 2 and 5 s, respectively (59Markley L.J. Horsley W.J. Klein M.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1971; 55: 3604-3605Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 64 transients were used for each experiment. NMR Characterizations of the Apo- and Holo-forms of E. coli MioC—The overexpression and purification procedures of the recombinant MioC were similar to that previously described (11Birch O.M. Hewitson K.S. Fuhrmann M. Burgdorf K. Baldwin J.E. Roach P.L. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32277-32280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The elution with bright yellow color from the ion exchange column was further purified by gel filtration chromatography. However, the two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectrum of the directly purified sample showed an extra set of peaks, indicating a mixture of inhomogeneous compositions. The trichloroacetic acid precipitation and subsequent refolding procedure were used to prepare the apo-form of MioC (39Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The corresponding two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectrum showed a unique set of cross-peaks with chemical shift distribution corresponding to a reasonably well folded protein (Fig. 1A). However, the backbone amide signals of 21 nonproline residues were missing, including Ala2, Gly9, Thr11, Leu12, Gly14, Ala15, Glu16, Ser55, Asp64, Arg93, Cys99, Ala101, Ile102, Asp103, Ile125, Leu126, Asp127, His128, Asp133, Ala135, and Glu136. Half of the missing residues are located in regions connecting the secondary structures of the central core and the FMN-binding loops, suggesting the intermediate conformational exchanges that are most probably coupled to the hinge motions (see below). Other missing residues are mostly located in the long loop (the 120s loop) connecting the fifth β-strand and the last α-helix, indicating that extensive conformational exchanges occur in this region. The holo-form of MioC was prepared by refolding the protein in the presence of excess FMN, and the corresponding two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectrum showed a single set of cross-peaks quite different from that of the apo-form (Fig. 1B). Nearly all backbone amide signals of nonproline residues were observed except for residues Ala2, Leu126, His128, Glu132, and Asp133. Fig. 1C shows an overlay of the HSQC spectra of the apo- and holo-forms of MioC, and the residues significantly perturbed upon binding with FMN are labeled. FMN titration experiments were performed to characterize the cofactor-binding site of MioC. When the molar ratio of FMN/MioC was less than 1, the two-dimensional HSQC spectra showed two sets of peaks corresponding to the apo- and holo-forms of MioC with varying intensities. The spectrum of the directly purified sample was similar to these spectra, further demonstrating that the protein purified directly from recombinant expression was a mixture of both the apo- and holo-forms of MioC. After the holo-form of MioC was exchanged using the NMR buffer without free FMN molecules, the bound FMN molecules gradually left off from the protein. The HSQC spectrum of the sample prepared in this way also showed two sets of peaks, indicating that FMN is noncovalently bound to MioC and the apo- and holo-forms of MioC are in an exchanging process. Taken together, the existence of two sets of peaks instead of one in the HSQC spectra indicates that the exchange of apo- and holo-forms of MioC is in the slow regime. When the molar ratio of FMN/protein reached and went beyond 1, the set of peaks corresponding to the apoform was completely unobservable, and the HSQC spectra were identical to that of the holo-form. These results suggest a 1:1 binding between MioC and FMN with high affinity, which is in agreement with the previously characterized nanomolar range of Kd values commonly observed for flavodoxins (60Hoover D.M. Ludwig M.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2525-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The composite chemical shift changes of individual residues in the two forms are plotted in Fig. 1D. Residues exhibiting the largest chemical shift changes are clustered around the three FMN-binding loops: the P-loop (residues Gly9-Gly14), the 50s loop (residues Ser55-Asp64), and the 90s loop (residues Ser92-Gly100). In the HSQC spectra of MioC, the missing residues located in or near the three loops in the apo-form appeared after its binding with FMN. Solution Structures of the Apo- and Holo-forms of E. coli MioC—To fully characterize the conformational changes upon FMN binding, the solution structures of both the apo- and holo-forms of E. coli MioC protein were determined using the NOE-derived distance restraints in combination with dihedral angle restraints. The lowest energy structures (20 for each form) were selected to represent the apo- and holo-forms of MioC, respectively, and are shown in Fig. 2, together with the ribbon diagrams of the mean structures (energy-minimized using AMBER) of each form. The structural statistics of both forms are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Structural statistics of the apo- and holo-forms of MioCApo-formHolo-formDistance restraintsIntraresidue unambiguous NOEs15261821Sequential unambiguous NOEs746804Medium range unambiguous NOEs540500Long range unambiguous NOEs706882Total unambiguous NOEs35184007Total ambiguous NOEs12831674Dihedral angles (φ and ψ)128158Intermolecular NOEs07r.m.s. deviation from mean structure (Å)Secondary structure backbone atoms0.57 ± 0.100.48 ± 0.11Secondary structure heavy atoms0.98 ± 0.121.01 ± 0.13All backbone atoms1.43 ± 0.260.97 ± 0.18All heavy atoms1.92 ± 0.281.46 ± 0.21Energy (kcal/mol)Mean AMBER energy−7065.22 ± 15.91−7548.59 ± 11.19NOE distance restraints violation energy15.61 ± 1.6913.85 ± 1.71Torsion angle restraints violation energy0.64 ± 0.120.85 ± 0.14Restraints violationsDistance (>0.3 Å)00Dihedral angle (>5°)01Ramachandran statistics (%)Residues in most favored regions73.079.3Residues in additional allowed regions22.619.1Residues in generously allowed regions3.41.3Residues in disallowed regions1.00.2 Open table in a new tab The overall fold of both forms of MioC is similar, which consists of an α/β sandwich with a central five-strand parallel β-sheet flanked by four α-helices on two sides, highly resembling the typical flavodoxin fold. The apo-form of MioC contains four α-helices (residues Glu16-Glu28 (α1), Ser67-Gln76 (α2), Lys104-Ser112 (α3), and Glu136-Leu146 (α4)) and five β-strands (residues Ile4-Ile7 (β1), Thr33-Leu36 (β2), Ser47-Ile53 (β3), Ala82-Ile88 (β4), and Lys115-Gln116 (β5)). In addition, five backbone NOE contacts between residues Ile88 and Gly89 and Leu121, Lys122, and Ile123 were assigned to establish the short strand β5′ for residues Leu121-Ile123. However, this short strand is highly flexible in the apo-form (see below). Furthermore, the three FMN-binding loops and the 120s loop are highly mobile and adopt a flexible conformation, in accordance with the lack of NOE contacts and high internal flexibility (see below). The holo-form of MioC also contains four α-helices (residues Gly14-Ala29 (α1), Ser67-Gln76 (α2), Ile101-Asn111 (α3), and Ala135-Leu146 (α4)) and five β-strands (residues Ile4-Ser8 (β1), Thr33-His37 (β2), Ser47-Ser55 (β3), Ala82-Gly91 (β4), Lys115-Gln116 (β5), and Leu121-Asn124 (β5′)). Residues from Leu41 to Asp43 form a short 310 helix (H′). The core structure is similar to that of the apo-form, but the secondary structures are significantly extended and stabilized. In particular, the FMN-loops are straightened up and fixed in a relatively rigid conformation for the accommodation of FMN. Binding-induced Secondary Structure Formation—Although the core structures of the apo- and holo-forms of MioC are similar, significant differences are observed. An overlay of the ribbon diagrams of the mean structures (energy-minimized using AMBER) of apo- and holo-forms of MioC is shown in Fig. 3A. The backbone r.m.s. deviation between the two forms is 4.63 Å for all residues, and it is 2.30 Å after excluding the four loops near the cofactor-binding sites, indicating the FMN-binding loops are involved i"

All blood cell types are derived from a common precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell.

The requirement for stringent transcriptional regulation of the hematopoietic transcription factor Gata2 appears to be critical, as deregulated GATA-2 expression either blocks or promotes hematopoiesis (3Briegel K.

Based on GATA-1-mediated Pol II recruitment to the β-globin LCR and the finding that GATA-1-mediated repression of Gata2 is associated with reduced Pol II at the 1S and 1G promoters (25Grass J.A.

We describe the localization and differential regulation of Pol II at Gata2 HSs. GATA-1-mediated repression abrogated Pol II occupancy at all sites of the locus except the –77-kb region and, to a lesser degree, the 1G promoter. TFIIB occupancy persisted at most GATA switch sites upon repression, whereas TATA-binding protein (TBP) occupancy paralleled that of P-Ser-5 Pol II. These results support a model in which GATA-2-bound extragenic regulatory elements recruit Pol II and GATA-1-mediated displacement of GATA-2 instigates repression via generation of TFIIB-chromatin complexes that fail to support subsequent Pol II recruitment.

Lysates (4 mg) were precleared with 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with either 2 μg of anti-TBP or TFIIB antibody for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were adsorbed to 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads by incubating for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were washed five times with lysis buffer. Samples were eluted in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and 20 μl of eluted material was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE with 10 μl of whole cell lysate (1 × 105 cells). Lysates were prepared by boiling 1 × 106 cells for 10 min in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Anti-TBP and anti-TFIIB were added at a dilution of 1:500 in 5% dry milk/TBST (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Rabbit IgG TrueBlot was added at a dilution of 1:1000 in 5% dry milk/TBST. Immunoreactivity was detected via chemoluminescence with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Type-specific Pol II Occupancy at Extragenic HSs of the Active Gata2 Locus Is Abrogated upon Repression—GATA switches at the –77, –3.9, –2.8, –1.8, and +9.5-kb regions of the Gata2 locus result in broad histone deacetylation of the locus and transcriptional repression (25Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 27Grass J.A. Jing H. Kim S.I. Martowicz M.L. Pal S. Blobel G.A. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7056-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As Pol II occupies extragenic regulatory regions of theβ-globin locus and GATA-1 increases Pol II occupancy at these sites (32Johnson K.D. Grass J.D. Boyer M.E. Kiekhaefer C.M. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11760-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Johnson K.D. Grass J.A. Im H. Park C. Choi K. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6468-6493Google Scholar), it is possible that GATA factor-mediated Pol II recruitment to extragenic elements is a fundamental step in GATA factor-mediated transcriptional regulation. Thus, we tested whether Pol II localizes to the GATA switch sites of the endogenous Gata2 locus. High resolution quantitative ChIP analysis was conducted to determine where Pol II resides at the Gata2 locus (Fig. 1A). Treatment of GATA-1-null G1E cells stably expressing conditionally active ER-GATA-1 (G1E-ER-GATA-1) with tamoxifen for 24 and 48 h strongly repressed Gata2 transcription from both 1S and 1G promoters (Fig. 1B). Pol II occupied the promoters, the open reading frame, and the four extragenic GATA switch sites (–77, –3.9, –2.8, and –1.8 kb) at the transcriptionally active Gata2 locus (Fig. 1C). Pol II occupancy overlapped with all previously mapped ER-GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupancy sites (27Grass J.A. Jing H. Kim S.I. Martowicz M.L. Pal S. Blobel G.A. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7056-7067Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), except the –12-kb region, in which Pol II but no ER-GATA-1 occupancy was detected. The –12-kb region lacks known regulatory elements. To determine whether GATA switches regulate Pol II occupancy, occupancy was analyzed at the repressed locus 48 h post-tamoxifen treatment. Pol II occupancy was nearly abolished at the proximal GATA switch sites (–3.9, –2.8, and –1.8 kb), the 1S promoter, and the open reading frame. Analysis of Pol II occupancy at the –2.8-kb region and the 1S promoter with a distinct Pol II antibody yielded similar results (supplemental Fig. S2). However, Pol II occupancy persisted at the –77-kb region, and ∼50% of the Pol II remained at the 1G promoter (Fig. 1D). The persistent Pol II at the –77-kb region post-ER-GATA-1 occupancy indicates that ER-GATA-1 occupancy is insufficient to displace Pol II from sites bound by ER-GATA-1. Taken together with the GATA-1 activity to recruit Pol II to the β-globin locus, GATA-1 regulates Pol II occupancy in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, the nearly quantitative loss of Pol II occupancy at the 1S promoter with partial retention of Pol II at the 1G promoter, despite repression of both promoters (Fig. 1B, data not shown), suggests the 1S and 1G promoters are differentially regulated. Both promoters are transcribed in erythroid cells, whereas the 1G promoter has broader activity in certain non-hematopoietic cell types (13Minegishi N. Ohta J. Yamagiwa H. Suzuki N. Kawauchi S.

Science. 2005; 308: 1149-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). To determine whether Pol II at Gata2 extragenic sites is transcriptionally competent, we tested whether extragenic Pol II is phosphorylated at Ser-5 of the CTD (RNA Pol II carboxyl-terminal domain). Serine 5 phosphorylation is a key step in the transition of stalled to elongating Pol II (42Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 43Lin P.S. Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 333-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P-Ser-5 was measured by quantitative ChIP analysis with the H14 antibody (44Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). The distribution of P-Ser-5 and total Pol II overlapped at all sites of the active locus except the –12-kb region, at which P-Ser-5 was absent. P-Ser-5 persisted at the –77-kb region and partially at the 1G promoter upon repression. As expected, P-Ser-5 was lost from exon 3 within the open reading frame (Fig. 1F). Pol II occupancy at the RPII215 promoter was unaffected by tamoxifen treatment, demonstrating the specificity of reduced Pol II occupancy at the Gata2 locus and indicating that reduced Pol II occupancy is not a consequence of cellular differentiation (Fig. 1G). The persistence of P-Ser-5 at the –77-kb site and partial retention at the 1G promoter suggested that Pol II remained in an elongation-competent form at restricted subregions of the repressed locus. Other examples in which P-Ser-5 occupancy precedes activation include paused Pol II at the 5′-end of the inactive hsp70 gene in Drosophila melanogaster (45Gilmour D.S. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and at the mammalian c-myc locus (46Eberhardy S.R. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48562-48571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 48Strobl L.J. Eick D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3307-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At the inactive peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 locus, Pol II associated with the basal transcriptional machinery does not initiate transcription until the SWI/SNF complex is recruited (49Salma N. Xiao H. Mueller E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4651-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). If extragenic Pol II at the active Gata2 locus is functionally important, one would expect Pol II to be absent from the locus in cells that never express Gata2. We tested whether Pol II occupied the Gata2 locus in murine 3T3 fibroblasts, which do not express Gata2 (data not shown). Pol II did not occupy the –77, –3.9, –2.8, and –1.8-kb regions or the promoters (Fig. 1H), whereas Pol II occupied the constitutively active RPII215 promoter in 3T3 cells (Fig. 1H, right panel). Thus, Pol II occupancy at the Gata2 locus is cell-type specific. A previous analysis of the β-globin locus demonstrated that lower ER-GATA-1 activity is sufficient to occupy GATA motifs at the HSs of the LCR versus the βmajor promoter (50Im H. Grass J.A. Johnson K.D. Kim S.I. Boyer M.E. Imbalzano A.N. Bieker J.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17065-17070Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As ER-GATA-1 occupancy at the LCR initiates factor recruitment and histone modifications, which are followed by ER-GATA-1 occupancy at the promoter and additional molecular events, the differential usage of GATA motifs appears to underlie the multistep activation mechanism. Similarly, Pol II loss at the GATA switch sites might not occur concomitantly, but rather Pol II at certain sites might be preferentially sensitive to ER-GATA-1. We tested whether Pol II at the HSs, sites of ER-GATA-1 occupancy, exhibits greater sensitivity to ER-GATA-1 versus Pol II at the promoters that are not occupied by ER-GATA-1. G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were treated with 0, 8, or 200 nm β-estradiol for 16 h. The concentration-dependent reductions in Pol II occupancy at the sites were similar, indicating that Pol II occupancy at GATA switch sites and sites lacking GATA factors is equally sensitive to ER-GATA-1 under the experimental conditions (Fig. 2). ER-GATA-1 activation resulted in slightly greater Pol II retention at the 1G promoter versus other sites, consistent with the partial Pol II retention at the repressed 1G promoter following a 48-h treatment with 1 μm tamoxifen (Fig. 1D). GATA-1-mediated Repression Yields Persistent TFIIB-Chromatin Complexes—Although the basal transcription factors TFIID and TFIIB are crucial for recruiting Pol II to promoters (51Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 54Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), the role of these factors in recruiting intergenic Pol II is unknown. We tested whether intergenic Pol II colocalizes with TFIIB and the TFIID component TBP and, if so, whether Pol II and basal transcription factor occupancy are differentially regulated. Using a highly specific TFIIB antibody (Fig. 3A), quantitative ChIP analysis at the Gata2 locus in untreated G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells revealed TFIIB occupancy at extragenic sites at least as high if not higher than at the 1S and 1G promoters (Fig. 3B). TFIIB occupancy overlapped with P-Ser-5 occupancy and was not detected at numerous other Gata2 sites (Fig. 3B). The low enrichments at extragenic sites away from the promoters resembled the low enrichments at the inactive Necdin promoter (Fig. 3B, center panel), whereas the active RPII215 promoter yielded strong enrichments (Fig. 3B, right panel). Because Pol II occupancy at multiple regions of the Gata2 locus is abrogated upon repression, we asked whether ER-GATA-1 binding to the chromatin similarly affects TFIIB occupancy. By contrast with Pol II, TFIIB occupancy was largely constant throughout the locus (compare left panels in Fig. 3, B and C) with one exception, the –1.8-kb region in which TFIIB occupancy was abrogated. Following the GATA switch, only low level ER-GATA-1 (and GATA-1) occupancy is detected at the –1.8-kb region, whereas considerably higher occupancy occurs at other GATA switch sites, and the –1.8-kb HS is lost (26Martowicz M.L. Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Guend H. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1724-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TFIIB occupancy at the Necdin and RPII215 promoters was unaffected by ER-GATA-1 (Fig. 3C, center and right panels). As expected from the lack of Pol II, TFIIB was not detected at Gata2 in 3T3 cells (Fig. 3D) but was detected at the RPII215 promoter (Fig. 3D, right panel). The persistence of TFIIB occupancy at sites in which Pol II occupancy declines to an undetectable level raises the question of whether other basal transcription factors remain in the TFIIB-chromatin complex. As the interaction of TBP with TFIIB is important for Pol II recruitment (54Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), we tested whether TBP colocalized with Pol II and TFIIB. Quantitative ChIP analysis with an anti-TBP antibody validated by Western blotting (Fig. 4A) revealed TBP occupancy at the –77-kb region, the HSs, and the promoters of the active Gata2 locus in G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells (Fig. 4B, left panel). No TBP occupancy was detected at the inactive Necdin promoter (Fig. 4B, right panel). TBP occupancy persisted at the –77-kb region upon repression, remained ∼2-fold greater than the control antibody at the 1G promoter, and was abrogated at other sites (Fig. 4C, left panel). The P-Ser-5 and TBP distributions within the active and repressed locus overlapped, both before and after repression. By contrast to ER-GATA-1-mediated Gata2 repression, ER-GATA-1-mediated β-globin locus activation involved dynamic changes in TFIIB occupancy. ER-GATA-1 strongly induced TFIIB (Fig. 4D), TBP (Fig. 4E), and Pol II (Fig. 4F) occupancy at the βmajor promoter. Thus, despite persistent TFIIB occupancy upon Gata2 repression and the established TFIIB activity to interact directly with Pol II (52Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), apparently TFIIB lost the capacity to efficiently recruit Pol II following ER-GATA-1 occupancy. Although we are unaware of a scenario in which TFIIB complexes exist on chromatin in the absence of TBP, potential explanations for this result include: the failure to cross-link TBP to the repressed chromatin; direct TFIIB-DNA interactions, because TFIIB has sequence-specific DNA binding activity (55Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 56Deng W. Roberts S.G. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2418-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); or TFIIB tethering to the chromatin via protein-protein interactions. GATA-1 Antagonism of Pol II Recruitment with TFIIB Retention, a Common Repression Mechanism—We tested whether GATA-1-mediated abrogation of Pol II recruitment with TFIIB retention occurs at additional GATA-1-repressed loci. GATA-1 represses c-Myb and c-Kit genes via direct interactions with promoter and intronic regulatory elements, respectively (57Munugalavadla V. Dore L.C. Tan B.L. Hong L. Vishnu M. Weiss M.J. Kapur R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6747-6759Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 58Bartunek P. Kralova J. Blendinger G. Dvorak M. Zenke M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Quantitative ChIP analysis revealed that ER-GATA-1-mediated repression of c-Myb and c-Kit involves strongly reduced Pol II occupancy (Fig. 5A) at their promoters with little to no change in TFIIB occupancy (Fig. 5B). Thus, reduced Pol II recruitment with persistent TFIIB-chromatin interactions at extragenic sites and promoters is a hallmark of repression at three GATA-1-repressed genes. The work described herein demonstrates Pol II and basal transcription factor complexes at extragenic GATA switch sites and Gata2 promoters, which are dynamically regulated via GATA switches. Several lines of evidence suggest that these complexes are functionally important. First, Pol II, TFIIB, and TBP at the extragenic sites are at least as high as that present at the 1S and 1G promoters. Second, the complexes were only detected in erythroid cells. Third, the complexes are dynamically regulated in response to ER-GATA-1 chromatin occupancy. ER-GATA-1-mediated repression remodels the complexes such that Pol II and TBP are no longer detected, whereas TFIIB persists at most sites (Fig. 6). Complexes at certain sites are differentially regulated, e.g. TFIIB occupancy is selectively lost from the –1.8-kb region upon repression and complexes at the –77-kb region are insensitive to ER-GATA-1. Lastly, Pol II resides at the –77-kb site independent of Pol II occupancy at the 1S promoter of the repressed locus, strongly suggesting that Pol II detected at upstream sites does not reflect the artifactual cross-linking of promoter-bound Pol II to regions that reside in the vicinity of the promoters. This finding is analogous to our report that Pol II can exist at the β-globin LCR independent of Pol II occupancy at the associated promoters (32Johnson K.D. Grass J.D. Boyer M.E. Kiekhaefer C.M. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11760-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Johnson K.D. Grass J.A. Im H. Park C. Choi K. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6468-6493Google Scholar). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that Pol II has important functions at Gata2 extragenic sites. Such functions might include Pol II transfer to the promoters or the generation of functional transcripts. The results described herein, defining the structure and regulation of spatially distinct complexes at the endogenous locus, provide a strong foundation for further dissecting the underlying mechanisms. Regardless of the function of the extragenic Pol II, our mechanistic analysis revealed Pol II occupancy of the full ensemble of sites only at the active locus, whereas TFIIB-chromatin interactions persist at all but the –1.8-kb region upon repression. In this regard, basal transcription factors can occupy heterochromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (59Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and D. melanogaster (60Breiling A. Turner B.M. Bianchi M.E. Orlando V. Nature. 2001; 412: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and can occupy repressed loci in mammalian mitotic chromatin (61Christova R. Oelgeschlager T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is attractive to propose that once GATA-1 binding expels Pol II from the Gata2 locus, the persistent TFIIB complex retains an important function. It seems unlikely that TFIIB persistence reflects that of a poised transcriptionally competent promoter, as once GATA-1 represses Gata2 no evidence exists to suggest that Gata2 is subsequently reactivated. Of considerable interest is why the TFIIB complex persists at a locus that is not destined for reactivation and how the persistent complex lacks the capacity to efficiently recruit Pol II. We anticipate that the answers to these questions will have broad implications for understanding the dynamic disassembly of transcriptional complexes during development.

Mcpr1 expression could be detected extensively in adult mouse tissues and during murine embryonic development.

We demonstrate that MCPR1 protein was localized primarily in the cytoplasm and could be synthesized and secreted by transfected COS-7 cells. Both the secretory and recombinant proteins of Mcpr1 inhibited proliferation of murine embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells and impeded the progression from the G1 to S phase in the cell cycle. The cells were prone to apoptosis after exposure to glutathione S-transferase-MCPR1. Furthermore, knockdown of MCPR1 protein levels by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides promoted progression of cells from the G1 to S phase and completely abolished the RA-induced block of the cell cycle from the G1 to S phase.

Many reports have demonstrated that RA, especially all-trans-RA (atRA), plays an important role in embryogenesis, including palatogenesis, by regulating morphogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation, and extracellular matrix production (1Lai L.

The induction of cleft palate by RA varies depending on the developmental stage exposed. Studies in vivo have indicated that, after exposure of embryonic mice to RA on gestation day 10, small palatal shelves that do not contact each other are produced and that the medial epithelial cells differentiate into an oral-like epithelium; after exposure on gestation day 12, shelves of normal size form but fail to fuse as the medial cells proliferate, and the normal growth and differentiation process of palatal mesenchymal cells is inhibited (5Abbott B.D. Harris M.W. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1989; 40: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Abbott B.D. Hill L.G. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1990; 41: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The pleiotropic effects of RA are mediated through ligand-dependent transcription regulators that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily: the retinoic acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ), which bind as RXR/RAR heterodimers to response elements located in RA-responsive genes. A genetic dissection by targeted mutagenesis performed in the mouse has revealed that RXRα/RAR (α, β, and γ) heterodimers represent the main functional units of the RA signaling pathway during embryonic development (7Mark M. Chambon P. Pure Appl. Chem. 2003; 75: 1709-1732Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has long been established that retinoids exert their action by regulating the expression of specific subsets of genes within target tissues. However, it is only during the last 15 years that the understanding of retinoid action has rapidly increased, and subsequently, research began to involve the cloning of nuclear retinoid receptors and the identification of elements (within the promoters of retinoid-responsive genes) exhibiting a high affinity for these receptors. These nuclear receptors have been shown to work as ligand-activated transcription activators in a spatiotemporal-specific manner during embryonic development (8Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar, 9Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. Nuclear Receptor Factsbook. Academic Press Ltd., London2001Google Scholar, 10Bastien J.

Despite these valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of RA-induced cleft palate, the RA-responsive signaling pathway during palatogenesis remains unclear. Moreover, research on cleft palate has focused on known candidate genes, e.g. transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3, transcription factor AP-2, and DLX-2 (11Kaartinen V. Voncken J.W. Shuler C.

Ghattas I. Meneses J.J. Christensen L. Sharpe P.T. Presley R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). No novel gene has been reported to be responsible for RA-induced cleft palate. During the last decade, the cloning of multiple differentially expressed genes without knowledge of their sequences or protein characteristics has been accomplished by several techniques (16Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 17Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Agarwai N. Weissman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and an improved technique based on the PCR subtractive hybridization method has been designed (20Zhao Z.L. Huang X. Li N. Zhu X.J. Chen S.M. Cao X.T. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 73: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This study aimed to identify novel genes that may function as regulatory molecules involved in RA-induced teratogenic alteration during palatal development. In this study, a novel gene (named Mcpr1) was identified to be up-regulated by RA. We demonstrate that Mcpr1 may be involved in murine embryonic palatal mesenchymal (MEPM) cell proliferation and even contribute to apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of cell proliferation can be antagonized by interfering with the expression of the Mcpr1 gene. The novel gene is expressed not only in palatal shelves, but also extensively during murine embryonic development. We propose that Mcpr1 may play an important role in palatogenesis and cleft palate formation by regulating proliferation of MEPM cells as a component of the RA signaling pathway. Animals and Treatment—C57BL/6N mice (12 weeks old and ∼25 g) were purchased from the Central Animal Laboratory Unit of the Fourth Military Medical University. Females were crossed with fertile males overnight. The presence of vaginal plugs was designated as embryonic day (E) 0. Pregnant females at day 10 were randomly divided into two groups. atRA (Sigma) was prepared as described by Abbott et al. (6Abbott B.D. Hill L.G. Birnbaum L.S. Teratology. 1990; 41: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All mice in one group were administered atRA dissolved in corn oil by gavage at 80 mg/kg, whereas mice in the other group received only corn oil as a control. The mice were killed on E12, and palatal shelves were dissected from fetuses using microscissors (21Yano H. Yoshimoto H. Ohtsuru A. Cleft Palate Craniofacial J. 1996; 33: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and collected for further analysis. Construction of a Subtractive cDNA Library—Total RNA and poly(A)+ mRNA were isolated using total RNA isolation and Poly(A) Tract System 1000 kits (Promega Corp.), respectively, from the palatal processes of both RA-exposed E12 murine embryos and controls. mRNA extracted from the RA-exposed group was designated tester mRNA, and that from the control group was designated driver mRNA. Driver and tester mRNAs were reverse-transcribed using a SMART™ PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech). Subtraction was performed according to the improved techniques based on the PCR subtractive hybridization method (20Zhao Z.L. Huang X. Li N. Zhu X.J. Chen S.M. Cao X.T. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 73: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of tester reverse-transcribed products was added to 100 μl of driver cDNA PCR products. This mixture was then denatured at 98 °C for 5 min and hybridized at 65 °C for 12 h in 6× SSC and 0.5% SDS. After hybridization, 20 μl of the hybridization liquid was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-400 spin column (Promega Corp.), and the recovered liquid (20 μl) was added to 0.1 ml of streptavidin-coated MagnetSphere paramagnetic particles (Promega Corp.) to prepare the PCR template. The PCR product could be used to repeat subtractive hybridization. The efficiency of subtraction was estimated by electrophoresis on agarose gel, and the recovered DNA fragments were inserted into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega Corp.) to construct a subtractive cDNA library for sequencing. Dot blotting was used to exclude the false positive and negative clones according to procedures described previously (20Zhao Z.L. Huang X. Li N. Zhu X.J. Chen S.M. Cao X.T. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 73: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics Analysis—Searches for DNA and protein homology were performed using the BLASTN and BLASTX programs of the NCBI Databank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The amino acid sequences deduced from cDNA were aligned with other similar protein sequences using the open reading frame finder (NCBI). Signal peptides and transmembrane fragments were predicted using the ExPASy proteomics server. The mapping of chromosomal localization was performed using the NCBI Map Viewer (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/maps.cgi). Northern Blot Analysis—To identify the expression of the novel gene, total RNAs from the palatal processes of both RA-exposed E12 murine embryos and controls were analyzed by Northern blotting. A nonradioactive digoxigenin-labeled system (Roche Applied Science) was used to label a cDNA probe specific for the Mcpr1 gene based on a standard method (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Purified RNA (up to 25 μg) was diluted with 5× Mops, formaldehyde, and formamide; heated to 65 °C; and chilled on ice. Samples were then run on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. When a gel had run for the appropriate distance, it was washed with RNase-free water and bathed with 20× SSC for 30 min. RNA was then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in a blotting transfer chamber. The membrane was baked at 80 °C for 2 h. Blot hybridization parameters included prehybridization for 2 h at 68 °C and hybridization overnight at 68 °C. The membrane was reprobed with digoxigenin-labeled β-actin cDNA as an indicator of mRNA loading. In Situ Hybridization—Mouse palatal sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde following treatment with 1 μg/ml proteinase K in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C with digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probes specific for Mcpr1 (as mentioned above). The probes were reacted overnight at 4 °C with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:1000 dilution; Roche Applied Science) and then visualized by coloring reaction in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mm levamisole (Sigma) containing 35 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium (Roche Applied Science), 17.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Applied Science). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNAs from adult mouse brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, and muscle were isolated and reverse-transcribed using the SMART™ PCR cDNA synthesis kit. Primers specific for the Mcpr1 gene (P1 and P2) were used. Primers P1 (5′-ATG GCC AAG CAT CCG CGG CG-3′, upstream) and P2 (5′-AAG AGT TGG ATC TGA GAA AG-3′, downstream) yielded an amplicon of 396 bp. A 20-μl volume of reverse-transcribed product was amplified with Taq DNA polymerase. The reaction was performed with a 5-min denaturation at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles each with denaturation at 94 °C for 50 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and product extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The final cycle, 72 °C extension, was carried out for 6 min. In all PCRs, the amplification of β-actin cDNA was used as an internal control, and the primers used were as follows: 5′-TGG AAT CCT GTG GCA TCC ATG AAA C-3′ (upstream) and 5′-TAA AAC GCA GCT CAG TAA CAG TCC G-3′ (downstream). Expression of Prokaryotic Recombinant Protein and Preparation of Polyclonal Antibodies—The partial coding regions of the Mcpr1 gene were amplified by PCR from the cDNA library obtained as described above using primers P3 (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATG GCC AAG CAT CCG CGG CG-3′, upstream; with BamHI sites indicated in italic type) and P4 (5′-CCG CTC GAG TAA GTT GCT ACT CTG GCC TCC-3′, downstream; with XhoI sites indicated in italic type). The expression vector pGEX-4T-Mcpr1 was generated by directionally cloning the BamHI-XhoI fragment into the multiple cloning site of the pGEX-4T-1 vector (kindly donated by Prof. Ming Jin). Protein expression was performed according to Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α was used as a recombinant expression host. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein was expressed in parallel with the pGEX-4T-1 vector as a control. Expressed proteins were purified using a GST affinity column. Purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel to detect their relative molecular masses and purity. Purified GST-MCPR1 protein was used for the preparation of polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against MCPR1 protein. Briefly, purified GST-MCPR1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, and the corresponding gel loaded with the protein was cut and stored at –80 °C for the preparation of antigens. The gel (200 mg) was mechanically homogenized in Freund's incomplete adjuvant to obtain antigens, and 200 mg of antigens was injected subcutaneously into a rabbit at six sites every other week. Serum was collected 1 week after the third booster injection and weekly thereafter. pAbs were purified from the sera using protein A-agarose according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specificity and sensitivity of the purified pAbs against MCPR1 protein were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. The purified pAbs that were identified with a titer of 1:100,000 were used for Western blotting and immunochemical analysis. Western Blot Analysis—To detect the expression pattern of MCPR1 protein, Western blotting was performed to analyze many tissue extracts. The samples included normal adult mouse liver, heart, brain, spleen, kidney, lung, and muscle; palatal shelves at E12–16 and postnatal day 1; and the whole head at E9–11. The tissue extracts were prepared in 10× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein in these samples was measured by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). Briefly, a sample containing 10 μg of the appropriate extract was mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer. These samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% denaturing gels containing SDS. The proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (pAbs against MCPR1 protein, 1:1000 dilution). The membranes were washed with PBS and incubated with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200–400 dilution) using an SA2022 Western blotting kit (BOSTER). Complexes of proteins and antibodies were detected using the chromogen diaminobenzidine (Dako). The results were quantitatively analyzed using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Inc.). Immunohistochemical Staining of MCPR1 Protein—Sequential cryostat sections (5 μm) were mounted and stained using the standard immunoperoxidase method (Dako). The optimum concentration of antibodies was established. Prior to application of the primary antibodies, endogenous peroxidase was blocked by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Negative controls were obtained by omission of pAbs against MCPR1 protein. Slides were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400 dilution; Dako). A streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peroxidase activity was demonstrated using diaminobenzidine. Each step was separated by thorough washes with PBS. Finally, slides were mounted with coverslips and viewed under a conventional light microscope. MEPM Cell Culture and Treatment—Primary MEPM cell cultures were established as described previously (24Dhulipala V.C. Hanumegowda U.M. Balasubramanian G. Reddy C.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 194: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, secondary palatal shelves were collected from pups at E13. The use of E13 MEPM cells to study events occurring on E12 in vivo was justified based on published data (25Hanumegowda U.M. Judy B. Welshons W.V. Reddy C.C. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 66: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MEPM cells between the third and fifth passages were used for analysis. Once the cultures attained ∼40% confluence (∼72 h), the cells were exposed to RA (at a final concentration of 3 × 10–4 μg/ml in the medium) or purified GST-MCPR1 (at a final concentration of 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, or 40 μg/ml in the medium). Purified GST was used in parallel as a control. Following 48 h of incubation, the media were collected; the cell sheet was washed with PBS; and the cells were treated differently according to different analyses. To assay the change in Mcpr1 expression in MEPM cells exposed to RA, RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunocytochemical analysis, and in situ hybridization were performed as described above. Flow cytometric analysis and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction were performed to assay the biological effect of MCPR1 protein on MEPM cells. The detailed procedures were described previously (26Zheng Y.Q. Wei W. Dai M. Zhu L. Jia X.Y. Wang Y. Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2006; 27: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 27Fujita Y.

After exposure to GST-MCPR1 for 48 h, cells were detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) system (ApopTag Plus in situ apoptosis detection kit, Oncor). Finally, slides were mounted with coverslips and viewed under a conventional light microscope. All experiments were carried out in duplicate, and the results represent the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine significance among groups, after which a post hoc test with Bonferroni's correction were used for comparison between individual groups. A p value ≤0.05 was considered significant. Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblot Analysis—To detect subcellular localization of MCPR1 protein, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation was performed as described previously (29Dhulipala V.C. Welshons W.V. Reddy C.S. Orthod. Craniofacial Res. 2004; 7: 227-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). MEPM cells were pelleted and resuspended in 300 μl of buffer A (0.25 mol/liter sucrose, 10 mmo/liter Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/liter phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride). After 15 min on ice, the product was centrifuged, and the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected and stored. The pellet was washed with 200 μl of buffer B (Buffer A + 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) and then resuspended in 100 μl of buffer C (2.2 mol/liter sucrose, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/liter phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride). After centrifugation, the supernatant (nuclear fraction) was recovered. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were quantitated for protein content by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Eukaryotic Recombinant Expression and Biological Activity Analysis—COS-7 cells were used as the recombinant expression hosts. A eukaryotic expression vector was generated by subcloning the EcoRI-BamHI fragment into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP-N3 eukaryotic expression vector (Clontech). Subsequently, COS-7 cells were transfected with the construct pEGFP-N3-Mcpr1 using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Subcellular localization of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-MCPR1 fusion protein was detected using a fluorescence microscope. To obtain COS-7 cells steadily expressing EGFP-MCPR1 (COS-7/Mcpr1 cells), we selected transiently transfected COS-7 cells using selective medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Promega Corp.). After 4 weeks of culture in the selective medium, clonal isolates were expanded, and Mcpr1 expression at the transcriptional level was verified by RT-PCR. To investigate whether MCPR1 protein could be secreted from cells, the conditioned medium of COS-7/Mcpr1 cells was collected 3 days after the cells were passaged, and protein from the conditioned medium was concentrated with a Centricon-10 concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Western blot assays were performed to identify the occurrence of MCPR1 protein. Once MCPR1 protein was identified, the conditioned medium was used to treat MEPM cells to analyze possible biological activity of the protein. The medium of COS-7 cells transfected with pEGFP-N3 (COS-7/N3 cells) was used as a control to exclude the effect of other components in the medium. MTT reduction was performed to assay cell viability. Synthesis of Antisense Mcpr1 Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs)—Antisense ODNs for Mcpr1 were selected using the DNASIS program (Hitachi Software, San Bruno, CA). Sense ODNs were used as controls. ODNs were thio-modified for stability and fluorescently labeled so that the transfection efficiency of ODNs could be subsequently evaluated. The sequences of ODNs for Mcpr1 mRNA were as follows: 5′-CGG ATG CTT GGC CAT-3′ (antisense) and 5′-ATG GCC AAG CAT CCG-3′ (sense). The ODNs were synthesized by Sunbiotech (Peking, China). Antisense ODNs in MEPM Cells—MEPM cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 8-well chamber slides and cultured for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MEPM cells were serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and transfected with antisense Mcpr1 ODNs or sense ODNs. Cationic liposomes (Lipofectamine™ 2000) were used to facilitate transfection as recommended by Invitrogen. The ODN-liposome complexes were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. Th cells were further incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h and analyzed. The MEPM cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in methanol at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were mounted and observed under a fluorescence microscope. The effect of antisense ODNs on Mcpr1 expression in MEPM cells was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The effect of antisense ODNs on the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometric analysis as described previously (28Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Mahmud N. Lekmine F. Kalvakolanu D. Minucci S. Bokoch G. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4012-4019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether the Mcpr1 gene is required for the inhibitory effect of atRA on MEPM cell growth, we exposed the antisense ODN-transfected cells to atRA. The transfected cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. atRA (10–8 mol/liter) was added to each well, followed by incubation in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The cell cycle was then examined by flow cytometric analysis. Molecular Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the Mcpr1 cDNA—To identify genes differentially expressed during normal palatogenesis and cleft palate formation, the improved subtractive hybridization technique was applied to the mRNA extracted from palatal shelves with or without atRA treatment, and we selected several clones specifically up-regulated by atRA treatment. We determined the sequences of the isolated partial cDNA clones and carried out homology searches in the Gen-Bank™ Data Bank using BLAST. Of four clones (clones 1–4) that had no significant homology to any known genes in the nucleotide sequence data bases, clone 1 was determined to be a full-length sequence, and the complete coding regions was considered to be encompassed by analysis with the GenBank™ open reading frame data base. We therefore focused all further analysis on this clone. The clone 1 gene was revised, and suspected T-vector sequences in the 3′ terminus were deleted. The 780-bp cDNA sequence was named Mcpr1 for mouse cleft palate-related gene 1 and submitted to the GenBank™ Data Bank as a novel gene with accession number AY074887. The full length of 780 bp obtained was in good agreement with the transcript size of ∼800 bp estimated by Northern blotting. An open reading frame extends from nucleotides 200 to 598 and encodes a 132-amino acid polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 14.1 kDa and an isoelectric point of 11.06. The predicted polypeptide includes a signal peptide and a hydrophobic segment thought to be a transmembrane-spanning region (Fig. 1, A–C). According to the NCBI Map Viewer, the Mcpr1 gene is assigned to chromosome 9q54 in the mouse. Identification of the Mcpr1 Gene in the RA Signaling Pathway—Compared with Mcpr1 expression in the normal controls, Mcpr1 expression in RA-treated E12 palatal shelves showed a marked induction as determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2A), and one transcript of ∼800 bp was detecte"
